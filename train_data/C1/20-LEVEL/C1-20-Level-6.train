"Oh, yeah."
"and er  their gra , grade stipulation so  even if you got  three A's they can still refuse you."
"He said that  he said it doesn't happen in York, but it has happened in some places  you know."
"I could understand them refusing you if they'd asked for  say, a B in english and C in something else"
Yes.
"and you got D in English and D in so , although it may not be the point, or C."
Yes.
"Because  then you  you wouldn't  certainly up, be up to the standard would you?"
In that particular
No.
Mm.

"But I suppose  espec , like if you got really really good grades  you'd be  different to the group."
"You know, say if they wanted to get you three C's and you got three A's  shut up Sam!"
You could be lot  a lot different to the group.
The higher standard?

Which might make it more difficult to teach.

"When Mrs. Liddell had gone , she rose and leaned over the counter ."
Marcella opened her burning eyes and pulled herself wearily together .
`` What can I do for you ? ''
she said .
`` Nothing .
I ai n't looking for to have anything done for me .
"You need to have something done for you , I guess , by the looks of you ."
You seem dead beat out .
Are n't you awful tired ?
I 've been listening to that woman jawing you till I felt like rising up and giving her a large and wholesome piece of my mind .
"I do n't know how you kept your patience with her , but I can tell you I admired you for it , and I made up my mind I 'd tell you so . ''"
The kindness and sympathy in her tone broke Marcella down .
Tears rushed to her eyes .
"She bowed her head on her hands and said sobbingly , `` Oh , I am tired !"
But it 's not that .
I 'm -- I 'm in such trouble . ''
"`` I knew you were , '' said the other , with a nod of her head ."
`` I could tell that right off by your face .
Do you know what I said to myself ?
"I said , ` That girl has got somebody at home awful sick . '"
That 's what I said .
Was I right ? ''
"`` Yes , indeed you were , '' said Marcella ."
`` I knew it '' -- another triumphant nod .
"`` Now , you just tell me all about it ."
It 'll do you good to talk it over with somebody .
"Here , I 'll pretend I 'm looking at shirtwaists , so that floor walker wo n't be coming down on you , and I 'll be as hard to please as that other woman was , so 's you can take your time ."
Who 's sick -- and what 's the matter ? ''
"Marcella told the whole story , choking back her sobs and forcing herself to speak calmly , having the fear of the floor walker before her eyes ."
"`` And I ca n't afford to send Patty to the country -- I ca n't -- and I know she wo n't get better if she does n't go , '' she concluded ."
"`` Dear , dear , but that 's too bad !"
Something must be done .
I suppose you 'll soon be leaving Sampson 's .
He told me he did n't need you after the holiday season was over .
What are you going at next ?
Have you anything in view ? ''
Bertie shook his head sorrowfully .
"`` No , sir ; but , '' he added more cheerfully , `` I guess I 'll find something if I hunt around lively ."
I almost always do . ''
"He forgot his shyness ; his face flushed hopefully , and he looked straight at the doctor with his bright , earnest eyes ."
The doctor poked the fire energetically and looked very wise .
But just then the girls came up and carried Bertie off to display their holiday gifts .
And there was a fur cap and a pair of mittens for him !
He wondered whether he was dreaming .
"`` And here 's a picture-book for William John , '' said Amy , `` and there is a sled out in the kitchen for him ."
"Oh , there 's the dinner-bell ."
I 'm awfully hungry .
"Papa says that is my ` normal condition , ' but I do n't know what that means . ''"
"As for that dinner -- Bertie might sometimes have seen such a repast in delightful dreams , but certainly never out of them ."
It was a feast to be dated from .
"When the plum pudding came on , the doctor , who had been notably silent , leaned back in his chair , placed his finger-tips together , and looked critically at Bertie ."
`` So Mr. Sampson ca n't keep you ? ''
Bertie 's face sobered at once .
He had almost forgotten his responsibilities .
"`` No , sir ."
He says I 'm too small for the heavy work . ''
"`` Well , you are rather small -- but no doubt you will grow ."
Boys have a queer habit of doing that .
I think you know how to make yourself useful .
I need a boy here to run errands and look after my horse .
"If you like , I 'll try you ."
"You can live here , and go to school ."
"I sometimes hear of places for boys in my rounds , and the first good one that will suit you , I 'll bespeak for you ."
How will that do ? ''
"As soon as the ceremony was over , Captain Harmon had to sail in his vessel ."
He was going to China .
Father and I came back home .
Nobody knew -- not even Emily .
He said we must not tell Mother until she was better .
But she was never better .
She only lived three months more -- she lived them happily and at rest .
"When I think of that , I am not sorry for what I did ."
Captain Harmon said he would be back in the fall to claim me .
"I waited , sick at heart ."
But he did not come -- he has never come .
We have never heard a word of or about him since .
Sometimes I feel sure he can not be still living .
"But never a day dawns that I do n't say to myself , ` Perhaps he will come today ' -- and , oh -- '' She broke down again , sobbing bitterly ."
"Amid all the daze of his own pain Alan realized that , at any cost , he must not make it harder for her by showing his suffering ."
"He tried to speak calmly , wisely , as a disinterested friend ."
`` Could it not be discovered whether your -- this man -- is or is not living ?
Surely your father could find out . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` No , he says he has no way of doing so ."
"We do not know if Captain Harmon had any relatives or even where his home was , and it was his own ship in which he sailed ."
"Father would be glad to think that Frank Harmon was dead , but he does not think he is ."
"He says he was always a fickle-minded fellow , one fancy driving another out of his mind ."
"Oh , I can bear my own misery -- but to think what I have brought on you !"
I never dreamed that you could care for me .
I was so lonely and your friendship was so pleasant -- can you ever forgive me ? ''
"`` There is nothing to forgive , as far as you are concerned , Lynde , '' said Alan steadily ."
`` You have done me no wrong .
I have loved you sincerely and such love can be nothing but a blessing to me .
I only wish that I could help you .
It wrings my heart to think of your position .
But I can do nothing -- nothing .
"An I had known , I should have seen the varlet hanged ere I had told him ."
"Well , if he goes through the fen , I may come up with him and pull his ears . ''"
"Half an hour later , Sir Daniel gave Dick the letter , and bade him speed to the Moat House ."
"And , again , some half an hour after Dick 's departure , a messenger came , in hot haste , from my Lord of Risingham ."
"`` Sir Daniel , '' the messenger said , `` ye lose great honour , by my sooth !"
"The fight began again this morning ere the dawn , and we have beaten their van and scattered their right wing ."
Only the main battle standeth fast .
"An we had your fresh men , we should tilt you them all into the river ."
"What , sir knight !"
Will ye be the last ?
It stands not with your good credit . ''
"`` Nay , '' cried the knight , `` I was but now upon the march ."
"Selden , sound me the tucket ."
"Sir , I am with you on the instant ."
"It is not two hours since the more part of my command came in , sir messenger ."
What would ye have ?
"Spurring is good meat , but yet it killed the charger ."
"Bustle , boys ! ''"
"By this time the tucket was sounding cheerily in the morning , and from all sides Sir Daniel 's men poured into the main street and formed before the inn ."
"They had slept upon their arms , with chargers saddled , and in ten minutes five-score men-at-arms and archers , cleanly equipped and briskly disciplined , stood ranked and ready ."
"The chief part were in Sir Daniel 's livery , murrey and blue , which gave the greater show to their array ."
"The best armed rode first ; and away out of sight , at the tail of the column , came the sorry reinforcement of the night before ."
Sir Daniel looked with pride along the line .
"`` Here be the lads to serve you in a pinch , '' he said ."
"`` They are pretty men , indeed , '' replied the messenger ."
`` It but augments my sorrow that ye had not marched the earlier . ''
"`` Well , '' said the knight , `` what would ye ?"
"The beginning of a feast and the end of a fray , sir messenger ; '' and he mounted into his saddle ."
`` Why !
how now ! ''
he cried .
`` John !
Rich !
I says .
"And I 'll tell you what : I 'll make a man of you , Jim ."
"Ah , Jim , you 'll bless your stars , you will , you was the first that found me ! ''"
"And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face , and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes ."
"`` Now , Jim , you tell me true : that ai n't Flint 's ship ? ''"
he asked .
At this I had a happy inspiration .
"I began to believe that I had found an ally , and I answered him at once ."
"`` It 's not Flint 's ship , and Flint is dead ; but I 'll tell you true , as you ask me -- there are some of Flint 's hands aboard ; worse luck for the rest of us . ''"
`` Not a man -- with one -- leg ? ''
he gasped .
`` Silver ? ''
I asked .
"`` Ah , Silver ! ''"
says he .
`` That were his name . ''
"`` He 's the cook , and the ringleader too . ''"
"He was still holding me by the wrist , and at that he give it quite a wring ."
"`` If you was sent by Long John , '' he said , `` I 'm as good as pork , and I know it ."
"But where was you , do you suppose ? ''"
"I had made my mind up in a moment , and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves ."
"He heard me with the keenest interest , and when I had done he patted me on the head ."
"`` You 're a good lad , Jim , '' he said ; `` and you 're all in a clove hitch , ai n't you ?"
"Well , you just put your trust in Ben Gunn -- Ben Gunn 's the man to do it ."
"Would you think it likely , now , that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help -- him being in a clove hitch , as you remark ? ''"
I told him the squire was the most liberal of men .
"`` Aye , but you see , '' returned Ben Gunn , `` I did n't mean giving me a gate to keep , and a suit of livery clothes , and such ; that 's not my mark , Jim ."
"What I mean is , would he be likely to come down to the toon of , say one thousand pounds out of money that 's as good as a man 's own already ? ''"
"`` I am sure he would , '' said I. `` As it was , all hands were to share . ''"
`` AND a passage home ? ''
he added with a look of great shrewdness .
cried Dick .
`` Would ye mind a ducking ?
Blood of wound or dust of travel -- that 's a man 's adornment . ''
"`` Nay , then , I like him better plain , '' observed the lad ."
"`` But , prithee , how shall I do ?"
"Prithee , good Master Richard , help me with your good counsel ."
"If I come not safe to Holywood , I am undone . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , dismounting , `` I will give more than counsel ."
"Take my horse , and I will run awhile , and when I am weary we shall change again , that so , riding and running , both may go the speedier . ''"
"So the change was made , and they went forward as briskly as they durst on the uneven causeway , Dick with his hand upon the other 's knee ."
`` How call ye your name ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Call me John Matcham , '' replied the lad ."
`` And what make ye to Holywood ? ''
Dick continued .
"`` I seek sanctuary from a man that would oppress me , '' was the answer ."
`` The good Abbot of Holywood is a strong pillar to the weak . ''
"`` And how came ye with Sir Daniel , Master Matcham ? ''"
pursued Dick .
"`` Nay , '' cried the other , `` by the abuse of force !"
"He hath taken me by violence from my own place ; dressed me in these weeds ; ridden with me till my heart was sick ; gibed me till I could ` a ' wept ; and when certain of my friends pursued , thinking to have me back , claps me in the rear to stand their shot !"
"I was even grazed in the right foot , and walk but lamely ."
"Nay , there shall come a day between us ; he shall smart for all ! ''"
`` Would ye shoot at the moon with a hand-gun ? ''
said Dick . ''
"'T is a valiant knight , and hath a hand of iron ."
"An he guessed I had made or meddled with your flight , it would go sore with me . ''"
"`` Ay , poor boy , '' returned the other , `` y ' are his ward , I know it ."
"By the same token , so am I , or so he saith ; or else he hath bought my marriage -- I wot not rightly which ; but it is some handle to oppress me by . ''"
`` Boy again ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Nay , then , shall I call you girl , good Richard ? ''"
"Rilla made a third attempt to give the long-suffering Jims his dinner , but all she could think of was the question -- Would Ken come to see her before he went away ?"
She had not heard from him for a long while .
Had he forgotten her completely ?
If he did not come she would know that he had .
Perhaps there was even -- some other girl back there in Toronto .
Of course there was .
She was a little fool to be thinking about him at all .
She would not think about him .
"If he came , well and good ."
It would only be courteous of him to make a farewell call at Ingleside where he had often been a guest .
"If he did not come -- well and good , too ."
It did not matter very much .
Nobody was going to fret .
That was all settled comfortably -- she was quite indifferent -- but meanwhile Jims was being fed with a haste and recklessness that would have filled the soul of Morgan with horror .
"Jims himself did n't like it , being a methodical baby , accustomed to swallowing spoonfuls with a decent interval for breath between each ."
"He protested , but his protests availed him nothing ."
"Rilla , as far as the care and feeding of infants was concerned , was utterly demoralized ."
Then the telephone-bell rang .
There was nothing unusual about the telephone ringing .
It rang on an average every ten minutes at Ingleside .
But Rilla dropped Jims ' spoon again -- on the carpet this time -- and flew to the ` phone as if life depended on her getting there before anybody else .
"Jims , his patience exhausted , lifted up his voice and wept ."
"`` Hello , is this Ingleside ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` That you , Rilla ? ''"
`` Yeth -- yeth . ''
"Oh , why could n't Jims stop howling for just one little minute ?"
Why did n't somebody come in and choke him ?
`` Know who 's speaking ? ''
"Oh , did n't she know !"
Would n't she know that voice anywhere -- at any time ?
`` It 's Ken -- is n't it ? ''
I hereby punish you by prompt departure from Orchard Knob .
"Yet I do not dislike audacity , at some times , in some places , in some people ."
It is only from a sense of duty that I punish it in this case .
And it was really pleasant in Eden .
"If you do not mail that letter , and if you still persist in your very absurd interpretation of the meaning of Eve 's kiss , we may meet again in town ."
"Until then I remain , `` Very sincerely yours , `` Dora Lynne Mannering . ''"
Murray kissed the grey letter and put it tenderly away in his pocket .
Then he took his letter to his uncle and tore it into tiny fragments .
Finally he looked at his watch .
"`` If I hurry , I can catch the afternoon train to town , '' he said ."
"Aunt Susanna 's Birthday Celebration Good afternoon , Nora May ."
I 'm real glad to see you .
I 've been watching you coming down the hill and I hoping you 'd turn in at our gate .
Going to visit with me this afternoon ?
That 's good .
I 'm feeling so happy and delighted and I 've been hankering for someone to tell it all to .
Tell you about it ?
"Well , I guess I might as well ."
It ai n't any breach of confidence .
You did n't know Anne Douglas ?
"She taught school here three years ago , afore your folks moved over from Talcott ."
She belonged up Montrose way and she was only eighteen when she came here to teach .
She boarded with us and her and me were the greatest chums .
She was just a sweet girl .
"She was the prettiest teacher we ever had , and that 's saying a good deal , for Springdale has always been noted for getting good-looking schoolmarms , just as Miller 's Road is noted for its humly ones ."
"Anne had yards of brown wavy hair and big , dark blue eyes ."
"Her face was kind o ' pale , but when she smiled you would have to smile too , if you 'd been chief mourner at your own funeral ."
"She was a well-spring of joy in the house , and we all loved her ."
Gilbert Martin began to drive her the very first week she was here .
"Gilbert is my sister Julia 's son , and a fine young fellow he is ."
"It ai n't good manners to brag of your own relations , but I 'm always forgetting and doing it ."
Gil was a great pet of mine .
"When he had gone home Anne soothed and warmed the sobbing , shivering Dora , got her her supper and put her to bed ."
"Then she returned to the kitchen , just as Marilla came grimly in , leading , or rather pulling , the reluctant , cobwebby Davy , whom she had just found hidden away in the darkest corner of the stable ."
She jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and sat down by the east window .
Anne was sitting limply by the west window .
Between them stood the culprit .
"His back was toward Marilla and it was a meek , subdued , frightened back ; but his face was toward Anne and although it was a little shamefaced there was a gleam of comradeship in Davy 's eyes , as if he knew he had done wrong and was going to be punished for it , but could count on a laugh over it all with Anne later on ."
"But no half hidden smile answered him in Anne 's gray eyes , as there might have done had it been only a question of mischief ."
There was something else ... something ugly and repulsive .
"`` How could you behave so , Davy ? ''"
she asked sorrowfully .
Davy squirmed uncomfortably .
`` I just did it for fun .
Things have been so awful quiet here for so long that I thought it would be fun to give you folks a big scare .
"It was , too . ''"
In spite of fear and a little remorse Davy grinned over the recollection .
"`` But you told a falsehood about it , Davy , '' said Anne , more sorrowfully than ever ."
Davy looked puzzled .
`` What 's a falsehood ?
Do you mean a whopper ? ''
`` I mean a story that was not true . ''
"`` Course I did , '' said Davy frankly ."
`` If I had n't you would n't have been scared .
I HAD to tell it . ''
Anne was feeling the reaction from her fright and exertions .
Davy 's impenitent attitude gave the finishing touch .
Two big tears brimmed up in her eyes .
"`` Oh , Davy , how could you ? ''"
"she said , with a quiver in her voice ."
`` Do n't you know how wrong it was ? ''
Davy was aghast .
Anne crying ... he had made Anne cry !
A flood of real remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it .
So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies . '
"She gave him a look of the most intense admiration , and he thought it was because he had run away , but it was really because he knew fairies ."
Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful .
"She poured out questions about them , to his surprise , for they were rather a nuisance to him , getting in his way and so on , and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding ."
"Still , he liked them on the whole , and he told her about the beginning of fairies ."
"` You see , Wendy , when the first baby laughed for the first time , its laugh broke into a thousand pieces , and they all went skipping about , and that was the beginning of fairies . '"
"Tedious talk this , but being a stay-at-home she liked it ."
"` And so , ' he went on good-naturedly , ` there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl . '"
` Ought to be ?
Is n't there ? '
` No .
"You see children know such a lot now , they soon do n't believe in fairies , and every time a child says , ' I do n't believe in fairies , ' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead ."
"Really , he thought they had now talked enough about fairies , and it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet . '"
"I ca n't think where she has gone to , ' he said , rising , and he called Tink by name ."
Wendy 's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill .
"` Peter , ' she cried , clutching him , ` you do n't mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room ! '"
"` She was here just now , ' he said a little impatiently ."
"` You do n't hear her , do you ? '"
and they both listened .
"` The only sound I hear , ' said Wendy , ` is like a tinkle of bells . '"
"` Well , that 's Tink , that 's the fairy language ."
I think I hear her too . '
"The sound came from the chest of drawers , and Peter made a merry face ."
"No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter , and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh ."
He had his first laugh still .
"` Wendy , ' he whispered gleefully , ' I do believe I shut her up in the drawer ! '"
"He let poor Tink out of the drawer , and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury ."
"` You should n't say such things , ' Peter retorted ."
"` Of course I 'm very sorry , but how could I know you were in the drawer ? '"
Wendy was not listening to him . '
"O Peter , ' she cried , ` if she would only stand still and let me see her ! '"
"` They hardly ever stand still , ' he said , but for one moment Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock . '"
"And how long is it before Marilla expects to be stone blind , Anne ? ''"
"`` The doctor thinks her eyes will not get any worse if she is very careful , '' faltered Anne ."
Eliza shook her head .
`` Doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up .
I would n't have much hope if I was her .
It 's best to be prepared for the worst . ''
`` But ought n't we be prepared for the best too ? ''
pleaded Anne .
`` It 's just as likely to happen as the worst . ''
"`` Not in my experience , and I 've fifty-seven years to set against your sixteen , '' retorted Eliza ."
"`` Going , are you ?"
"Well , I hope this new society of yours will be able to keep Avonlea from running any further down hill but I have n't much hope of it . ''"
"Anne and Diana got themselves thankfully out , and drove away as fast as the fat pony could go ."
"As they rounded the curve below the beech wood a plump figure came speeding over Mr. Andrews ' pasture , waving to them excitedly ."
"It was Catherine Andrews and she was so out of breath that she could hardly speak , but she thrust a couple of quarters into Anne 's hand ."
"`` That 's my contribution to painting the hall , '' she gasped ."
`` I 'd like to give you a dollar but I do n't dare take more from my egg money for Eliza would find it out if I did .
I 'm real interested in your society and I believe you 're going to do a lot of good .
I 'm an optimist .
"I HAVE to be , living with Eliza ."
I must hurry back before she misses me ... she thinks I 'm feeding the hens .
"I hope you 'll have good luck canvassing , and do n't be cast down over what Eliza said ."
The world IS getting better ... it certainly is . ''
The next house was Daniel Blair 's .
"`` Now , it all depends on whether his wife is home or not , '' said Diana , as they jolted along a deep-rutted lane ."
`` If she is we wo n't get a cent .
"Everybody says Dan Blair does n't dare have his hair cut without asking her permission ; and it 's certain she 's very close , to state it moderately ."
She says she has to be just before she 's generous .
But Mrs. Lynde says she 's so much ` before ' that generosity never catches up with her at all . ''
Anne related their experience at the Blair place to Marilla that evening .
`` We tied the horse and then rapped at the kitchen door .
"Nobody came but the door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry , going on dreadfully ."
"`` Gone , '' shouted Mrs. Palmer , `` gone ."
She left on the train Mollie come on .
"Gracious me , has the man gone crazy ?"
He has n't seemed like himself at all this afternoon . ''
Murray had bolted madly out of the house and was striding down the lane .
Blind fool -- unspeakable idiot that he had been !
"To take her for Mrs. Palmer 's niece -- that peerless creature with the calm acceptance of any situation , which marked the woman of the world , with the fine appreciation and quickness of repartee that spoke of generations of culture -- to imagine that she could be Mollie Booth !"
"He had been blind , besottedly blind ."
And now he had lost her !
She would never forgive him ; she had gone without a word or sign .
"As he reached the last curve of the lane where it looped about the apple trees , a plump figure came flying down the orchard slope ."
"`` Mr. Murray , Mr. Murray , '' Mollie Booth called breathlessly ."
`` Will you please come here just a minute ? ''
Murray crossed over to the paling rather grumpily .
He did not want to talk with Mollie Booth just then .
"Confound it , what did the girl want ?"
Why was she looking so mysterious ?
Mollie produced a little square grey envelope from some feminine hiding place and handed it over the paling .
"`` She give me this at the station -- Miss Mannering did , '' she gasped , `` and asked me to give it to you without letting Aunt Emily Jane see ."
"I could n't get a chanst when you was in , but as soon as you went I slipped out by the porch door and followed you ."
You went so fast I near died trying to head you off . ''
"`` You dear little soul , '' said Murray , suddenly radiant ."
`` It is too bad you have had to put yourself so out of breath on my account .
But I am immensely obliged to you .
The next time your young man wants a trusty private messenger just refer him to me . ''
"`` Git away with you , '' giggled Mollie ."
`` I must hurry back ` fore Aunt Emily Jane gits wind I 'm gone .
I hope there 's good news in your girl 's letter .
"My , but did n't you look flat when Aunt said she 'd went ! ''"
Murray beamed at her idiotically .
When she had vanished among the trees he opened his letter .
"`` Dear Mr. Murray , '' it ran , `` your unblushing audacity of the morning deserves some punishment ."
A pretty pass the world is coming to !
I 'll never consent to it . ''
"Perhaps if you had searched Greenwood and all the adjacent districts thoroughly you might have found a man who was more astonished and taken aback than old John Ellis was at that moment , but I doubt it ."
The wind was completely taken out of his sails and every bit of the Ellis contrariness was roused .
`` What have you got to say against my son ? ''
he fairly shouted in his rage .
"`` Is n't he good enough for your girl , Susan Oliver , I 'd like to know ? ''"
"`` No , he is n't , '' retorted Miss Susan deliberately and unflinchingly ."
"`` He 's well enough in his place , but you 'll please to remember , John Ellis , that my niece is an Oliver , and the Olivers do n't marry beneath them . ''"
Old John was furious .
`` Beneath them indeed !
"Why , woman , it is condescension in my son to so much as look at your niece -- condescension , that is what it is ."
You are as poor as church mice . ''
"`` We come of good family , though , '' retorted Miss Susan ."
`` You Ellises are nobodies .
Your grandfather was a hired man !
"And yet you have the presumption to think you 're fit to marry into an old , respectable family like the Olivers ."
But talking does n't signify .
I simply wo n't allow this nonsense to go on .
I came here today to tell you so plump and plain .
"It 's your duty to stop it ; if you do n't I will , that 's all . ''"
"`` Oh , will you ? ''"
John Ellis was at a white heat of rage and stubbornness now .
"`` We 'll see , Miss Susan , we 'll see ."
"My son shall marry whatever girl he pleases , and I 'll back him up in it -- do you hear that ?"
Come here and tell me my son is n't good enough for your niece indeed !
I 'll show you he can get her anyway . ''
"`` You 've heard what I 've said , '' was the answer , `` and you 'd better go by it , that 's all ."
"I sha n't stay to bandy words with you , John Ellis ."
"I 'm going home to talk to my niece and tell her her duty plain , and what I want her to do , and she 'll do it , I have n't a fear . ''"
"Miss Susan was halfway down the steps , but John Ellis ran to the railing of the verandah to get the last word ."
"`` I 'll send Burton down this evening to talk to her and tell her what he wants her to do , and we 'll see whether she 'll sooner listen to you than to him , '' he shouted ."
"`` Stand back , by ' r Lady ! ''"
"returned Dick , raising his bow ."
"`` Ah , y ' are a brave boy ! ''"
retorted Matcham .
`` Shoot ! ''
Dick lowered his weapon in some confusion .
"`` See here , '' he said ."
`` Y ' have done me ill enough .
"Go , then ."
"Go your way in fair wise ; or , whether I will or not , I must even drive you to it . ''"
"`` Well , '' said Matcham , doggedly , `` y ' are the stronger ."
Do your worst .
"I shall not leave to follow thee , Dick , unless thou makest me , '' he added ."
Dick was almost beside himself .
"It went against his heart to beat a creature so defenceless ; and , for the life of him , he knew no other way to rid himself of this unwelcome and , as he began to think , perhaps untrue companion ."
"`` Y ' are mad , I think , '' he cried ."
"`` Fool-fellow , I am hasting to your foes ; as fast as foot can carry me , go I thither . ''"
"`` I care not , Dick , '' replied the lad ."
"`` If y ' are bound to die , Dick , I 'll die too ."
I would liever go with you to prison than to go free without you . ''
"`` Well , '' returned the other , `` I may stand no longer prating ."
"Follow me , if ye must ; but if ye play me false , it shall but little advance you , mark ye that ."
"Shalt have a quarrel in thine inwards , boy . ''"
"So saying , Dick took once more to his heels , keeping in the margin of the thicket and looking briskly about him as he went ."
"At a good pace he rattled out of the dell , and came again into the more open quarters of the wood ."
"To the left a little eminence appeared , spotted with golden gorse , and crowned with a black tuft of firs ."
"`` I shall see from there , '' he thought , and struck for it across a heathy clearing ."
"He had gone but a few yards , when Matcham touched him on the arm , and pointed ."
"To the eastward of the summit there was a dip , and , as it were , a valley passing to the other side ; the heath was not yet out ; all the ground was rusty , like an unscoured buckler , and dotted sparingly with yews ; and there , one following another , Dick saw half a score green jerkins mounting the ascent , and marching at their head , conspicuous by his boar-spear , Ellis Duckworth in person ."
"One after another gained the top , showed for a moment against the sky , and then dipped upon the further side , until the last was gone ."
Dick looked at Matcham with a kindlier eye .
"`` So y ' are to be true to me , Jack ? ''"
"He said that he must really go back or he would be late for dinner , lifted his hat politely , and departed ."
"Katherine waited until he was out of sight , then sat down on the sand and put on her shoes and stockings ."
`` Who on earth can he be ? ''
she said to herself .
`` And where have I seen him before ?
There was certainly something familiar about his appearance .
"He is very nice , but he must have thought me crazy ."
I wonder if he belongs to Harbour Hill . ''
The mystery was solved when she got home and found a letter from Edith awaiting her .
"`` I see Ned quite often , '' wrote the latter , `` and I think he is perfectly splendid ."
"You are a lucky girl , Kate ."
"But oh , do you know that Sidney is actually at Harbour Hill , too , or at least quite near it ?"
I had a letter from him yesterday .
"He has gone down there to spend his vacation , because it is so quiet , and to finish up some horrid scientific book he is working at ."
He 's boarding at some little farmhouse up the shore .
I 've written to him today to hunt you up and consider himself introduced to you .
"I think you 'll like him , for he 's just your style . ''"
Katherine smiled when Sidney Keith 's card was brought up to her that evening and went down to meet him .
Her companion of the morning rose to meet her .
`` You ! ''
he said .
"`` Yes , me , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully and ungrammatically ."
"`` You did n't expect it , did you ?"
I was sure I had seen you before -- only it was n't you but your photograph . ''
When Professor Keith went away it was with a cordial invitation to call again .
"He did not fail to avail himself of it -- in fact , he became a constant visitor at Sycamore Villa ."
Katherine wrote all about it to Edith and cultivated Professor Keith with a dear conscience .
They got on capitally together .
"They went on long expeditions up shore after seaweeds , and when seaweeds were exhausted they began to make a collection of the Harbour Hill flora ."
"This involved more long , companionable expeditions ."
"Katherine sometimes wondered when Professor Keith found time to work on his book , but as he made no reference to the subject , neither did she ."
"Once in a while , when she had time to think of them , she wondered how Ned and Edith were getting on ."
Also that there were very few birds in winter .
"` Of course they might want your clothes , ' he had to admit rather falteringly ."
She was somewhat indignant at this .
"` They are always thinking of their nests , ' he said apologetically , ` and there are some bits of you ' -- he stroked the fur on her pelisse -- ` that would excite them very much . '"
"` They sha n't have my fur , ' she said sharply ."
"` No , ' he said , still fondling it , however , ` no ."
"O Maimie , ' he said rapturously , ` do you know why I love you ?"
It is because you are like a beautiful nest . '
Somehow this made her uneasy . '
"I think you are speaking more like a bird than a boy now , ' she said , holding back , and indeed he was even looking rather like a bird ."
"` After all , ' she said , ` you are only a Betwixt-and-Between . '"
"But it hurt him so much that she immediately added , ` It must be a delicious thing to be . '"
"` Come and be one , then , dear Maimie , ' he implored her , and they set off for the boat , for it was now very near Open-Gate time ."
"` And you are not a bit like a nest , ' he whispered to please her ."
"` But I think it is rather nice to be like one , ' she said in a woman 's contradictory way ."
"` And , Peter , dear , though I ca n't give them my fur , I would n't mind their building in it ."
Fancy a nest in my neck with little spotty eggs in it !
"O Peter , how perfectly lovely ! '"
"-LSB- Illustration : Building the house for Maimie -RSB- But as they drew near the Serpentine , she shivered a little , and said , ` Of course I shall go and see mother often , quite often ."
"It is not as if I was saying good-bye for ever to mother , it is not in the least like that . '"
"` Oh no , ' answered Peter , but in his heart he knew it was very like that , and he would have told her so had he not been in a quaking fear of losing her ."
"He was so fond of her , he felt he could not live without her ."
"` She will forget her mother in time , and be happy with me , ' he kept saying to himself , and he hurried her on , giving her thimbles by the way ."
"But even when she had seen the boat and exclaimed ecstatically over its loveliness , she still talked tremblingly about her mother ."
"` You know quite well , Peter , do n't you , ' she said , ` that I would n't come unless I knew for certain I could go back to mother whenever I want to ?"
"Peter , say it . '"
"He said it , but he could no longer look her in the face ."
"` If you are sure your mother will always want you , ' he added rather sourly ."
` The idea of mother 's not always wanting me ! '
"Maimie cried , and her face glistened ."
"` If she does n't bar you out , ' said Peter huskily ."
"` The door , ' replied Maimie , ` will always , always be open , and mother will always be waiting at it for me . '"
Then they both dried their tears and went to work at the preparations for moving .
"`` Since we must go let us go as soon as we can and have it over , '' said poor Anne with bitter resignation ."
"`` You know you will like that lovely old place at the Glen after you have lived in it long enough to have dear memories woven about it , '' said Leslie ."
"`` Friends will come there , as they have come here -- happiness will glorify it for you ."
"Now , it 's just a house to you -- but the years will make it a home . ''"
Anne and Leslie had another cry the next week when they shortened Little Jem .
Anne felt the tragedy of it until evening when in his long nightie she found her own dear baby again .
"`` But it will be rompers next -- and then trousers -- and in no time he will be grown-up , '' she sighed ."
"`` Well , you would not want him to stay a baby always , Mrs. Doctor , dear , would you ? ''"
said Susan .
"`` Bless his innocent heart , he looks too sweet for anything in his little short dresses , with his dear feet sticking out ."
"And think of the save in the ironing , Mrs. Doctor , dear . ''"
"`` Anne , I have just had a letter from Owen , '' said Leslie , entering with a bright face ."
"`` And , oh !"
I have such good news .
He writes me that he is going to buy this place from the church trustees and keep it to spend our summer vacations in .
"Anne , are you not glad ? ''"
"`` Oh , Leslie , ` glad ' is n't the word for it !"
It seems almost too good to be true .
"I sha 'n' t feel half so badly now that I know this dear spot will never be desecrated by a vandal tribe , or left to tumble down in decay ."
"Why , it 's lovely !"
It 's lovely ! ''
One October morning Anne wakened to the realisation that she had slept for the last time under the roof of her little house .
The day was too busy to indulge regret and when evening came the house was stripped and bare .
Anne and Gilbert were alone in it to say farewell .
Leslie and Susan and Little Jem had gone to the Glen with the last load of furniture .
The sunset light streamed in through the curtainless windows .
"`` It has all such a heart-broken , reproachful look , has n't it ? ''"
said Anne .
"`` Oh , I shall be so homesick at the Glen tonight ! ''"
"`` We have been very happy here , have n't we , Anne-girl ? ''"
"said Gilbert , his voice full of feeling ."
"But when she came out again Susan was sitting on the veranda , loosening her bonnet strings with the air of one who meant to stay where she was for some time ."
`` Have you got your baby to sleep ? ''
she asked kindly .
Your baby !
"Really , Susan might have more tact ."
"`` Yes , '' said Rilla shortly ."
"Susan laid her parcels on the reed table , as one determined to do her duty ."
She was very tired but she must help Rilla out .
"Here was Kenneth Ford who had come to call on the family and they were all unfortunately out , and `` the poor child '' had had to entertain him alone ."
But Susan had come to her rescue -- Susan would do her part no matter how tired she was .
"`` Dear me , how you have grown up , '' she said , looking at Ken 's six feet of khaki uniform without the least awe ."
"Susan had grown used to khaki now , and at sixty-four even a lieutenant 's uniform is just clothes and nothing else ."
`` It is an amazing thing how fast children do grow up .
"Rilla here , now , is almost fifteen . ''"
"`` I 'm going on seventeen , Susan , '' cried Rilla almost passionately ."
She was a whole month past sixteen .
It was intolerable of Susan .
"`` It seems just the other day that you were all babies , '' said Susan , ignoring Rilla 's protest ."
"`` You were really the prettiest baby I ever saw , Ken , though your mother had an awful time trying to cure you of sucking your thumb ."
Do you remember the day I spanked you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Ken ."
"`` Oh well , I suppose you would be too young -- you were only about four and you were here with your mother and you insisted on teasing Nan until she cried ."
"I had tried several ways of stopping you but none availed , and I saw that a spanking was the only thing that would serve ."
So I picked you up and laid you across my knee and lambasted you well .
You howled at the top of your voice but you left Nan alone after that . ''
Rilla was writhing .
Had n't Susan any realization that she was addressing an officer of the Canadian Army ?
Apparently she had not .
"Oh , what would Ken think ?"
"`` I suppose you do not remember the time your mother spanked you either , '' continued Susan , who seemed to be bent on reviving tender reminiscences that evening ."
"`` I shall never , no never , forget it ."
"She was up here one night with you when you were about three , and you and Walter were playing out in the kitchen yard with a kitten ."
"`` Nay , it is the way of England ."
What would ye have ? ''
the earl demanded .
"`` But ye are unjust to the knight of Tunstall ; and as faith goes , in this unfaithful generation , he hath of late been honourably true to us of Lancaster ."
Even in our last reverses he stood firm . ''
"`` An it pleased you , then , '' said Dick , `` to cast your eye upon this letter , ye might somewhat change your thought of him ; '' and he handed to the earl Sir Daniel 's letter to Lord Wensleydale ."
"The effect upon the earl 's countenance was instant ; he lowered like an angry lion , and his hand , with a sudden movement , clutched at his dagger ."
`` Ye have read this also ? ''
he asked .
"`` Even so , '' said Dick ."
`` It is your lordship 's own estate he offers to Lord Wensleydale ? ''
"`` It is my own estate , even as ye say ! ''"
returned the earl .
`` I am your bedesman for this letter .
It hath shown me a fox 's hole .
"Command me , Master Shelton ; I will not be backward in gratitude , and to begin with , York or Lancaster , true man or thief , I do now set you at freedom ."
"Go , a Mary 's name !"
"But judge it right that I retain and hang your fellow , Lawless ."
"The crime hath been most open , and it were fitting that some open punishment should follow . ''"
"`` My lord , I make it my first suit to you to spare him also , '' pleaded Dick ."
"`` It is an old , condemned rogue , thief , and vagabond , Master Shelton , '' said the earl ."
`` He hath been gallows-ripe this score of years .
"And , whether for one thing or another , whether to-morrow or the day after , where is the great choice ? ''"
"`` Yet , my lord , it was through love to me that he came hither , '' answered Dick , `` and I were churlish and thankless to desert him . ''"
"`` Master Shelton , ye are troublesome , '' replied the earl , severely ."
`` It is an evil way to prosper in this world .
"Howbeit , and to be quit of your importunity , I will once more humour you ."
"Go , then , together ; but go warily , and get swiftly out of Shoreby town ."
For this Sir Daniel -LRB- whom may the saints confound ! -RRB-
thirsteth most greedily to have your blood . ''
"`` My lord , I do now offer you in words my gratitude , trusting at some brief date to pay you some of it in service , '' replied Dick , as he turned from the apartment ."
"CHAPTER VI -- ARBLASTER AGAIN When Dick and Lawless were suffered to steal , by a back way , out of the house where Lord Risingham held his garrison , the evening had already come ."
"`` Oh , if Susan and you are both banded together against me ! ''"
said Anne helplessly .
"One day the glorious news came that the Canadians had taken Courcelette and Martenpuich , with many prisoners and guns ."
Susan ran up the flag and said it was plain to be seen that Haig knew what soldiers to pick for a hard job .
The others dared not feel exultant .
Who knew what price had been paid ?
"Rilla woke that morning when the dawn was beginning to break and went to her window to look out , her thick creamy eyelids heavy with sleep ."
Just at dawn the world looks as it never looks at any other time .
The air was cold with dew and the orchard and grove and Rainbow Valley were full of mystery and wonder .
Over the eastern hill were golden deeps and silvery-pink shallows .
"There was no wind , and Rilla heard distinctly a dog howling in a melancholy way down in the direction of the station ."
Was it Dog Monday ?
"And if it were , why was he howling like that ?"
Rilla shivered ; the sound had something boding and grievous in it .
"She remembered that Miss Oliver said once , when they were coming home in the darkness and heard a dog howl , `` When a dog cries like that the Angel of Death is passing . ''"
Rilla listened with a curdling fear at her heart .
It was Dog Monday -- she felt sure of it .
Whose dirge was he howling -- to whose spirit was he sending that anguished greeting and farewell ?
Rilla went back to bed but she could not sleep .
All day she watched and waited in a dread of which she did not speak to anyone .
"She went down to see Dog Monday and the station-master said , `` That dog of yours howled from midnight to sunrise something weird ."
I dunno what got into him .
I got up once and went out and hollered at him but he paid no ` tention to me .
"He was sitting all alone in the moonlight out there at the end of the platform , and every few minutes the poor lonely little beggar 'd lift his nose and howl as if his heart was breaking ."
He never did it afore -- always slept in his kennel real quiet and canny from train to train .
But he sure had something on his mind last night . ''
Dog Monday was lying in his kennel .
He wagged his tail and licked Rilla 's hand .
But he would not touch the food she brought for him .
"`` I 'm afraid he 's sick , '' she said anxiously ."
She hated to go away and leave him .
But no bad news came that day -- nor the next -- nor the next .
"He gave his hat to Liza , who took it scornfully ; for she had no imagination , and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man ."
"Outside , the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering , and he was naturally not unmoved ."
"`` Listen to them , '' he said ; `` it is very gratifying . ''"
"`` Lots of little boys , '' sneered Liza ."
"`` There were several adults to-day , '' he assured her with a faint flush ; but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her ."
Social success had not spoilt him ; it had made him sweeter .
"For some time he sat with his head out of the kennel , talking with Mrs. Darling of this success , and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not be turned by it ."
"`` But if I had been a weak man , '' he said ."
"`` Good heavens , if I had been a weak man ! ''"
"`` And , George , '' she said timidly , `` you are as full of remorse as ever , are n't you ? ''"
"`` Full of remorse as ever , dearest !"
See my punishment : living in a kennel . ''
"`` But it is punishment , is n't it , George ?"
You are sure you are not enjoying it ? ''
`` My love ! ''
"You may be sure she begged his pardon ; and then , feeling drowsy , he curled round in the kennel ."
"`` Wo n't you play me to sleep , '' he asked , `` on the nursery piano ? ''"
"and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly , `` And shut that window ."
I feel a draught . ''
"`` O George , never ask me to do that ."
"The window must always be left open for them , always , always . ''"
"Now it was his turn to beg her pardon ; and she went into the day-nursery and played , and soon he was asleep ; and while he slept , Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room ."
Oh no .
"We have written it so , because that was the charming arrangement planned by them before we left the ship ; but something must have happened since then , for it is not they who have flown in , it is Peter and Tinker Bell ."
Peter 's first words tell all .
"`` Quick Tink , '' he whispered , `` close the window ; bar it !"
That 's right .
Now you and I must get away by the door ; and when Wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out ; and she will have to go back with me . ''
"Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me , why when Peter had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland ."
This trick had been in his head all the time .
Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee ; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing .
"He whispered to Tink , `` It 's Wendy 's mother !"
"He was a tall , broad-shouldered man of forty , and looking no younger , with dark grey eyes and a tanned , clean-cut face , clean-shaven save for a drooping moustache ."
"Jeffrey Miller was considered a handsome man , and Bayside people had periodical fits of wondering why he had never married ."
"They pitied him for the lonely life he must lead alone there at the Valley Farm , with only a deaf old housekeeper as a companion , for it did not occur to the Bayside people in general that a couple of shaggy dogs could be called companions , and they did not know that books make very excellent comrades for people who know how to treat them ."
"One of Jeffrey 's dogs was with him now -- the oldest one , with white breast and paws and a tawny coat ."
"He was so old that he was half-blind and rather deaf , but , with one exception , he was the dearest of living creatures to Jeffrey Miller , for Sara Stuart had given him the sprawly , chubby little pup years ago ."
They came down the hill together .
"A group of men were standing on the bridge in the hollow , discussing Colonel Stuart 's funeral of the day before ."
Jeffrey caught Sara 's name and paused on the outskirts of the group to listen .
"Sometimes he thought that if he were lying dead under six feet of turf and Sara Stuart 's name were pronounced above him , his heart would give a bound of life ."
"`` Yes , the old kunnel 's gone at last , '' Christopher Jackson was saying ."
"`` He took his time dyin ' , that 's sartain ."
"Must be a kind of relief for Sara -- she 's had to wait on him , hand and foot , for years ."
But no doubt she 'll feel pretty lonesome .
Wonder what she 'll do ? ''
`` Is there any particular reason for her to do anything ? ''
asked Alec Churchill .
"`` Well , she 'll have to leave Pinehurst ."
"The estate 's entailed and goes to her cousin , Charles Stuart . ''"
There were exclamations of surprise from the other men on hearing this .
"Jeffrey drew nearer , absently patting his dog 's head ."
He had not known it either .
"`` Oh , yes , '' said Christopher , enjoying all the importance of exclusive information ."
`` I thought everybody knew that .
Pinehurst goes to the oldest male heir .
The old kunnel felt it keen that he had n't a son .
"Of course , there 's plenty of money and Sara 'll get that ."
But I guess she 'll feel pretty bad at leaving her old home .
"Sara ai n't as young as she used to be , neither ."
Let me see -- she must be thirty-eight .
"Well , she 's left pretty lonesome . ''"
"`` Maybe she 'll stay on at Pinehurst , '' said Job Crowe ."
`` It 'd only be right for her cousin to give her a home there . ''
"Often crushed by so many passing feet it gave out its essence freely , and the spicy odour hung round them like a soundless , invisible benediction ."
"Ken looked up at Rilla , whose hair was shining in the moonlight and whose eyes were pools of allurement ."
All at once he felt sure there was nothing in that gossip about Fred Arnold .
"`` Rilla , '' he said in a sudden , intense whisper , `` you are the sweetest thing . ''"
Rilla flushed and looked at Susan .
"Ken looked , too , and saw that Susan 's back was turned ."
He put his arm about Rilla and kissed her .
It was the first time Rilla had ever been kissed .
She thought perhaps she ought to resent it but she did n't .
"Instead , she glanced timidly into Kenneth 's seeking eyes and her glance was a kiss ."
"`` Rilla-my-Rilla , '' said Ken , `` will you promise that you wo n't let anyone else kiss you until I come back ? ''"
"`` Yes , '' said Rilla , trembling and thrilling ."
Susan was turning round .
Ken loosened his hold and stepped to the walk .
"`` Good-bye , '' he said casually ."
Rilla heard herself saying it just as casually .
"She stood and watched him down the walk , out of the gate , and down the road ."
"When the fir wood hid him from her sight she suddenly said `` Oh , '' in a choked way and ran down to the gate , sweet blossomy things catching at her skirts as she ran ."
"Leaning over the gate she saw Kenneth walking briskly down the road , over the bars of tree shadows and moonlight , his tall , erect figure grey in the white radiance ."
As he reached the turn he stopped and looked back and saw her standing amid the tall white lilies by the gate .
He waved his hand -- she waved hers -- he was gone around the turn .
"Rilla stood there for a little while , gazing across the fields of mist and silver ."
She had heard her mother say that she loved turns in roads -- they were so provocative and alluring .
Rilla thought she hated them .
She had seen Jem and Jerry vanish from her around a bend in the road -- then Walter -- and now Ken .
"Brothers and playmate and sweetheart -- they were all gone , never , it might be , to return ."
Yet still the Piper piped and the dance of death went on .
When Rilla walked slowly back to the house Susan was still sitting by the veranda table and Susan was sniffing suspiciously .
"`` I have been thinking , Rilla dear , of the old days in the House of Dreams , when Kenneth 's mother and father were courting and Jem was a little baby and you were not born or thought of ."
It was a very romantic affair and she and your mother were such chums .
To think I should have lived to see her son going to the front .
As if she had not had enough trouble in her early life without this coming upon her !
`` He wished Miranda many happy returns of the day .
"She did not look very happy , but perhaps you could not expect that under the circumstances . ''"
"`` Anyhow , '' thought Rilla , `` I can write a perfectly killing account of it all to the boys ."
How Jem will howl over Sir Wilfrid 's part in it ! ''
But if Rilla was rather disappointed in the war wedding she found nothing lacking on Friday morning when Miranda said good-bye to her bridegroom at the Glen station .
"The dawn was white as a pearl , clear as a diamond ."
Behind the station the balsamy copse of young firs was frost-misted .
The cold moon of dawn hung over the westering snow fields but the golden fleeces of sunrise shone above the maples up at Ingleside .
Joe took his pale little bride in his arms and she lifted her face to his .
Rilla choked suddenly .
It did not matter that Miranda was insignificant and commonplace and flat-featured .
It did not matter that she was the daughter of Whiskers-on-the-moon .
"All that mattered was that rapt , sacrificial look in her eyes -- that ever-burning , sacred fire of devotion and loyalty and fine courage that she was mutely promising Joe she and thousands of other women would keep alive at home while their men held the Western front ."
"Rilla walked away , realising that she must not spy on such a moment ."
"She went down to the end of the platform where Sir Wilfrid and Dog Monday were sitting , looking at each other ."
Sir Wilfrid remarked condescendingly : `` Why do you haunt this old shed when you might lie on the hearthrug at Ingleside and live on the fat of the land ?
Is it a pose ?
Or a fixed idea ? ''
"Whereat Dog Monday , laconically : `` I have a tryst to keep . ''"
When the train had gone Rilla rejoined the little trembling Miranda .
"`` Well , he 's gone , '' said Miranda , `` and he may never come back -- but I 'm his wife , and I 'm going to be worthy of him ."
I 'm going home . ''
`` Do n't you think you had better come with me now ? ''
asked Rilla doubtfully .
Nobody knew yet how Mr. Pryor had taken the matter .
`` No .
"If Joe can face the Huns I guess I can face father , '' said Miranda daringly ."
`` A soldier 's wife ca n't be a coward .
"Come on , Wilfy ."
I 'll go straight home and meet the worst . ''
"There was nothing very dreadful to face , however ."
"Perhaps Mr. Pryor had reflected that housekeepers were hard to get and that there were many Milgrave homes open to Miranda -- also , that there was such a thing as a separation allowance ."
And then what an unthinkable predicament I should have been in !
"`` When poor Fred became convinced that I could n't promise him , he behaved beautifully -- though that rather made things worse ."
"If he had been nasty about it I would n't have felt so heartbroken and remorseful -- though why I should feel remorseful I do n't know , for I never encouraged Fred to think I cared a bit about him ."
Yet feel remorseful I did -- and do .
"If Fred Arnold never comes back from overseas , this will haunt me all my life ."
"`` Then Fred said if he could n't take my love with him to the trenches at least he wanted to feel that he had my friendship , and would I kiss him just once in good-bye before he went -- perhaps for ever ?"
"`` I do n't know how I could ever had imagined that love affairs were delightful , interesting things ."
They are horrible .
"I could n't even give poor heartbroken Fred one little kiss , because of my promise to Ken ."
It seemed so brutal .
"I had to tell Fred that of course he would have my friendship , but that I could n't kiss him because I had promised somebody else I would n't ."
"`` He said , ` It is -- is it -- Ken Ford ? '"
`` I nodded .
It seemed dreadful to have to tell it -- it was such a sacred little secret just between me and Ken .
`` When Fred went away I came up here to my room and cried so long and so bitterly that mother came up and insisted on knowing what was the matter .
I told her .
"She listened to my tale with an expression that clearly said , ` Can it be possible that anyone has been wanting to marry this baby ? '"
"But she was so nice and understanding and sympathetic , oh , just so race-of-Josephy -- that I felt indescribably comforted ."
Mothers are the dearest things . ''
"` But oh , mother , ' I sobbed , ` he wanted me to kiss him good-bye -- and I could n't -- and that hurt me worse than all the rest . ' ''"
"` Well , why did n't you kiss him ? '"
asked mother coolly .
"` Considering the circumstances , I think you might have . ' ''"
"` But I could n't , mother -- I promised Ken when he went away that I would n't kiss anybody else until he came back . '"
`` This was another high explosive for poor mother .
"She exclaimed , with the queerest little catch in her voice , ` Rilla , are you engaged to Kenneth Ford ? ' ''"
"` I -- do n't -- know , ' I sobbed . ''"
` You -- do n't -- know ? '
repeated mother .
"`` Then I had to tell her the whole story , too ; and every time I tell it it seems sillier and sillier to imagine that Ken meant anything serious ."
I felt idiotic and ashamed by the time I got through .
`` Mother sat a little while in silence .
"They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday , till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage ."
"` If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27 , ' Mrs. Darling said ."
"` If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana 's bowl , ' said Mr. Darling ."
"` If only I had pretended to like the medicine , ' was what Nana 's wet eyes said ."
"` My liking for parties , George . '"
"` My fatal gift of humour , dearest . '"
"` My touchiness about trifles , dear master and mistress . '"
"Then one or more of them would break down altogether ; Nana at the thought , ` It 's true , it 's true , they ought not to have had a dog for a nurse . '"
Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to Nana 's eyes .
` That fiend ! '
"Mr. Darling would cry , and Nana 's bark was the echo of it , but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter ; there was something in the right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names ."
"They would sit there in the empty nursery , recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening ."
"It had begun so uneventfully , so precisely like a hundred other evenings , with Nana putting on the water for Michael 's bath and carrying him to it on her back . '"
"I wo n't go to bed , ' he had shouted , like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject , ' I wo n't , I wo n't ."
"Nana , it is n't six o'clock yet ."
"Oh dear , oh dear , I sha n't love you any more , Nana ."
"I tell you I wo n't be bathed , I wo n't , I wo n't ! '"
"Then Mrs. Darling had come in , wearing her white evening-gown ."
"She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown , with the necklace George had given her ."
She was wearing Wendy 's bracelet on her arm ; she had asked for the loan of it .
Wendy so loved to lend her bracelet to her mother .
"She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of Wendy 's birth , and John was saying : ' I am happy to inform you , Mrs. Darling , that you are now a mother , ' in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real occasion ."
"Wendy had danced with joy , just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done ."
"Then John was born , with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male , and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also , but John said brutally that they did not want any more ."
Michael had nearly cried .
"` Nobody wants me , ' he said , and of course the lady in evening-dress could not stand that . '"
"I do , ' she said , ' I so want a third child . '"
` Boy or girl ? '
"asked Michael , not too hopefully ."
` Boy . '
Then he had leapt into her arms .
"Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now , but not so little if that was to be Michael 's last night in the nursery ."
Once I thought I was stuck for keeps .
Ai n't it an awful night ? '
`` I came to myself and knew I must hurry upstairs .
"I explained as quickly as I could to Mary , and left her trying to brush the snow off ."
"Upstairs I found that Jims was over that paroxysm , but almost as soon as I got back to the room he was in the grip of another ."
"I could n't do anything but moan and cry -- oh , how ashamed I am when I think of it ; and yet what could I do -- we had tried everything we knew -- and then all at once I heard Mary Vance saying loudly behind me , ` Why , that child is dying ! '"
`` I whirled around .
Did n't I know he was dying -- my little Jims !
I could have thrown Mary Vance out of the door or the window -- anywhere -- at that moment .
"There she stood , cool and composed , looking down at my baby , with those , weird white eyes of hers , as she might look at a choking kitten ."
I had always disliked Mary Vance -- and just then I hated her . ''
"` We have tried everything , ' said poor Susan dully ."
` It is not ordinary croup . ' ''
"` No , it 's the dipthery croup , ' said Mary briskly , snatching up an apron ."
` And there 's mighty little time to lose -- but I know what to do .
"When I lived over-harbour with Mrs. Wiley , years ago , Will Crawford 's kid died of dipthery croup , in spite of two doctors ."
"And when old Aunt Christina MacAllister heard of it -- she was the one brought me round when I nearly died of pneumonia you know -- she was a wonder -- no doctor was a patch on her -- they do n't hatch her breed of cats nowadays , let me tell you -- she said she could have saved him with her grandmother 's remedy if she 'd been there ."
She told Mrs. Wiley what it was and I 've never forgot it .
I 've the greatest memory ever -- a thing just lies in the back of my head till the time comes to use it .
"Got any sulphur in the house , Susan ? '"
"`` Yes , we had sulphur ."
"Susan went down with Mary to get it , and I held Jims ."
I had n't any hope -- not the least .
Mary Vance might brag as she liked -- she was always bragging -- but I did n't believe any grandmother 's remedy could save Jims now .
Presently Mary came back .
"She had tied a piece of thick flannel over her mouth and nose , and she carried Susan 's old tin chip pan , half full of burning coals . ''"
"` You watch me , ' she said boastfully ."
"` I 've never done this , but it 's kill or cure that child is dying anyway . '"
"`` She sprinkled a spoonful of sulphur over the coals ; and then she picked up Jims , turned him over , and held him face downward , right over those choking , blinding fumes ."
I do n't know why I did n't spring forward and snatch him away .
"Susan says it was because it was fore-ordained that I should n't , and I think she is right , because it did really seem that I was powerless to move ."
"Susan herself seemed transfixed , watching Mary from the doorway ."
"I just hoped he would go on forgetting about Jims , Mrs. Crawford . ''"
"`` And then your pa would have the expense of raising him , '' said Cousin Sophia reprovingly ."
`` You young creeturs are terrible thoughtless . ''
"Jims himself ran in at this juncture , so rosy and curly and kissable , that he extorted a qualified compliment even from Cousin Sophia ."
"`` He 's a reel healthy-looking child now , though mebbee his colour is a mite too high -- sorter consumptive looking , as you might say ."
I never thought you 'd raise him when I saw him the day after you brung him home .
I reely did not think it was in you and I told Albert 's wife so when I got home .
"Albert 's wife says , says she , ` There 's more in Rilla Blythe than you 'd think for , Aunt Sophia . '"
Them was her very words .
` More in Rilla Blythe than you 'd think for . '
Albert 's wife always had a good opinion of you . ''
"Cousin Sophia sighed , as if to imply that Albert 's wife stood alone in this against the world ."
But Cousin Sophia really did not mean that .
She was quite fond of Rilla in her own melancholy way ; but young creeturs had to be kept down .
If they were not kept down society would be demoralized .
`` Do you remember your walk home from the light two years ago tonight ? ''
"whispered Gertrude Oliver to Rilla , teasingly ."
"`` I should think I do , '' smiled Rilla ; and then her smile grew dreamy and absent ; she was remembering something else -- that hour with Kenneth on the sandshore ."
Where would Ken be tonight ?
And Jem and Jerry and Walter and all the other boys who had danced and moonlighted on the old Four Winds Point that evening of mirth and laughter -- their last joyous unclouded evening .
"In the filthy trenches of the Somme front , with the roar of the guns and the groans of stricken men for the music of Ned Burr 's violin , and the flash of star shells for the silver sparkles on the old blue gulf ."
"Two of them were sleeping under the Flanders poppies -- Alec Burr from the Upper Glen , and Clark Manley of Lowbridge ."
Others were wounded in the hospitals .
But so far nothing had touched the manse and the Ingleside boys .
They seemed to bear charmed lives .
Yet the suspense never grew any easier to bear as the weeks and months of war went by .
"`` It is n't as if it were some sort of fever to which you might conclude they were immune when they had n't taken it for two years , '' sighed Rilla ."
`` The danger is just as great and just as real as it was the first day they went into the trenches .
"I know this , and it tortures me every day ."
And yet I ca n't help hoping that since they 've come this far unhurt they 'll come through .
"Oh , Miss Oliver , what would it be like not to wake up in the morning feeling afraid of the news the day would bring ?"
I ca n't picture such a state of things somehow .
I asked them to tell me the things they most wanted .
"Some of the answers were commonplace enough ... dolls , ponies , and skates ."
Others were decidedly original .
Hester Boulter wanted ` to wear her Sunday dress every day and eat in the sitting room . '
Hannah Bell wanted ` to be good without having to take any trouble about it . '
"Marjory White , aged ten , wanted to be a WIDOW ."
"Questioned why , she gravely said that if you were n't married people called you an old maid , and if you were your husband bossed you ; but if you were a widow there 'd be no danger of either ."
The most remarkable wish was Sally Bell 's .
She wanted a ` honeymoon . '
I asked her if she knew what it was and she said she thought it was an extra nice kind of bicycle because her cousin in Montreal went on a honeymoon when he was married and he had always had the very latest in bicycles !
`` Another day I asked them all to tell me the naughtiest thing they had ever done .
"I could n't get the older ones to do so , but the third class answered quite freely ."
Eliza Bell had ` set fire to her aunt 's carded rolls . '
"Asked if she meant to do it she said , ` not altogether . '"
She just tried a little end to see how it would burn and the whole bundle blazed up in a jiffy .
Emerson Gillis had spent ten cents for candy when he should have put it in his missionary box .
Annetta Bell 's worst crime was ` eating some blueberries that grew in the graveyard . '
Willie White had ` slid down the sheephouse roof a lot of times with his Sunday trousers on . '
"` But I was punished for it 'cause I had to wear patched pants to Sunday School all summer , and when you 're punished for a thing you do n't have to repent of it , ' declared Willie ."
`` I wish you could see some of their compositions ... so much do I wish it that I 'll send you copies of some written recently .
"Last week I told the fourth class I wanted them to write me letters about anything they pleased , adding by way of suggestion that they might tell me of some place they had visited or some interesting thing or person they had seen ."
"They were to write the letters on real note paper , seal them in an envelope , and address them to me , all without any assistance from other people ."
Last Friday morning I found a pile of letters on my desk and that evening I realized afresh that teaching has its pleasures as well as its pains .
Those compositions would atone for much .
"Here is Ned Clay 's , address , spelling , and grammar as originally penned . ''"
` Miss teacher ShiRley Green gabels .
p.e. Island can birds '' ` Dear teacher I think I will write you a composition about birds .
birds is very useful animals .
my cat catches birds .
His name is William but pa calls him tom .
he is oll striped and he got one of his ears froz of last winter .
only for that he would be a good-looking cat .
Before Miss Marshall had finished reading that letter she had cried three times and laughed times past counting .
"More tears came at the end -- happy , tender tears such as Miss Marshall had not shed for years ."
Something warm and sweet and gentle seemed to thrill to life within her heart .
"So those girls were not such selfish , heedless young creatures as she had supposed !"
How kind it had been in Cyrilla Blair to think of her and write so to her .
She no longer felt lonely and neglected .
Her whole sombre world had been brightened to sunshine by that merry friendly letter .
Mrs. Plunkett 's table was surrounded by a ring of smiling faces that night .
Everybody seemed in good spirits in spite of the weather .
"The pale little dressmaker , who had hardly uttered a word since her arrival a week before , talked and laughed quite merrily and girlishly , thanking Cyrilla unreservedly for her `` jolly letter . ''"
"Old Mr. Grant did not grumble once about the rain or the food or his rheumatism and he told Carol that she might be a good letter writer in time if she looked after her grammar more carefully -- which , from Mr. Grant , was high praise ."
All the others declared that they were delighted with their letters -- all except Miss Marshall .
"She said nothing but later on , when Cyrilla was going upstairs , she met Miss Marshall in the shadows of the second landing ."
"`` My dear , '' said Miss Marshall gently , `` I want to thank you for your letter , I do n't think you can realize just what it has meant to me ."
I was so -- so lonely and tired and discouraged .
It heartened me right up .
I -- I know you have thought me a cross and disagreeable person .
"I 'm afraid I have been , too ."
But -- but -- I shall try to be less so in future .
"If I ca n't succeed all at once do n't mind me because , under it all , I shall always be your friend ."
And I mean to keep your letter and read it over every time I feel myself getting bitter and hard again . ''
"`` Dear Miss Marshall , I 'm so glad you liked it , '' said Cyrilla frankly ."
`` We 're all your friends and would be glad to be chummy with you .
Only we thought perhaps we bothered you with our nonsense . ''
"`` Come and see me sometimes , '' said Miss Marshall with a smile ."
`` I 'll try to be ` chummy ' -- perhaps I 'm not yet too old to learn the secret of friendliness .
Your letter has made me think that I have missed much in shutting all young life out from mine as I have done .
I want to reform in this respect if I can . ''
When Cyrilla reached the front room she found Mrs. Plunkett there .
"`` I 've just dropped in , Miss Blair , '' said that worthy woman , `` to say that I dunno as I mind your making candy once in a while if you want to ."
Only do be careful not to set the place on fire .
Please be particularly careful not to set it on fire . ''
I do n't believe in whipping children MUCH .
"I think , as you say , Anne , that there are better ways of managing as a rule , and that corporal punishment should be a last resort ."
"But on the other hand , as Jane says , I believe there is an occasional child who ca n't be influenced in any other way and who , in short , needs a whipping and would be improved by it ."
Corporal punishment as a last resort is to be my rule . ''
"Gilbert , having tried to please both sides , succeeded , as is usual and eminently right , in pleasing neither ."
Jane tossed her head .
`` I 'll whip my pupils when they 're naughty .
It 's the shortest and easiest way of convincing them . ''
Anne gave Gilbert a disappointed glance .
"`` I shall never whip a child , '' she repeated firmly ."
`` I feel sure it is n't either right or necessary . ''
`` Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something ? ''
said Jane .
"`` I 'd keep him in after school and talk kindly and firmly to him , '' said Anne ."
`` There is some good in every person if you can find it .
It is a teacher 's duty to find and develop it .
"That is what our School Management professor at Queen 's told us , you know ."
Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him ?
"It 's far more important to influence the children aright than it is even to teach them the three R 's , Professor Rennie says . ''"
"`` But the Inspector examines them in the three R 's , mind you , and he wo n't give you a good report if they do n't come up to his standard , '' protested Jane ."
"`` I 'd rather have my pupils love me and look back to me in after years as a real helper than be on the roll of honor , '' asserted Anne decidedly ."
"`` Would n't you punish children at all , when they misbehaved ? ''"
asked Gilbert .
"`` Oh , yes , I suppose I shall have to , although I know I 'll hate to do it ."
But you can keep them in at recess or stand them on the floor or give them lines to write . ''
`` I suppose you wo n't punish the girls by making them sit with the boys ? ''
said Jane slyly .
Gilbert and Anne looked at each other and smiled rather foolishly .
"Once upon a time , Anne had been made to sit with Gilbert for punishment and sad and bitter had been the consequences thereof ."
"`` Well , time will tell which is the best way , '' said Jane philosophically as they parted ."
"Anne went back to Green Gables by way of Birch Path , shadowy , rustling , fern-scented , through Violet Vale and past Willowmere , where dark and light kissed each other under the firs , and down through Lover 's Lane ... spots she and Diana had so named long ago ."
"She walked slowly , enjoying the sweetness of wood and field and the starry summer twilight , and thinking soberly about the new duties she was to take up on the morrow ."
I do n't see the good of being so awful clean .
It 's lots more comfable being dirty . ''
"`` Paul Irving washes his face every day of his own accord , '' said Anne astutely ."
"Davy had been an inmate of Green Gables for little over forty-eight hours ; but he already worshipped Anne and hated Paul Irving , whom he had heard Anne praising enthusiastically the day after his arrival ."
"If Paul Irving washed his face every day , that settled it ."
"He , Davy Keith , would do it too , if it killed him ."
"The same consideration induced him to submit meekly to the other details of his toilet , and he was really a handsome little lad when all was done ."
Anne felt an almost maternal pride in him as she led him into the old Cuthbert pew .
"Davy behaved quite well at first , being occupied in casting covert glances at all the small boys within view and wondering which was Paul Irving ."
The first two hymns and the Scripture reading passed off uneventfully .
Mr. Allan was praying when the sensation came .
"Lauretta White was sitting in front of Davy , her head slightly bent and her fair hair hanging in two long braids , between which a tempting expanse of white neck showed , encased in a loose lace frill ."
"Lauretta was a fat , placid-looking child of eight , who had conducted herself irreproachably in church from the very first day her mother carried her there , an infant of six months ."
"Davy thrust his hand into his pocket and produced ... a caterpillar , a furry , squirming caterpillar ."
Marilla saw and clutched at him but she was too late .
Davy dropped the caterpillar down Lauretta 's neck .
Right into the middle of Mr. Allan 's prayer burst a series of piercing shrieks .
The minister stopped appalled and opened his eyes .
Every head in the congregation flew up .
"Lauretta White was dancing up and down in her pew , clutching frantically at the back of her dress ."
"`` Ow ... mommer ... mommer ... ow ... take it off ... ow ... get it out ... ow ... that bad boy put it down my neck ... ow ... mommer ... it 's going further down ... ow ... ow ... ow ... '' Mrs. White rose and with a set face carried the hysterical , writhing Lauretta out of church ."
Her shrieks died away in the distance and Mr. Allan proceeded with the service .
But everybody felt that it was a failure that day .
For the first time in her life Marilla took no notice of the text and Anne sat with scarlet cheeks of mortification .
When they got home Marilla put Davy to bed and made him stay there for the rest of the day .
She would not give him any dinner but allowed him a plain tea of bread and milk .
Anne carried it to him and sat sorrowfully by him while he ate it with an unrepentant relish .
But Anne 's mournful eyes troubled him .
"`` I s ` pose , '' he said reflectively , `` that Paul Irving would n't have dropped a caterpillar down a girl 's neck in church , would he ? ''"
"`` Indeed he would n't , '' said Anne sadly ."
"`` Well , I 'm kind of sorry I did it , then , '' conceded Davy ."
`` But it was such a jolly big caterpillar ... I picked him up on the church steps just as we went in .
The next Saturday Anne and Diana started out .
"They drove to the end of the road and canvassed homeward , calling first on the `` Andrew girls . ''"
"`` If Catherine is alone we may get something , '' said Diana , `` but if Eliza is there we wo n't . ''"
Eliza was there ... very much so ... and looked even grimmer than usual .
"Miss Eliza was one of those people who give you the impression that life is indeed a vale of tears , and that a smile , never to speak of a laugh , is a waste of nervous energy truly reprehensible ."
The Andrew girls had been `` girls '' for fifty odd years and seemed likely to remain girls to the end of their earthly pilgrimage .
"Catherine , it was said , had not entirely given up hope , but Eliza , who was born a pessimist , had never had any ."
They lived in a little brown house built in a sunny corner scooped out of Mark Andrew 's beech woods .
"Eliza complained that it was terrible hot in summer , but Catherine was wont to say it was lovely and warm in winter ."
"Eliza was sewing patchwork , not because it was needed but simply as a protest against the frivolous lace Catherine was crocheting ."
"Eliza listened with a frown and Catherine with a smile , as the girls explained their errand ."
"To be sure , whenever Catherine caught Eliza 's eye she discarded the smile in guilty confusion ; but it crept back the next moment ."
"`` If I had money to waste , '' said Eliza grimly , `` I 'd burn it up and have the fun of seeing a blaze maybe ; but I would n't give it to that hall , not a cent ."
It 's no benefit to the settlement ... just a place for young folks to meet and carry on when they 's better be home in their beds . ''
"`` Oh , Eliza , young folks must have some amusement , '' protested Catherine ."
`` I do n't see the necessity .
"We did n't gad about to halls and places when we were young , Catherine Andrews ."
This world is getting worse every day . ''
"`` I think it 's getting better , '' said Catherine firmly ."
`` YOU think ! ''
Miss Eliza 's voice expressed the utmost contempt .
"`` It does n't signify what you THINK , Catherine Andrews ."
Facts is facts . ''
"`` Well , I always like to look on the bright side , Eliza . ''"
`` There is n't any bright side . ''
"`` Oh , indeed there is , '' cried Anne , who could n't endure such heresy in silence ."
"`` Why , there are ever so many bright sides , Miss Andrews ."
It 's really a beautiful world . ''
"`` You wo n't have such a high opinion of it when you 've lived as long in it as I have , '' retorted Miss Eliza sourly , `` and you wo n't be so enthusiastic about improving it either ."
"How is your mother , Diana ?"
"Dear me , but she has failed of late ."
She looks terrible run down .
By the most curious coincidence he had opened his heart to me too .
"Being a man , he was n't so discursive as Anne ; he said his say in four pages , but I could read the heartache between the lines ."
He wrote that he was going to Klondike and would start in a month 's time .
He was sick of living now that he 'd lost Anne .
"He said he loved her better than his life and always would , and could never forget her , but he knew she did n't care anything about him now after the way she 'd acted , and he wanted to get as far away from her and the torturing thought of her as he could ."
"So he was going to Klondike -- going to Klondike , Nora May , when his mother was writing to him to come home every week and Anne was breaking her heart for him at St. Mary 's ."
"Well , I folded up them letters and , says I , `` Grandpa Holland , I guess my birthday celebration is here ready to hand . ''"
I thought real hard .
I could n't write myself to explain to those two people that they each thought the world of each other still -- my hands are too stiff ; and I could n't get anyone else to write because I could n't let out what they 'd told me in confidence .
"So I did a mean , dishonourable thing , Nora May ."
I sent Anne 's letter to Gilbert and Gilbert 's to Anne .
"I asked Emma Matilda to address them , and Emma Matilda did it and asked no questions ."
I brought her up that way .
Then I settled down to wait .
In less than a month Gilbert 's mother had a letter from him saying that he was coming home to settle down and marry Anne .
He arrived home yesterday and last night Anne came to Springdale on her way home from St. Mary 's .
They came to see me this morning and said things to me I ai n't going to repeat because they would sound fearful vain .
They were so happy that they made me feel as if it was a good thing to have lived eighty years in a world where folks could be so happy .
They said their new joy was my birthday gift to them .
The wedding is to be in September and I 'm going to Montrose in August to help Anne with her quilts .
"I do n't think anything will happen to prevent this time -- no quarrelling , anyhow ."
Those two young creatures have learned their lesson .
"You 'd better take it to heart too , Nora May ."
It 's less trouble to learn it at second hand .
"Do n't you ever quarrel with your real beau -- it do n't matter about the sham ones , of course ."
"Do n't take offence at trifles or listen to what other people tell you about him -- outsiders , that is , that want to make mischief ."
What you think about him is of more importance than what they do .
"To be sure , you 're too young yet to be thinking of such things at all ."
But just mind what old Aunt Susanna told you when your time comes .
Bertie 's New Year He stood on the sagging doorstep and looked out on the snowy world .
"His hands were clasped behind him , and his thin face wore a thoughtful , puzzled look ."
"The door behind him opened jerkingly , and a scowling woman came out with a pan of dishwater in her hand ."
"Ragged , dirty , thin , and worn-out he looked ; one foot was bare , the other tied up in the old gingham jacket which he had taken from his own back to use as a clumsy bandage for some hurt ."
"He seemed to have hidden himself behind the hay-cock , but in his sleep had thrown out the arm that had betrayed him ."
"He sighed and muttered as if his dreams disturbed him , and once when he moved , he groaned as if in pain , but still slept on quite spent with weariness ."
"`` He must not lie here , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , and stooping over him she gently called his name ."
"He opened his eyes and looked at her , as if she was a part of his dream , for he smiled and said drowsily , `` Mother Bhaer , I 've come home . ''"
"The look , the words , touched her very much , and she put her hand under his head to lift him up , saying in her cordial way , `` I thought you would , and I 'm so glad to see you , Dan . ''"
"He seemed to wake thoroughly then , and started up looking about him as if he suddenly remembered where he was , and doubted even that kind welcome ."
"His face changed , and he said in his old rough way , `` I was going off in the morning ."
"I only stopped to peek in , as I went by . ''"
"`` But why not come in , Dan ?"
Did n't you hear us call you ?
"Teddy saw , and cried for you . ''"
"`` Did n't suppose you 'd let me in , '' he said , fumbling with a little bundle which he had taken up as if going immediately ."
"`` Try and see , '' was all Mrs. Bhaer answered , holding out her hand and pointing to the door , where the light shone hospitably ."
"With a long breath , as if a load was off his mind , Dan took up a stout stick , and began to limp towards the house , but stopped suddenly , to say inquiringly , `` Mr. Bhaer wo n't like it ."
I ran away from Page . ''
"`` He knows it , and was sorry , but it will make no difference ."
Are you lame ? ''
"asked Mrs. Jo , as he limped on again ."
`` Getting over a wall a stone fell on my foot and smashed it .
"I do n't mind , '' and he did his best to hide the pain each step cost him ."
"Mrs. Bhaer helped him into her own room , and , once there , he dropped into a chair , and laid his head back , white and faint with weariness and suffering ."
`` My poor Dan !
"drink this , and then eat a little ; you are at home now , and Mother Bhaer will take good care of you . ''"
"He only looked up at her with eyes full of gratitude , as he drank the wine she held to his lips , and then began slowly to eat the food she brought him ."
"Each mouthful seemed to put heart into him , and presently he began to talk as if anxious to have her know all about him ."
"`` Where have you been , Dan ? ''"
"she asked , beginning to get out some bandages ."
`` I ran off more 'n a month ago .
"Page was good enough , but too strict ."
"I did n't like it , so I cut away down the river with a man who was going in his boat ."
That 's why they could n't tell where I 'd gone .
"`` Oh , dear no !"
"I 'm the first boy Mrs. Jo ever had to take care of , and I was such a bad one that she is n't done with me yet , though she has been working at me for years and years . ''"
`` How old she must be ! ''
"said Nat , innocently ."
"`` She began early , you see ."
Poor thing !
"she was only fifteen when she took me , and I led her such a life , it 's a wonder she is n't wrinkled and gray , and quite worn out , '' and Mr. Laurie looked up at her laughing ."
"`` Do n't Teddy ; I wo n't have you abuse yourself so ; '' and Mrs. Jo stroked the curly black head at her knee as affectionately as ever , for , in spite of every thing Teddy was her boy still ."
"`` If it had n't been for you , there never would have been a Plumfield ."
"It was my success with you , sir , that gave me courage to try my pet plan ."
"So the boys may thank you for it , and name the new institution ` The Laurence Museum , ' in honor of its founder , wo n't we , boys ? ''"
"she added , looking very like the lively Jo of old times ."
`` We will !
we will ! ''
"shouted the boys , throwing up their hats , for though they had taken them off on entering the house , according to rule , they had been in too much of a hurry to hang them up ."
"`` I 'm as hungry as a bear , ca n't I have a cookie ? ''"
"asked Mr. Laurie , when the shout subsided and he had expressed his thanks by a splendid bow ."
"`` Trot out and ask Asia for the gingerbread-box , Demi ."
"It is n't in order to eat between meals , but , on this joyful occasion , we wo n't mind , and have a cookie all round , '' said Mrs. Jo ; and when the box came she dealt them out with a liberal hand , every one munching away in a social circle ."
"Suddenly , in the midst of a bite , Mr. Laurie cried out , `` Bless my heart , I forgot grandma 's bundle ! ''"
"and running out to the carriage , returned with an interesting white parcel , which , being opened , disclosed a choice collection of beasts , birds , and pretty things cut out of crisp sugary cake , and baked a lovely brown ."
"`` There 's one for each , and a letter to tell which is whose ."
"Grandma and Hannah made them , and I tremble to think what would have happened to me if I had forgotten to leave them . ''"
"Then , amid much laughing and fun , the cakes were distributed ."
"A fish for Dan , a fiddle for Nat , a book for Demi , a money for Tommy , a flower for Daisy , a hoop for Nan , who had driven twice round the triangle without stopping , a star for Emil , who put on airs because he studied astronomy , and , best of all , an omnibus for Franz , whose great delight was to drive the family bus ."
"Stuffy got a fat pig , and the little folks had birds , and cats , and rabbits , with black currant eyes ."
`` Now I must go .
Where is my Goldilocks ?
"Mamma will come flying out to get her if I 'm not back early , '' said Uncle Teddy , when the last crumb had vanished , which it speedily did , you may be sure ."
"The young ladies had gone into the garden , and while they waited till Franz looked them up , Jo and Laurie stood at the door talking together ."
`` How does little Giddy-gaddy come on ? ''
"he asked , for Nan 's pranks amused him very much , and he was never tired of teasing Jo about her ."
"Thereupon he fell in a muse , looking in the embers of the fire ; and presently , getting a piece of wood , he fashioned it in a cross , the four ends of which he blackened on the coals ."
Then he looked at me a little shyly .
`` Could ye lend me my button ? ''
says he .
"`` It seems a strange thing to ask a gift again , but I own I am laith to cut another . ''"
"I gave him the button ; whereupon he strung it on a strip of his great-coat which he had used to bind the cross ; and tying in a little sprig of birch and another of fir , he looked upon his work with satisfaction ."
"`` Now , '' said he , `` there is a little clachan '' -LRB- what is called a hamlet in the English -RRB- `` not very far from Corrynakiegh , and it has the name of Koalisnacoan ."
"There there are living many friends of mine whom I could trust with my life , and some that I am no just so sure of ."
"Ye see , David , there will be money set upon our heads ; James himsel ' is to set money on them ; and as for the Campbells , they would never spare siller where there was a Stewart to be hurt ."
"If it was otherwise , I would go down to Koalisnacoan whatever , and trust my life into these people 's hands as lightly as I would trust another with my glove . ''"
`` But being so ? ''
"said I. `` Being so , '' said he , `` I would as lief they didnae see me ."
"There 's bad folk everywhere , and what 's far worse , weak ones ."
"So when it comes dark again , I will steal down into that clachan , and set this that I have been making in the window of a good friend of mine , John Breck Maccoll , a bouman * of Appin 's . ''"
* A bouman is a tenant who takes stock from the landlord and shares with him the increase .
"`` With all my heart , '' says I ; `` and if he finds it , what is he to think ? ''"
"`` Well , '' says Alan , `` I wish he was a man of more penetration , for by my troth I am afraid he will make little enough of it !"
But this is what I have in my mind .
"This cross is something in the nature of the crosstarrie , or fiery cross , which is the signal of gathering in our clans ; yet he will know well enough the clan is not to rise , for there it is standing in his window , and no word with it ."
"So he will say to himsel ' , THE CLAN IS NOT TO RISE , BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ."
"Then he will see my button , and that was Duncan Stewart 's ."
"And then he will say to himsel ' , THE SON OF DUNCAN IS IN THE HEATHER , AND HAS NEED OF ME . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` it may be ."
"But even supposing so , there is a good deal of heather between here and the Forth . ''"
"`` And that is a very true word , '' says Alan ."
"`` But then John Breck will see the sprig of birch and the sprig of pine ; and he will say to himsel ' -LRB- if he is a man of any penetration at all , which I misdoubt -RRB- , ALAN WILL BE LYING IN A WOOD WHICH IS BOTH OF PINES AND BIRCHES ."
"Then he will think to himsel ' , THAT IS NOT SO VERY RIFE HEREABOUT ; and then he will come and give us a look up in Corrynakiegh ."
"And if he does not , David , the devil may fly away with him , for what I care ; for he will no be worth the salt to his porridge . ''"
"`` Eh , man , '' said I , drolling with him a little , `` you 're very ingenious !"
But would it not be simpler for you to write him a few words in black and white ? ''
"`` And that is an excellent observe , Mr. Balfour of Shaws , '' says Alan , drolling with me ; `` and it would certainly be much simpler for me to write to him , but it would be a sore job for John Breck to read it ."
He would have to go to the school for two-three years ; and it 's possible we might be wearied waiting on him . ''
"Do ye gang easier so , Davie ? ''"
"`` Ay , '' said I , `` I can be doing this way ; '' and I pressed his arm with my hand ."
Again he came near sobbing .
"`` Davie , '' said he , `` I 'm no a right man at all ; I have neither sense nor kindness ; I could nae remember ye were just a bairn , I couldnae see ye were dying on your feet ; Davie , ye 'll have to try and forgive me . ''"
"`` O man , let 's say no more about it ! ''"
said I. `` We 're neither one of us to mend the other -- that 's the truth !
"We must just bear and forbear , man Alan ."
"O , but my stitch is sore !"
Is there nae house ? ''
"`` I 'll find a house to ye , David , '' he said , stoutly ."
"`` We 'll follow down the burn , where there 's bound to be houses ."
"My poor man , will ye no be better on my back ? ''"
"`` O , Alan , '' says I , `` and me a good twelve inches taller ? ''"
"`` Ye 're no such a thing , '' cried Alan , with a start ."
"`` There may be a trifling matter of an inch or two ; I 'm no saying I 'm just exactly what ye would call a tall man , whatever ; and I dare say , '' he added , his voice tailing off in a laughable manner , `` now when I come to think of it , I dare say ye 'll be just about right ."
"Ay , it 'll be a foot , or near hand ; or may be even mair ! ''"
It was sweet and laughable to hear Alan eat his words up in the fear of some fresh quarrel .
"I could have laughed , had not my stitch caught me so hard ; but if I had laughed , I think I must have wept too ."
"`` Alan , '' cried I , `` what makes ye so good to me ?"
What makes ye care for such a thankless fellow ? '' ''
"` Deed , and I do n't know '' said Alan ."
"`` For just precisely what I thought I liked about ye , was that ye never quarrelled : -- and now I like ye better ! ''"
"CHAPTER XXV IN BALQUHIDDER At the door of the first house we came to , Alan knocked , which was of no very safe enterprise in such a part of the Highlands as the Braes of Balquhidder ."
"No great clan held rule there ; it was filled and disputed by small septs , and broken remnants , and what they call `` chiefless folk , '' driven into the wild country about the springs of Forth and Teith by the advance of the Campbells ."
"Here were Stewarts and Maclarens , which came to the same thing , for the Maclarens followed Alan 's chief in war , and made but one clan with Appin ."
"Here , too , were many of that old , proscribed , nameless , red-handed clan of the Macgregors ."
"They had always been ill-considered , and now worse than ever , having credit with no side or party in the whole country of Scotland ."
"Their chief , Macgregor of Macgregor , was in exile ; the more immediate leader of that part of them about Balquhidder , James More , Rob Roy 's eldest son , lay waiting his trial in Edinburgh Castle ; they were in ill-blood with Highlander and Lowlander , with the Grahames , the Maclarens , and the Stewarts ; and Alan , who took up the quarrel of any friend , however distant , was extremely wishful to avoid them ."
"Chance served us very well ; for it was a household of Maclarens that we found , where Alan was not only welcome for his name 's sake but known by reputation ."
"Here then I was got to bed without delay , and a doctor fetched , who found me in a sorry plight ."
"But whether because he was a very good doctor , or I a very young , strong man , I lay bedridden for no more than a week , and before a month I was able to take the road again with a good heart ."
"All this time Alan would not leave me though I often pressed him , and indeed his foolhardiness in staying was a common subject of outcry with the two or three friends that were let into the secret ."
"`` It is ten o'clock ; into bed , every man of you , '' said Mr. Bhaer , looking at his watch ."
"`` And , thank Heaven !"
"there will be no empty ones to-night , '' added Mrs. Bhaer , watching , with full eyes , Robby going up in his father 's arms , and Nan escorted by Daisy and Demi , who considered her the most interesting heroine of their collection ."
"`` Poor Aunt Jo is so tired she ought to be carried up herself , '' said gentle Franz , putting his arm round her as she paused at the stair-foot , looking quite exhausted by her fright and long walk ."
"`` Let 's make an arm-chair , '' proposed Tommy ."
"`` No , thank you , my lads ; but somebody may lend me a shoulder to lean on , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
`` Me !
me ! ''
"and half-a-dozen jostled one another , all eager to be chosen , for there was something in the pale motherly face that touched the warm hearts under the round jackets ."
"Seeing that they considered it an honor , Mrs. Jo gave it to the one who had earned it , and nobody grumbled when she put her arm on Dan 's broad shoulder , saying , with a look that made him color up with pride and pleasure , `` He found the children ; so I think he must help me up . ''"
"Dan felt richly rewarded for his evening 's work , not only that he was chosen from all the rest to go proudly up bearing the lamp , but because Mrs. Jo said heartily , `` Good-night , my boy !"
God bless you ! ''
as he left her at her door .
"`` I wish I was your boy , '' said Dan , who felt as if danger and trouble had somehow brought him nearer than ever to her ."
"`` You shall be my oldest son , '' and she sealed her promise with a kiss that made Dan hers entirely ."
"Little Rob was all right next day , but Nan had a headache , and lay on Mother Bhaer 's sofa with cold-cream upon her scratched face ."
"Her remorse was quite gone , and she evidently thought being lost rather a fine amusement ."
"Mrs. Jo was not pleased with this state of things , and had no desire to have her children led from the paths of virtue , or her pupils lying round loose in huckleberry fields ."
"So she talked soberly to Nan , and tried to impress upon her mind the difference between liberty and license , telling several tales to enforce her lecture ."
"She had not decided how to punish Nan , but one of these stories suggested a way , and as Mrs. Jo liked odd penalties , she tried it ."
"`` All children run away , '' pleaded Nan , as if it was as natural and necessary a thing as measles or hooping cough ."
"`` Not all , and some who do run away do n't get found again , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
`` Did n't you do it yourself ? ''
"asked Nan , whose keen little eyes saw some traces of a kindred spirit in the serious lady who was sewing so morally before her ."
"Mrs. Jo laughed , and owned that she did ."
"`` Tell about it , '' demanded Nan , feeling that she was getting the upper hand in the discussion ."
"Mrs. Jo saw that , and sobered down at once , saying , with a remorseful shake of the head , `` I did it a good many times , and led my poor mother rather a hard life with my pranks , till she cured me . ''"
`` How ? ''
and Nan sat up with a face full of interest .
"`` I had a new pair of shoes once , and wanted to show them ; so , though I was told not to leave the garden , I ran away and was wandering about all day ."
"It was in the city , and why I was n't killed I do n't know ."
Such a time as I had .
`` I suppose that 's it .
"Well , I like it , and I shall keep on trying , for being loved by every one is about the nicest thing in the world ."
"Is n't it , Ed ? ''"
"asked Jack , with a gentle tweak of the ear as he put a question which he knew would get no answer , for Ed was so modest he could not see wherein he differed from other boys , nor believe that the sunshine he saw in other faces was only the reflection from his own ."
"Sunday evening Mrs. Minot sat by the fire , planning how she should tell some good news she had been saving up all day ."
"Mrs. Pecq knew it , and seemed so delighted that she went about smiling as if she did not know what trouble meant , and could not do enough for the family ."
"She was downstairs now , seeing that the clothes were properly prepared for the wash , so there was no one in the Bird Room but Mamma and the children ."
"Frank was reading up all he could find about some Biblical hero mentioned in the day 's sermon ; Jill lay where she had lain for nearly four long months , and though her face was pale and thin with the confinement , there was an expression on it now sweeter even than health ."
"Jack sat on the rug beside her , looking at a white carnation through the magnifying glass , while she was enjoying the perfume of a red one as she talked to him ."
"`` If you look at the white petals you 'll see that they sparkle like marble , and go winding a long way down to the middle of the flower where it grows sort of rosy ; and in among the small , curly leaves , like fringed curtains , you can see the little green fairy sitting all alone ."
"Your mother showed me that , and I think it is very pretty ."
"I call it a ` fairy , ' but it is really where the seeds are hidden and the sweet smell comes from . ''"
"Jill spoke softly lest she should disturb the others , and , as she turned to push up her pillow , she saw Mrs. Minot looking at her with a smile she did not understand ."
"`` Did you speak , 'm ? ''"
"she asked , smiling back again , without in the least knowing why ."
"`` No , dear ."
"I was listening and thinking what a pretty little story one could make out of your fairy living alone down there , and only known by her perfume . ''"
"`` Tell it , Mamma ."
"It is time for our story , and that would be a nice one , I guess , '' said Jack , who was as fond of stories as when he sat in his mother 's lap and chuckled over the hero of the beanstalk ."
"`` We do n't have fairy tales on Sunday , you know , '' began Jill regretfully ."
"`` Call it a parable , and have a moral to it , then it will be all right , '' put in Frank , as he shut his big book , having found what he wanted ."
"`` I like stories about saints , and the good and wonderful things they did , '' said Jill , who enjoyed the wise and interesting bits Mrs. Minot often found for her in grown-up books , for Jill had thoughtful times , and asked questions which showed that she was growing fast in mind if not in body ."
"`` This is a true story ; but I will disguise it a little , and call it ` The Miracle of Saint Lucy , ' '' began Mrs. Minot , seeing a way to tell her good news and amuse the children likewise ."
"Frank retired to the easy-chair , that he might sleep if the tale should prove too childish for him ."
"Jill settled herself among her cushions , and Jack lay flat upon the rug , with his feet up , so that he could admire his red slippers and rest his knee , which ached ."
`` Once upon a time there was a queen who had two princes . ''
`` Was n't there a princess ? ''
"asked Jack , interested at once ."
"`` No ; and it was a great sorrow to the queen that she had no little daughter , for the sons were growing up , and she was often very lonely ."
"`` Like Snowdrop 's mother , '' whispered Jill ."
"`` Now , do n't keep interrupting , children , or we never shall get on , '' said Frank , more anxious to hear about the boys that were than the girl that was not ."
"`` One day , when the princes were out -- ahem !"
"""And your ruby clasps."""
And the Queen undid the clasps.
"""Now the lilies from your breast."""
The Queen gathered together the lilies.
"""And the diamonds of your little bright shoe buckles."""
The Queen pulled off her shoes.
"Then the witch stirred the stuff that was in the cauldron, and, one by one, she threw in the gold crown and the sapphire necklace and the pearl bracelets and the ruby clasps and the diamonds of the little bright shoe buckles, and last of all she threw in the lilies."
"The stuff in the cauldron boiled up in foaming flashes of yellow and blue and red and white and silver, and sent out a sweet scent, and presently the witch poured it out into a pot and set it to cool in the doorway among the snakes."
"Then she said to the Queen: ""Your child will have hair as golden as your crown, eyes as blue as your sapphires. The red of your rubies will lie on its lips, and its skin will be clear and pale as your pearls. Its soul will be white and sweet as your lilies, and your diamonds will be no clearer than its wits."""
"""Oh, thank you, thank you,"" said the Queen, ""and when will it come?"""
"""You will find it when you get home."""
"""And won't you have something for yourself?"" asked the Queen. ""Any little thing you fancy would you like a country, or a sack of jewels?"""
"""Nothing, thank you,"" said the witch. ""I could make more diamonds in a day than I should wear in a year."""
"""Well, but do let me do some little thing for you,"" the Queen went on."
"""Aren't you tired of being a witch? Wouldn't you like to be a Duchess or a Princess, or something like that?"""
"""There is one thing I should rather like,"" said the witch, ""but it's hard to get in my trade."""
"""Oh, tell me what,"" said the Queen."
"""I should like some one to love me,"" said the witch."
"Then the Queen threw her arms around the witch's neck and kissed her half a hundred times. ""Why,"" she said, ""I love you better than my life!"
"You've given me the baby and the baby shall love you too."""
"""Perhaps it will,"" said the witch, ""and when the sorrow comes, send for me. Each of your fifty kisses will be a spell to bring me to you. Now, drink up your medicine, there's a dear, and run along home."""
"So the Queen drank the stuff in the pot, which was quite cool by this time, and she went out under the fringe of snakes, and they all behaved like good Sunday-school children. Some of them even tried to drop a curtsy to her as she went by, though that is not easy when you are hanging wrong way up by your tail. But the snakes knew the Queen was friends with their mistress; so, of course, they had to do their best to be civil."
"When the Queen got home, sure enough there was the baby lying in the cradle with the Royal arms blazoned on it, crying as naturally as possible. It had pink ribbons to tie up its sleeves, so the Queen saw at once it was a girl. When the King knew this he tore his black hair with fury."
"""Oh, you silly, silly Queen!"" he said. ""Why didn't I marry a clever lady? Did you think I went to all the trouble and expense of sending you to a witch to get a girl? You knew well enough it was a boy I wanted a boy, an heir, a Prince to learn all my magic and my enchantments, and to rule the kingdom after me. I'll bet a crown my crown,"" he said, ""you never even thought to tell the witch what kind you wanted! Did you now?"""
And the Queen hung her head and had to confess that she had only asked for a child.
"""Very well, madam,"" said the King, ""very well have your own way. And make the most of your daughter, while she is a child."""
"The Queen did. All the years of her life had never held half so much happiness as now lived in each of the moments when she held her little baby in her arms. And the years went on, and the King grew more and more clever at magic, and more and more disagreeable at home, and the Princess grew more beautiful and more dear every day she lived."
"The Queen and the Princess were feeding the goldfish in the courtyard fountains with crumbs of the Princess's eighteenth birthday cake, when the King came into the courtyard, looking as black as thunder, with his black raven hopping after him. He shook his fist at his family, as indeed he generally did whenever he met them, for he was not a King with pretty home manners. The raven sat down on the edge of the marble basin and tried to peck the goldfish. It was all he could do to show that he was in the same temper as his master."
"""A girl indeed!"" said the King angrily. ""I wonder you can dare to look me in the face, when you remember how your silliness has spoiled everything."""
"""You oughtn't to speak to my mother like that,"" said the Princess. She was eighteen, and it came to her suddenly and all in a moment that she was a grown-up, so she spoke out."
The King could not utter a word for several minutes. He was too angry.
"But the Queen said, ""My dear child, don't interfere,"" quite crossly, for she was frightened."
"“I must go out unto my maid, Who keeps my thoughts for me,”"
"And ran out and found Maid Maleen, “Girl, what didst thou say to the foot-bridge?”"
"“I said nothing but,"
"“Foot-bridge, do not break, I am not the true bride.”"
"“That costs thee thy life!” cried the bride, but she hurried into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,” and she repeated the words. “But what didst thou say to the church-door?” “To the church-door?” she replied; “I don’t talk to church-doors.” “Then thou art not the true bride.”"
"She went out and found Maid Maleen, and said, “Girl, what didst thou say to the church-door?”"
"“I said nothing but,"
"“Church-door, break not, I am not the true bride.”"
"“That will break thy neck for thee!” cried the bride, and flew into a terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the church-door,” and she repeated the words."
“But where hast thou the jewel which I gave thee at the church-door?”
"“What jewel?” she answered; “thou didst not give me any jewel.” “I myself put it round thy neck, and I myself fastened it; if thou dost not know that, thou art not the true bride.” He drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her immeasurable ugliness, he sprang back terrified, and said, “How comest thou here? Who art thou?” “I am thy betrothed bride, but because I feared lest the people should mock me when they saw me out of doors, I commanded the scullery-maid to dress herself in my clothes, and to go to church instead of me.” “Where is the girl?” said he; “I want to see her, go and bring her here.” She went out and told the servants that the scullery-maid was an impostor, and that they must take her out into the court-yard and strike off her head. The servants laid hold of Maid Maleen and wanted to drag her out, but she screamed so loudly for help, that the King’s son heard her voice, hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to set the maiden free instantly. Lights were brought, and then he saw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the church-door. “Thou art the true bride,” said he, “who went with me to the church; come with me now to my room.” When they were both alone, he said, “On the way to church thou didst name Maid Maleen, who was my betrothed bride; if I could believe it possible, I should think she was standing before me thou art like her in every respect.” She answered, “I am Maid Maleen, who for thy sake was imprisoned seven years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and thirst, and has lived so long in want and poverty. To-day, however, the sun is shining on me once more. I was married to thee in the church, and I am thy lawful wife.” Then they kissed each other, and were happy all the days of their lives. The false bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off."
"The tower in which Maid Maleen had been imprisoned remained standing for a long time, and when the children passed by it they sang,"
"“Kling, klang, gloria."
Who sits within this tower?
"A King’s daughter, she sits within, A sight of her I cannot win, The wall it will not break, The stone cannot be pierced."
"Little Hans, with your coat so gay, Follow me, follow me, fast as you may.”"
The Lion and the Crane
The Bodhisatta was at one time born in the region of Himavanta as a white crane; now Brahmadatta was at that time reigning in Benares. Now it chanced that as a lion was eating meat a bone stuck in his throat.
"The throat became swollen, he could not take food, his suffering was terrible. The crane seeing him, as he was perched on a tree looking for food, asked, ""What ails thee, friend?"" He told him why. ""I could free thee from that bone, friend, but dare not enter thy mouth for fear thou mightest eat me."" ""Don't be afraid, friend, I'll not eat thee; only save my life."" ""Very well,"" says he, and caused him to lie down on his left side. But thinking to himself, ""Who knows what this fellow will do,"" he placed a small stick upright between his two jaws that he could not close his mouth, and inserting his head inside his mouth struck one end of the bone with his beak. Whereupon the bone dropped and fell out. As soon as he had caused the bone to fall, he got out of the lion's mouth, striking the stick with his beak so that it fell out, and then settled on a branch. The lion gets well, and one day was eating a buffalo he had killed. The crane thinking ""I will sound him,"" settled on a branch just over him, and in conversation spoke this first verse:"
"""A service have we done thee       To the best of our ability,     King of the Beasts! Your Majesty!"
"What return shall we get from thee?"""
In reply the Lion spoke the second verse:
"""As I feed on blood,       And always hunt for prey,     'Tis much that thou art still alive       Having once been between my teeth."""
Then in reply the crane said the two other verses:
"""Ungrateful, doing no good,       Not doing as he would be done by,     In him there is no gratitude,       To serve him is useless."
"""His friendship is not won       By the clearest good deed."
"Better softly withdraw from him,       Neither envying nor abusing."""
And having thus spoken the crane flew away.
"And when the great Teacher, Gautama the Buddha, told this tale, he used to add: ""Now at that time the lion was Devadatta the Traitor, but the white crane was I myself."""
"The strange rabbit stopped dancing, and came quite close. He came so close this time that his long whiskers brushed the Velveteen Rabbit's ear, and then he wrinkled his nose suddenly and flattened his ears and jumped backwards."
"""He doesn't smell right!"" he exclaimed. ""He isn't a rabbit at all! He isn't real!"""
"""I am Real!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I am Real! The Boy said so!"" And he nearly began to cry."
"Just then there was a sound of footsteps, and the Boy ran past near them, and with a stamp of feet and a flash of white tails the two strange rabbits disappeared."
"""Come back and play with me!"" called the little Rabbit. ""Oh, do come back! I know I am Real!"""
"But there was no answer, only the little ants ran to and fro, and the bracken swayed gently where the two strangers had passed. The Velveteen Rabbit was all alone."
"""Oh, dear!"" he thought. ""Why did they run away like that? Why couldn't they stop and talk to me?"""
"For a long time he lay very still, watching the bracken, and hoping that they would come back. But they never returned, and presently the sun sank lower and the little white moths fluttered out, and the Boy came and carried him home."
"Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the Boy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy. To him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about. He didn't mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic had made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn't matter."
"And then, one day, the Boy was ill."
"His face grew very flushed, and he talked in his sleep, and his little body was so hot that it burned the Rabbit when he held him close."
"Strange people came and went in the nursery, and a light burned all night and through it all the little Velveteen Rabbit lay there, hidden from sight under the bedclothes, and he never stirred, for he was afraid that if they found him some one might take him away, and he knew that the Boy needed him."
"It was a long weary time, for the Boy was too ill to play, and the little Rabbit found it rather dull with nothing to do all day long."
"But he snuggled down patiently, and looked forward to the time when the Boy should be well again, and they would go out in the garden amongst the flowers and the butterflies and play splendid games in the raspberry thicket like they used to. All sorts of delightful things he planned, and while the Boy lay half asleep he crept up close to the pillow and whispered them in his ear. And presently the fever turned, and the Boy got better. He was able to sit up in bed and look at picture-books, while the little Rabbit cuddled close at his side. And one day, they let him get up and dress."
"It was a bright, sunny morning, and the windows stood wide open. They had carried the Boy out on to the balcony, wrapped in a shawl, and the little Rabbit lay tangled up among the bedclothes, thinking."
"The Boy was going to the seaside to-morrow. Everything was arranged, and now it only remained to carry out the doctor's orders. They talked about it all, while the little Rabbit lay under the bedclothes, with just his head peeping out, and listened. The room was to be disinfected, and all the books and toys that the Boy had played with in bed must be burnt."
"""Hurrah!"" thought the little Rabbit. ""To-morrow we shall go to the seaside!"" For the boy had often talked of the seaside, and he wanted very much to see the big waves coming in, and the tiny crabs, and the sand castles."
Just then Nana caught sight of him.
"""How about his old Bunny?"" she asked."
"""That?"" said the doctor. ""Why, it's a mass of scarlet fever germs!-Burn it at once. What? Nonsense! Get him a new one. He mustn't have that any more!"""
Anxious Times
"And so the little Rabbit was put into a sack with the old picture-books and a lot of rubbish, and carried out to the end of the garden behind the fowl-house. That was a fine place to make a bonfire, only the gardener was too busy just then to attend to it. He had the potatoes to dig and the green peas to gather, but next morning he promised to come quite early and burn the whole lot."
"That night the Boy slept in a different bedroom, and he had a new bunny to sleep with him. It was a splendid bunny, all white plush with real glass eyes, but the Boy was too excited to care very much about it. For to-morrow he was going to the seaside, and that in itself was such a wonderful thing that he could think of nothing else."
"And while the Boy was asleep, dreaming of the seaside, the little Rabbit lay among the old picture-books in the corner behind the fowl-house, and he felt very lonely. The sack had been left untied, and so by wriggling a bit he was able to get his head through the opening and look out. He was shivering a little, for he had always been used to sleeping in a proper bed, and by this time his coat had worn so thin and threadbare from hugging that it was no longer any protection to him. Near by he could see the thicket of raspberry canes, growing tall and close like a tropical jungle, in whose shadow he had played with the Boy on bygone mornings. He thought of those long sunlit hours in the garden-how happy they were-and a great sadness came over him. He seemed to see them all pass before him, each more beautiful than the other, the fairy huts in the flower-bed, the quiet evenings in the wood when he lay in the bracken and the little ants ran over his paws; the wonderful day when he first knew that he was Real. He thought of the Skin Horse, so wise and gentle, and all that he had told him. Of what use was it to be loved and lose one's beauty and become Real if it all ended like this? And a tear, a real tear, trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the ground."
"And then a strange thing happened. For where the tear had fallen a flower grew out of the ground, a mysterious flower, not at all like any that grew in the garden. It had slender green leaves the colour of emeralds, and in the centre of the leaves a blossom like a golden cup."
"It was so beautiful that the little Rabbit forgot to cry, and just lay there watching it. And presently the blossom opened, and out of it there stepped a fairy."
"She was quite the loveliest fairy in the whole world. Her dress was of pearl and dew-drops, and there were flowers round her neck and in her hair, and her face was like the most perfect flower of all. And she came close to the little Rabbit and gathered him up in her arms and kissed him on his velveteen nose that was all damp from crying."
"""Little Rabbit,"" she said, ""don't you know who I am?"""
"The Rabbit looked up at her, and it seemed to him that he had seen her face before, but he couldn't think where."
"""I am the nursery magic Fairy,"" she said. ""I take care of all the playthings that the children have loved. When they are old and worn out and the children don't need them any more, then I come and take them away with me and turn them into Real."""
"""Wasn't I Real before?"" asked the little Rabbit."
"""You were Real to the Boy,"" the Fairy said, ""because he loved you. Now you shall be Real to every one."""
"""No,"" answered the Queen-Mother, ""I don't. You see, I have so much to think about, and happy thoughts make tasks light. And then, you know, it is not always the same kind of egg, and that makes a pleasant change for me. I will give you a motto to remember: 'As long as a Bee is well, work is pleasant when done faithfully.'"""
"""Perhaps that is the matter with me,"" said the Worker, raising her drooping head. ""I have been careless lately when I thought nobody was looking. I will try your way."""
"When she had gone, the Queen-Mother smiled to herself and said: ""Poor child! When work is no longer a pleasure, life is indeed sad. But any Larva should know better than to work carelessly when she is not watched."""
THE HAUGHTY GROUND HOG
"Not far from the home of the Rabbits was another burrow where the Ground Hog lived, and there was a very kindly feeling between the neighbors."
"They liked the same food, and as there was plenty for all, they often nibbled together near the edge of the forest. The little Rabbits were fond of him and liked to listen to his stories. Once the biggest little Rabbit had run into the Ground Hog's burrow by mistake when he was frightened, and that was the beginning of a great friendship between them."
"They were a queer-looking couple, for the Rabbit was small and quick and dainty, while the Ground Hog, with his stout body covered with thick, reddish fur, his broad, flat head, and his short legs, was a clumsy fellow. To be sure, he could get out of sight quickly if he had to, but he never scampered around and kicked up his heels for the fun of it, as the Rabbits did. He was too dignified to do that. He came of an old family and he could remember who his grandfather was. There were but few people in the forest who could do that; so, of course, he could not frisk like his neighbors."
"Perhaps if the Ground Hog had not belonged to so old a family, he might have had a better time. Yet the thought that he could remember his grandfather was a great pleasure to him, and when he was talking he would often remark in the most careless way, ""as my grandfather used to say""; or, ""That reminds me of something my grandfather once did."" Some people said that he did this to show off; but it may be that they were envious."
"However that may have been, the Ground Hog was certainly a haughty fellow, and if he had not been so gentle and kind a neighbor people would not have liked him. Only once had he been known to get angry, and that was when a saucy young Chipmunk had spoken of him as a Woodchuck."
"""Woodchuck! Woodchuck!"" he had grunted. ""You young Bushy-tail, I am a Ground Hog, and the Ground Hog family lived in this forest long before you ever opened your eyes. People with good manners do not call us 'Woodchucks.' We do not like the name. My grandfather could not endure it."""
"It was not very long after this that he told the wondering young Rabbits about his grandfather. When talking, the Ground Hog rested by the edge of his burrow, sitting on his haunches, and waving his queer little forepaws whenever he told anything especially important. And this was the story:"
"""Perhaps you may have heard me speak of my grandfather. Ah, he was a Ground Hog worth seeing! He was large, and, although when I knew him the black fur on his back was streaked with gray, he was still handsome. He was clever, too. I have often heard my father say that he could dig the deepest and best burrow in the forest. And then he had such fine manners! There was not another Ground Hog in the country around who could eat as noisily as he, and it is said that when he was courting my grandmother she chose him because of the elegant way in which he sat up on his haunches. I have been told, children, that I am very much like him."""
"Just here, a Red-headed Woodpecker gave a loud ""Rat-a-tat-tat"" on the tree above the Ground Hog's head, and there was a look around her bill as though she wanted to laugh. The Ground Hog slowly turned his head to look at her as she flew away. ""Quite a good-looking young person,"" he said, ""but badly brought up. She should know better than to disturb those who are talking. What was I saying, children?"""
"""You were telling how well your grandfather sat up on his haunches,"""
said the smallest little Rabbit.
"""So I was! So I was! I must tell you how my grandfather came to know the world so well. When he was only a young fellow, he made his home for a time by a Hen house, and so heard the talk of the barn-yard people."
"Once he heard them tell how the farmer watched on a certain winter day to see my grandfather come out of his burrow. Of course, you children all know how we Ground Hogs do; in the fall we are very fat, and when the cold weather comes we go to sleep in our burrows to wait for spring."
"Sometimes we awaken and stretch, but we go to sleep again very soon."
"Then, when spring comes we are slender and have healthy appetites."
"""The Hens treated my grandfather with great politeness, and the Black Brahma Cock showed plainly how honored they felt to have him there. They said that they were so glad my grandfather stayed out of his burrow awhile on this winter day when the farmer was watching, because they were in a hurry for warm weather. My grandfather did not know what they meant by that, but he was too wise to say so, and he found out by asking questions, that if a Ground Hog leaves his burrow on this certain day in winter, and sees his shadow, and goes back again, it will be cold for a long time after that. If he does not see his shadow, and stays out, it will soon be warm."
"""You see now, children, how important our family is; and yet we are so modest that we had not even known that we made the weather until the Hens told my grandfather. But that is the way! Really great people often think the least of themselves."""
"""And do you make the weather?"" asked the smallest little Rabbit."
"""I suppose we do,"" said the Ground Hog, with a smile. ""It is a great care. I often say to myself: 'Shall I have it warm, or shall I have it cold?' It worries me so that sometimes I can hardly eat."""
"""And how do you know when the day comes for you to make the weather?"""
said the smallest little rabbit.
"""Ahem! Well-er! I am sorry to say that my grandfather did not find out exactly what day it is that they watch for us, so I have to guess at that. But to think that we Ground Hogs make the weather for all the other people! It is worth a great deal to belong to such a family. I suppose I might have been a Weasel, a Fox, an Owl, or an Oriole. And it is a great thing to have known one's grandfather."""
"The little Rabbits sat very still, wishing that they had known their grandfather, when suddenly the biggest one said: ""If you should stay out of your burrow when that day comes, and another Ground Hog should go back into his burrow, how would the weather know what to do?"""
"""Children,"" said the old Ground Hog, ""I think your mother is calling to you. You might better go to see. Good-by."" And he waved his paw politely."
"The seven little Rabbits scampered away, but their mother was not calling them. She wasn't even there, and when they went back they couldn't find the Ground Hog. They wondered how he happened to make such a mistake. The Red-headed Woodpecker who came along at about that time, twisted her head on one side and said: ""Made-a-mistake! Rat-a-tat-tat!"
"Not he!"""
"Then Balna said to her sisters, ""Do you not see that girl watching us?"
"Let us drive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tell her mother all about it, and that will be very bad for us."""
"But the other sisters said, ""Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna. The girl would never be so cruel as to tell her mother. Let us rather invite her to come and have some of the fruit."" And calling her to them, they gave her one of the pomeloes."
"No sooner had she eaten it, however, than the Prudhan's daughter went home and said to her mother, ""I do not wonder the seven Princesses will not eat the dinner you prepare for them, for by their mother's grave there grows a beautiful pomelo tree, and they go there every day and eat the pomeloes. I ate one, and it was the nicest I have ever tasted."""
"The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this, and all next day she stayed in her room, and told the Raja that she had a very bad headache. The Raja was deeply grieved, and said to his wife, ""What can I do for you?"" She answered, ""There is only one thing that will make my headache well. By your dead wife's tomb there grows a fine pomelo tree; you must bring that here, and boil it, root and branch, and put a little of the water in which it has been boiled, on my forehead, and that will cure my headache."" So the Raja sent his servants, and had the beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did as the Ranee desired; and when some of the water, in which it had been boiled, was put on her forehead, she said her headache was gone and she felt quite well."
"Next day, when the seven Princesses went as usual to the grave of their mother, the pomelo tree had disappeared. Then they all began to cry very bitterly."
"Now there was by the Ranee's tomb a small tank, and as they were crying they saw that the tank was filled with a rich cream-like substance, which quickly hardened into a thick white cake. At seeing this all the Princesses were very glad, and they ate some of the cake, and liked it; and next day the same thing happened, and so it went on for many days. Every morning the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and found the little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like cake. Then the cruel step-mother said to her daughter: ""I cannot tell how it is, I have had the pomelo tree which used to grow by the Ranee's grave destroyed, and yet the Princesses grow no thinner, nor look more sad, though they never eat the dinner I give them. I cannot tell how it is!"""
"And her daughter said, ""I will watch."""
"Next day, while the Princesses were eating the cream cake, who should come by but their step-mother's daughter. Balna saw her first, and said, ""See, sisters, there comes that girl again. Let us sit round the edge of the tank and not allow her to see it, for if we give her some of our cake, she will go and tell her mother; and that will be very unfortunate for us."""
"The other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious, and instead of following her advice, they gave the Prudhan's daughter some of the cake, and she went home and told her mother all about it."
"The Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses fared, was exceedingly angry, and sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee's tomb, and fill the little tank with the ruins. And not content with this, she next day pretended to be very, very ill in fact, at the point of death and when the Raja was much grieved, and asked her whether it was in his power to procure her any remedy, she said to him: ""Only one thing can save my life, but I know you will not do it."" He replied, ""Yes, whatever it is, I will do it."" She then said, ""To save my life, you must kill the seven daughters of your first wife, and put some of their blood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, and their death will be my life."" At these words the Raja was very sorrowful; but because he feared to break his word, he went out with a heavy heart to find his daughters."
He found them crying by the ruins of their mother's grave.
"Then, feeling he could not kill them, the Raja spoke kindly to them, and told them to come out into the jungle with him; and there he made a fire and cooked some rice, and gave it to them. But in the afternoon, it being very hot, the seven Princesses all fell asleep, and when he saw they were fast asleep, the Raja, their father, stole away and left them (for he feared his wife), saying to himself: ""It is better my poor daughters should die here, than be killed by their step-mother."""
"He then shot a deer, and returning home, put some of its blood on the forehead and hands of the Ranee, and she thought then that he had really killed the Princesses, and said she felt quite well."
"Meantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when they found themselves all alone in the thick jungle they were much frightened, and began to call out as loud as they could, in hopes of making their father hear; but he was by that time far away, and would not have been able to hear them even had their voices been as loud as thunder."
"It so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a neighbouring Raja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle, and as they were returning home, after the day's sport was over, the youngest Prince said to his brothers: ""Stop, I think I hear some one crying and calling out. Do you not hear voices? Let us go in the direction of the sound, and find out what it is."""
So the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the place where the seven Princesses sat crying and wringing their hands.
"At the sight of them the young Princes were very much astonished, and still more so on learning their story; and they settled that each should take one of these poor forlorn ladies home with him, and marry her."
"So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him, and married her."
And the second took the second;
And the third took the third;
And the fourth took the fourth;
And the fifth took the fifth;
And the sixth took the sixth;
"And the seventh, and the handsomest of all, took the beautiful Balna."
"And when they got to their own land, there was great rejoicing throughout the kingdom, at the marriage of the seven young Princes to seven such beautiful Princesses."
"About a year after this Balna had a little son, and his uncles and aunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathers and seven mothers. None of the other Princes and Princesses had any children, so the son of the seventh Prince and Balna was acknowledged their heir by all the rest."
"They had thus lived very happily for some time, when one fine day the seventh Prince (Balna's husband) said he would go out hunting, and away he went; and they waited long for him, but he never came back."
"Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of him; and they went away, but they also did not return."
"And the seven Princesses grieved very much, for they feared that their kind husbands must have been killed."
"One day, not long after this had happened, as Balna was rocking her baby's cradle, and whilst her sisters were working in the room below, there came to the palace door a man in a long black dress, who said that he was a Fakir, and came to beg. The servants said to him, ""You cannot go into the palace the Raja's sons have all gone away; we think they must be dead, and their widows cannot be interrupted by your begging."" But he said, ""I am a holy man, you must let me in."""
"Then the stupid servants let him walk through the palace, but they did not know that this was no Fakir, but a wicked Magician named Punchkin."
"His rallying cry was, ""I am a Democrat."""
"The Mexican War now came on. General Taylor's army met the enemy first at Palo Alto, where he ran across the Mexicans six thousand strong, and, though he had but two thousand men, drove them back, only losing nine men. This was the most economical battle of the war."
"The next afternoon he met the enemy at Resaca de la Palma, and whipped him in the time usually required to ejaculate the word ""scat!"""
"Next General Taylor proceeded against Monterey, September 24, and with six thousand men attacked the strongly-fortified city, which held ten thousand troops. The Americans avoided the heavy fire as well as possible by entering the city and securing rooms at the best hotel, leaving word at the office that they did not wish to be disturbed by the enemy. In fact, the soldiers did dig their way through from house to house to avoid the volleys from the windows, and thus fought to within a square of the Grand Plaza, when the city surrendered. The Grand Plaza is generally a sandy vacant lot, where Mexicans sell tamales made of the highly-peppered but tempting cutlets of the Mexican hairless dog."
"The battle of Buena Vista took place February 23, 1847, General Santa Anna commanding the Mexicans. He had twenty thousand men, and General Taylor's troops were reduced in numbers. The fight was a hot one, lasting all day, and the Americans were saved by Bragg's artillery."
Bragg used the old Colonial method of rolling his guns up to the nose of the enemy and then discharging an iron-foundry into his midst. This disgusted the enemy so that General Santa Anna that evening took the shreds of his army and went away.
"General Kearney was sent to take New Mexico and California. His work consisted mainly in marching for General Frémont, who had been surveying a new route to Oregon, and had with sixty men been so successful that on the arrival of Kearney, with the aid of Commodores Sloat and Stockton, California was captured, and has given general satisfaction to every one."
"In March, 1847, General Scott, with twelve thousand men, bombarded Vera Cruz four days, and at the end of that time the city was surrendered."
"At Cerro Gordo, a week later, Scott overtook the enemy under General Santa Anna, and made such a fierce attack that the Mexicans were completely routed. Santa Anna left his leg on the field of battle and rode away on a pet mule named Charlotte Corday. The leg was preserved and taken to the Smithsonian Institute. It is made of second-growth hickory, and has a brass ferrule and a rubber eraser on the end. General Taylor afterwards taunted him with this incident, and, though greatly irritated, Santa Anna said there was no use trying to kick."
"Puebla resisted not, and the army marched into the city of Mexico August 7. The road was rendered disagreeable by strong fortifications and thirty thousand men who were not on good terms with Scott. The environments and suburbs one after another were taken, and a parley for peace ensued, during which the Mexicans were busy fortifying some more on the quiet."
"September 8 the Americans made their assault, and carried the outworks one by one. Then the castle of Chapultepec was stormed. First the outer works were scaled, which made them much more desirable, and the moat was removed by means of a stomach-pump and blotting-pad, and then the escarpment was up-ended, the Don John tower was knocked silly by a solid shot, and the castle capitulated."
"Thus on the 14th of September the old flag floated over the court-house of Mexico, and General Scott ate his tea in the palace of the Montezumas. Peace was declared February 2, 1848, and the United States owned the vast country southward to the Gila (pronounced Heeler) and west to the Pacific Ocean."
"The Wilmot Proviso was invented by David Wilmot, a poor, struggling member of Congress, who moved that in any territory acquired by the United States slavery should be prohibited except upon the advice of a physician. The motion was lost."
"Gold was discovered in the Sacramento Valley in August, 1848, by a workman who was building a mill-race. A struggle ensued over this ground as to who should own the race. It threatened to terminate in a race war, but was settled amicably."
In eighteen months one hundred thousand people went to the scene.
"Thousands left their skeletons with the red brother, and other thousands left theirs on the Isthmus of Panama or on the cruel desert. Many married men went who had been looking a long time for some good place to go to. Leaving their wives with ill-concealed relief, they started away through a country filled with death, to reach a country they knew not of. Some died en route, others were hanged, and still others became the heads of new families. Some came back and carried water for their wives to wash clothing for their neighbors."
"It was a long hard trip then across the plains. One of the author's friends at the age of thirteen years drove a little band of cows from the State of Indiana to Sacramento. He says he would not do it again for anything. He is now a man, and owns a large prune-orchard in California, and people tell him he is getting too stout, and that he ought to exercise more, and that he ought to walk every day several miles; but he shakes his head, and says, ""No, I will not walk any to-day, and possibly not to-morrow or the day following. Do not come to me and refer to taking a walk: I have tried that. Possibly you take me for a dromedary; but you are wrong. I am a fat man, and may die suddenly some day while lacing up my shoes, but when I go anywhere I ride."""
"When he got to Sacramento, where gold was said to be so plentiful, he was glad to wash dishes for his board, and he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into the fields for to feed swine, and he would fain have filled his system with the California peaches which the swine did eat, and he began to be in want, and no man gave unto him, and if he had spent his substance in riotous living, he said, it would have been different."
"About thirty years after that he arose and went unto his father, and carried his dinner with him, also a government bond and a new suit of raiment for the old gentleman."
I do not know what we should learn from this.
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE WEBSTERS.
"Daniel Webster, together with Mr. Clay, had much to do with the Compromise measures of 1850. These consisted in the admission of California as a free State, the organizing of the Territories of Utah and New Mexico without any provision regarding slavery pro or con, the payment to Texas of one hundred million dollars for New Mexico, which was a good trade for Texas, the prohibition of the slave-trade in the District of Columbia, and the enactment of a Fugitive Slave Law permitting owners of slaves to follow them into the free States and take them back in irons, if necessary. The officials and farmers of the free States were also expected to turn out, call the dog, leave their work, and help catch these chattels and carry them to the south-bound train."
"Daniel Webster was born in 1782, and Noah in 1758. Daniel was educated at Dartmouth College, where he was admitted in 1797. He taught school winters and studied summers, as many other great men have done since, until he knew about everything that anybody could. What Dan did not know, Noah did."
"Strange to say, Daniel was frightened to death when first called upon to speak a piece. He says he committed dozens of pieces to memory and recited them to the woods and crags and cows and stone abutments of the New England farms, but could not stand up before a school and utter a word."
"In 1801 he studied law with Thomas W. Thompson, afterwards United States Senator. He read then for the first time that ""Law is a rule of action prescribing what is right and prohibiting what is wrong."""
"In 1812 he was elected to Congress, and in 1813 made his maiden speech."
"One of his most masterly speeches was made on economical and financial subjects; and yet in order to get his blue broadcloth coat with brass buttons from the tailor-shop to wear while making the speech, he had to borrow twenty-five dollars."
"When the country has wanted a man to talk well on these subjects it has generally been compelled to advance money to him before he could make a speech. Sometimes he has to be taken from the pawn-shop. Webster, it is said, was the most successful lawyer, after he returned to Boston, that the State of Massachusetts has ever known; and yet his mail was full of notices from banks down East, announcing that he had overdrawn his account."
"The battle of Antietam was a very fierce one, and undecisive, yet it saved Washington from an invasion by the Confederates, who would have done a good deal of trading there, no doubt, entirely on credit, thus injuring business very much and loading down Washington merchants with book accounts, which, added to what they had charged already to members of Congress, would have made times in Washington extremely dull."
"General McClellan, having impressed the country with the idea that he was a good bridge-builder, but a little too dilatory in the matter of carnage, was succeeded by General Burnside."
"President Lincoln had written the Proclamation of Emancipation to the slaves in July, but waited for a victory before publishing it. Bull Run as a victory was not up to his standard; so when Lee was driven from Maryland the document was issued by which all slaves in the United States became free; and, although thirty-one years have passed at this writing, they are still dropping in occasionally from the back districts to inquire about the truth of the report."
CHAPTER XXVII.
"STILL MORE FRATERNAL BLOODSHED, ON PRINCIPLE. OUTING FEATURES DISAPPEAR, AND GIVE PLACE TO STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN COMBATANTS, WHO BEGIN TO MIX THINGS."
"On December 13 the year's business closed with the battle of Fredericksburg, under the management of General Burnside. Twelve thousand Union troops were killed before night mercifully shut down upon the slaughter."
"The Confederates were protected by stone walls and situated upon a commanding height, from which they were able to shoot down the Yankees with perfect sang-froid and deliberation."
"In the midst of all these discouragements, the red brother fetched loose in Minnesota, Iowa, and Dakota, and massacred seven hundred men, women, and children. The outbreak was under the management of Little Crow, and was confined to the Sioux Nation. Thirty-nine of these Indians were hanged on the same scaffold at Mankato, Minnesota, as a result of this wholesale murder."
This execution constitutes one of the green spots in the author's memory. In all lives now and then an oasis is liable to fall. This was oasis enough to last the writer for years.
"In 1863 the Federal army numbered about seven hundred thousand men, and the Confederates about three hundred and fifty thousand. Still it took two more years to close the war."
"It is held now by good judges that the war was prolonged by the jealousy existing between Union commanders who wanted to be President or something else, and that it took so much time for the generals to keep their eyes on caucuses and county papers at home that they fought best when surprised and attacked by the foe."
"General Grant moved again on Vicksburg, and on May 1, defeated Pemberton at Fort Gibson. He also prevented a junction between Joseph E. Johnston and Pemberton, and drove the latter into Vicksburg, securing the stopper so tightly that after forty-seven days the garrison surrendered, July 4."
"This fight cost the Confederates thirty-seven thousand prisoners, ten thousand killed and wounded, and immense quantities of stores. It was a warm time in Vicksburg; a curious man who stuck his hat out for twenty seconds above the ramparts found fifteen bullet-holes in it when he took it down, and when he wore it to church he attracted more attention than the collection."
"The North now began to sit up and take notice. Morning papers began to sell once more, and Grant was the name on every tongue."
"The Mississippi was open to the Gulf, and the Confederacy was practically surrounded."
"Rosecrans would have moved on the enemy, but learned that the foe had several head of cavalry more than he did, also a team of artillery. At this time John Morgan made a raid into Ohio. He surrounded Cincinnati, but did not take it, as he was not keeping house at the time and hated to pay storage on it. He got to Parkersburg, West Virginia, and was captured there with almost his entire force."
On September 19 and 20 occurred the battle of Chickamauga. Longstreet rushed into a breach in the Union line and swept it with a great big besom of wrath with which he had wisely provided himself on starting out. Rosecrans felt mortified when he came to himself and found that his horse had been so unmanageable that he had carried him ten miles from the carnage.
"But the left, under Thomas, held fast its position, and no doubt saved the little band of sixty thousand men which Rosecrans commanded at the time."
"His army now found itself shut up in intrenchments, with Bragg on the hills threatening the Union forces with starvation."
"On November 24-25 a battle near Chattanooga took place, with Grant at the head of the Federal forces. Hooker came to join him from the Army of the Potomac, and Sherman hurried to his standard from Iuka. Thomas made a dash and captured Orchard Knob, and Hooker, on the following day, charged Lookout Mountain."
"This was the most brilliant, perhaps, of Grant's victories. It is known as the ""battle of Missionary Ridge."" Hooker had exceeded his prerogative and kept on after capturing the crest of Lookout Mountain, while Sherman was giving the foe several varieties of fits, from the north, when Grant discovered that before him the line was being weakened in order to help the Confederate flanks. So with Thomas he crossed through the first line and over the rifle-pits, forgot that he had intended to halt and reform, and concluded to wait and reform after the war was over, when he should have more time, and that night along the entire line of heights the camp-fires of the Union army winked at one another in ghoulish glee."
"The army under Bragg was routed, and Bragg resigned his command."
"Burnside, who had been relieved of the command of the Army of the Potomac, was sent to East Tennessee, where the brave but frost-bitten troops of Longstreet shut him up at Knoxville and compelled him to board at the railroad eating-house there."
"Sherman's worn and weary boys were now ordered at once to the relief of Burnside, and Longstreet, getting word of it, made a furious assault on the former, who repulsed him with loss, and he went away from there as Sherman approached from the west."
"Hooker had succeeded Burnside in the command of the Army of the Potomac, and he judged that, as Lee was now left with but sixty thousand men, while the Army of the Potomac contained one hundred thousand who craved out-of-door exercise, he might do well to go and get Lee, returning in the cool of the evening. Lee, however, accomplished the division of his army while concealed in the woods and sent Jackson to fall on Hooker's rear. The close of the fight found Hooker on his old camping-ground opposite Fredericksburg, murmuring to himself, in a dazed sort of way, ""Where am I?"" Lee felt so good over this that he decided to go North and get something to eat. He also decided to get catalogues and price-lists of Philadelphia and New York while there. Threatening Baltimore in order to mislead General Meade, who was now in command of the Federals, Lee struck into Pennsylvania and met with the Union cavalry a little west of Gettysburg on the Chambersburg road. It is said that Gettysburg was not intended by either army as the site for the battle, Lee hoping to avoid a fight, depending as he did on the well-known hospitality of the Pennsylvanians, and Meade intending to have the fight at Pipe Creek, where he had some property."
"July 1-2-3 were the dates of this memorable battle. The first day was rather favorable to Lee, quite a number of Yankee prisoners being taken while they were lost in the crowded streets of Gettysburg."
"The second day was opened by Longstreet, who charged the Union left, and ran across Sickles, who had by mistake formed in the way of Meade's intended line of battle. They outflanked him, but, as they swung around him, Warren met them with a diabolical welcome, which stayed them."
"Sickles found himself on Cemetery Ridge, while the Confederates under Ewell were on Culp's Hill."
"On November 16, Sherman started, his army moving in four columns, constituting altogether a column of fire by night, and a pillar of cloud and dust by day. Kilpatrick's cavalry scoured the country like a mass meeting of ubiquitous little black Tennessee hornets."
"In five weeks Sherman had marched three hundred miles, had destroyed two railroads, had stormed Fort McAllister, and had captured Savannah."
"On the 5th and 6th of May, 1864, occurred the battle of the Wilderness, near the old battleground of Chancellorsville. No one could describe it, for it was fought in the dense woods, and the two days of useless butchery with not the slightest signs of civilized warfare sickened both armies, and, with no victory for either, they retired to their intrenchments."
"Grant, instead of retreating, however, quietly passed the flank of the Confederates and started for Spottsylvania Court-House, where a battle occurred May 8-12."
"Here the two armies fought five days without any advantage to either. It was at this time that Grant sent his celebrated despatch stating that he ""proposed to fight it out on this line if it took all summer."""
"Finally he sought to turn Lee's right flank. June 8, the battle of Cold Harbor followed this movement. The Union forces were shot down in the mire and brush by Lee's troops, now snugly in out of the wet, behind the Cold Harbor defences. One historian says that in twenty minutes ten thousand Yankee troops were killed; though Badeau, whose accuracy in counting dead has always been perfectly marvellous, admits only seven thousand in all."
"Grant now turned his attention towards Petersburg, but Lee was there before him and intrenched, so the Union army had to intrench. This only postponed the evil day, however."
"Things now shaped themselves into a siege of Richmond, with Petersburg as the first outpost of the besieged capital."
"On the 30th of July, eight thousand pounds of powder were carefully inserted under a Confederate fort and the entire thing hoisted in the air, leaving a huge hole, in which, a few hours afterwards, many a boy in blue met his death, for in the assault which followed the explosion the Union soldiers were mowed down by the concentrated fire of the Confederates. The Federals threw away four thousand lives here."
"On the 18th of August the Weldon Railroad was captured, which was a great advantage to Grant, and, though several efforts were made to recapture it, they were unsuccessful."
"General Early was delegated to threaten Washington and scare the able officers of the army who were stopping there at that time talking politics and abusing Grant. He defeated General Wallace at Monocacy River, and appeared before Fort Stevens, one of the defences of Washington, July 11. Had he whooped right along instead of pausing a day somewhere to get laundry-work done before entering Washington, he would easily have captured the city."
"Reinforcements, however, got there ahead of him, and he had to go back."
"He sent a force of cavalry into Pennsylvania, where they captured Chambersburg and burned it on failure of the town trustees to pay five hundred thousand dollars ransom."
"General Sheridan was placed in charge of the troops here, and defeated Early at Winchester, riding twenty miles in twenty minutes, as per poem."
At Fisher's Hill he was also victorious. He devastated the Valley of the Shenandoah to such a degree that a crow passing the entire length of the valley had to carry his dinner with him.
"It was, however, at the battle of Cedar Creek that Sheridan was twenty miles away, according to historical prose. Why he was twenty miles away, various and conflicting reasons are given, but on his good horse Rienzi he arrived in time to turn defeat and rout into victory and hilarity."
"Rienzi, after the war, died in eleven States. He was a black horse, with a saddle-gall and a flashing eye."
"He passed away at his home in Chicago at last in poverty while waiting for a pension applied for on the grounds of founder and lampers brought on by eating too heartily after the battle and while warm, but in the line of duty."
"The Red River campaign under General Banks was a joint naval and land expedition, resulting in the capture of Fort de Russy, March 14, after which, April 8, the troops marching towards Shreveport in very open order, single file or holding one another's hands and singing ""John Brown's Body,"" were attacked by General Dick Taylor, and if Washington had not been so far away and through a hostile country, Bull Run would have had another rival. But the boys rallied, and next day repulsed the Confederates, after which they returned to New Orleans, where board was more reasonable. General Banks obtained quite a relief at this time: he was relieved of his command."
"August 5, Commodore Farragut captured Mobile, after a neat and attractive naval fight, and on the 24th and 25th of December Commodore Porter and General Butler started out to take Fort Fisher. After two days' bombardment, Butler decided that there were other forts to be had on better terms, and returned. Afterwards General Terry commanded the second expedition, Porter having remained on hand with his vessels to assist. January 15, 1865, the most heroic fighting on both sides resulted, and at last, completely hemmed in, the brave and battered garrison surrendered; but no one who was there need blush to say so, even to-day."
At the South at this time coffee was fifty dollars a pound and gloves were one hundred and fifty dollars a pair. Flour was forty dollars a barrel; but you could get a barrel of currency for less than that.
"Money was plenty, but what was needed seemed to be confidence. Running the blockade was not profitable at that time, since over fifteen hundred head of Confederate vessels were captured during the war."
"The capture of Fort Fisher closed the last port of the South, and left the Confederacy no show with foreign Powers or markets."
"The Alabama was an armed steam-ship, and the most unpleasant feature of the war to the Federal government, especially as she had more sympathy and aid in England than was asked for or expected by the Unionists."
"However, England has since repaid all this loss in various ways. She has put from five to eight million dollars into cattle on the plains of the Northwest, where the skeletons of same may be found bleaching in the summer sun; and I am personally acquainted with six Americans now visiting England who can borrow enough in a year to make up all the losses sustained through the Alabama and other neutral vessels."
"Captain Semmes commanded the Alabama, and off Cherbourg he sent a challenge to the Kearsarge, commanded by Captain Winslow, who accepted it, and so worked his vessel that the Alabama had to move round him in a circle, while he filled her up with iron, lead, copper, tin, German silver, glass, nails, putty, paint, varnishes, and dye-stuff. At the seventh rotation the Alabama ran up the white flag and sunk with a low mellow plunk. The crew was rescued by Captain Winslow and the English yacht Deerhound, the latter taking Semmes and starting for England."
"This matter, however, was settled in after-years."
"The care of the sick, the dying, and the dead in the Union armies was almost entirely under the eye of the merciful and charitable, loyal and loving members of the Sanitary and Christian Commissions, whose work and its memory kept green in the hearts of the survivors and their children will be monument enough for the coming centuries."
"In July, 1864, the debt of the country was two billion dollars and twenty cents. Two dollars and ninety cents in greenbacks would buy a reluctant gold dollar."
"Still, Abraham Lincoln was re-elected against George B. McClellan, the Democratic candidate, who carried only three States. This was endorsement enough for the policy of President Lincoln."
"Troubles arose in 1878 over the right to fish in the northeast waters, and the treaty at Washington resulted in an award to Great Britain of five million five hundred thousand dollars, with the understanding that wasteful fishing should cease, and that as soon as either party got enough for a mess he should go home, no matter how well the fish seemed to be biting."
"The right to regulate Chinese immigration was given by treaty at Pekin, and ever since the Chinaman has entered our enclosures in some mysterious way, made enough in a few years to live like a potentate in China, and returned, leaving behind a pleasant memory and a chiffonnier here and there throughout the country filled with scorched shirt-bosoms, acid-eaten collars, and white vests with burglar-proof, ingrowing pockets in them."
The next nominations for President and Vice-President were James A.
"Garfield, of Ohio, and Chester A. Arthur, of New York, on the Republican ticket, and Winfield S. Hancock, of Pennsylvania, and William H."
"English, of Indiana, on the Democratic ticket. James B. Weaver was connected with this campaign also. Who will tell us what he had to do with it? Can no one tell us what James B. Weaver had to do with the campaign of 1881? Very well; I will tell you what he had to do with the campaign of 1881."
"He was the Presidential candidate on the Greenback ticket, but it was kept so quiet that I am not surprised to know that you did not hear about it."
"After the inauguration of Garfield the investigation and annulling of star-route contracts fraudulently obtained were carried out, whereby two million dollars' worth of these corrupt agreements were rendered null and void."
"On the morning of July 2, President Garfield was shot by a poor, miserable, unbalanced, and abnormal growth whose name will not be discovered even in the appendix of this work. He was tried, convicted, and sent squealing into eternity."
"The President lingered patiently for two months and a half, when he died."
"After the accession of President Arthur, there occurred floods on the lower Mississippi, whereby one hundred thousand people lost their homes."
The administration was not in any way to blame for this.
"In 1883 the Brooklyn Bridge across East River was completed and ready for jumping purposes. It was regarded as a great engineering success at the time, but it is now admitted that it is not high enough. A person jumping from it is not always killed."
"The same year the Civil Service Bill became a law. It provides that competitive examinations shall be made of certain applicants for office, whereby mail-carriers must prove that they know how to teach school, and guards in United States penitentiaries are required to describe how to navigate a ship."
"Possibly recent improvements have been made by which the curriculum is more fitted to the crime, but in the early operations of the law the janitor of a jail had to know what length shadow would be cast by a pole 18 feet 6-1/4 inches high on the third day of July at 11 o'clock 30 min."
"and 20 sec. standing on a knoll 35 feet 8-1/8 inches high, provided 8 men in 9 days can erect such a pole working 8 hours per day."
"In 1883 letter postage was reduced from three cents to two cents per half-ounce, and in 1885 to two cents per ounce."
"In 1884 Alaska was organized as a Territory, and after digging the snow out of Sitka, so that the governor should not take cold in his system, it was made the seat of government."
"Chinese immigration in 1882 was forbidden for ten years, and in 1884 a treaty with Mexico was made, a copy of which is on file in the State Department, but not allowed to be loaned to the author for use in this work."
"Grover Cleveland and Thomas A. Hendricks were nominated and elected at the end of President Arthur's term, running against James G. Blaine and John A. Logan, the Republican candidates, also Benjamin F. Butler and A."
"M. West, of Mississippi, on the People's ticket, and John P. St. John and William Daniel on the Prohibition ticket. St. John went home and kept bees, so that he could have honey to eat on his Kansas locusts, and Daniel swore he would never enter the performing cage of immoral political wild beasts again while reason remained on her throne."
"In 1886 a Presidential succession law was passed, whereby on the death of the President and the Vice-President the order of succession shall be the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of War, the Attorney-General, the Postmaster-General, and the Secretaries of the Navy and of the Interior. This gives the Secretary of Agriculture an extremely remote and rarefied chance at the Presidency. Still, he should be just as faithful to his trust as he would be if he were nearer the throne."
"May 4, 1886, occurred a terrible outbreak of Chicago Anarchists, whereby seven policemen sent to preserve order were killed by the bursting of an Anarchist's bomb. The Anarchists were tried and executed, with the exception of Ling, who ate a dynamite capsule and passed into rest having had his features, and especially his nose, blown in a swift and earnest manner. Death resulted, and whiskers and beer-blossoms are still found embedded in the stone walls of his cell. Those who attended the funeral say that Ling from a scenic point of view was not a success."
"Governor Altgeld, of Illinois, an amateur American, in the summer of 1893 pardoned two of the Anarchists who had escaped death by imprisonment."
"August 31, 1886, in Charleston, occurred several terrible earthquake shocks, which seriously damaged the city and shocked and impaired the nerves and health of hundreds of people."
The noted heroism and pluck of the people of Charleston were never shown to greater advantage than on this occasion.
"Mr. Cleveland was again nominated, but was defeated by General Benjamin Harrison. Hon. James G. Blaine, of Maine, was made Secretary of State, and Wm. Windom, a veteran financier, Secretary of the Treasury."
"Secretary Windom's tragic death just as he had finished a most brilliant address to the great capitalists of New York after their annual dinner and discussion at Delmonico's is, and will ever remain, while life lasts, a most dramatic picture in the author's memory."
"Personally, the administration of President Harrison will be long remembered for the number of deaths among the families of the Executive and those of his Cabinet and friends."
"Nebraska, the thirty-seventh State, was admitted March 1, 1867. The name signifies ""Water Valley."" Colorado, the Centennial State, was the thirty-eighth. She was admitted July 1, 1876. Six other States have been since admitted when the political sign was right. Still, they have not always stuck by the party admitting them to the Union. This is the kind of ingratitude which sometimes leads to the reformation of politicians supposed to have been dead in sin."
"President Harrison's administration was a thoroughly upright and honest one, so far as it was possible for it to be after his party had drifted into the musty catacombs of security in office and the ship of state had become covered with large and expensive barnacles."
"As we go to press, his successor, Grover Cleveland, in the first year of his second administration, is paying a high price for fleeting fame, with the serious question of what to do with the relative coinage of gold and silver, and the Democrats in Congress, for the first time in the history of the world, are referring each other with hot breath and flashing eye to the platform they adopted at the National Convention."
"Andrei Androv stopped, his ancient eyes tearing as his voice dropped to"
"a whisper. ""Of all the things you've ever done, my son, nothing could"
make me more proud of you than what you just said. I've thought it
"over, about the military uses for this vehicle, and I think the future"
of the world is about to be rewritten here. You must stop them. You're
"the only chance we have left."""

SPRING TWILIGHT.
To K. W.
"THE twilight droops across the day,"
I watch her portrait on the wall
Palely recede into the grey
That palely comes and covers all.
"The sad Spring twilight, dull, forlorn,"
The menace of the dreary night:
"But in her face, more fair than morn,"
A sweet suspension of delight.
IN WINTER.
"PALE from the watery west, with the pallor of winter a-cold,"
"There was the upflashing of a sword, and a hoarse challenge frightened"
the night.
Giovanni Frangipani saw a furious face glaring dead white from under
the shadow of a shield.
"He stopped in his onward rush, blinked at the duke as one gone mad."
"""Damnation, what have we here?"""
"""By the love of God, I have you now!"""
"""Fool, are you mad?"""
"The hoarse voice echoed him, the eyes flashed fire."
"""Guard, ravisher,--guard!"""
"""Ten thousand devils! Who are you?"""
"""Your obedient servant,--the Duke of Spoleto!"""
The Frangipani growled like a trapped bear.
"He raised his sword, put forward his shield."
"""On with you, dog!"" he roared. ""Join your wanton under the sod!"""
"""Ha, say you so?"" cried the duke, closing in."
"Their swords flashed, yelped, twisted in the air. A down cut hewed the"
dexter cantrel from the Frangipani's shield. His face with a gashed
ON JUDGES’ WALK.
THAT night on Judges’ Walk the wind
Was as the voice of doom;
"The heath, a lake of darkness, lay"
As silent as the tomb.
"The vast night brooded, white with stars,"
Above the world’s unrest;
The awfulness of silence ached
Like a strong heart repressed.
"That night we walked beneath the trees,"
"Alone, beneath the trees;"
There was some word we could not say
Half uttered in the breeze.
That night on Judges’ Walk we said
No word of all we had to say;
But now there shall be no word said
Before the Judge’s Day.
IN THE NIGHT.
THE moonlight had tangled the trees
"""Wait, they're after me, Captain; it's the Port Townsend police, and if"
"you let them aboard they'll take me off."""
"""What makes you think so?"" demanded Peasley."
"""Ask them."""
"Turning, the skipper bellowed down the gleaming electric pathway, ""Who"
"are you?"""
"""Police! We want to come aboard."""
"""What did I tell you?"" cried Emerson."
"Once more the Captain shouted: ""What do you want?"""
"""One of your passengers--Emerson. Heave to. You're passing us."""
"""That's bloody hard luck, Mr. Emerson; I can't help myself,"" the"
Captain declared. But again Boyd blocked him as he started for the
telegraph.
"""I won't stand it, sir. It's a conspiracy to ruin me."""
"""But, my dear young man--"""
"""Don't touch that instrument!"""
"From the launch came cries of growing vehemence, and a startled murmur"
of voices rose from somewhere in the darkness of the deck beneath.
"I shall always hold you fast,"
"I shall never set you free,"
"You are mine, and I possess you"
Long as life shall last;
"You will comfort me,"
I shall bless you.
I shall keep you as we keep
"Flowers for memory, hid away,"
Under many a newer token
"Buried deep,"
"Roses of a gaudier day,"
"Rings and trinkets, bright and broken."
"Other women I shall love,"
"Fame and fortune I may win,"
But when fame and love forsake me
"And the light is night above,"
"You will let me in,"
You will take me.
NOCTURNES.
NOCTURNE.
energy enough to create more than the delicate measure of a gust of
chamber-music.
A burst of applause followed the recital of a poem.
Noll roused with a start:
"“Come, Madelaine,” said he--“this heavy air is making you faint. Come"
with me and we’ll have some supper.”
She gathered her skirts with wonted grace of gesture and took his arm;
and they made their way out of the room almost unnoticed.
"As the doors closed on them, she turned in the dim ill-lit passage,"
"drew down his face to her between her two hands, and kissed him."
She clung to him:
"“Thou must give me a bed too,” she whispered hoarsely; “I have no bed.”"
She was trembling.
"“You are tired, Madelaine,” he said."
She nodded:
“I have had no sleep for three nights.”
“What have you been doing?” he asked.
"“I walked about the streets,” she answered simply."
“Coleman. He lives—”
“I know. Au revoir!” And the girls were alone.
"“There!” exclaimed Miss Decker, “we have got rid of him. Now for the"
"others. You slip upstairs, and I’ll dispose of them one by one. You are"
taken suddenly ill. Teddy will not be back for an hour. Dr. Coleman has
moved.”

"A lamp burned in the sea-room, and the two girls were sitting in their"
evening gowns before a bright log fire. Miss Decker was in white this
time—an elaborate French concoction of embroidered muslin which made
her look like an expensive fashion plate. Jessica wore a low-cut black
"crêpe, above which she rose like carved ivory and brass. The snakes"
to-night were held in place by diamond hair-pins that glittered like
baleful eyes. In her lap sparkled four rings.
"“What shall I do?” she exclaimed. “If my life depended upon it, I could"
"Entman's little eyes shone with affection. ""I can only wish you good"
"luck."""
"""Thanks. I'll need it."""
"""And one more thing I was wondering."""
"""What's that?"""
"""Why do you suppose the tenth android killed the one in the Village?"""
"""Another case of taking one reason for want of a better one. I think it"
was his way of delivering the creature to us for research. He couldn't
"know for sure that we already had his 'brothers.'"""
"""You're right--you must be,"" Entman agreed."
"""Small consolation. I'd like a few facts to go on for a change instead"
"of having to depend on logic all the time,"" Taber growled."
"""What are you referring to?"""
"""The data. I'm assuming, _if_ that's what's important, that the tenth"
"creature has a way of getting the stuff back up there."""
"""I can help a little on that,"" Entman said. ""I can assure you that from"
"what I've found in those brains, the data could, most likely, be sent"
"mentally."""
"""You're sure of that?"""
"Crane thing, I'm sure you realized that our talk was ... well, the words"
were put into my mouth. I felt the same way about the oaf as you did.
"But sometimes, in the line of duty, old man ... well, I know you were"
"reading between my lines all the time."""
"""I'm pretty good at that."""
"""I knew we understood each other."""
"""Is that what you called about?"""
"""Yes, but I've got a little tip for you. They want to see you upstairs."
I happen to know they liked the way things turned out. Just between you

"happy. I was queried and I gave you all the credit."""
"""Before or after the good Senator fell on his face?"""
"Halliday laughed. ""Okay, pal. You're entitled to your little dig. But"
"you know this--I'm with you and I always will be."""
"""And I'm with you, too, pal,"" Brent said wearily and hung up."
"The phone rang again. Automatically, Brent picked up the receiver."
"""Brent? Porter on this end. How is it with you, old man?"""
"""Ducky. Just ducky."""
"Porter laughed. ""Just called to say, 'Good job well done.'"""
"""Thanks."""
"Quilliam O’Flaherty stooping down in confusion to search for the hat,"
she kicked him violently behind.
"There was a roar of laughter from the students seated round about, and"
"they tapped the handles of their knives upon the tables, singing:"
"“Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe! Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe!"
Hey-hey-hey! bouffe-bouffe-bouffe!”
"Then the girl flogged Quilliam with a horse-whip, thrice:"
Once for France.
Once for womanhood.
And once because she liked it.
The whip whistled.
It was said that he had been seen to strike at her--but she parried the
"blow with her left, and countered between his eyes with the butt-end of"
the whip--which was loaded.
He fell.
It was homeric.
"It was at this stage, so the scandal went, that he scrambled under a"
table; but she lugged at his collar to get him out; and as he clung
to the leg of the table she gripped him by the moustache so that she
pulled off one side of it.
"""He'll take offense,"" the lawyer murmured, considering the matter."
But Solem urged him on:
"""I don't think so. Anyhow, you were the first one to talk about it."""
"""Everybody here will know, and I'll be prevented,"" said the lawyer."
"""We can go at dawn,"" said Solem."
In the end they came to an agreement.
"""You won't tell anyone?"" the lawyer said to me."
*       *       *       *       *
The lawyer was missed in the course of the morning; he was not in his
"room, and not in the garden."
"""Perhaps the Danish mountaineer can tell us where he is,"" I said. But it"
transpired that the Dane had not even thought of climbing the Blue Peak
"that day, and knew nothing whatever about the expedition."
This surprised me greatly.
I looked at the clock; it was eleven. I had been watching the peak through
"my field glasses from the moment I got up, but there was nothing to be"
seen. It was five hours since the two men had left.
At half-past eleven Solem came running back; he was drenched in sweat and
exhausted.
"“Come,” he said, “we must first sup.”"
"She gathered up her skirts, and slipped her hand through his arm. They"
"climbed up to the courtyard, and so into the street, and out into the"
night.
Madelaine sat on the side of the bed and undressed.
It was a sadly simple undressing.
She was languid with sleep.
"Noll went and looked out of the window, where Paris lay below him,"
blinking her thousand eyes....
He roused and went to the bed.
The dark head on the pillow lay very still. The girl was fast asleep.
Noll went back to the window--it was the window from which Horace had
gazed down upon the world the night before Noll and Betty had come to
Paris.
"And as Noll so stood, his brows hard knit upon the problems of his"
"life, the night slowly passed."
The rustle of a woman’s skirt had been in his ears all day--in his
"blood. This girl had brought back to him, of a sudden, the fragrance of"
his marriage.
And this beautiful winsome girl--what was to be the end?

"""How long will that be?"" Slyne inquired. He, too, was smiling"
ecstatically.
"""Not much more than a fortnight,"" the lawyer informed him. ""It will soon"
"pass. We must just be patient."""
"""We must keep very quiet, too,"" said Slyne, ""unless we want to give the"
whole show away to the enemy in advance. We must clear off out of London
"till then. I'll tell you what, Jobling! Why shouldn't we all go down to"
"Scotland to-night?"""
"Mr. Jobling nodded agreement. ""An excellent idea,"" he declared. ""There's"
"nothing to keep us here."""
"""That's settled, then,"" Slyne asserted. ""And we'll all dine together at"
the Savoy before we start. I think we can afford to celebrate the
"occasion, eh! And I want to show Lady Josceline a few of her future"

"The Duchess of Dawn was dining a number of notabilities at the Savoy, on"
her way to a command performance at the Gaiety; a fact of which the

"He seemed to express the general feeling, but men were reluctant to"
"acknowledge so disappointing a conclusion, and the preparations for"
departure were slow and lingering. They had not fairly begun before Mr.
Kilshaw's entrance abruptly checked them. Instantly he became the centre
of a crowd.
"""Now, Kilshaw,"" they cried, ""you know all about it. Oh, come now! Of"
"course you do! Secret? Nonsense! Out with it!"" and one or two of his"
"intimates added imploringly, ""Don't be an ass, Kilshaw."""
Kilshaw flung himself into a chair.
"""They resign,"" he said."
"""At once?"""
"""Yes. Perry's to be sent for. Medland, I'm told, insists on going. For"
"my own part, I think he's right."""
"""Of course,"" said somebody sapiently, ""he doesn't want to dissolve with"
"this affair hanging over him."""
"""It comes to the same thing,"" observed Kilshaw. ""Perry will dissolve;"
"the Governor has promised to do it, if he likes."""
"""Perry dissolve!"""
"""Yes,"" nodded Kilshaw. ""You see--"" He paused and added, ""Our present"
"position isn't very independent."""
"He tried to stand, and realized his knees were numb. He staggered"
"backward, grabbing for something to steady himself . . . and the light"
came on.

"It was the gravel voice of his father. He felt like a child again,"
caught with his hand in his pants. What should he do? tell the truth?
"""I'm--I'm checking over the consoles, passing the time. I couldn't"
"sleep."""
"""Don't lie to me."" Andrei Androv's ancient eyebrows gathered into the"

Yuri stared at him a moment. How had he known? A sixth sense?

"""I'm an old man. An old man worries. I had a feeling you might be in"
"here tonight, tinkering with the vehicle. You told me you were planning"
"something. I think the time has come to tell me what it is."""
Yuri took a deep breath and looked him over.
"No, it was too risky. For them both. His secret had to be ironclad."

The waiter came bringing Cæsar’s breakfast. “Will you tell me what it
"is?” said Cæsar to the ecclesiastic, while he filled his cup."
"The monk waited until the waiter was gone, and then said in a hard"
voice:
“His Eminence the Cardinal sent me to bid you not to present yourself
"anywhere again, giving his name.”"
"“What? What does this mean?” asked Cæsar, calmly."
“It means that His Eminence has found out about your intrigues and
machinations.”
“Intrigues? What intrigues were those?”
“You know perfectly well. And His Eminence forbids you to continue in
that direction.”
“His Eminence forbids me to pay calls? And for what reason?”
“Because you have used his name to introduce yourself into certain
places.”
“It is not true.”
“You have told people you went to that you are Cardinal Fort’s nephew.”
"“And I am not?” asked Cæsar, after taking a swallow of coffee."
"“You are trying to make use of the relationship, we don’t know with what"
end in view.”

"The horseman looked for a moment in Francesco's face but, hardened as"
"he was, he dared not abide the trial. There was such a stare of"
"desperate calm in the dark eyes, that his courage failed and quailed"
from the truth. He hung his head and stood mute.
"""I listen--"""
"""My lord--"""
"""For God's sake, speak out!"""
"""My lord--"""
"""The truth!""--"
"""She lives--"""
"A great silence fell within the hearts of the three, an ecstasy of"
"silence, such as comes after the wail of a storm. The duke's lips were"
"compressed, as if he feared to give expression to his feelings."
Francesco's face was as the face of one who thrusts back hope out of
"his soul. He sat rigid on his horse, a stone image fronting Fate,"
"grim-eyed and steadfast. All his life had been one long sacrifice, one"
"long denial,--had it all been in vain?"
There were tears in the eyes of the man-at-arms.

effect on her than through any doubt in his own mind.
"“Not sure. But then the wall safe shows no marks, and the replica is"
gone.”
“Might I see your jewel case?” he asked.
“Surely. I’ll get it. The wall safe is in Lynn’s room. I shall probably
have to fuss a long time with the combination.”
In fact she could not have been very familiar with it for it took
"several minutes before she returned. Meanwhile, Kennedy, who had been"
"drumming absently on the arms of his chair, suddenly rose and walked"
quietly over to a scrap basket that stood beside an escritoire. It had
"evidently just been emptied, for the rooms must have been cleaned"
several hours before. He bent down over it and picked up two scraps of
paper adhering to the wicker work. The rest had evidently been thrown

I bent over to read them. One was:

"a cushion. Trent, who had been detained a moment by Miss Decker,"
advanced to her.
"“It is very soon to come again,” he said, “but I simply had to call and"
inquire if you felt better. I am delighted to see that you apparently
do.”
"“I am better, thank you.” Her voice was weak. “It was good of you to"
come again.”
“Whose ring is that?”
“Why—a—to—sure—”
"“Jessica!” cried Miss Decker, “have you gone off with my ring again? You"
are so absent-minded! I hunted for that ring high and low!”
"“You should not be so good-natured, and my memory would turn over a new"
"leaf. Here, take it.” She tossed the ring to Miss Decker and raised her"
eyes guiltily to Trent’s. “Shall I go up and get the other?”
“No. But I thought you promised never to take it off.”
“I forgot that water ruins stones.”
"“Well, it is a consolation to know that water does not ruin a certain"
plain gold circlet.”

Jessica gasped and looked at the flames. A crisis had come. Would she be

The light of understanding deepened in Lois' eyes.
"""Beatrice--I believe I know!"""

It has been my fear of the world and its opinion that helped to lead
me wrong. Isn't it a just punishment? I have ruined both our lives.

"THE wind is rising on the sea,"
"White flashes dance along the deep,"
That moans as if uneasily
It turned in an unquiet sleep.
Ridge after rocky ridge upheaves
A toppling crest that falls in spray
Where the tormented beach receives
The buffets of the sea’s wild play.
"On the horizon’s nearing line,"
"Where the sky rests, a visible wall."
"Grey in the offing, I divine"
The sails that fly before the squall.
UNDER THE CLIFFS.
BRIGHT light to windward on the horizon’s verge;
"To leeward, stormy shadows, violet-black,"
And the wide sea between
A vast unfurrowed field of windless green;
The stormy shadows flicker on the track
Of phantom sails that vanish and emerge.
"I gaze across the sea, remembering her."
"I watch the white sun walk across the sea,"
"She smiled, rather superciliously I thought."
"""But how did the terrible affair occur?"""
"""We have no idea,"" answered the Countess brokenly.  ""She was found lying"
upon the floor of the salon within a quarter of an hour of the departure
"of her visitor, who proved to be yourself.  Jean, the valet-de-chambre,"
"on entering, discovered her lying there, quite dead."""
"""Astounding!""  I gasped.  ""She was in perfect health when I left her."""
"She shook her head sorrowfully, and her voice, choking with grief,"
declared:
"""My child has been killed--murdered!"""
"""Murdered!  Impossible!""  I cried."
"""But she has,"" she declared.  ""I am absolutely positive of it!"""
CHAPTER SIX.
A PIECE OF PLAIN PAPER.
"""What medical examination has been made?""  I demanded."
"""None,"" responded the Countess.  ""My poor child is dead, and no doctor"
"can render her assistance.  Medical aid is unavailing."""
"""But do you mean to say that on making this discovery you did not think"

"ONE little cab to hold us two,"
"Night, an invisible dome of cloud,"
"The rattling wheels that made our whispers loud,"
As heart-beats into whispers grew;
"And, long, the Embankment with its lights,"
"The pavement glittering with fallen rain,"
"The magic and the mystery that are night’s,"
And human love without the pain.
"The river shook with wavering gleams,"
Deep buried as the glooms that lay
"Impenetrable as the grave of day,"
Near and as distant as our dreams.
A bright train flashed with all its squares
Of warm light where the bridge lay mistily.
"The night was all about us: we were free,"
Free of the day and all its cares!
"That was an hour of bliss too long,"
Too long to last where joy is brief.
Yet one escape of souls may yield relief
To many weary seasons’ wrong.

It ended: heaven was done.
I had been dreaming by her side
That heaven was but begun.

"""No excuse? No, I suppose, none. And I lived with her till she died four"
"years ago. And--Daisy is our daughter."""
"""And he--the husband?"""
"""He did not divorce her. I don't know why not, perhaps because she asked"
him to--anyhow he didn't. And he outlived her: so she died--as she had
"lived."""
"""And is he still alive?"""
"""No; he is dead now."" He was about to go on, but checked himself. Why"
add that horror? How the man died was nothing between her and him.
"""Have you no--nothing to say?"" she burst out, almost angrily. ""You just"
"tell me that and stop!"""
"""What is there to say? I have told you all there is to tell. I loved her"
"very much. I did what I could to make her happy, and I try to make up"
"for it to Daisy. But there is nothing more to say."""
"She was angry that he would not defend himself. She was ready--ah, so"
ready!--to listen to his pleading. But he would not say a word for
"himself. Instead, he went on,"
"""She didn't want to come, but I made her. She repented, poor girl, all"

"""Well, what then?"" asked the merchant, loudly."
"""Nothing ...  Let us be friends!"""
"""It is nice to see that you have decided so quickly. Look here, I have"
already prepared a notification to the court of the withdrawal of the
"summons against my father. Here it is; read it, and sign it."""
"Vaviloff looked at his companion with his round eyes and shivered, as"
if experiencing an unpleasant sensation.
"""Pardon me ... sign it?  And why?"""
"""There is no difficulty about it ... write your Christian name and"
"surname and nothing more,"" explained Petunikoff, pointing obligingly"
with his finger to the place for the signature.
"""Oh!  It is not that ...  I was alluding to the compensation I was to"
"get for my ground."""
"""But then this ground is of no use to you,"" said Petunikoff, calmly."
"""But it is mine!"" exclaimed the soldier."
"""Of course, and how much do you want for it?"""
"""Well, say the amount stated in the document,"" said Vaviloff, boldly."
"""Six hundred!"" and Petunikoff smiled softly.  ""You are a funny fellow!"""
said he. “Look here”--he slapped the old man’s chest jocosely--“your
master and the amateur aristocracy used to have private theatricals
here. Where are his wigs and make-up things? Where does he keep them?
Quick!”
The old butler promptly began to retire backwards upon a handsome
cabinet:
"“Gentlemen, gentlemen; surely I have no need to remind you that Mr."
"Pangbutt’s wigs are his private property,” said the shocked, anxious"
old man. “I haven’t Mr. Pangbutt’s permission----”
"Rippley followed him up, grimly smiling:"
"“Get out, you old panjandrum!” said he. “You’ve shown the hiding-place,"
you naughty old deceiver. Go away!”
"He pushed the expostulating old man from the cabinet, and, throwing"
"open the drawers, proceeded to ransack them."
“Hullo!” he cried--“splendid!”
He struck a match:
“Spirit lamp--everything. Ginger! Here’s a glorious short beard affair
that goes down the middle of the chin and all along the throat.”
He put it on.
"“By Clarkson, makes me look like a ducal butler--I’ll be butler.”"
"He flung off his coat, and his deft fingers began to fix the disguise"
He left the matron and darted back into the room.
"“I'm sure there must be something you would like me to bring you,” he"
whispered. “Don't be afraid. Any mortal thing.”
The child's lips twitched and she looked nervously from side to side.
“What is it? Tell me.”
"“Oh, sir,” she pleaded breathlessly, “might I have some peppermint"
bull's-eyes.”
"When Herold returned to his dressing-room after the first act,--the"
piece for which he had been rehearsing had started a successful
"career,--he found Risca sitting in a straight-backed chair and smoking a"
pipe.
"“Hallo, John! I did n't know you were in front. Why did n't you tell me?"
"It's going splendidly, is n't it?”"
He glowed with the actor's excited delight in an audience's enthusiastic
"reception of a new play. His glow sat rather oddly upon him, for he was"
"made up as a decrepit old man, with bald wig, and heavy, blue patches"
beneath his eyes.
"“No, I'm not in front,” said John."
"“I see now,” smiled Herold, glancing at his friend's loose tweed suit."
No clothes morning or evening ever fitted Risca. Herold called him “The
Tailors' Terror.”
"Suddenly he flung in upon us with a great noise, his colour high, his"
eyes glittering. His first action was to throw his feathered hat on
"one chair, and himself into another."
'I've seen him!' he said. 'Himmel! he is a clever fellow. He will
"worst you, cousin, yet--see if he does not. Oh, he is a clever one!'"
"'Who?' my lady said, looking at him in some displeasure."
"'Who? Tzerclas, to be sure!' he answered, chuckling."
"'You have seen him!' she exclaimed, rising."
"'Of course I have!' he answered. 'And you will see him too, one of"
these days.'
"My lady looked at me, frowning. But I shook my head. He was not drunk."
"'Where?' she asked, after a pause. 'Where did you see him, Rupert?'"
"'In the street--where you see other men,' he answered, chuckling"
"again. 'He should not be there, but who is to keep him out? He is too"
"clever. He will get his way in the end, see if he does not!'"
"'Rupert!' my lady cried in wrathful amazement, 'to hear you, one would"
suppose you admired him.'
"'So I do,' he replied coolly. 'Why not? He has all the wits of the"
"family. He is as cunning as the devil. Take a hint, cousin; put"
yourself on the right side. He will win in the end!' And the Waldgrave
"rose restlessly from his chair, and, going to the window, began to"
whistle.
a sheaf of notes from his jacket pocket.
"""I've known Mr. Dennis for quite some time,"" Frank commented wryly."
"""Be quiet."""
John Dennis' tone was neither hostile nor friendly. They were the words
of a person whose mind was on other things. They watched him as his eyes
scanned the notes.
He appeared to be memorizing them.
"The air became somewhat electric, the silence so deep it seemed to"
scream. Rhoda looked across at Frank Corson. Frank's expression was
"empty, as though he'd suffered some traumatic emotional blow and was"
struggling to recover.
John Dennis stirred. He also appeared to be struggling. He turned his
eyes on the drink Rhoda was holding. He took it out of her hand and
downed it in a single gulp.
"They watched as he went back to work, leafing through the notes, one at"
"a time. As he came close to the end, he lifted his head and shook it"
"violently, as though from sudden pain. He scowled at the empty glass"
he'd handed back to Rhoda.
"""Do you want another?"" she inquired."
"""Give me another."""
She poured a second Scotch and handed it to him. He drank it like so
much water.
"""--what?"" fell from the Girl's lips, her face pale and set."
"""Are you deaf?"" demanded Rance; and then, emphasising every word, he"
"rasped out: ""The fellow you've been polkying with is the man that has"
"been asking people to hold up their hands."""
"""Oh, go on--you can't hand me out that!"" Nevertheless the Girl looked"
wildly about the room.
Angrily Rance strode over to her and sneered bitingly:
"""You don't believe it yet, eh?"""
"""No, I don't believe it yet!"" rapped out the Girl, laying great stress"
"upon the last word. ""I know he isn't."""
"""Well, he _is_ Ramerrez, and he _did_ come to The Polka to rob it,"""
retorted the Sheriff.
All at once the note of resentment in the Girl's voice became positive;
"she flared back at him, though she flushed in spite of herself."
"""But he didn't rob it!"""
"""That's what gits me,"" fretted Sonora. ""He didn't."""
"""I should think it would git you,"" snapped back the Girl, both in her"
look and voice rebuking him for his words.
It was left to Ashby to spring another surprise.
"over it, and charging on and on and on through the darkness."
"To the foot of the hill and across the bottom, and up the opposite"
"slope. I do not know how far we had sped, when Steve's voice was"
"heard, calling on us to halt."
"'Pull up! pull up!' he cried, with an angry oath. 'It is a false"
alarm! What fool set it going? There is no one behind us. Donner und
Blitzen! where is Martin?'
"The horses were beginning to flag, and gladly came to a trot, and then"
to a walk.
'Here! I panted.
"'Himmel! I thought we had ridden you down!' he said, leaving my lady's"
side. His voice shook with passion and loss of breath. 'Who was it? We
"might all have broken our necks, and for nothing!'"
The Waldgrave--it was his stirrup I had caught--turned his horse
round. 'I heard them--close behind us!' he panted. There was a note of
"wildness in his voice. My elbow was against his knee, and I felt him"
tremble.
"'A bird in the hedge,' Steve said rudely. 'It has cost some one dear."
Whose horse was it struck him?'
No one answered. I left the Waldgrave's side and went back a few
"paces. The women were sobbing. Ernst and Jacob stood by them,"
breathing hard after their run. I thought the men's silence strange. I
looked again. There was a figure missing; a horse missing.
But now art sunk beneath the sod.
"Here lost and gone poor Robin lies,"
"He trembles, lingers, falls and dies."
"He's gone, he's gone, forever lost,"
No more of him they now can boast.

He struggled to the very last.
"Perhaps he spent a happy Life,"
Without much struggle and much strife.

The prolonged gloom of the main theme is somewhat lightened by the
speculative optimism of the last verse.

“now we have ours.”
Laura ordered the coachman to stop a moment. The air was still murmuring
"in the foliage, the birds singing, and the clouds flying slowly across"
the sky.
A man with a black box approached the carriage to offer them postcards.
"“Buy two or three,” said Laura."
Cæsar bought a few and put them into his pocket. The vendor withdrew
and Laura continued to look at Rome with enthusiasm.
"“Oh, how beautiful, how lovely it is! I never get tired of looking at"
"it. It is my favourite city. ‘_O fior d’ogni cittá, donna del mondo_.’”"
"“She is no longer mistress of the world, little sister.”"
“For me she is. Look at St. Peter’s. It looks like a shred of cloud.”
"“Yes, that’s so. It’s of a blue shade that seems transparent.”"
Bells were ringing and great majestic white clouds kept moving along the
horizon; on the Janiculum the statue of Garibaldi rose up gallantly into
"the air, like a bird ready to take wing."
"“When I look at Rome this way,” murmured Laura, “I feel a pang, a pang"
of grief.”

THE LAST EXIT.
"OUR love was all arrayed in pleasantness,"
A tender little love that sighed and smiled
"At little happy nothings, like a child,"
A dainty little love in fancy dress.
But now the love that once was half in play
Has come to be this grave and piteous thing.
Why did you leave me all this suffering
For all your memory when you went away?

Closing upon a kiss our comedy.

There is little reason to doubt that the horsewhipping by Gaston
Latour’s sister hastened Mr. Myre’s desire to start the great

As he stood before the mirror in his rooms at his hotel and shaved

loudly through a swollen nose--he had very tender places--and decided
to go to Rouen until the hair grew.

preserve the secret.  She must not see the Countess before we question
"her."""
"""Is she yet conscious?""  I asked in eagerness."
"""Yes; but at present we must put no question to her."""
"""Thank Heaven!""  I gasped.  Then I added, fervently grasping my friend's"
"hand: ""You cannot realise, Dick, what great consolation this is to me!"""
"""I know, my dear fellow--I know,"" he answered sympathetically.  ""But may"
I speak to you as a friend?  You won't be offended at anything I am
"about to say, will you?"""
"""Offended?--certainly not.  Our friendship is too firm for that, Dick."
"What is it you wish to say?"""
"I saw that he was uneasy, and was surprised at his sudden gravity."
"""Well,"" he said, after a moment's hesitation, ""you'll forgive me for"
"saying so, but I don't think that in this affair you've told me exactly"
"the truth."""
"""What do you mean?""  I inquired quickly."
"""I mean that when you parted from her this afternoon you were not"
"altogether good friends."""
"""You are mistaken,"" I assured him.  ""We were as good friends as ever"
"""At present they cannot tell,"" I responded.  ""Some deleterious substance"
"is suspected, but until she has returned to consciousness and can give"
"us some details of her sudden attack we can determine nothing."""
"""But she will recover, m'sieur?"" the Countess asked.  ""Are you certain?"""
"""The chances are in her favour, the doctors say.  They have given her a"
"drug to counteract the effect of the poison."""
"""Poison!  Was she poisoned?"" gasped the Countess."
"""Poison is suspected,"" I answered quietly.  ""But calm yourself, madame."
"The truth will be discovered in due course."""
"""I care nothing so long as Yolande is given back to me!"" the distressed"
"woman cried.  ""Was it your English friend who discovered the truth?"""
"""Yes,"" I replied.  ""He is one of the cleverest men in Paris."""
"""And to him my poor Yolande will owe her life?"""
"""Yes, to him."""
"""And to you also, m'sieur?  You have done your utmost for us, and I"
"thank you warmly for it all."""
"""Madame,"" I said earnestly, ""I have done only what a man should do.  You"
"sought my assistance, and I have given it, because--"""
"""Because of what?"" she inquired sharply the instant I paused."
"""Because I once loved her,"" I responded with perfect frankness."
that you hated me. You have been playing a part throughout. You loathe
"me. Yes, madam, you may wince,' he continued bitterly, 'for you shall"
still be my wife; and when you are my wife we will talk of that.'
"'Never!' she said, with a brave face; but her heart beat wildly, and a"
mist rose before her eyes.
"He laughed. 'My legions are round me,' he said. 'Where are yours?'"
"'You are a gentleman,' she answered with an effort. 'You will let me"
go.'
'If I do not?'
'There are those who will know how to avenge me.'
"He laughed again. 'I do not know them, Countess,' he said"
"contemptuously. 'For Hesse Cassel, he has his hands full at Nuremberg,"
"and will be likely, when Wallenstein has done with him, to need help"
himself. The King of Sweden--the brightest morning ends soonest in
"rain--and he will end at Nuremberg. Bernhard of Weimar, Leuchtenstein,"
all the fanatics fall with him. Only the banner of the Free Companies
"stands and waves ever the wider. Be advised,' he continued grimly."
"'Bend, Countess, or I have the means to break you.'"
'Never!' she said.
"'So you say now,' he answered slowly. 'You will not say so in five"
"minutes. If you care nothing for yourself, have a care for your"
friends.'
"'You said I had none,' she retorted hoarsely."
“And there are superior things which are good for nothing.”
"“Will you come and take a drive with me, philosopher brother?”"
“Where?”
“Let’s go to the Villa Borghese. The carriage will be here in a moment.”
“All right. Let us go there.”
"A two-horse victoria with rubber tires was waiting at the door, and"
"Laura and Cæsar got in. The carriage went past the Treasury, and out"
"the Porta Salaria, and entered the gardens of the Villa Borghese."
The morning had been rainy; the ground was damp; the wind waved the
tree-tops gently and caused a murmur like the tide. The carriage rolled
slowly along the avenues. Laura was very gay and chatty. Cæsar listened
to her as one listens to a bird warbling.
Many times while listening he thought: “What is there inside this head?
"What is the master idea of her life? Has she really any idea about life,"
or has she none?”
After several rounds they crossed the viaduct that unites the Villa
Borghese with the Pincio gardens.
_FROM THE PINCIO TERRACE_
They approached the great terrace of the gardens by an avenue that has
busts of celebrated men along both sides.
"Cap'n Davies lifted the box. ""It's pretty big to be diamonds but it"
looks suspicious like! And you're sure it wasn't there before? That it
"ain't the property of that summer boarder of Miss Green's?"""
"Sidney's face was flaming with excitement. ""Oh, I'm _sure_! The other"
stuff was there but there wasn't any box under it. If I hadn't been so
excited listening I'd have realized I was sitting on something
"different. Can't we look inside?"""
"""We won't take the time to look at anything now, mate. We'll get"
ashore. I reckon by this time there are folks strainin' their eyes for
"a sight o' you--"""
He fairly pushed Sidney and Mart ahead of him and toward the _Sally_.
"Saunders lifted the girls into the smaller boat, then took the box."
"""To Rockman's. Quick as you can make it,"" snapped Cap'n Phin."
CHAPTER XXII
"""YOU NEED A BIG BROTHER"""
Aunt Achsa had not slept through the storm. Accustomed though she was
"to the howl of the wind and the roar of the pounding surf, tonight it"
filled her heart with dread. Lavender had not come home.
Twice during the night hours she crept to the door of his small room
"""No, it is not.  It has been destroyed."""
"""Why?""  I asked."
"""For some mysterious reason known to Yolande.""  Then, turning quickly"
"again to me, she placed her hand upon my arm in deep earnestness,"
"saying: ""Tell me, is your love for her absolutely and entirely dead--so"
"dead that you would not care to perform her a service?"""
Anderson's strange and startling story flashed through my mind.  I made
no reply.
"""Remember the affection you once bore her,"" she urged.  ""I am a woman,"
"m'sieur, and I presume to remind you of it."""
I needed no reminder.  The recollection of those sweet idyllic days was
still fresh as ever in my memory.  Ah! in those brief sunny hours I had
fondly believed that our love would last always.  It is ever the same.
Youth is ever foolish.
"""I should have loved her now,"" I answered at last, ""were it not for one"
"fact."""
"There was a mystery which had ended our love, and I saw now an"
"opportunity of clearing it up.  ""To what fact do you refer?"""
"""To the reason of our parting."""
"""The reason!"" echoed the Countess.  ""I have no idea whatever of the"
"reason.  What was it?"""
I held my breath.  Would it be just to tell her the truth?  I wondered.

"As Noll, reaching the bottom step, fumbled at the door that led into"
"the tavern of _The Golden Sun_, a young woman in black came languidly"
"down the stairs, and he held the door open for her to pass in."
The light fell on the delicate features of Madelaine. She smiled with
"pleasure, seeing him."
They entered and stood together--a song was being sung--and as the last
"chords were struck, she slipped her hand within his arm; and he left"
it there. She shared the cordial greeting that Noll received from the
faded poets and frequenters of the place. She was very beautiful--but
her face pathetically pale. Noll noticed a dizzy tendency to cling to
"his arm, as though she feared to fall. He found a table, and made her"
sit down beside him.
"“Madelaine,” said he--“you look as if you wanted food.”"
She sighed sadly:
"“Ah, yes--for years,” she said."
He called for a drink and some biscuits for her; and whilst they were
"being brought, he asked her:"
"“What became of you, Madelaine--after the old widow Snacheur was"
killed?”
She sighed sadly:

"The girls surged forward when they saw him, scattering the crew to one"
side. They were like a school of sharks that had just caught sight of a
dying whale.

"""Men like that are worth the mileage!"""

Sis had been let go. She grabbed my free hand and pulled me away. She
"was trying to look only annoyed, but her eyes had bright little bubbles"
of fury popping in them.
"""The cheap extroverts! And they call themselves responsible women!"""
"I was angry, too. And I let her know, once we were in our cabin."
"""What about that promise, Sis? You said you wouldn't turn him in. You"
"_promised_!"""
She stopped walking around the room as if she had been expecting to get
"to Venus on foot. ""I know I did, Ferdinand, but he forced me."""
"""My name is Ford and I don't understand."""
"""Your name is Ferdinand and stop trying to act forcefully like a girl."
"It doesn't become you. In just a few days, you'll forget all this and"
"be your simple, carefree self again. I really truly meant to keep my"
"word. From what you'd told me, Mr. Brown seemed to be a fundamentally"
decent chap despite his barbaric notions on equality between the
"""Less of your lip, now!"" snarled the old man. ""And _don't_ keep on"
"saying that. Just take it from me again, both of you, that you'd better"
"not be so slow again in telling me--"""
"""You didn't give me time,"" Mr. Jobling protested."
"Slyne opened the door. ""Come on,"" he urged. ""You've got to get your kit"
"packed, Jobling. We'll be leaving before very long now."""
"""Have you made up your mind to come with us, Dove?"""
"Captain Dove nodded, most emphatically. ""I'll send word to Brasse and Da"
"Costa at once,"" he remarked, ""and then I'll be ready to start whenever"
"you are."""
"He left the room after Mr. Jobling, and Slyne, in the doorway, looked"
"back at Sallie, the reassuring smile on his lips belied by his cold,"
calculating eyes.
"""And how about you, Sallie?"" he asked. ""Have you made up your mind? Are"
you satisfied--so far? Or--would you rather go back to the _Olive
Branch_?
"""If you would--I'll let you off your promise, even now! And don't forget"
"that this will be your last chance to recall it."""
"""You know I can't go back to the _Olive Branch_, Jasper,"" she answered"
"slowly. ""But--"""
"He did not give her time to say more. ""That's settled for good, then,"""
"he asserted. ""Your promise stands, and I know you'll keep it when the"

"""Then take it out,"" Vera commanded. ""We are running out of time."""
"You've got that right, lady, Vance thought. Three men were just killed."
That personal Boeing of Tanzan Mino's better be warming up its Pratt &
Whitney's right now. London's about to get too hot for you.
One of the _kobun  _withdrew the Zenith. He placed it on the mahogany
"table, then unlatched the top and lifted it up, only to stare at the"
"blank gray screen, unsure what he was supposed to do next."
"Vera knew. She reached for the switch on the side and clicked it on,"
then stood back and turned to Eva.

“Yes.”

"“I am glad, because you have such a pitiable air when you are sad. Would"
"you like to go to the Priory of Malta, which is only a step from here?”"
“Good.”
They went down in the carriage to the Priory of Malta. They knocked at
"the gate and a woman came out who knew Kennedy, and who told them to"
wait a moment and she would open the church.
"“Here,” said Kennedy, “you have all that remains of the famous Order of"
Saint John of Jerusalem. That anti-historic man Bonaparte rooted it
"out of Malta. The Order attempted to establish itself in Catania, and"
"afterwards at Ferrara, and finally took refuge here. Now it has no"

"""Hark,"" cried Mart, suddenly leaning forward. ""Don't you hear"
"something? Girls, that's a motor boat! I _know_! Quick. Let's signal!"
"Yell! Wave something! _Anything!_"" She sprang to her feet, leaning her"
body against the rail for support as the boat rolled in the heavy sea.
"She cupped her hands to her lips and shouted lustily. ""Come on, girls!"""
she commanded.
"""Maybe it's the pirates,"" wailed Pola."
"""I don't care if it is! I don't care _what_ it is!"" And Mart and Sidney"
lifted their chorus.
"Out of the mist that lay over the surging water a small, gray object"
gradually shaped. The chug-chug of an engine now came distinctly to
their ears. After a little they could make out the forms of two men
standing. And then someone shouted faintly.
"Pola, a solemn happiness transfiguring her face, clung to Sidney."
"""Girls,"" she whispered, ""We're going to be saved! And I'll never forget"
this night--never. Or you two. Or what you've done! Or what you _are_.

Sidney had some solemn resolutions of her own shaping in her heart but
the moment gave her no time to pronounce them.

"“All we know about it is that they’re not here,” replied Jimmie."
"“There are altogether too many bears in this forest,” suggested Gilroy."
“The lads may have encountered some of them.”
“That’s a fact!” laughed Jimmie. “Perhaps we’d better go out and see if
we can find a group of pine trees bearing a mess of Boy Scouts.”
"“This is a serious matter,” Ned interrupted. “Judging from our own"
"experiences, the boys may be having a bad time of it.”"
“The outlaws are none too good to commit murder!” Jimmie asserted.
CHAPTER XI
THE DEVIL’S PUNCH BOWL
"“See here, boys,” Frank Shaw suggested, as the three boys moved on"
"through the forest, almost entirely surrounded by repulsive half-breeds,"
"“this will be a fine story for Dad’s newspaper. ‘Captured by Bold, Bad"
"Men; or, Why Little Frankie Didn’t Get Home to His Beans’! That would be"
"a fine title for the story, and I’ll ask Dad to print a picture of three"
boys wandering through a jungle surrounded by a bunch of cheap skates
that no decent dog would bark at.”
“Keep still!” whispered Harry. “What’s the use of stirring these people
up? We’re in no shape to scrap with them!”
"“I wanted to tell you about it, that 's all,” said Risca. “I made up my"
mind this afternoon. The only thing is what the deuce am I to do with a
child of fifteen in Fenton Square?”
“Is she pretty?”
"“Lord, no. Coarse, undersized little cockney, ugly as sin.”"
"“Anyhow,” said Herold, extinguishing his cigarette in the ash-tray,"
"“it's out of the question.” He rose from his chair. “Look here,” he"
"cried with an air of inspiration, “why not send her down to The Channel"
House?”
“I'm not going to shift responsibilities on to other people's
"shoulders,” John growled in his obstinate way. “This child 's my"
"responsibility. I 'm going to see her through somehow. As to Southcliff,"
"you must be crazy to suggest it. What's to prevent her, one fine"
"day, from getting into Stella's room and talking? My God! it would be"
appalling!”
Herold agreed. He had spoken thoughtlessly.
"“I should just think so,” said Risca. “The idea of such a tale of horror"
being told in that room--”
"The dresser entered. “Miss Mercier has just gone on, sir.”"
"“Well, just think out something else till I come back,” said Herold. “At"
"any rate, Fenton Square won't do.”"
He left John to smoke and meditate among the clothes hanging up on pegs
"Andrews said scornfully, ""Without a doubt, a man of your age and build"
"could wipe up the lifeship with me."""
"Norton chuckled. ""Don't count on your age being good protection,"

"decrepit old man who has to buy what your physique can't get you."""
"""Now see here!"" roared Andrews."
*       *       *       *       *
He was stopped short by Norton who took one long step forward to grasp
"him by the coat lapels. Andrews' face went white, because he was"
looking into the face of dark anger. Norton's other hand was clenched
"in a large, tight fist. He eyed the older man sourly for a minute, then"
shoved him backward to collapse in a chair.
"""What are you trying to do?"" sneered Norton. ""Make me mad enough to"
clip you so you can yell 'Foul!'? I know as well as you do that the law
doesn't even recognize taunts and tongue-lashings as contributory to
"assault."""
"Alice got up from her couch and stood between them. ""Stop it, both of"
"you!"" she cried. ""Stop it!"""
"Norton's anger subsided. ""All right,"" he said to Andrews. ""Now that"
"we've all had our lungs exercised, I'll go below and pedal that"
"generator. Alice, you can have the bathroom first. Andrews, you take it"
"with what she leaves. Is that okay?"""
"""Aren't you the hard-working little Boy Scout?"""
"“You are bothering me and preventing me from drinking my coffee,” he"
"said, with exquisite politeness, and touched the bell."
"“Be careful!” exclaimed the monk, seizing Cæsar’s arm with violence."
"“Don’t you touch me again,” said Cæsar, pulling away violently, his"
"face pale and his eyes flashing. “If you do, I have a revolver here with"
"five chambers, and I shall take pleasure in emptying them one by one,"
"taking that lighthouse you carry about for a nose, as my target.”"
“Fire it if you dare.”
Fortunately the waiter had come in on hearing the bell.
"“Do you wish anything, sir?” he asked."
"“Yes, please escort this clerical gentleman to the door, and tell him on"
the way not to come back here.”
Days later Cæsar found out that there had been a great disturbance at
the Altemps palace in consequence of the calls he had made. Preciozi
"had been punished and sent away from Rome, and the various Spanish"
monasteries and colleges warned not to receive Cæsar.

announced:

CHAPTER XV
THE LAW--AND THE PROFITS
Sallie saw how Jasper Slyne's face blanched at sight of that very
"untimely intruder, whose keen eyes seemed to take in the situation there"
at a glance.
"Mr. Jobling had fallen backward into a convenient armchair and, with"
"both hands clapped to his nose, was moaning most piteously. Captain Dove"
"was standing over him, with features inflamed, in a very bellicose"
"posture and glaring at the new-comer, toward whom Slyne had turned"
inquiringly.
"""You're--looking for some one, M. Dubois?"" Slyne asked, in a tone of"
"polite surprise, which, Sallie knew, was assumed."
"""A thousand pardons,"" returned that individual. ""I am indeed looking for"
"some one--whom I thought to find here. I had no intention, however, of"
"intruding upon a lady--"" He bowed profusely to Sallie. ""It may be,"" he"
"suggested, ""that I have mistaken the number. Is not this the suite 161?"""
"""One hundred and sixty,"" Slyne told him, and evidently did not think it"
"formidable in small operations. He kept his cab at the door, rang, and"
"asked for Gyp, with a kind of pleasure in his ruse."
"""She's not in yet, sir.  Mr. Fiorsen's in."""
"""Ah!  And baby?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""I'll come in and see her.  In the garden?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""Dogs there, too?"""
"""Yes, sir.  And will you have tea, please, sir?"""
"""No, thanks.""  How to effect this withdrawal without causing gossip, and"
"yet avoid suspicion of collusion with Gyp?  And he added: ""Unless Mrs."
"Fiorsen comes in."""
"Passing out into the garden, he became aware that Fiorsen was at the"
"dining-room window watching him, and decided to make no sign that he knew"
"this.  The baby was under the trees at the far end, and the dogs came"
rushing thence with a fury which lasted till they came within scent of
"him.  Winton went leisurely up to the perambulator, and, saluting Betty,"
"looked down at his grandchild. She lay under an awning of muslin, for"
"fear of flies, and was awake.  Her solemn, large brown eyes, already like"
"Gyp's, regarded him with gravity.  Clucking to her once or twice, as is"
"the custom, he moved so as to face the house.  In this position, he had"
Betty with her back to it.  And he said quietly:
everything home. And the car's broken down and goodness knows how long
"we'll have to stay."""
"""Pola!"" Her mother called sharply."
"Pola waved her hand toward her mother. ""Yes, mamma!"" Then, to Sidney,"
"""Isn't it simply rare our meeting like this? It shows how small the"
"world is. I must run now! By-by!"" She gave the slightest flip of her"
"hand in sign of leave-taking and, turning, ran lightly up the wharf"
toward her mother.
"Sidney's eyes followed her, devouring her dainty clothes, the"
"tight-fitting motoring hat, the buckled pumps. Pola--the Pola she had"
"carried enshrined in her heart! That heart hurt now, to the core. She"
"had dreamed of a meeting sometime, somewhere, had planned just what it"
would be like and what she'd say and what Pola would say. And now Pola
had turned a shoulder upon it.
Mart's laugh behind her roused her.
"""Who's Guinevere, anyway? Her ma called her just in time--we might a"
"hurt the doll-baby!"""
"Sidney turned on Mart fiercely. ""She's a friend of mine,"" she cried, in"
"a voice she made rough to keep the tears from it. ""And she's _not_ a"
"doll-baby."""
"""All right--go and play with her then--she's crazy about you, I guess."""
"And with that Mart swung on her heel and stalked away, her head in the"
air.
Poor Sidney hurried back to Sunset Lane to hide her humiliation and her
with uneasy feet on the lopsided deck.
"""They're standin' upon the 'ill as thick as pea-sticks,"" said one of"
the boys.
"""Speak hup,"" roared the skipper."
The crew shoved old Mac in front.
"""We've revolved the notion up and over,"" said Mac, ""and we've come to"
"the conclusion, sir, there ain't nothin' to be got by sendin'"
"ignorant men like we on such errands."""
The skipper hiccupped angrily.
"""Who asted you to think?  But I ain't the man to press unwilling"
"lubbers into goin' aloft, _I_ can lead the way.  Go into the"
"fo'castle, you dogs, and consider yourselves under arrest.  Go!"""
"""Blimy,"" said the crowd, ""but we're all in our own custody, so we"
"are.  Now what's the old man goin' to do?"""
They watched him from the fo'castle as he staggered into his own part
of the ship.
"""I'll be my own hambassador,"" said Jones.  ""I'll show 'em 'ow to work"
things with dignity; I'll show that ass Lampert what's o'clock.  What
"you wants in such cases made and provided is tact, and go, and"
innerds.  Innerds is the chief need.  Why fight if palaver'll do?
Where I was wrong was to send a galoot like Simcox.  But what could I
"do but work the best with the tools I 'ad?  If I'd gone myself, we'd"
"'ave made peace afore there was a row."""
"Brand laughed. ""Try and get you out of it! I know your attitude toward"
"a real jaunt. And it's a real jaunt we've got ahead of us, too, old"
"boy. We're going to the red spot. Immediately."""
*       *       *       *       *
"Dex's sandy eyebrows shot up. ""The red spot! That's where Coblenz and"
"Heiroy were lost!"""
"""And Journeyman,"" added Brand. ""He's the latest victim of whatever's"
"in the hell-hole."""
"Dex whistled. ""Journeyman too! Well, all I've got to say is that"
whatever's there must be strong medicine. Journeyman was a damn fine
"man, and as brave as they come. Have you any idea what it's all"
"about?"""
"""Not an idea. Nobody has. We're to go and find out--if we can. Are you"
"all ready?"""
"""All ready,"" said Dex."
"""So am I. We'll start at eleven o'clock in one of the Old Man's best"
"cruisers. Meanwhile, we might as well go and hunt up a dinner"
"somewhere, to fortify us against the synthetic pork chops and bread"
"we'll be swallowing for the next fortnight."""
They went out; and at ten minutes of eleven reported at the great
"space ship hangars north of New York, with their luggage, a"
conspicuous item of which was a chess board to help while away the
"long, long days of spacial travel. Brand then paused a little while"

_The Red Spot_
"[Sidenote: What is the mystery centered in Jupiter's famous ""Red"
"Spot""? Two fighting Earthmen, caught by the ""Pipe-men"" like their"
"vanished comrades, soon find out.]"
"Commander Stone, grizzled chief of the Planetary Exploration Forces,"
acknowledged Captain Brand Bowen's salute and beckoned him to take a
seat.
"Brand, youngest officer of the division to wear the triple-V for"
"distinguished service, sat down and stared curiously at his superior."
He hadn't the remotest idea why he had been recalled from leave: but
that it was on a matter of some importance he was sure. He hunched his
big shoulders and awaited orders.
"""Captain Bowen,"" said Stone. ""I want you to go to Jupiter as soon as"
"you can arrange to do so, fly low over the red area in the southern"
"hemisphere, and come back here with some sort of report as to what's"
"wrong with that infernal death spot."""
He tapped his radio stylus thoughtfully against the edge of his desk.
"""As you perhaps know, I detailed a ship to explore the red spot about"

"""Yes--yes, we will make love--"""
"The ring of the doorbell was like thunder in the room. Dennis tensed,"
"his eyes widened, and he got to his feet and stood swaying. Looking up"
"at him, Rhoda saw a trapped animal, but the excitement was still there"
and she wanted to take him in her arms and hold him and protect him from
the world.
But he had forgotten her. A cunning sneer took the place of the
slavering animal look and he ran to the kitchen to reappear moments
later with a butcher knife in his hand.
"The bell rang again. Dennis snarled at the door and, in some kind of"

"“Yes, an unhappy disposition; good, awfully good; but very"

The great eurypterids--some of which were five or six feet in
length--and the cephalopods were still masters of the seas. Fishes
were as yet few and small; trilobites and graptolites had now
passed their prime and had diminished greatly in numbers.
Scorpions are found in this period both in Europe and in America.
"The limestone-making seas of the Silurian swarmed with corals,"
"crinoids, and brachiopods."
With the end of the Silurian period the AGE OF INVERTEBRATES comes
"to a close, giving place to the Devonian, the AGE OF FISHES."
CHAPTER XVIII
THE DEVONIAN
In America the Silurian is not separated from the Devonian by any
mountain-making deformation or continental uplift. The one period
passed quietly into the other. Their conformable systems are so
"closely related, and the change in their faunas is so gradual,"
that geologists are not agreed as to the precise horizon which
divides them.

in New York and southward by the following five series. We add the
rocks of which they are chiefly composed.

building a new life. He didn't care if all hell was about to break
loose.

"He was feeling nervous, which was unusual and he didn't like it."
"Whenever he got that way, things always started going off the track."
"They were now in the paneled elevator, heading up to the sixth floor of"
the Moscow Narodny Bank. The hundred million had been held overnight in
"the vault of Victoria Courier Service Limited, which was scheduled to"
deliver the satchels this morning at ten-thirty sharp. The location for
"the delivery, however, was known only to him and to Michael Vance. He"
wanted to be sure and arrive there ahead of the money. He also would
have much preferred being without the company of Vera Karanova.
One thing you had to say for Michael: He'd arranged the deal with great
finesse. He didn't trust anybody. Until he notified Victoria Courier
"this morning, nobody knew where the money would be taken, not even the"
"Japanese banker Nogami. Still, the instruments were negotiable, leaving"
the possibility of trouble if the timing went sour.
“Then it was sent up by this crooked messenger boy with the intention of
"getting us out to look for you. He believed, of course, that we would"
regard the call for help as coming from you and rush away from camp.”
"“Don’t be too sure of that,” warned Ned. “There’s something about that"
"boy I rather like. Besides, he really is a member of the Wolf Patrol,"
New York.”
“My own patrol?” exclaimed Jimmie. “I never saw him at the club room. He
"told me that he belonged to the Wolf Patrol, but I didn’t believe it. I"
think he’s a fake.”
"“Time alone will tell,” answered Ned. “I’m going to believe in the boy"
until I get some positive proof that he really is crooked.”
Jimmie was about to continue the argument when a succession of shrieks
and calls for help came from the forest on the slope below.
"“Now, what’s that?” demanded Jimmie. “That isn’t any of our boys!”"
“Help! Help! Help!” cried the voice.
"“No,” Ned agreed, “our boys don’t make a racket like that.”"
"“Say!” Jimmie shouted, springing to his feet. “I bet you the next dollar"
"I don’t find that that’s the fat clerk, Gilroy!”"
"“The voice sounds like that of a fat man,” Ned laughed."
“Gilroy’s fat all right!” Jimmie exclaimed. “He’s got one of those pink
baby faces that make you hungry to look at. He makes me think of a roast

"""The regiment will do for the beggars all right. They didn't expect us"
"so soon, I fancy. Just listen! I believe I've frightened them away"
"already. There isn't a sound."""
"Colonel Carmichael lifted his head. True enough, no living thing"
"seemed to move. A profound hush hung in the air, broken only by Mrs."
Cary's pitiful meanings.
"""Oh, Beatrice, Beatrice, where are you?"""
Geoffries turned his stained face to the Colonel's.
"""Beatrice! That's Miss Cary, isn't it? Anything happened to her?"""
Colonel Carmichael shrugged his shoulders with the impatience of a man
whose nerves are overstrained by anxiety.
"""I don't know--we've lost her,"" he said. ""We must do something at"
"once. Heaven alone knows what has happened."""
No one indeed knew what had happened--not even the lonely man who
"waited, revolver in hand, for the final encounter on whose issue hung"
the fortunes of them all.
"Only one knew, and that was Beatrice herself as she stood before the"
"shattered doorway of the Colonel's drawing-room, amidst the debris of"
"wrecked, shot-riddled furniture, face to face with Nehal Singh."
"Perhaps half an hour we waited, still puzzling over the scraps of"
paper. Suddenly I felt a nudge from Kennedy. Antoinette Moulton was
standing in the doorway across the street. Evidently she preferred not
"to ride in her own car, for a moment later she entered a taxicab."
"“Follow that black cab,” said Kennedy to our driver."
"Sure enough, it stopped in front of the Recherche Apartments and Mrs."
Moulton stepped out and almost ran in.
"We waited a moment, then Kennedy followed. The elevator that had taken"
her up had just returned to the ground floor.
"“The same floor again,” remarked Kennedy, jauntily stepping in and"
nodding familiarly to the elevator boy.
"Then he paused suddenly, looked at his watch, fixed his gaze"
"thoughtfully on me an instant, and exclaimed. “By George—no. I can’t go"
"up yet. I clean forgot that engagement at the hotel. One moment, son."
Let us out. We’ll be back again.”
"Considerably mystified, I followed him to the sidewalk."
"“You’re entitled to an explanation,” he laughed catching my bewildered"
look as he opened the cab door. “I didn’t want to go up now while she
"is there, but I wanted to get on good terms with that boy. We’ll wait"
"until she comes down, then go up.”"
“Where?” I asked.
“That’s what I am going through all this elaborate preparation to find
Pangbutt’s handsome studio had been cleared for a reception; and the
"deliberate old butler, throwing open the great folding-doors, walked"
stiffly into the room and glanced an orderly eye round the brilliantly
lighted details in a last complacent survey before the near arrival of
the guests.
"He started at a loud peal of the door-bell, and pulled out his watch:"
“I hope they are arriving early enough!” said he. “It comes of arsking
these here artists to the house.... They’re always hungry and they’re
"always noisy, and they’re always thirsty. Even if I suffered from these"
here afflictions I’d have the manners not to show it.” He shrugged his
shoulders. “I call it letting ourselves down. They don’t even know how
to put on their clothes like Christians.”
"He straddled stiffly out of the room, grumbling and mumbling."
"“Leastwise not like Christians of the Established Church,” he"
growled....
He returned after awhile through the great hollow of the handsome
"doorway, ushering in four guests."
"When they had entered, he said stiffly:"
"“Mr. Pangbutt, I fear, will not be down for several minutes, gentlemen;"
he has only just come in to dress.”
"He drew out his watch from his pocket, and glanced at it aggressively."
"hand to Craig, she added, “Mr. Kennedy, if there is anything I can do"
"to help you, I beg that you will call on me.”"
"“I shall not forget,” he answered, relinquishing the hand reluctantly."
"Then, as she thanked him, and turned again to her guest, he added in a"
"low tone to me, “A remarkable girl, Walter, a girl that can be depended"
on.”
We followed Miss Sears down the hall.
"“Who was that young man in the music room?” asked Kennedy, when we were"
out of earshot.
"“Duncan Baldwin,” she answered. “A friend and bosom companion of"
Reginald.”
"“He seems to think more of Betty than of her brother,” Craig remarked"
dryly.
"Miss Sears smiled. “Sometimes, we think they are secretly engaged,” she"
"returned. We had almost reached the door. “By the way,” she asked"
"anxiously, “do you think there are any precautions that I should take"
for Mrs. Blake—and the rest?”
"“Hardly,” answered Kennedy, after a moment’s consideration, “as long as"
"you have taken none in particular already. Still, I suppose it will do"
no harm to be as antiseptic as possible.”
"“I shall try,” she promised, her face showing that she considered the"
affair now in a much more serious light than she had before our visit.
"“And keep me informed of anything that turns up,” added Kennedy handing"
"in it, to check up on the disappearance of the first. That ship, too,"
never came back. Almost with the second of its arrival at the edge of
the red area all radio communication with it was cut off. It was never
heard from again. Two weeks ago I sent Journeyman there. Now _he_ has
"been swallowed up in a mysterious silence."""
An exclamation burst from Brand's lips. Sub-Commander Journeyman!
"Senior officer under Stone, ablest man in the expeditionary forces,"
and Brand's oldest friend!
"Stone nodded comprehension of the stricken look on Brand's face. ""I"
"know how friendly you two were,"" he said soberly. ""That's why I chose"
"you to go and find out, if you can, what happened to him and the other"
"two ships."""
Brand's chin sank to rest on the stiff high collar of his uniform.
"""Journeyman!"" he mused. ""Why, he was like an older brother to me. And"
"now ... he's gone."""
*       *       *       *       *
There was silence in Commander Stone's sanctum for a time. Then Brand
raised his head.
"""Did you have any radio reports at all from any of the three ships"
"concerning the nature of the red spot?"" he inquired."
"""None that gave definite information,"" replied Stone. ""From each of"
the three ships we received reports right up to the instant when the
red area was approached. From each of the three came a vague
description of the peculiarity of the ground ahead of them: it seems
"Yes, they were all satisfied. The Lieutenant pronounced it ""blendend"""
(dazzling). They had not eaten so much and such good food for months and
"months. Oh it was good to be out of the fighting. Yes, their treatment"
was perfect--except for the thieving. Why were British soldiers allowed
"to steal the buttons, caps, rings, and watches belonging to their"
prisoners?
"A German private, a tall thin man with bushy eyebrows, who had not"
"spoken hitherto, said he didn't mind losing a few buttons--but to rob a"
"man of his marriage ring, that was very mean--eine Gemeinheit--his"
marriage ring had been taken from him: he would have lost anything
"rather than that, for it always reminded him of home."
The boy from East Prussia said he didn't care what they took from him as
long as they didn't take his life. He was safe now and nothing else
mattered. He spoke with a Polish accent.
I asked him what town he came from.
"""Allenstein."""
"""Did you see anything of the Russians in 1914?"""
"""Jawohl""--he had seen plenty of Russian troops. They behaved very well."
"""Die sind besser als die Deutschen--They're better than the Germans...."""
"But the theatre orderly interrupted us and asked us to ""send two or"
"three across."""
I went to the Prep. to see if there were any new arrivals. It was full
once again and the wounded were streaming into the station.
"I nodded ‘That will do’ to the twain, and dismissed them; and, they"
"being dismissed, I whistled long."
Naughty old gentleman!...
The next morning Pa did not return. Mid-day passed. Evening stole
on.... The dusk saw me descend at the doors of the address in St.
John’s Wood from mine hansom cab.

rang.
"‘Sir Pompey Malahide is here,’ said I sternly to the smart maid that"
opened the door.
"‘Yes, sir,’ said she."
"‘I desire to see my father,’ said I, and marched boldly towards the"
furious racket that filled the room near at hand--the paternal roar
"distinctly discernible, bassoonlike as though he cried small coal."
I flung open the door--burst upon the riot----
On the floor lay the Byronic Bartholomew Doome with three children
"rolling over him--three, no less!--another in his arms--Sir Pompey"
"Malahide, my father, on all fours, pretending to be a she-bear, his"
"coat-tails over his head, shaking a footstool in his teeth, and"
growling like an ass in pain--and seated on the immaculate waistcoat of
the dark mysterious Bartholomew the most beautiful young woman I have
ever seen. The din infernal--and Pa the worst part of the din.
of pure knowledge and Christian meekness in a near future speaks from
the preface of Erasmus's edition of the New Testament.
How clear did the future look in those years! In this period Erasmus
"repeatedly reverts to the glad motif of a golden age, which is on the"
point of dawning. Perennial peace is before the door. The highest
"princes of the world, Francis I of France, Charles, King of Spain, Henry"
"VIII of England, and the emperor Maximilian have ensured peace by the"
strongest ties. Uprightness and Christian piety will flourish together
with the revival of letters and the sciences. As at a given signal the
mightiest minds conspire to restore a high standard of culture. We may
"congratulate the age, it will be a golden one."
But Erasmus does not sound this note long. It is heard for the last time
in 1519; after which the dream of universal happiness about to dawn
gives place to the usual complaint about the badness of the times
everywhere.

Vance recognized the sound immediately. It was the harp-like plucking
"of a Japanese _koto_, punctuated by the tinkling of a wind chime."
"Without opening his eyes, he reached out and touched a hard, textured"
"surface. It was, he realized, a straw mat, and from the firmness of the"
weave he knew it was _tatami_. Then he felt the soft cotton of the
padded mat beneath him and guessed he was lying on a futon. The air in
the room was faintly spiced with Mahayana Buddhist temple incense.
"I'm in Japan, he told himself. Or somebody wants me to think I am."
He opened his eyes and found himself looking at a rice-paper lamp on
"the floor next to his futon. Directly behind it, on the left, was a"
"_tokonoma _art alcove, built next to a set of sliding doors. A small,"
round _shoji_ window in the _tokonoma  _shed a mysterious glow on its
"hanging scroll, the painting an ink sketch of a Zen monk fording a"
shallow stream.
Then he noticed an insignia that had been painted on the sliding doors
"with a giant brush. He struggled to focus, and finally grasped that it"
"was the Minoan double ax, logo of the Daedalus Corporation."
Jesus!
"He lay a minute, nursing the ache in his head and trying to remember"
"what had happened. All he could recall was London, money, Eva . . ."

John Dennis showed human surprise as Frank Corson lunged at him. He had
"either been lax in using the controlling power he'd been given, or else"
Frank Corson had an exceptional resistance.
"Dennis released Rhoda, swayed drunkenly under Frank Corson's clumsy"
"football-type tackle, and swung his arm like a pivoting beam. The blow"
"was a lucky one. His fist smashed low on Corson's jaw, numbing the"
nerves of his neck on the left side.
"Corson went down and, as he lay helpless, Dennis kicked him twice--once"
"in the side and once, viciously effectively, in the head. Corson rolled"
over and lay still.
"Dennis looked down at him in a drunken daze. ""They will make an army and"
"bring it here."""
"Rhoda, standing in the center of an emotional maelstrom, watched the"
struggle from the prison of her own horror. At that moment she was
"physically, mentally and spiritually ill; a human being caught in the"
midst of forces beyond her knowledge and control.
"Dennis laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. ""I want to make love."""
"""No--no. Please--"""
The drunkenness ebbed slightly and his eyes emptied. They looked into
Rhoda's. She shivered. He took the neck of her brunch coat in his fist
and jerked downward. She had just come from the shower when she'd first
"opened the door for Frank Corson, and the vicious denuding gesture left"

The manufacturer and his wife got up.
Then the first man from Bergen made another speech.

"The manufacturer stayed with us for the promised three days, and then made"
ready to travel again. His mood never changed; he was contented and
entertaining the whole time. Every evening one whisky and soda was brought
"him--no more. Before their bedtime, his little girls had a wildly"
hilarious half-hour with him. At night a tremendous snoring could be heard
"from his cottage. Before his arrival, the little girls had spent a good"
"deal of time with me, but now they no longer knew I existed, so taken up"
with their father were they. He hung a swing for them between the two
"rowan trees in the field, taking care to pack plenty of rag under the rope"
so as not to injure the tree.
He also had a talk with Paul; there were rumors that he was intending to
"take his money out of the Tore Peak resort. Paul's head was bent now, but"
he seemed even more hurt that the manufacturer should have paid a visit to

"him: 'There's too much in this, Jed, to take any chances.' That's what"
"they said, Sid, and then they went on."""
"""Oh, Lav, they're pirates!"""
"""Well, not exactly pirates, but they're up to _something_ that's sure."
Maybe they're rum-runners. There's a lot of that going on. I thought
"you were crazy, but I guess you weren't."""
Sidney's lips trembled with eagerness. As long as Lavender knew what he
knew she felt that she would be justified in telling him what Cap'n
Davies had told her.
"""It isn't rum--Lav,"" she whispered, ""It's _diamonds_!"""
"""Diamonds! Oh, go on, where did you get that stuff?"""
"""It's diamonds, Lav."" Then Sidney solemnly repeated what the old"
"Captain had told her concerning the letter and the reward. ""He asked me"
"not to tell a soul, but you're different because you know. And he said"
that the reward would be posted everywhere in two weeks at least and
"it's that long now. Everyone will know soon."""

The butler touched him upon his shirt-sleeve in dignified despair:

stiff being out of the room and down the stairs.
"Rippley followed them to the top of the stairs, making up his disguise"
as he went:
"“Look here, boys,” he called down in a hoarse whisper--“if the old"
fool will swear not to move away from the hall door until we release
him you needn’t put him in the cellar.... What?... Eh?... He says he
surrenders? That’s all right then. Now back with you--quick! or the
guests will be here--or Pangbutt himself.”
There was a loud ring at the door-bell.
Rippley skipped back to the cabinet: and from the cabinet he ran to
Andrew Blotte:
"“Blotte, old boy,” said he, pulling a red wig over the gloomy man’s"
head and combing the lank red hair down the sides of his pale
face--“you must look after the cloak-room and change the tickets and
"""It was that fool Rochester who set the rumor afloat."""
"After standing through an awkward minute or two, Castlemain bowed stiffly"
"to the king and the duchess, turned away from our group, and soon left"
the ballroom.
"When Castlemain was gone, we all laughed save the king. Presently he left"
"us, and I saw him beckon Wentworth and Berkeley to his side. I followed"
"him as though going to the other side of the gallery, but walked slowly"
when I approached him and the two worthy villains. I was rewarded by
hearing his Majesty say:--
"""Odds fish! But you made a mess of it! You got the wrong woman! Who in"
"the devil's name did you pick up?"""
"I could not stop to hear the rest of this interesting conversation, but"
"two days later I heard from Rochester, who had it from Wentworth, that"
the following occurred:--
"""We thought we had her,"" answered Berkeley, nodding towards Frances, ""but"
"the woman wore a full vizard and was wrapped in furs to her ears, so that"
"we did not see her face."""
"""Do you suppose we could have made a mistake?"" asked Wentworth."
"""You surely did,"" answered the king. ""She has established an alibi. At"
"what hour did you leave Baynard's Castle?"""
"""Near one o'clock,"" returned Berkeley."
"""One o'clock! She was playing cards with the duchess till four,"""
"exclaimed the king, impatiently. ""You picked up the wrong woman. But"
"""No, by God, you'll not introduce her to the king! I'll explode the whole"
"affair, and Dunkirk may go to the devil before you shall introduce Betty"
"to the king,"" I answered."
"""Yet you are willing that I should meddle in the dangerous affair?"
"Evidently you love her more than you love me?"""
"""Only a few hundred million times more,"" I answered sullenly."
"""Is it that way with you, my dear brother?"" she asked, coming to me as I"
"stood gazing out the window, seeing nothing save Bettina's face. Frances"
"put her hand on my shoulder and said coaxingly: ""Forgive me. No harm"
"shall come to her through me."""
"Of course I was sorry that I had allowed myself to become angry, and at"
once made my apology as well as I could.
"""Let us go to see Betty, anyway,"" said Frances. And I assenting, she went"
"to fetch her cloak, hat, and vizard."
"But when she returned, I had changed my mind and declined to go, telling"
Frances that I must see Bettina no more.
"""Why?"" asked Frances."
"""Because I would not win a love from her which I cannot accept."""
"""Baron Ned, there are few men who would be so considerate."""
"But I required little coaxing, and when Frances had made ready for the"
"journey, I buckled on my sword, which I had left standing in the corner,"
"took my hat from the floor, and started out with her."
"someone looking at her, someone different, and someone smiling."
She sat bolt upright and rubbed her eyes. Then she flung out her arms
with a low glad cry that was half sob.
"""Trude--_Oh, Trude!_"""
"Trude held her long and close, stroking the shorn head, murmuring"
soothing words. Finally Sidney wriggled from her.
"""Have you come to take me home? But how could they send for you so"
"quickly? How long have I been asleep? Oh, Lavender--is he--is he--"""
"""One question at a time, Sid. Lavender is better. He'll be all right,"
"the doctor says, after a good rest. Yes, I think I'd better take you"
"home. No, they did not send for me."" Briefly, as though now that"
"earlier concern was of little consequence, Trude told of the sketch"
that had so bewildered and alarmed her.
"""I couldn't understand,"" she finished."
"""I couldn't either, at first. You see the boarder--the man who has"
boarded here so long and is dreadfully fond of Aunt Achsa wrote that
"letter to me and wrote it _nice_ so as to please her, and, at"
"first--but, oh, Trude, Aunt Achsa _is_ wonderful and so is Lavender,"
"really, truly, even though they are poor--"""
"""Hush, Sidney."" Trude's eyes darkened with feeling. ""You do not have to"
"tell me that. I have learned _that_ in only a few hours. Oh, I have"
"seen straight into souls--those kind men on the street, as concerned as"
"though you belonged to them, and here--Aunt Achsa with her great"
courage and her love. And that Miss Vine--they're so _simple_--and so
Sidney he admired the girl's gameness though he was beginning to wish
they had not let her come.
"""How long do you think we'll have to wait? And what if no one comes?"""
"""We'll have to wait until most morning anyway before the tide is out."
"And if no one comes tonight we'll have to come out again, that's all."
"We're not in this business for any fun!"""
"""Oh--h!"" sighed Pola, clinging closer to Sidney."
The wind howled over their heads with increasing velocity and Sidney
thought involuntarily of the snugness of Miss Letty's buggy. Miss Letty
was probably almost to Truro now. And Aunt Achsa thought she was with
her!
"""Is--is the boat tied tight?"" asked Pola; and Lav assured her that it"
"was. ""The wind could get a lot worse and you'd be as safe out here as"
"in your bed at home."""
"After a long while Mart muttered, ""What's that?"" The others leaned"
forward in the blackness of the cabin. They had all felt rather than
heard a soft thud as though something had touched the side of the boat.
And in a few moments heavy footsteps came straight toward the fo'castle.
"""Oh, will they come _here_?"" breathed Pola, shaking. And for answer"
Sidney caught Pola's arm with a warning clutch.
For an instant it seemed that the footsteps must descend to the cabin.
"But at the companionway they halted. A voice came, heavy and thick."
"""I tell you it ain't safe to take it off now. They got a man on"
out. I have no more idea than you have.”
It could not have been more than twenty minutes later when Mrs. Moulton
"emerged rather hurriedly, and drove away."
While we had been waiting I had observed a man on the other side of the
"street who seemed unduly interested in the Recherche, too, for he had"
"walked up and down the block no less than six times. Kennedy saw him,"
"and as he made no effort to follow Mrs. Moulton, Kennedy did not do so"
either. In fact a little quick glance which she had given at our cab
had raised a fear that she might have discovered that she was being
followed.
Kennedy and I paid off our cabman and sauntered into the Recherche in
the most debonair manner we could assume.
"“Now, son, we’ll go up,” he said to the boy who, remembering us, and"
now not at all clear in his mind that he might not have seen us before
"that, whisked us to the tenth floor."
"“Let me see,” said Kennedy, “it’s number one hundred and—er——”"
"“Three,” prompted the boy."
He pressed the buzzer and a neatly dressed colored maid responded.
"“I had an appointment here with Mrs. Moulton this morning,” remarked"
Kennedy.
"“She has just gone,” replied the maid, off her guard."
"“And was to meet Mr. Schloss here in half an hour,” he added quickly."
interpret it.
"Steve rode by me, and his face too was moody. I suppose that we should"
all of us have thanked God the peril was past. But my lady rode in
another part with Count Leuchtenstein and the Waldgrave; and Steve
"yearned, I fancy, for the old days of trouble and equality, when there"
was no one to come between us.
"I saw Count Hugo that night. He sent for me to his quarters at Hesel,"
and told me frankly that he would have let me go back had he thought
good could come of it.
"'But it would have been looking for a needle in a bundle of hay, my"
"friend,' he continued. 'Tzerclas' men would have picked you up, or the"
"peasants killed you for a soldier, and in a month perhaps the girl"
"would have returned safe and sound, to find you dead.'"
"'My lord!' I cried passionately, 'she saved your child. It was to her"
as her own!'
"'I know it,' he answered with gravity, which of itself rebuked me."
'And where is my child?'
I shook my head.
'Yet I do not give up my work and the task God and the times have
"given me, and go out looking for it!' he answered severely. 'Leaving"
"Scot, and Swede, and Pole, and Switzer to divide my country. For"
"shame! You have your work too, and it lies by your lady's side. See to"
"it that you do it. For the rest I have scouts out, who know the"
country; if I learn anything through them you shall hear it. And now
"of another matter. How long has the Waldgrave been like this, my"
"name is Villiers. Mr. Alwyn is my guest,--but he is at present very"
"much occupied,--and unless your business is extremely urgent..."""
"""Certainly it is urgent""--said the lady decisively.. ""otherwise I"
"should not have come. And so you are NOT Mr. Alwyn! Well, I thought you"
"couldn't be! Now then, will you have the kindness to tell Mr. Alwyn I"
"am here?"""
"By this time Villiers had recovered his customary self-possession, and"
he met her commanding glance with a somewhat defiant coolness.
"""I am not aware to whom I have the honor of speaking,"" he said"
"frigidly. ""Perhaps you will oblige me with your name?"""
"""My name doesn't in the least matter,"" she replied calmly--""though I"
will tell you afterward if you wish. But you don't seem to understand
"I..._I_ am 'Tiger-Lily'!"""
The situation was becoming ludicrous. Villiers felt strongly disposed
to laugh.
"""I'm afraid I am very ignorant!""--he said, with a humorous sparkle in"
"his blue eyes,--""But really I am quite in the dark as to your meaning."
"Will you explain?"""
"The lady's nose grew deeper of tint, and the look she shot at him had"
quite a killing vindictiveness. With evident difficulty she forced a
smile.
"""Oh, you MUST have heard of me!""--she declared, with a ponderous"
"attempt at playfulness--""You read the papers, don't you?"""
Thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the
tribe of the Manhattans.
"The girl, after leaving her entertainer, sped swiftly cross-town until"
"she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east,"
facing on that avenue which is the highway of Mammon and the auxiliary
gods. Here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a
handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously
out the window.
"“Oh, you madcap!” exclaimed the elder girl, when the other entered."
“When will you quit frightening us this way? It is two hours since you
ran out in that rag of an old dress and Marie’s hat. Mamma has been so
"alarmed. She sent Louis in the auto to try to find you. You are a bad,"
thoughtless Puss.”
"The elder girl touched a button, and a maid came in a moment."
"“Marie, tell mamma that Miss Marian has returned.”"
"“Don’t scold, sister. I only ran down to Mme. Theo’s to tell her to use"
mauve insertion instead of pink. My costume and Marie’s hat were just
"what I needed. Every one thought I was a shopgirl, I am sure.”"
"“Dinner is over, dear; you stayed so late.”"
“I know. I slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle. I could not
"walk, so I hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until I was better."
That is why I was so long.”
"The two girls sat in the window seat, looking out at the lights and the"
that did not feel--a happy world!
She had not long to wait before he tapped on the drawing-room window.
She got up from the tea-table to let him in.  Why do faces gazing in
"through glass from darkness always look hungry--searching, appealing for"
what you have and they have not?  And while she was undoing the latch she
thought: 'What am I going to say?  I feel nothing!'  The ardour of his
"gaze, voice, hands seemed to her so false as to be almost comic; even"
more comically false his look of disappointment when she said:
"""Please take care; I'm still brittle!""  Then she sat down again and"
asked:
"""Will you have some tea?"""
"""Tea!  I have you back, and you ask me if I will have tea Gyp!  Do you"
know what I have felt like all this time?  No; you don't know. You know
"nothing of me--do you?"""
A smile of sheer irony formed on her lips--without her knowing it was
there.  She said:
"""Have you had a good time at Count Rosek's?""  And, without her will,"
"against her will, the words slipped out: ""I'm afraid you've missed the"
"music-room!"""
His stare wavered; he began to walk up and down.
"""Missed!  Missed everything!  I have been very miserable, Gyp. You've no"
"idea how miserable.  Yes, miserable, miserable, miserable!""  With each"
"repetition of that word, his voice grew gayer.  And kneeling down in"
"front of her, he stretched his long arms round her till they met behind"
"""Ha, ha, ha, ha!"" laughed the other sprout."
"Yes, truly, they had acquired dashing ways among their sporting"
acquaintances.
"It rained for three weeks; then came two fine days, and then rain again"
"for a fortnight. The sun was not to be seen, the sky was invisible, the"
mountain tops had disappeared; we saw nothing but rain. The roofs at the
Tore Peak resort began to leak more and more.
"The hay that still lay spread on the ground was black and rotting, and the"
stacks had gone moldy.
The cotters had got their hay indoors during the patient spell. They had
"carried it, man, woman, and child, on their backs."
The men from Bergen and Mrs. Brede with her children have left for home.
The little girls curtsied and thanked me for taking them walking in the
hills and telling them stories. The house is empty now. Associate Master
"Höy and Mrs. Molie were the last to go; they left last week, traveling"
"separately, though both were going to the same small town."
He went by way of the village--a very roundabout route--while she crossed
"the field. It is very quiet now, but Miss Torsen is still here."
Why do I not leave? Don't know. Why ask? I'm here. Have you ever heard
"anyone ask: ""How much is a northern light?"" Hold your tongue."
Where should I go if I did leave? Do you imagine I want to go to the town
"again? Or do you think I'm longing for my old hut and the winter, and"
Madame? I'm not longing for any specific place; I am simply longing.
"We went down into the road on foot, a little party of nine--four women"
"and five men. The horsemen, as they came up, looked at us in wonder."
"Our clothes, even my lady's, were dyed with mud and torn in a score of"
"places. We had not washed for days, and our faces were lean with"
famine. Some of the women were shoeless and had their hair about their
"ears, while Steve was bare-headed and bare-armed, and looked so huge a"
ruffian the stocks must have yawned for him anywhere. They drew up and
"gazed at us, and then Count Hugo came riding down the column and saw"
us.
"My lady went forward a step. 'Count Leuchtenstein,' she said, her"
"voice breaking; she had only seen him once, and then under the mask of"
"a plain name. But he was safety, honour, life now, and I think that"
she could have kissed him. I think for a little she could have fallen
into his arms.
"'Countess!' he said, as he sprang from his horse in wonder. 'Is it"
really you? Gott im Himmel! These are strange times. Waldgrave! Your
pardon. Ach! Have you come on foot?'
"'Not I. But these brave men have,' my lady answered, tears in her"
voice.
He looked at Steve and grunted. Then he looked at me and his eyes
lightened. 'Are these all your party?' he said hurriedly.
"'All,' my lady answered in a low voice. He did not ask farther, but he"
"sighed, and I knew that he had looked for his child. 'I came north"
"upon a reconnaissance, and was about to turn,' he said. 'I am thankful"
that I did not turn before. Is Tzerclas in pursuit of you?'
"mother used to, and lifted her eyes... Oh, _madam_!"
"When Harry came I had his letters all ready, and the ring and a ducky"
"little brooch he’d given me—a silver bird it was, with a chain in its"
"beak, and on the end of the chain a heart with a dagger. Quite the"
thing! I opened the door to him. I never gave him time for a word.
"“There you are,” I said. “Take them all back,” I said, “it’s all over."
"I’m not going to marry you,” I said, “I can’t leave my lady.” White! he"
"turned as white as a woman. I had to slam the door, and there I stood,"
"all of a tremble, till I knew he had gone. When I opened the"
"door—believe me or not, madam—that man _was_ gone! I ran out into the"
"road just as I was, in my apron and my house-shoes, and there I stayed"
in the middle of the road... staring. People must have laughed if they
saw me....
... Goodness gracious!—What’s that? It’s the clock striking! And here
"I’ve been keeping you awake. Oh, madam, you ought to have stopped"
"me.... Can I tuck in your feet? I always tuck in my lady’s feet, every"
"night, just the same. And she says, “Good night, Ellen. Sleep sound and"
"wake early!” I don’t know what I should do if she didn’t say that, now."
"... Oh dear, I sometimes think... whatever should I do if anything were"
"to.... But, there, thinking’s no good to anyone—is it, madam? Thinking"
won’t help. Not that I do it often. And if ever I do I pull myself up
"sharp, “Now, then, Ellen. At it again—you silly girl! If you can’t find"
anything better to do than to start thinking!...”
rallied a little.
"""Who has told you this lie?"" he exclaimed, with a kind of indignation."
"""A man who does not make mistakes--or tell lies--Sergeant Cardono!"" said"
"Rollo. ""He has both seen and spoken to her! She has sworn to attack the"
"palace to-night."""
"""Then I am as good as dead already. I must go directly to my wife!"""
answered Muñoz.
But Rollo stepped before him.
"""Not without carrying an armful of these to where they will be of use,"""
"he said, pointing to the guns. And the Duke of Rianzares, without any"
"further demur, did his will. Rollo in turn took as many as he could"
"carry, and the Sergeant brought up the rear carrying a wooden box of"
"cartridges, which had evidently been packed ready for transportation."
"They returned to the large lighted room, where Mortimer, Etienne, and El"
Sarria had been left on guard. Concha and the waiting-maid seconded
their efforts by bringing store of pistols and ammunition.
"On their way they passed through a hall, which by day seemed to be"
"lighted only from the roof. Rollo bade them deposit the arms there, and"
bring the other candles and lamps to that place.
"""Every moment that a light is to be seen at an outside window adds to"
"our danger,"" he said, and Concha ran at his bidding."
"Before she had time to return, however, the Queen-Regent came in with"
"her usual dignity, the three serving-men following her. Rollo saw at"
We were in a narrow passage leading to the Stone Gallery in Whitehall. He
"looked about him a moment, then taking me by the arm, led me to the Stone"
"Gallery and thence to the garden. I wanted to stop, but he kept his grasp"
"on my arm, repeating now and then the word ""Come"" in whispers, till we"
"reached a lonely spot in St. James Park. There he halted, and though"
"there was not a living creature in sight, he brought his lips to my ear"
"and breathed the name, ""'Sieur George Hamilton."""
"I tried not to show that I was startled, but the quickwitted, sharp-eyed"
"Frenchman read me as though I were an open book, and grasping my hand,"
cried out:--
"""Ah, I knew you could tell me. It is to rejoice! I knew it!"""
"""Tell you what, count?"" I asked."
"""Tell me where your friend and mine is, or if you will not tell me, take"
"to him a letter. I have been trying to find him this fortnight."""
"""I cannot tell you where he is, my dear count--"""
"""Of course not! I do not ask,"" he interrupted."
"""--But I may be able to forward your letter to him. I heard only the"
"other day that he was in France."""
"""Of course, of course, he is in France! Not in England at all! Good,"
good! I see you are to be trusted. But I must have your word of honor
"that the letter will be delivered."""
"""I shall send it by none but a trusted messenger,"" I answered, ""and shall"
return it to you unopened unless I am convinced beyond a doubt that it
'What is it?' I asked without curiosity.
"'A little boy gave it to me at the door,' he answered. 'I was to ask"
you to be in the street opposite Herr Krapp's half an hour after
sunset this evening.'
I gasped. 'Herr Krapp's!' I exclaimed.
"Steve nodded, looking at me queerly. 'Yes; do you know him?' he said."
"'I do now,' I muttered, gulping down my amazement. But my face was as"
"red as fire, the blood drummed in my ears. I had to turn away to hide"
my emotion. 'What was the boy like?' I asked.
But it seemed that the lad had made off the moment he had done his
"errand, and Steve had not noticed him particularly. 'I called after"
"him to know who sent him,' he added, 'but he had gone too far.'"
"I nodded and mumbled something, and went on into the house. Perhaps I"
"was still a little sore on my girl's account, and resented the easy"
"way in which she had dropped out of others' lives. At any rate, my"
"instinct was to keep the thing to myself. The face at the window, and"
"then this strange assignation, could have only one meaning; but, good"
"or bad, it was for me. And I hugged myself on it, and said nothing"
even to my lady.
"The day seemed long, but at length the evening came, and when the"
"men had gone to drill and the house was quiet, I slipped out. The"
streets were full at this hour of men passing to and fro to their
"drill-stations, and of women who had been out to see the camp, and"
were returning before the gates closed. The bells of many of the
He broke off abruptly as a sound of sliding bolts came from the
"doorway. The two men whirled around to face the door, their fists"
doubling instinctively against whatever new danger might threaten
them.

"The door was opened and two of their ugly, towering enemies came in,"
their tubes held conspicuously before them. Behind came another
"figure; and at sight of this one, so plainly not of the race of"
"Jupiter, the Earthmen gasped with wonder."
"They saw a girl who might have come from Earth, save that she was"
taller than most Earth women--of a regal height that reached only an
inch or two below Brand's own six foot one. She was beautifully
"formed, and had wavy dark hair and clear light blue eyes. A sort of"
"sandal covered each small bare foot; and a gauzy tunic, reaching from"
"above the knee to the shoulder, only half shielded her lovely figure."
She was bearing a metal container in which was a mess of stuff
evidently intended as food. The guards halted and stepped aside to let
"her pass into the room. Then they backed out, constantly keeping Dex"
"and Brand covered with the tubes, and closed and barred the door."
The girl smiled graciously at the admiration in the eyes of both the
men--a message needing no inter-planetary interpretation. She
"advanced, and held the metal container toward them."
"""Eat,"" she said softly. ""It is good food, and life giving."""
*       *       *       *       *
"""Give it here,"" one of the men asked. And as Si handed over the"
contraband it slipped from his hands. He caught at it quickly to save
it from the dirt of the floor. Suddenly something small and gleaming
fell from the folds and rolled upon the floor.
"""I'll be ding-blasted!"" roared Cap'n Phin. Someone swore softly. The"
man Si dropped to his knees. Sidney blinked.
Cap'n Phin seized the silk and unwound it. And among the countless
folds he found a cunningly contrived pocket filled with hundreds of the
priceless gems.
"For a moment no one spoke. The daring of it all, the wealth of the"
"glistening jewels, held each man in the room. Cap'n Phin folded the"
gorgeous silk and passed it to one of the men.
"""I guess this belongs to you in trust for Uncle Sam,"" he said gravely."
"""Our business is with one Jed Starrow."" He turned to Sidney who was"
"trembling violently. ""Now, matie, will you tell these men how you"
"happened to ship aboard the _Arabella_ last night?"""
"Sidney's story tumbled out in quick, eager words and in careful detail."
"The men listened closely. The one who had taken the diamonds ""in trust"
"for Uncle Sam"" made notes in a small black book. When she had finished"
"Cap'n Phin nodded, his face serious."
"""Reckon we'd better not question Lav Green just yet, he's pullin' out"
of the fog. We got enough as 'tis to hold Jed Starrow. If I ain't much
mistaken he'll turn yellow when we face him and squeal on the folks
higher up what's paid him to hurt the name of the Cape. That'll do for
"now, little gal."""
domineeringly:
“Giovanni Battista!”
“What is it?”
"“That’s enough, that’s enough! I can hear you from here.”"
"“That’s my wife,” said Giovanni Battista, “she doesn’t like me to be"
lacking in respect for plaster saints.” “You are a pagan!” screamed the
"old woman. “You shall see, you shall see what will happen to you.”"
"“What do you expect to have happen to me, darling?”"
"“Leave her alone,” exclaimed the elder son, ill at ease; “you always"
have to be making mother fly into a rage.”
"“No, my boy, no; she is the one who makes me fly into a rage.”"
"“Giovanni Battista is used to living among gods,” said Kennedy, “and he"
despises saints.”
"“No, no,” replied the cast-maker; “some saints are all right. If all"
"the churches had figures by Donatello or Robbia, I would go to church"
"oftener; but to go and look at those statues in the Jesuit churches,"
"those figures with their arms spread and their eyes rolling.... Oh, no!"
I cannot look at such things.”
Cæsar could see that Giovanni Battista expressed himself very well;
but that he was not precisely a star when it came to working. After the
"mould for the bas-relief was cleaned and fixed, the cast-maker invited"
Cæsar and Kennedy to have a glass of wine in a wine-shop near by.
"half the listeners, had known the lady as Mrs. Medland."
"""No,"" said Mr. Medland; ""I lost sight of him."""
"""You did not hear from--from any one about him?"""
"""No."""
He gave the dates when he had last seen Benyon in old days. Asked
whether he had communicated with him between that date and the dead
"man's reappearance, he answered,"
"""Once, about four years ago. I wrote to tell him of that lady's death,"""
"and he pointed again to the picture, and went on to tell the details of"
Benyon's subsequent application to him for a post under Government.
"""You refused it?"" he was asked."
"""Yes, I refused it. I spoke to him once again, when we met on a social"
occasion. We had a sort of dispute then. I never saw him again to speak
"to."""
"""It was all done,"" said Mr. Duncombe, describing the scene, ""in a"
repressed way that was very effective--to a house that knew the
circumstances most effective. And the other fellow--Kilshaw--he gave
"some sport too. The coroner (they told me he was one of Medland's men,"
and I noticed he spared Medland all he could) was inclined to be a bit
"down on Kilshaw. Kilshaw was cool and handy in his answers, but, Lord"
love you! his game came out pretty plain. A monkey! You don't give a man
"a monkey unless there's value received! So people saw, and Mr. Kilshaw"
looked a bit uncomfortable when he caught Medland's eye. He looked at
"him like that,"" and Mr. Duncombe assumed the finest wronged-hero glance"

"""She is a lady who has taken a high degree at an English University."
She has been an important person in the English feminist movement.

"At this juncture Vivie entered. ""_Mother_, I hope you haven't"
"missed me, haven't been unwell?"" she said, looking rather"
"questioningly at the little glass of Schnapps, only half of which"
had been drunk.
"""Well yes, dear, I have. _Terrible_ low spirits and all swimmy-like."
Thought I was going to faint. But this man here has been so kind
"""--her tears flowed afresh--""We've bin talking of old times; he used"
"to know me before--"""
"_Vivie_: ""Quite so. But I think, dear, we had better be going back."
I want to talk to you about the new rooms I've seen. Are you equal
to walking? If not perhaps this kind man would try to get us a
"cab...?"""
"But Mrs. Warren said it was no distance, only round the corner, and"
she could well walk. When they got back she would go and lie down.
"Vivie, reading her mother's thoughts, pressed a five-franc note into"
"the gardener's not reluctant palm, and they regained the Rue Royale."
But just as they were passing through the revolving door of the
"Hotel Impérial, a German who had been installed as manager came up"
"with two soldiers and said explosively: ""Heraus! Foutez-nous le"
"camp! Aout you go! Don't show your face here again!"""
"""But,"" said Vivie, ""our notice doesn't expire till the end of this"
"""Now you're talking!"" he retorted approvingly. ""Say what's in your mind,"
"straightforwardly, and we'll soon come to an understanding. Sit down"
"again, you strutting peacock! and tell me what it is you want."""
"Slyne did not sit down again, however; to do so would scarcely have been"
"dignified. He stayed in the doorway, silent, a thin stream of"
"cigarette-smoke slowly filtering from his nostrils. His cold,"
calculating eyes were once more on Captain Dove's. And it was Captain
Dove's would-be mocking glance that at length gave way.
"""You offered to give me Sallie, if I paid you a hundred thousand"
"dollars,"" said Slyne, judicially."
"""To see you safely married to her,"" Captain Dove corrected him."
"Slyne nodded, in grave assent."
"""Well, I'm going to hold you to your offer,"" said he. ""The money's ready"
and waiting for you--just as soon as we can settle a few trifling
"formalities. I have Sallie's promise to marry me--"""
"""The devil you have!"" said Captain Dove, not slow to seize opportunity"
"either. ""I thought I heard her say--"""
"Slyne's face darkened again. ""And, if you'll come ashore with me now,"""
"he went on, controlling his temper, ""I'll prove to you that your money"
"is perfectly safe."""
"Captain Dove lay back in his bunk and laughed, most discordantly. He"
"laughed till his red-rimmed eyes were adrip, while Slyne sat looking at"
"him. He was still laughing when Slyne rose and, flicking the"
"cigarette-end from between two nicotine-stained fingers, began to button"
"""It's more 'n I did,"" returned the Girl, evenly, and bolted the door."
"""Do you think I'd want to shield a man who tried to rob me?"" she asked,"
facing him.
"Ignoring the question, Rance removed the glove of his weaponless hand"
and strode to the curtains that enclosed the Girl's bed and parted them.
When he turned back he was met by a scornful look and the words:
"""So, you doubt me, do you? Well, go on--search the place. But this ends"
your acquaintance with The Polka. Don't you ever speak to me again.
"We're through."""
Suddenly there came a smothered groan from the man in the loft; Rance
"wheeled round quickly and brought up his gun, demanding:"
"""What's that? What's that?"""
Leaning against the bureau the Girl laughed outright and declared that
the Sheriff was becoming as nervous as an old woman. Her ridicule was
"not without its effect, and, presently, Rance uncocked his gun and"
replaced it in its holster. Advancing now to the table where the Girl
"was standing, he took off his cap and shook it before laying it down;"
"then, pointing to the door, his eyes never leaving the Girl's face, he"
went on accusingly:
"""I saw someone standing out there against the snow. I fired. I could"
"have sworn it was a man."""
The Girl winced. But as she stood watching him calmly remove his coat
"and shake it with the air of one determined to make himself at home, she"
cried out tauntingly:
The Uzi. The goddam Uzi. Why hadn't they brought it?
"It was still back in Kensington, where they'd stashed it in the false"
bottom of a new suitcase. But if the _Mino-gumi_ had been searching
"only for a computer, maybe they'd missed it. So Tanzan Mino's hoods"
could still be in for a surprise. Just make an excuse to go back.
"Vera was aware an Uzi had been part of their deal for the limo, but"
"maybe that fact had momentarily slipped her mind, what with all the"
important things she had to think about. Or maybe she'd assumed Alex
"had kept it, or maybe she thought it was still in the car. Whatever she"
"thought, things were moving too fast now."
"""I get the picture,"" he said, rising from his chair. With a"
"carefully feigned nonchalance, he strolled over to the table. ""Guess"
"it's time we got our toothbrushes."""
"""You won't have to bother, Mr. Vance,"" Vera continued. ""Your suitcases"
were sent to the plane an hour ago. We found them conveniently packed.
"Don't worry. Everything has already been taken care of."""
"Okay, scratch the Uzi. Looks like it's now or never. Settle it here."
"He shot a glance at Eva, then at Ken, trying to signal them. They"
"caught it, and they knew. She began strolling in the direction of Vera,"
"who was now standing in the doorway, as though readying to depart."
"""We appreciate the snappy service,"" Vance said. He looked down at the"
"computer, then bent over. When he came up, it was in his right hand,"
"sailing in an arc. He brought it around with all his might, aimed for"
"the nearest Japanese _kobun_. He was on target, catching the man"
CHAPTER XXVII.
THE HOUSE IN THE CHURCHYARD.
The heat which Count Leuchtenstein had thrown into the matter
"surprised me somewhat when I came to think of it, but I was soon to be"
"more surprised. I did not go to my lady at once on coming in, for on"
"the landing the sound of voices and laughter met me, and I learned"
that there were still two or three young officers sitting with her who
had outstayed Count Hugo. I waited until they were gone--clanking and
"jingling down the stairs; and then, about the hour at which I usually"
"went to take orders before retiring, I knocked at the door."
Commonly one of the women opened to me. To-night the door remained
"closed. I waited, knocked again, and then went in. I could see no one,"
"but the lamps were flickering, and I saw that the window was open."
"At that moment, while I stood uncertain, she came in through it; and"
"blinded, I suppose, by the lights, did not see me. For at the first"
"chair she reached just within the window, she sat down suddenly and"
burst into tears!
'Mein Gott!' I cried clumsily. I should have known better; but the
laughter of the young fellows as they trooped down the stairs was
"still in my ears, and I was dumfounded."
"She sprang up on the instant, and glared at me through her tears. 'Who"
are--how dare you? How dare you come into the room without knocking?'
she cried violently.
"'I did knock, my lady,' I stammered, 'asking your pardon.'"
"not a day over forty?"""
"""I have given up wondering where the real Dawson ends and where the"
disguises begin. The man I met up north wasn't the least bit like the
"one down here."""
"""A deal younger, I expect,"" said the chief assistant, grinning. ""He"
shifts about between thirty and sixty. The old man is no end of a
"cure, and tries to take us in the same as he does you. There's an"
"inspector at the Yard who was at school with him down Hampshire way,"
"and ought to know what he is really like, but even he has given Dawson"
up. He says that the old man does not know his own self in the
"looking-glass; and as for Mrs. Dawson, I expect she has to take any"
"one who comes along claiming to be her husband, for she can't,"
"possibly tell t'other from which."""
"""One might make a good story out of that,"" I observed to Cary."
"""I don't understand,"" said he. ""Mr. Dawson told me once that I knew"
"the real Dawson, but that few other people did."""
"""If he told you that,"" calmly observed the assistant, ""you may bet"
"your last shirt he was humbugging you. He couldn't tell the truth, not"
"if he tried ever so."""
"""What is he at now?"" I asked."
"""I don't know, sir. And if he told me, I shouldn't believe him. I"
don't take no account of a word that man says. But he's the most
successful detective we've got in the whole Force. He's sure to be
"head of the C.I.D. one day, and then he will have to stay in his"
"office and give us others a chance."""
"presence, especially as I read he's indisposed, but really I hardly know"
how to bear the situation.  I can't bring myself to think of money in
"relation to that matter; all the same, it's a serious loss to my"
"daughter, very serious loss.  I've got my family pride to think of.  My"
"daughter's name, well--it's my own; and, though I say it, I'm"
"respected--a regular attendant--I think I told you. Sometimes, I assure"
"you, I feel I can't control myself, and it's only that--and you, if I may"
"say so, that keeps me in check."""
"During this speech, his black-gloved hands were clenching and"
"unclenching, and he shifted his broad, shining boots.  Gyp gazed at them,"
not daring to look up at his eyes thus turning and turning from
"Christianity to shekels, from his honour to the world, from his anger to"
herself.  And she said:
"""Please let me do what I ask, Mr. Wagge.  I should be so unhappy if I"
"mightn't do that little something."""
Mr. Wagge blew his nose.
"""It's a delicate matter,"" he said.  ""I don't know where my duty lays.  I"
"don't, reelly."""
Gyp looked up then.
"""The great thing is to save Daisy suffering, isn't it?"""
"Mr. Wagge's face wore for a moment an expression of affront, as if from"
the thought: 'Sufferin'!  You must leave that to her father!' Then it
"wavered; the curious, furtive warmth of the attracted male came for a"
"moment into his little eyes; he averted them, and coughed.  Gyp said"
softly:

Is it possible to have a world without moral values?
"Or does lack of morality become a moral value, also?"
"The first angry rays of the sun--which, startlingly enough, still rose"
in the east at 24 hour intervals--pierced the lacy tops of Atlantic
combers and touched thousands of sleeping Americans with unconscious
"fear, because of their unpleasant similarity to the rays from World War"
III's atomic bombs.
They turned to blood the witch-circle of rusty steel skeletons around
"Inferno in Manhattan. Without comment, they pointed a cosmic finger at"
the tarnished brass plaque commemorating the martyrdom of the Three
Physicists after the dropping of the Hell Bomb. They tenderly touched
the rosy skin and strawberry bruises on the naked shoulders of a
girl sleeping off a drunk on the furry and radiantly heated floor of
"""A friend who knows you both.""  Then she added: ""From my information I"
hear that last season you danced so much with her and were so constantly
"at her side that people were talking of a match between you."""
"""Ridiculous!""  I exclaimed.  ""Of course gossips are always too ready to"
"jump to ill-formed conclusions.  As one of the staff of the Embassy, and"
"her most intimate male friend, it was only courtesy to take her beneath"
"my care.  When she had no other partner and wanted to dance, then she"
"sometimes asked me.  I think she did it to annoy me, for she knew that I"
"was never fond of dancing."""
"""Do you remember the Countess of Flanders' balls at Brussels--how we"
"danced together?"" she remarked."
"""Remember them!""  I echoed.  ""They were in the golden days when"
everything seemed to our eyes couleur de rose--the days when our love
"was perfect."""
"She sighed again, but no word escaped her.  She was, I knew, reflecting"
upon those blissful days and nights when we met here and there at all
"hours and at all the best houses in Brussels, dining, lunching, dancing,"
and gossiping--together always.
"""Will you not resolve to forget the past, Yolande?""  I asked fervently,"
"taking her hand in mine again.  ""Come, tell me that you will--that you"
"will not hold me aloof like this?  I cannot bear it--indeed I can't, for"
"I love you;"" and I bent until my lips touched her finger-tips."
"""I cannot!"" she cried at last, with an effort rising and firmly"
withdrawing her hand from my grasp.
mix the hats.... Ha-ha!” He laughed mock-tragically. “This night must
never be forgotten!”
"“It never will,” said Blotte; and laughing grimly he got striding again"
"in the red wig, as Fluffy Reubens and Doome burst into the room."
"“Here, Fluffy,” said Rippley, “quick, man! put on this yellow wig, and"
"comb it well over your eyes. There isn’t a moment to be lost; Doome,"
here’s a black moustache and a greyish wig--this is the way to stick it
on--see? Splendid! Makes you look like a broken-down Italian tenor.”
He searched about in the cabinet and found a stubbly black wig which he
"pulled over his own hair, and was at once a son of France:"
"“Look here, boys, I’m head-waiter, see! And when I bow, you bow: and"
"when I rub my hands, you rub your hands; and don’t forget the foreign"
"accent--try to talk English as you used to talk French.... Doome, you"
"stand at the landing below, and see that old Dukes don’t stir a step"
"from the door--and bawl up the names from him. And you, Fluffy, play"
the general ass. I’ll stick to the door here.... Are we all right
"now?... No, Blotte’s not enough disguised. Here, Doome, fasten this"
"fierce moustache on his lip, whilst I shut up.... O lor! here they"
come!”
Rippley had scarcely hurried into his coat when there entered and
halted in the great doorway a hesitating figure in the white satin
"dress of a courtier of Charles the First, lace frills at his weak"
"knees, white stockings, white shoes, and holding a plumed hat in his"
hand.
"His eyeglass dropped out of his eye, and he stood there stuttering and"
aghast.
"keeping his eye vigilantly on his fellow guard, who, having seated"
"himself in the window-sill, had dozed off to sleep, the cigarette still"
"drooping from the corner of his mouth. Yes, he was certainly asleep."
"He held out his hand to Etienne, who readily gave him the last he had"
"rolled. The sentry thanked him with a quick martial salute, and after a"
"turn or two more, deftly dropped the crumbled tobacco upon the floor and"
let the leaf drop on Rollo's knees with a stump of pencil rolled up in
it.
"Then the young man, turning his back upon the dozing guard in the stone"
"window-sill, wrote with some difficulty the following note, lying on his"
breast and using the uneven floor of the granary for a desk.
"""Little Concha"" (it ran), ""we are General Cabrera's prisoners."
Bring the papers as soon as you receive this. Otherwise we are
"to be shot at day-break.--ROLLO BLAIR."""
"There was still a little space left upon the leaf of Alcoy paper, and"
"with a half shamefaced glance at El Sarria, he added, ""_And in any case"
"do not wholly forget R. B._"""
"He passed the note to the outlaw, who folded it to the size of a postage"
stamp and apparently gave directions where and to whom it was to be
delivered.
"""In half an hour we shall be relieved and I will go,"" said the Carlist"
"ex-Miguelete, and resumed his steady tramp. Presently he awoke his"
comrade so that he might not be found asleep at the change of guard.
*       *       *       *       *
"wiping it. All the while his eyes were emotionless, betraying no hint"
of what was in his mind.
"After the utensils were ceremonially cleansed, he wordlessly scooped a"
"portion of pale-green powdered tea into the bowl, then lifted a"
dipperful of boiling water from the kettle and poured it in. Finally he
"picked up a bamboo whisk and began to whip the mixture, continuing"
until it had acquired the consistency of green foam.
"Authority, control, and--above all--discipline. Those things, Vance knew,"
"were what this was really about. As was traditional and proper, not a"
"word was spoken. This was the Zen equivalent of High Mass, and Tanzan"
"Mino was silently letting him know he was a true master--of himself, of"
his world.
"Then the _oyabun _reached over and formally presented the bowl, placing"
it on the _tatami  _in front of his guest.
"Vance lifted it up, rotated it a half turn in his hand, and took a"
"reserved sip. As the bitter beverage assaulted his mouth, he found"
himself thinking this was probably intended to be his Last Supper. He
hoped he remembered enough to get the moves right.
"He sipped one more time, then wiped the rim, formally repositioned the"
"bowl on the _tatami_, and leaned back."
"""Perfectly done,"" Tanzan Mino smiled as he broke the silence. ""I'm"
"impressed."" He nodded toward the white bowl. ""Incidentally, you were"
"just handling one of the finest pieces in all Japan."""
"""Shino ware. Mino region, late sixteenth century. Remarkably fine"
"glaze, considering those kilns had just started firing _chawan_."""
Dawson spoke with less than his usual cheery confidence. I fancy that
the thinness and whiteness of his face were not wholly due to
disguise. He had not been to bed since he had been called up in the
"middle watch of the night before last, and the man was worn out."
"""If you take my poor advice, Dawson,"" I said, ""you will cut off now"
and get some sleep. Even your brain cannot work continuously without
"rest. The country needs you at your best, and needs you very badly"
"indeed."""
"His dull, weary eyes lighted as if under the stimulus of champagne,"
and he turned upon me a look which was almost affectionate. I really
"began to believe that Dawson likes me, that he sees in me a kindred"
spirit as patriotically unscrupulous as himself.
"He jumped up and gripped my hand. ""You are right. I will put in a few"
hours' sleep and then to work once more. This time I am up against a
"man who is nearly as smart as I am myself, and I can't afford to carry"
"any handicap."""
"I led him to the door and put him out, and then turned to Cary with a"
"laugh. ""And I, too, will follow Dawson's example. It is past one, and"
"my head is buzzing with queer ideas. Perhaps, after all, the Germans"
"have more imagination than we usually credit them with. I wonder--"""
But I did not tell to Cary what I wondered.
*       *       *       *       *
"We were sitting after breakfast in Cary's study, enjoying the first"
"sweet pipe of the day, when the telephone bell rang. Cary took off the"
earpiece and I listened to a one-sided conversation somewhat as
follows:--
"George would not have sailed without notifying us."""
"""He may have feared to betray himself by writing,"" she suggested, ""since"
"King Charles had asked King Louis to detain him."""
"""That is true,"" I returned. ""But the occasion must have been urgent"
"indeed if he could not have sent us word in some manner."""
"But I could find no comfort for her, for I really believed that George"
"had gone to Canada, and there was a certain relief to me in knowing that"
he had passed out of Frances's life.
After along silence this feeling of relief found unintentional expression
when I said:--
"""Time heals all wounds, Frances. One of these days you will find a man"
"who will make amends for your present loss, and then--"""
"""No, no, Baron Ned. Your words are spoken in kindness, but what you"
suggest is impossible. Perhaps if there had been fewer obstacles between
"us, or if I had not misjudged him so cruelly, I might have found my heart"
"more obedient to my will."""
The only comfort I could give my beautiful cousin was that a letter would
"soon come explaining everything. In default of a letter, I promised to go"
"to Paris and learn the truth from George's friends, if possible."
"Frances did not go back to Whitehall that day, but remained at home,"
pretending to be ill of an ague.
"At the end of a week, Frances not having returned to Whitehall, Sir"
"Richard was honored by a visit from no less a person than the king,"
"Perhaps she had spoiled everything. Pola would come back, of course,"
"but, somehow, Pola's glamour had faded. After all, what, besides tons"
"of candy and quarts of sweet mixtures and much glitter, had there been"
to it? The sweets and the glitter and Pola's endless confidences of
"""men"" had left Sidney jaded and bored, though she did not know it; she"
did know that she was suddenly lonely for Mart and Lav and the
stimulating pastimes they seemed to find always right at hand.
"As she approached Rockman's, wandering there from force of habit, she"
"saw Lav pushing off in a dory. She ran down the wharf, hailing him."
"""Oh, Lav, take me with you!"" she pleaded, breathlessly."
He hesitated a moment before he swung the dory back to the wharf.
Something of the look Mart had given her flashed into his eyes.
"Then: ""Come on if y'want to,"" he answered ungraciously."
As she sat down in the bow of the boat Sidney wanted to cry more than
"anything else, but Lav's dark face suddenly reminded her of what Aunt"
Achsa had told her. Perhaps he had been out in the sand dunes last
"night, lying on his face, sobbing aloud! She began chattering with"
resolute cheerfulness.
"""Isn't it hot this morning, Lav? Where are you going?"" Lav answered"
shortly that he was going out to the _Arabella_. Sidney noticed a book
"in his pocket, but said nothing. She ventured other remarks concerning"
"the activities in the bay to which Lavender answered in monosyllables,"
if at all.
"""Oh, look, the _Puritan's_ in, Lav!"" And even to this Lavender only"
serious and convincing tone that the sergeant's eyes burned with
"curiosity, and, telling him that he would see if the papers were in his"
"desk, he went through the door behind the bar.  Two minutes later he"
"returned with the papers in his hand, and an expression of extreme"
astonishment on his face.
"""Here they are; the deeds about the damned houses!"""
"""Ah!  You ... vagabond!  And you pretend to have been a soldier, too!"""
"And Kuvalda did not cease to belabour him with his tongue, as he"
"snatched the blue parchment from his hands. Then, spreading the papers"
"out in front of him, and excited all the more by Vaviloff's"
"inquisitiveness, the Captain began reading and bellowing at the same"
"time.  At last he got up resolutely, and went to the door, leaving all"
"the papers on the bar, and saying to Vaviloff:"
"""Wait!  Don't lift them!"""
"Vaviloff gathered them up, put them into the cash-box, and locked it,"
"then felt the lock with his hand, to see if it were secure. After that,"
"he scratched his bald head, thoughtfully, and went up on the roof of"
the eating-house.  There he saw the Captain measuring the front of the
"house, and watched him anxiously, as he snapped his fingers, and began"
"measuring the same line over again. Vaviloff's face lit up suddenly,"
and he smiled happily.
"""Aristid Fomich, is it possible?"" he shouted, when the Captain came"
opposite to him.
"""Of course it is possible.  There is more than one short in the front"
"alone, and as to the depth I shall see immediately."""
"Vera Karanova stared at him, her dark eyes flooding with concern. ""But"
"you said the transaction was scheduled for Westminster Union Bank, this"
"morning at ten-thirty."""
"""That was merely a diversion."" Novosty leaned back. ""The actual"
"arrangement is turned around. For security reasons."""
"""I don't like this."" Her displeasure was obvious, and mounting. ""There"
"is no reason--"""
"""It's better, I assure you."" He withdrew a white tin of Balkan Sobranie"
"cigarettes from his coat, snapped it open, and withdrew one. Made of"
"fine Turkish Yenidje tobacco, they were what he always smoked on"
important days. This was an important day.
"As he flicked his lighter and drew in the first lungful of rich smoke,"
he thought about how much he hated the dark-haired woman seated beside
"him, dressed in a gray Armani business suit, sable coat, Cartier"
"jewelry. The bad blood between them traced back over five years, begin-"
ning with a T-Directorate reshuffle in which she'd moved up to the
"number three slot, cutting him out of a well-deserved promotion. The"
rumor going around Dzerzhinsky Square was that she'd done it by making
"the right connections, so to speak. It was the kind of in-house screw-"
"job Alex Novosty didn't soon forget, of forgive."
"Their black limo was now passing the Royal Courts of Justice, on the"
"left, headed onto Fleet Street. Ahead was Cannon Street, which"
intersected the end of Saint Swithins Lane. Just a few blocks more.
"After today, he fully intended never to see her again."
"""We've arranged for the transaction to take place through MNB's bond"
"""Well, show me the girl that would want to go to Heaven alone! I'll sell"
"out the saloon--I'll go anywhere with you, you bet!"""
Johnson bent low over her hand and kissed it. The Girl's straightforward
answer had filled his heart to overflowing with joy.
"""You know what that means, don't you?"" a moment later he asked."
Sudden joy leapt to her blue eyes.
"""Oh, yes,"" she told him with a world of understanding in her voice."
"There was a silence; then she went on reminiscently: ""There's a little"
Spanish Mission church--I pass it 'most every day. I can look in an' see
the light burnin' before the Virgin an' see the saints standin' round
with glassy eyes an' faded satin slippers. An' I often tho't what they'd
"think if I was to walk right in to be made--well, some man's wife. It"
makes your blood like pin-points thinkin' about it. There's somethin'
"kind o' holy about love, ain't they?"""
"Johnson nodded. He had never regarded love in that light before, much"
"less known it. For many moments he stood motionless, a new problem of"
right and wrong throbbing in his bosom.
"At last, it being settled that Johnson was to pass the night in the"
"Girl's cabin, she went over to the bed and, once more, began to make it"
"ready for his occupancy. Meanwhile, Johnson, seated in the barrel rocker"
"before the fire, watched her with a new interest. The Girl had not gone"
"very far with her duties, however, when she suddenly came over to him,"
plumping herself down on the floor at his feet.
"""Say, did you ever ask any other woman to marry you?"" she asked as she"
"tears was ready to accompany her tale of woe, so I said hurriedly: ""Don't"
"cry. Laugh while you speak. You will attract less attention."""
"She tried to laugh, but the effort was piteous and became a failure, as"
she said:--
"""George Hamilton has sailed for Canada, and my heart is broken."""
"Again she tried to smile, but the smile never reached her eyes, for they"
were full of tears.
"""How do you know?"" I asked, almost stunned by the news."
"She tried to stay her tears, but failed, and answered between sobs: ""Last"
"night at the queen's ball, the king showed me a letter sent by order of"
"the French king, saying that George had sailed from Bordeaux for Canada"
"nearly a fortnight ago. I could not help showing my grief, and the king,"
"who was boisterously happy, said: 'Now you will forget him and listen to"
"me.' I smiled, but it was a poor effort, and he smiled, showing his"
yellow fangs as he left me. I pray God that I may never be called upon to
"hate another man as I hate him."""
"""I can hardly believe that George has gone to Canada without notifying"
"us,"" I said."
"""Yes, I fear it is true,"" she returned. ""But if I am ever so fortunate"
"as to find him again, I intend to go with him whether he consents or no,"
regardless of father and all the world. Just as soon as I learn where he
"is in Canada, I will go to him. You will take me, won't you, Baron Ned?"""
"""I'll not give that promise,"" I answered. ""But I am sure there is"
something back of King Louis's letter of which we do not know. Surely
"""showing himself."""
"""Your description of her does not strike me as particularly"
"attractive,""--he said--""I cannot endure that nineteenth-century"
"hermaphroditic production, a mannish woman."""
"""Oh but she isn't altogether mannish,""--declared Villiers, . ."
"""Besides, I mustn't forget to add, that she is extremely beautiful."""
Alwyn shrugged his shoulders indifferently. His friend noticed the
gesture and laughed.
"""Still impervious to beauty, old boy?""--he said gayly--""You always"
"were, I remember!"""
"Alwyn flushed a little, and rose from his chair."
"""Not always,""--he answered steadily,--""There have been times in my life"
"when the beauty of women,--mere physical beauty--has exercised great"
influence over me. But I have lately learned how a fair face may

overheard at the garden-party at de Wolkenstein's I have come to a firm
"conclusion that, although during the next few years important changes"
"will be made upon the map of the world, Ceuta will remain Spanish.  My"
country will never menace yours in the Mediterranean at that point.  A
Ministry might be found in Madrid to consider the question of its
"disposal, but the Spanish people would rise in revolution before they"

Such was Mrs. Winstanley’s passing thought one day. She was there with
"Sophia and Evan Wilmington. It was always a great pleasure, she used"
"to say, to have young people about her; and very naturally, since young"
people can be particularly useful in strange places to a middle-aged
"lady. The brother and sister fetched and carried for her all day long,"
"which was very nice and suitable, and Mrs. Winstanley was in her"
"most affable mood. On the day in question, however, she saw, to her"
"astonishment and annoyance, Canon Chisely and Yvonne making their way"
towards her through the crowded lines of tables.
"“Good gracious, Everard!” she said as they came up. “How did you find"
your way here? I thought you were going to Switzerland.”
"“So we are,” replied the Canon. “We have broken our journey. And as for"
"getting here, we took the boat from Dover and then walked.”"
"“The frivolity of the place is infecting you already, Canon,” cried"
"Sophia, with a laugh. “I hope you are going to stay a long time.”"
"“Oh, not too long,” said Yvonne. “It wouldn’t be fair to the Canon, who"
needs some mountain air. This is just a little treat all for me.”
She glanced at him affectionately as she spoke. It was good of him to
tarry for her sake in this Vanity Fair of a place.
"“We were going by Calais, as you know,” said the Canon, explanatively"
to Mrs. Winstanley. “We only changed our minds a day or two ago--we
thought it would be a little surprise for you.”

In the white track was a brilliant silver object travelling along at a
"great speed. A number of anti-aircraft guns opened fire simultaneously,"
"and all around the shining fugitive innumerable stars of pale, liquid"
gold flashed out and melted away again.

We returned to our marquee and sat down on our kits. My friend Private
"Black came in after us, smiling ruefully. I asked him what was the"
matter.
"""I was playing the piano in the Sergeants' Mess when the first one"
dropped. We all jumped up together and rushed out. Then the second one
burst and I lost my head and didn't know where I was going. I darted to
"and fro, tripping over tent-ropes and dashing up against revetments. I"
"never had the wind up so much in all my life. I couldn't get my breath,"
there was a kind of weight on my stomach and a tightness round my chest
"and throat, and my knees kept on giving way all the time. The third one"
burst and I fell down and crawled under some ropes and lay flat against
abandoned by God?  Have we no punishments nor prophets from the Lord?
"Who then will teach us?"" Tyapa spoke strongly and plainly, and there"
"was faith in his words.  He had been speaking a long time, and the"
"teacher, who was generally drunk and in a speechless condition, could"
"not stand it any longer.  He looked at the dry, wrinkled old man, felt"
"the great force of these words, and suddenly began to pity himself.  He"
wished to say something so strong and convincing to the old man that
Tyapa would be disposed in his favour; he did not wish to speak in such
"a serious, earnest way, but in a soft and fatherly tone.  And the"
teacher felt as if something were rising from his breast into his
throat ...  But he could not find any powerful words.
"""What kind of a man are you? ...  Your soul seems to be torn away--and"
you still continue speaking ... as if you knew something ...  It would
"be better if you were silent."""
"""Ah, Tyapa, what you say is true,"" replied the teacher, sadly. ""The"
people ... you are right ... they are numberless ... but I am a
stranger to them ... and they are strangers to me ... Do you see where
the tragedy of my life is hidden? ... But let me alone!  I shall suffer
"... and there are no prophets also ...  No.  You are right, I speak a"
great deal ...  But it is no good to anyone.  I shall be always silent
"...  Only don't speak with me like this ...  Ah, old man, you do not"
"know ...  You do not know ...  And you cannot understand."""
"And in the end the teacher cried.  He cried so easily and so freely,"
"with such torrents of flowing tears, that he soon found relief."
"""You ought to go into a village ... become a clerk or a teacher ..."
"You would be well fed there.  What are you crying for?"" asked Tyapa,"
sadly.
"She looked at me keenly, and I fancied her colour rose. But she only"
"answered, 'Yes, Martin. But you see I have not one. I am alone.'"
"'And lonely, my lady?'"
"'Sometimes,' she answered, smiling sadly."
"'But this evening?' I replied, feeling that there was still something"
I did not understand. 'I should not have thought you would be feeling
"that way. I have not been here, but when I came in, my lady----'"
"'Pshaw!' she answered with a laugh of disdain. 'Those boys, Martin?"
"They can laugh, fight, and ride; but for the rest, pouf! They are not"
"company. However, it is bedtime, and you must go. I think you have"
"done me good. Good night. I wish--I wish I could do you good,' she"
"added kindly, almost timidly."
To some extent she had. I went away feeling that mine was not the only
"trouble in the world, nor my loneliness the only loneliness. She was a"
"stranger in a besieged city, a woman among men, exposed, despite her"
"rank, to many of a woman's perils; and doubtless she had felt Fraulein"
Max's defection and the Waldgrave's strange conduct more deeply than
any one watching her daily bearing would have supposed. So much the
"greater reason was there that I should do my duty loyally, and putting"
"her first to whom I owed so much, let no sorrow of my own taint my"
service.
But God knows there is one passion that defies argument. The house
next Herr Krapp's had a fascination for me which I could not resist;
"and though I did not again leave my lady unguarded, but arranged that"
"Steve should stop at home and watch the door, four o'clock the next"
afternoon saw me sneaking away in search of St. Austin's. Of course I
"pitiful to hear. And the castle was hung with black, and in the whole"
kingdom proclamation was made from all pulpits that whoever could help
"the king's daughter should get her, and half the kingdom besides. Then"
"Tom, Dick and Harry, and the best physicians in the country came along."
But none of them could help the princess.
But one day a foreign doctor from afar came to court. He was not from
"their country, he said, and had made the journey purposely just to try"
"his luck here. But he must see the king's daughter alone, said he, and"
permission was granted him.
"The king's daughter recognized him, and grew red and pale in turn. ""If"
"I help you now, will you marry me?"" asked the youth. Yes, indeed she"
"would. Then he gave her one of the magic apples, and her horns were only"
"half as large as before. ""But I cannot do more until I have my cap,"
"and my table-cloth, and my purse back again,"" said he. So she went and"
"brought him the things. Then he gave her still another magic apple, and"
"now the horns were no more than tiny hornlets. ""But now I cannot go on"
"until you have sworn that you will be true to me,"" said he. And she"
"swore that she would. And after she had eaten the third apple, her"
"forehead was quite smooth again, and she was even more beautiful than"
in days gone by.
Then there was great joy in the castle. They prepared for the wedding
"with baking and brewing, and invited people from East and West to come"
"to it. And they ate and drank, and were merry and of good cheer, and if"
"they have not stopped, they are merry and of good cheer to this very"
day!
NOTE
"A sigh escaped her, and her hand sought my arm."
"""I was young once, m'sieur,"" she said in that calm, refined voice which"
had long ago always sounded so much to me like that of my own dead
"mother.  ""I understand your feeling--I understand perfectly.  It is only"
my poor daughter who does not understand.  She knows that you have
"forsaken her--that is all."""
It was upon my tongue to lay bare to her the secret of my heart's
"longings, yet I hesitated.  I remembered that calm, serious, sweet-faced"
"woman on the other side of the English Channel, far from the glare and"
glitter of life as I knew it--the fevered life which the diplomat in
"Paris is forced to lead.  I remembered my troth to Edith, and my"
conscience pricked me.
"""Could it be possible,"" I reflected, ""that Yolande was really in the pay"
"of a Government hostile to England?""  Kaye was already nearing Berlin"
with the intention of searching out her actions and exposing her as a
"spy, while Anderson had already denounced her as having been a party to"
an attempt to secure the secret which he had carried from Berlin to
Downing Street.
With a mother's solicitude the Countess could for some time only speak
"of Yolande's mysterious attack; but at last, in order to prosecute my"
"inquiries further, I observed, during a lull in the conversation:"

"called the guard to attention, and himself saluted me--me a private! I"
handed him my rifle--there was an inch of blood at the point of the
"bayonet--and hobbled off to the nearest ladder. My word, I could"
"scarcely walk, and as for climbing a ship's ladder--I could never have"
done if some one hadn't given me a boost behind and some one else a
hand at the top. The Commander and the Major of Marines were both in
"the wardroom; I walked in, saluted them as a self-respecting private"
"should do, and told them the whole story."""
"""It was Petty Officer Trehayne,"" said I calmly--and waited for a"
sensation.
"""Of course,"" replied Dawson, greatly to my annoyance. He might have"
"shown some astonishment at my wonderful intuition; but he didn't, not"
"a scrap. Even Cary was at first disappointing, though he warmed up"
"later, and did me full justice. ""Trehayne a spy!"" cried Cary. ""He"
"looked a smart good man."""
"""I am not saying that he wasn't,"" snapped Dawson, whose nerves were"
"very badly on edge. ""He was obeying the orders of his superiors as we"
"all have to do. He gave his life, and it was for his country's"
service. Nobody can do more than that. Don't you go for to slander
"Trehayne. I watched him die--on his feet."""
"Cary turned to me. ""What made you think it was Trehayne?"" he asked."
"This was better. I looked at Dawson, who was brooding in his chair"
with his thoughts far away. He was still seeing those eyes fading out
under the glare of the electrics between the steel decks of the
_Malplaquet_!
"""It was a sheer guess at first,"" said I, preserving a decent show of"
This teacher had once taught at an institution in one of the towns on
"the Volga, but in consequence of some story was dismissed.  After this"
"he was a clerk in a tannery, but again had to leave.  Then he became a"
"librarian in some private library, subsequently following other"
"professions.  Finally, after passing examinations in law he became a"
"lawyer, but drink reduced him to the Captain's dosshouse.  He was tall,"
"round-shouldered, with a long sharp nose and bald head.  In his bony"
"and yellow face, on which grew a wedge-shaped beard, shone large,"
"restless eyes, deeply sunk in their sockets, and the corners of his"
"mouth drooped sadly down.  He earned his bread, or rather his drink, by"
reporting for the local papers.  He sometimes earned as much as fifteen
roubles.  These he gave to the Captain and said:
"""It is enough.  I am going back into the bosom of culture. Another"
"week's hard work and I shall dress respectably, and then Addio, mio"
"caro!"""
"""Very exemplary!  As I heartily sympathise with your decision, Philip,"
"I shall not give you another glass all this week,"" the Captain warned"
him sternly.
"""I shall be thankful! .... You will not give me one drop?"""
The Captain heard in his voice a beseeching note to which he turned a
deaf ear.
"""Even though you roar, I shall not give it you!"""
"""As you like, then,"" sighed the teacher, and went away to continue his"
"reporting.  But after a day or two he would return tired and thirsty,"
and would look at the Captain with a beseeching glance out of the
"corners of his eyes, hoping that his friend's heart would soften."
"The little withered lady, all pleased excitement, said: “_Quite_"
"thrilling, James!”"
"Pangbutt seeing awkwardness at the door, and missing the loud"
"announcement of names, went a few paces closer to it to meet his"
newly-arrived guests.
"The little old gentleman entered the room vaguely, the dandruff of"
"the philosophic habit upon his coat-collar, and his wig full of"
reasons--very markedly a professor. He had the air of cataloguing
"ideas. The little old lady, a couple of paces behind him, followed him."
Pangbutt exchanged greetings with him.
Said the professor:
"“Good-evening, sir; my sister’s husband’s brother-in-law, Sir Gilders"
"Persimmon, was good enough to say that you would allow me to meet"
Mr. Anthony Bickersteth here.... I am writing a work to disprove
the insanity of genius.... It is a part of my theory that the human
personality cannot be hidden by artifice--that the strong temperament
shows itself in the vigorous growth of the hair--and so on.... I
"am, sir, I may have forgotten to say, Professor Curtis.... I am an"
"inveterate novel-reader.... My wife keeps a diary.... Where are you,"
"Charlotte? Ah, yes. But, fervently as I admire Mr. Bickersteth’s prose,"
I should like to suggest to him that in his next work he might make
"more of that unworked mine, the folk-lore of the London coster--or"
greengrocer.... I am most anxious that Mr. Bickersteth should be a
virile person whose moustache springs out strongly from under the
"nostrils, with a tendency towards ruddiness in the colouring.... But"
"I fear that on this--what I may call his--er,” he tittered--“his"
"you."" And he fell to polishing his furry, old-fashioned top-hat with a"
"tail of the scanty, ill-fitting frock-coat he had donned along with a"
noisome waistcoat in honour of the occasion.
"Slyne shrugged his shoulders, despairingly, and, having made an end of"
"his unappetising meal, prepared for the road. Then he lighted a cigar"
"very much at his leisure, while Captain Dove regarded him grimly, and"
led the way on deck without further words.
"Sallie was ready and waiting at the companion-hatch on the poop, as"
pretty as a picture in the sables Captain Dove had given her a year
before--after a very lucrative season of poaching on the Siberian coast.
"As soon as she caught sight of them she came forward, followed by"
"Ambrizette, whose appearance, in cloak and turban, was even a worse"
offence to Slyne's fastidious taste than Captain Dove's had been.
"""What a calamitous circus!"" he muttered between set teeth. ""I must get"
rid of those two somehow--and soon. But till then--
"""My car's at the back of those coal-wagons there,"" he told Captain Dove"
"with great dignity, and Captain Dove turned to the engine-room hatch."
"""Below there!"" he called down. ""Is that Mr. Brasse? I'm off now, Brasse."
"You'll carry out all my instructions, eh? And--don't quarrel with Da"
"Costa, d'ye hear?"""
"""Ay, ay, sir,"" answered a dreary voice from the depths below, and"
"Captain Dove faced about again to find Sallie, flushed and anxious,"
waiting with Ambrizette at the gangway.
"""Come on,"" he ordered irascibly, and Sallie followed him down the"
"plank. Ambrizette shuffled fearfully after her, and Slyne came last, his"
"girl's arm and whispered in her ear that she must be brave, a true"
"Andaluse, and not compromise the expedition by any spoken word."
"Concha turned indignantly upon her, shaking off her restraining hand as"
she did so.
"""Do you think I am a fool?"" she whispered. ""I will do nothing to spoil"
"their chances. But oh, Giralda, at any moment he might be shot!"""
"""Trust José Maria. He hath taken risks far greater than this,"" said La"
"Giralda in a low voice, wilfully mistaking her meaning. But Concha,"
"quite unconsoled, did nothing but clasp her hands and quicken her"
supplications to the Virgin.
"The ladder was reared against the gilded iron railing and Rollo mounted,"
immediately dropping lightly down on the further side. The Sergeant
"followed, and presently both were on the ground. At a word from Rollo,"
El Sarria pushed the ladder over and the two received it and laid it
along the parapet in a place where it would remain completely hidden
till wanted.
"The two moved off together in the direction of the porter's lodge, at"
"the door of which the Sergeant knocked lightly, and then, obtaining no"
"answer, with more vehemence. A window was lifted and a frightened voice"
asked who came there at that time of night.
The Sergeant answered with some sharpness that they wished for the key
of the great gate.
Upon this the same old woman who had ushered out La Giralda appeared
"trembling at the lattice, and was but little relieved when the Sergeant,"
"putting on his most serious air, informed her that her life was in the"
"she had reached the great dramatic moment, the child raised his hands"
"in terror and said: “Oh! Auntie, don't let the bear _really_ eat the"
boy!”
"“Don't you know,” said an impatient boy who had been listening to a"
"mild adventure story considered suitable to his years, “that I don't"
take any interest in the story until the decks are dripping with gore?”
Here we have no opportunity of deciding whether or not the actual
description demanded would be more alarming than the listener had
realised.
"Here is a poem of James Stephens, showing a child's taste for"
sensational things:--
A man was sitting underneath a tree
"Outside the village, and he asked me"
"What name was upon this place, and said he"
Was never here before. He told a
Lot of stories to me too. His nose was flat.
"I asked him how it happened, and he said,"
"The first mate of the  “Mary Ann”  done that,"
"With a marling-spike one day, but he was dead,"
"And a jolly job too, but he'd have gone a long way to have"
killed him.
"A gold ring in one ear, and the other was bit off by a crocodile,"
"bedad,"
That's what he said: He taught me how to chew.
He was a real nice man. He liked me too.
The taste that is fed by the sensational contents of the newspapers
"and the dramatic excitement of street life, and some of the lurid"
"representations of the Kinematograph, is so much stimulated that the"
"Rollo was about to speak, but the Sergeant whispered that the old lady"
"was now in such good case to admit them, that she might be frighted by"
his foreign accent.
In a few moments the woman could be heard stiffly and grumblingly
"descending the stairs, the door was opened, and Rebeca appeared with the"
key in her hand.
"""How many are there of your party?"" she asked, her poor hand shaking so"
"that she could scarcely fit the key in the lock, and her voice sunk to a"
quavering whisper.
"""There are five men of us and two women,"" said the Sergeant, quickly."
"""Now we are all within, pray give me the key and show us the road to the"
"Queen's apartments."""
"""Two women!"" grumbled the poor old creature, whose mind appeared to be"
"somewhat unhinged; ""that will never suit her Royal Highness the Regent,"
"especially if they are young and well-looking. She loves not such, any"
"more than I love the hussy of the pork-shop. Though, indeed, my man hath"
"not the roving eye in his head as her Señor Muñoz hath. Ah, the saints"
have mercy on all poor deserted women! But what am I saying? If the
"Lady Cristina heard me speak ill of him, she would set my poor old neck"
"in the garrote. Then--crack--all would be over!"""
"The party now advanced towards the palace, which in the gloom of a"
"starless night was still entirely hidden from their sight, save as a"
darker mass set square against the black vault of heaven.
By this time Concha and La Giralda had taken the trembling portress by
"the arms, and were bringing her along in the van, whispering comfort in"
my rifle and hopped towards the dressing-station. I think it was the
happiest moment in my life. I lost the sensation of weariness for the
time being. But my foot began to hurt very badly and I got someone to
help me along. My wound was dressed. I got on to a stretcher and I
didn't know anything more until I was taken out of the motor ambulance
"here at the C.C.S. Anyhow, I'm all right now and I'm going to try and"
"get across to Blighty and swing the lead as long as I can."""
There was silence for a while. It had grown dark outside. But the call
from the theatre sounded again. Gradually the waiting-room emptied
itself until at last there were only two men left sitting in front of
the fire. They both seemed depressed and gloomy. Then one of them broke
the silence and said:
"""We was goin' over when a 'eavy one burst. I didn't 'alf cop a packet in"
"me shoulder. It's the third time too, an' I've got the wind up about"
"goin' up the line agin when I'm out o' dock. The third time's yer last,"
"yer know. Fritz'll send one over with me number on it, that's a bloody"
"cert!"""
"""If yer number's up it's up,"" said the other, who had a big patch over"
"his right ear. ""If yer've got ter die yer've got ter die, an' it's no"
"use worryin' about it."""
Their turn came before long and I helped each one to get on to a table.
Then I went over to the Prep. to see if any more walking wounded had
"arrived, but there were none at all."
I stood out in the open for a few minutes in order to breathe the fresh
air. There was a roar and rumble of distant drum-fire. The trees behind
the C.C.S. stood out blackly against the pallid flashes that lit up the
entire horizon.
"smooth, the delicate tracery of veins could be distinctly seen, and each"
"muscle stood out hard and taut; there was no superfluous flesh, but a"
firmness and excellence of condition that brought a smile of
"satisfaction to Grey’s face.  He turned with a smile to Dick, who stood"
by beaming.
"""Not much fear of him to-day, eh, Dicon?"""
"""He would jump the moon, master, if you asked it of him,"" was the proud"
and confident answer.
"""How do the others look?  Have you seen them?"""
"""Pretty bits of horseflesh every one; and there is a black stallion of"
Mr. Artheret’s that will take some beating.  But he’s too heavy for some
of the jumps. He don’t take off fast enough.  And he’s a nasty temper
"too.  There’s a gray Arab with pace; but he falls away behind, as they"
all do.  I don’t think Don Carlos will be troubled long by him.  None of
"the others will take much beating.  Pretty to look at, but not trained"
"for what they’ve got to do.  Lord Sandford was here yesterday early,"
"looking at the jumps, and he had several of them made stiffer; but"
"there’s nothing Don Carlos cannot sail over like a bird!"""
"""Let us go and see,"" said Grey.  ""I will take a canter on the turf to"
"warm myself to the saddle. Soh, boy, soh!"" as he lightly vaulted to his"
"seat, and the horse curveted beneath him.  ""We will take a look at these"
"obstructions.  The stiffer they are, the better you and I will be"
"pleased—eh, my beauty?"""
"Dick mounted his nag, and rode beside his master to the course, where"
the horses were to be matched against each other when Lord Sandford and
"his friends should have finished their merry meal, and be ready to"

"popular-priced editions. The ""Library"" includes only those books which"
have been put to the test of public opinion and have not been found
"wanting,--books, in other words, which have come to be regarded as"
"standards in the fields of knowledge--literature, religion, biography,"
"history, politics, art, economics, sports, sociology, and belles"
lettres. Together they make the most complete and authoritative works on
the several subjects.

somewhat original version of one of the cycles of tales in which
"people acquire asses' ears, long noses, humped backs and other"
"adornments, through eating some enchanted fruit. The British Isles"
"are believed to be the home-land of this tale, and it is thought"
to have emigrated to Scandinavia by way of France and Germany.

SELF DID IT
"Once upon a time there was a mill, in which it was impossible to grind"
"flour, because such strange things kept happening there. But there was a"
"poor woman who was in urgent need of a little meal one evening, and she"
asked whether they would not allow her to grind a little flour during
"the night. ""For heaven's sake,"" said the mill-owner, ""that is quite"
"impossible! There are ghosts enough in the mill as it is."" But the woman"
said that she must grind a little; for she did not have a pinch of flour
"in the house with which to make mush, and there was nothing for her"
children to eat. So at last he allowed her to go to the mill at night
"and grind some flour. When she came, she lit a fire under a big"
"tar-barrel that was standing there; got the mill going, sat down by the"
"fire, and began to knit. After a time a girl came in and nodded to her."
"""Good evening!"" said she to the woman. ""Good evening!"" said the woman;"
"kept her seat, and went on knitting. But then the girl who had come in"
began to pull apart the fire on the hearth. The woman built it up again.
Even Aileen had not been shot at with a pistol. And then Tildy rather
"hoped that he would not shoot at her, for she was always loyal to"
Aileen; and she did not want to overshadow her friend.
At 4 o’clock on the afternoon of the third day Mr. Seeders came in.
There were no customers at the tables. At the back end of the
restaurant Tildy was refilling the mustard pots and Aileen was
quartering pies. Mr. Seeders walked back to where they stood.
"Tildy looked up and saw him, gasped, and pressed the mustard spoon"
against her heart. A red hair-bow was in her hair; she wore Venus’s
"Eighth Avenue badge, the blue bead necklace with the swinging silver"
symbolic heart.
Mr. Seeders was flushed and embarrassed. He plunged one hand into his
hip pocket and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie.
"“Miss Tildy,” said he, “I want to apologise for what I done the other"
"evenin’. Tell you the truth, I was pretty well tanked up or I wouldn’t"
of done it. I wouldn’t do no lady that a-way when I was sober. So I
"hope, Miss Tildy, you’ll accept my ’pology, and believe that I wouldn’t"
of done it if I’d known what I was doin’ and hadn’t of been drunk.”
"With this handsome plea Mr. Seeders backed away, and departed, feeling"
that reparation had been made.
But behind the convenient screen Tildy had thrown herself flat upon a
"table among the butter chips and the coffee cups, and was sobbing her"
heart out—out and back again to the grey plain wherein travel they with
blunt noses and hay-coloured hair. From her knot she had torn the red
hair-bow and cast it upon the floor. Seeders she despised utterly; she
had but taken his kiss as that of a pioneer and prophetic prince who
feel their knuckles against her.  Had he gone mad?  Would he strangle
"her?  But her eyes never moved from his, and his began to waver; his"
"hands dropped, and, with a kind of moan, he made for the door."
Monsieur Harmost's voice behind her said:
"""Before you go, monsieur, give me some explanation of this imbecility!"""
"Fiorsen spun round, shook his fist, and went out muttering.  They heard"
"the front door slam.  Gyp turned abruptly to the window, and there, in"
"her agitation, she noticed little outside things as one does in moments"
"of bewildered anger.  Even into that back yard, summer had crept.  The"
leaves of the sumach-tree were glistening; in a three-cornered little
"patch of sunlight, a black cat with a blue ribbon round its neck was"
basking.  The voice of one hawking strawberries drifted melancholy from a
side street.  She was conscious that Monsieur Harmost was standing very
"still, with a hand pressed to his mouth, and she felt a perfect passion"
of compunction and anger.  That kind and harmless old man--to be so
insulted!  This was indeed the culmination of all Gustav's outrages!  She
"would never forgive him this!  For he had insulted her as well, beyond"
"what pride or meekness could put up with.  She turned, and, running up to"
"the old man, put both her hands into his."
"""I'm so awfully sorry.  Good-bye, dear, dear Monsieur Harmost; I shall"
"come on Friday!""  And, before he could stop her, she was gone."
"She dived into the traffic; but, just as she reached the pavement on the"
"other side, felt her dress plucked and saw Fiorsen just behind her.  She"
shook herself free and walked swiftly on.  Was he going to make a scene
"in the street?  Again he caught her arm.  She stopped dead, faced round"
"on him, and said, in an icy voice:"
"The English author had met a colleague, with whom he stayed behind"
"talking, and Marchmont remained in the “hall,” as if it did not seem to"
him proper for him to go to his wife’s rooms.
"Susanna’s rooms were very high, had balconies on the Via Veneto, and"
were almost opposite Queen Margherita’s palace. One overlooked the
"garden and could see the Queen Mother taking her walks, which is not"
without its importance for persons who live in a republic.
Susanna was most amiable to Laura; repeated to all of them her
invitation to come and see her again; and after they had all promised
"to see one another frequently, Cæsar and Laura went down to their"
"carriage, and took a turn on the Corso by twilight."
XIII. ESTHETICS AND DEMAGOGY
_SUSANNA AND THE YOUNGSTERS_
"From this meeting on, Cæsar noticed that Marchmont paid court to Laura"
"with much persistence. A light-hearted, coquettish woman, it pleased"
"Laura to be pursued by a person like this Englishman, young,"
"distinguished, and rich; but she was not prepared to yield. Her"
"bringing-up, her class-feelings impelled her to consider adultery a"
"heinous thing. Nor was divorce a solution for her, since accepting it"
would oblige her to cease being a Catholic and to quarrel irrevocably
with the Cardinal. Marchmont showed no discretion in the way he paid
"court to Laura; he cared nothing about his wife, and talked of her with"
profound contempt....
"closed their lids. He sat with his head sunk on his breast, till the"
tumult died away. No one rose. The Speaker looked round once and again.
Could it be that no one----? Slowly he began to rise. The movement
"caught Sir Robert's attention: he signed to Puttock, who sprang heavily"
"to his feet. Puttock was no favourite as a speaker, and generally his"
rising was a signal for the House to thin. He began his speech with his
stolid deliberation. Not a man stirred. They waited for something still.
"""And now,"" whispered Medland to the Treasurer, who sat by him, ""let's"
"see what it was in that infernal paper."""
The Treasurer handed him what he asked.
"""You ought to see it,"" he whispered back."
"Mr. Puttock's voice droned on, and his sheaf of notes rustled in his"
hand. No one looked at him or listened to him. Their eyes were still on
"Medland. The Premier read--it seemed so slowly--put the paper down, and"
"gazed first up at the ceiling; then he glanced round, and found all the"
"attentive eyes on him: he smiled--it was just a visible smile, no"
"more--and his head fell again on his breast, while his hand idly twisted"
a button on his coat.
"The show was over, or had never come, and the deferred rush to the doors"
began. They almost tumbled over one another now in their haste to reach
"where their tongues could play freely. Kilshaw and Perry, the Treasurer"
"and the waverers, all slipped out, and Norburn, knowing nothing but"
"simply wearied of Puttock, followed them. Scarce twenty were left in the"
"House, and the galleries had poured half their contents into the great"
room which served for a lobby outside. There the talk ran swift and
"eager. The very name of ""Benyon"" was enough for many, who remembered"
that it had always been said to be the maiden name of Medland's wife.
"the lawyer had drawn up from his dictation, and the more lengthy"
agreement between Sallie and Jasper Slyne.
"Slyne and Jobling added their names to that, and Slyne attached his"
careful signature to a promise to pay the solicitor the percentage
agreed upon. Captain Dove witnessed it and then called Sallie from her
"seat in the window-alcove, and she came forward with anxious eyes, to"
fulfil the undertaking she had finally had to give Jasper Slyne as the
price of his help in her most unhappy predicament.
She did not know--nor did she greatly care then--what was contained in
the contract he laid before her without a word. She took from him
without demur the pen he held out to her. She had promised to do all he
"told her and give him whatever he asked--except, for the present,"
herself.
"""Sign 'Josceline Justice' at the foot of each page,"" he said gently, and"
she did so without a word. For she would not for all the world contained
have broken any promise she had given. Then Mr. Jobling desired her to
witness the two other men's signatures.
As she handed him back the pen she had a final question to ask him.
"""You said my father and mother are both dead, and my step-brother too."
"Is there no one else--"""
"""No one you need worry about in the least,"" he assured her,"
"misunderstanding. ""There was a beggarly American who lodged a claim to"
"the title and--to the title; his name was Carthew, I think--yes, Justin"
Carthew. But even if I--if he hadn't gone and got lost while looking for
"you, his claim would be quite ineffectual now. You're your father's"
"daughter, Lady Josceline. Justin Carthew was a dozen or more degrees"
"Islands, and after these were surrendered by the Dutch, Thomas Morgan was"
left in charge.
In 1686 he sailed in command of a company of buccaneers to assist Governor
"Wells, of St. Kitts, against the French. The defence of the island was"
"disgraceful, and Morgan's company was the only one which displayed any"
"courage or discipline, and most of them were killed or wounded, Colonel"
Morgan himself being shot in both legs.
Often these buccaneer leaders altered their titles from colonel to
"captain, to suit the particular enterprise on which they were engaged,"
according if it took place on sea or land.
"MORGAN, SIR HENRY. Buccaneer."
"This, the greatest of all the ""brethren of the coast,"" was a Welshman,"
born at Llanrhymmy in Monmouthshire in the year 1635. The son of a
"well-to-do farmer, Robert Morgan, he early took to the seafaring life."
"When quite a young man Morgan went to Barbadoes, but afterwards he"
"settled at Jamaica, which was his home for the rest of his life."
"Morgan may have been induced to go to the West Indies by his uncle,"
"Colonel Morgan, who was for a time Deputy Governor of Jamaica, a post Sir"
Henry Morgan afterwards held.
"Morgan was a man of great energy, and must have possessed great power of"
winning his own way with people. That he could be absolutely unscrupulous
"when it suited his ends there can be little doubt. He was cruel at times,"
but was not the inhuman monster that he is made out to be by Esquemeling
"in his ""History of the Bucaniers."" This was largely proved by the evidence"
given in the suit for libel brought and won by Morgan against the
"""Nay,"" he said deliberately, ""I have been both judged and misjudged"
"myself, and it would ill become me in like manner to judge others. But"
"if that man is not of your country and my trade, Ramon Garcia has lived"
"in vain. That is all."""
Concha nodded a little uncertainly.
"""Yes,"" she said slowly, ""yes--of my country. I believe you. He has the"
Andalucian manner of wearing his clothes. If he were a girl he would
know how to tie a ribbon irregularly and how to place a bow-knot a
little to the side in the right place--things which only Andalucians
"know. But what in the world do you mean by 'of your profession'?"""
"El Sarria smoked a while in silence, inhaling the blue cigarette smoke"
"luxuriously, and causing it to issue from his nostrils white and"
moisture-laden with his breath. Then he spoke.
"""I mean of my late profession,"" he explained, smiling on Concha; ""it"
will not do for a man on the high-road to a commission to commit himself
"to the statement that he has practised as a bandit, or stopped a coach"
on the highway in the name of King Carlos Quinto that he might examine
"more at his ease the governmental mail bags. But our Sergeant--well, I"
am man-sworn and without honour if he hath not many a time taken
"blackmail without any such excuse!"""
Concha seemed to be considering deeply. Her pretty mouth was pursed up
"like a ripe strawberry, and her brows were knitted so fiercely that a"
deep line divided the delicately arched eyebrows.
"""And to this I can add somewhat,"" she began presently; ""they say (I know"
not with what truth) that I have some left-handed gipsy blood in me--and
"if that man be not a Gitano--why, then I have never seen one. Besides,"
plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head. The lady looked at
"him coolly, without prejudice or favour."
"“Lady,” he said, “dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance"
"by me. If yer don’t know de guy, and he’s tryin’ to do de Johnny act,"
"say de word, and I’ll call a cop in t’ree minutes. If yer does know"
"him, and he’s on de square, w’y I’ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he"
sent yer.”
The young lady betrayed a faint interest.
"“A song and dance!” she said, in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed"
to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony. “A new
"idea—in the troubadour line, I suppose. I—used to know the gentleman"
"who sent you, so I think it will hardly be necessary to call the"
"police. You may execute your song and dance, but do not sing too"
"loudly. It is a little early yet for open-air vaudeville, and we might"
attract attention.”
"“Awe,” said the boy, with a shrug down the length of him, “yer know"
"what I mean, lady. ’Tain’t a turn, it’s wind. He told me to tell yer"
he’s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to
’Frisco. Den he’s goin’ to shoot snow-birds in de Klondike. He says yer
told him not to send ’round no more pink notes nor come hangin’ over de
"garden gate, and he takes dis means of puttin’ yer wise. He says yer"
"refereed him out like a has-been, and never give him no chance to kick"
"at de decision. He says yer swiped him, and never said why.”"
The slightly awakened interest in the young lady’s eyes did not abate.
Perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the
"snow-bird hunter, in thus circumventing her express commands against"
the ordinary modes of communication. She fixed her eye on a statue
"There was also a Baluch Political Officer, known as the Sarhad-dar,"
who worked under orders from the British Political Officer at Quetta.
"The Sarhad-dar, to a certain degree, controlled the Sarhadi Raiders,"
"occasionally with the help of the Chagai Levies, which were raised by"
the Indian Government for this particular work.
Supplies were brought to these scattered posts by camel caravans from
India.
Communication with India was maintained by means of the telegraph.
Later on it became necessary to send out a wireless troop from India
to establish communication between my force at Khwash and Saindak.
At the same time I did my best to learn all I could about the tribes
"amongst whom I was going to operate, their ways and customs, and the"
nature of the country in which they lived.
A glance at the map will show the situation and boundaries of the
Sarhad--literally meaning boundary. It will be seen that it extends
"from Jalk in the East to Galugan in the West. The Eastern part, from"
"Jalk to Safed-koh, is held by a tribe known as the Gamshadzais, under"
"their notable leader, Halil Khan."
The central portion is held by the Yarmahommedzais under Jiand
"Khan, an elderly man, who has been undisputed chief, and a sort of"
"over-lord of the whole of the Sarhad, for very many years. He has"
been looked upon by his own and neighbouring tribes as well-nigh a
"demi-god. As Jiand enters later, and largely, into this narrative all"
further description of him will be reserved till actual contact is
established with him.
"Khwash--known also as Vasht or Washt--is the capital of the Sarhad,"
and appeared to have been recently rough-dried and starched. He was too
diffident to aspire to Aileen’s notice; so he usually sat at one of
"Tildy’s tables, where he devoted himself to silence and boiled"
weakfish.
One day when Mr. Seeders came in to dinner he had been drinking beer.
There were only two or three customers in the restaurant. When Mr.
"Seeders had finished his weakfish he got up, put his arm around Tildy’s"
"waist, kissed her loudly and impudently, walked out upon the street,"
"snapped his fingers in the direction of the laundry, and hied himself"
to play pennies in the slot machines at the Amusement Arcade.
For a few moments Tildy stood petrified. Then she was aware of Aileen
"shaking at her an arch forefinger, and saying:"
"“Why, Til, you naughty girl! Ain’t you getting to be awful, Miss"
Slyboots! First thing I know you’ll be stealing some of my fellows. I
"must keep an eye on you, my lady.”"
Another thing dawned upon Tildy’s recovering wits. In a moment she had
"advanced from a hopeless, lowly admirer to be an Eve-sister of the"
"potent Aileen. She herself was now a man-charmer, a mark for Cupid, a"
Sabine who must be coy when the Romans were at their banquet boards.
Man had found her waist achievable and her lips desirable. The sudden
"and amatory Seeders had, as it were, performed for her a miraculous"
piece of one-day laundry work. He had taken the sackcloth of her
"uncomeliness, had washed, dried, starched and ironed it, and returned"
it to her sheer embroidered lawn—the robe of Venus herself.
The freckles on Tildy’s cheeks merged into a rosy flush. Now both Circe
and Psyche peeped from her brightened eyes. Not even Aileen herself had
been publicly embraced and kissed in the restaurant.
presently be an armistice and Germany would have to make peace with
"perhaps the cession to France of Metz as a _solatium_, while Germany"
"was given a little bit more of Africa, and Austria got nothing...."
Meantime the Villa Beau-séjour seemed after Holloway Prison a
paradise upon earth. Why quarrel with her fate? Why not drop
politics and take up philosophy? She felt herself capable of writing
a Universal History which would be far truer if more cynical than
any previous attempt to show civilized man the route he had followed
and the martyrdom he had undergone.
On the 17th of August she took the tram into Brussels. It seemed
"however as if it would never get there, and when she reached the"
Porte de Namur she was too impatient to wait for the connection. She
"could not find any gendarme, but at a superior-looking flower-shop"
she obtained the address of the British Legation.
She asked at the lodge for Mr. Hawk; but there was only a Belgian
"coachman in charge, and he told her the Minister and his staff had"
followed the Court to Antwerp. Mr. Hawk had only left that morning.
"""What a nuisance,"" said Vivie to herself. ""I might have found out"
from him whether there is any truth in the rumours that are flying
"about Tervueren."""
These rumours were to the effect that the Germans had captured all
"the forts of Liège and their brave defender, General Léman; that"
"they were in Namur and were advancing on Louvain. ""I wonder what we"
"had better do?"" pondered Vivie."
In her bewilderment she took the bold step of calling at the Hotel
"de Ville, gave her name and nationality, and asked the advice of"
the municipal employé who saw her as to what course she and her
the Government regulations as to curricula. A good teacher was not
troubled by such matters.
"83,660. (Mr. Sly). There was no scope for the employment of non-Indians"
in the high schools as apart from the colleges. It was in the
professorial line that more help from the West was required.
"83,661. (Mr. Gokhale). The witness knew of three instances in which the"
colonies had secured distinguished men on salaries which were lower than
these given to officers of the Indian Educational Service. One was at
"Toronto, another was in New Zealand and the third at Yale university."
The salaries on the two latter cases were £600 and £500 a year. The same
held good as regards Japan. The facts there had been stated in a
"Government of India publication as follows: ""Subsequent to 1895 there"
"were 67 Professors recruited in Europe and America, of those, 20 came"
"from Germany, 16 from England and 16 from the United States. The average"
pay was £384. In the highest Imperial University the average pay is
"£684. As soon as Japanese could be found to do the work, even tolerably"
"well, the foreigner was dropped."""
"83,662. When the witness first started work in India, he found that"
"there was no physical laboratory, or any grant made for a practical"
experimental course. He had to construct instruments with the help of
"local mechanics, whom he had to train. All this took him ten years. He"
then undertook original investigation at his own expense. The Royal
Society became specially interested in his work and desired to give him
a Parliamentary grant for its continuation. It was after this that the
Government of Bengal came forward and offered him facilities for
research.
"83,663. In the Educational Service he would take men of achievement from"
anywhere; but men of promise he would take from his own country.
"money, Slyne. Where is she? Fetch her in here."""
"Slyne had no farther to go to do that than to the next room, where he"
"found Sallie at the window, gazing pensively out at the sea. But he"
delayed there for some time to make it still more clear to her that her
only hope of helping herself lay in abetting him blindly.
"When he at length returned to his own sitting-room with her, he found"
"Captain Dove staring fixedly at another arrival there, an overwhelmingly"
"up-to-date if rather imbecile-looking young man, whose general"
"gorgeousness, combined with a very vacant, fish-like eye much magnified"
"by a monocle, had evidently reduced the would-be fashionable seaman to a"
stricken silence.
"Slyne, who had at first shot a most malevolent glance at the intruder,"
was stepping forward to greet him just as Mr. Jobling put in an
appearance with a sheaf of papers in one hand.
"""How d'ye do, Lord Ingoldsby?"" said Slyne quite suavely to the young man"
"with the eye-glass. He had caught sight of Mr. Jobling in the doorway,"
"and turned to Sallie, his quick mind bent on a masterstroke."
"""May I introduce to you the Marquis of Ingoldsby,"" he remarked to her in"
"the monotone of convention; and, as she bowed slightly in response to"
"that very modern young gentleman's ingratiating wriggle and grin, Slyne,"
"one eye on Captain Dove's astonished countenance, completed the"
formality.
"""This is Lady Josceline Justice,"" said he to his smirking lordship, and"
breathed delicately into a somewhat extensive ear the further
"information, ""the late Earl of Jura's daughter, you know--and my"
"_fiancée_."""
"months of German occupation, though Vivie, in her solitude at"
"Tervueren, seldom heard them."
After her business at the bank she walked about the town. No one
took any notice of her or annoyed her in any way. The restaurants
"seemed crowded with Belgians as well as Germans, and the Belgians"
did not seem to have lost their appetites. The Palace Hotel had
become a German officers' club. On all the public buildings the
German Imperial flag hung alongside the Belgian. Only a few of the
"trams were running. Yet you could still buy, without much difficulty"
"at the kiosques, Belgian and even French and British newspapers."
From these she gathered that the German forces were in imminent
peril between the Belgian Antwerp army on the north and the British
army advancing from the south; and that in the plains of Alsace the
"French had given the first public exhibition of the new ""Turpin"""
explosive. The results had been _foudroyant_ ... and simple.
Complete regiments of German soldiers had been destroyed in _one
"minute_. It seemed curious, she thought, that with such an arm as"
this the French command did not at once come irresistibly to the
rescue of Brussels....
"However, it was four o'clock, and there was her friend the enemy's"
"automobile drawn up outside the bank, awaiting her. She got in, and"
"the soldier chauffeur whirled her away to the Villa Beau-séjour,"
beyond Tervueren.
On her return she found her mother prostrate with bad news. Their
"nearest neighbour, Farmer Oudekens who had driven them into Brussels"
the preceding day had been executed in his own orchard only an hour
ago. It seemed that the lieutenant in charge of the soldiers
"billeted there had disappeared in the night, leaving his uniform and"
watch and chain behind him. The farmer's story was that in the night
spirit?”
"“If it's as you say, it's uncanny,” said Risca, unconvinced."
Yet when Sir Oliver and Julia both assured him that Stella never doubted
"his luxurious happiness, and that the ordering of the picture was due to"
"no subtle suggestion, he had to believe them."
"“You always make the mistake, John, of thinking Stellamaris mortal,”"
"said Herold, at the supper-table, for, on receipt of the young men's"
"telegram, the Blounts had deferred their dinner to the later hour of"
"supper. “You are utterly wrong,” said he. “How can she be mortal when"
she talks all day to winds and clouds and the sea-children in their cups
"of foam? She's as elemental as Ariel. When she sleeps, she's really away"
on a sea-gull's back to the Isles of Magic. That's why she laughs at the
"dull, clumsy old world from which she is cut off in her mortal guise."
What are railway-trains and omnibuses to her? What would they be to
"you, John, if you could have a sea-gull's back whenever you wanted to go"
"anywhere? And she goes to places worth going to, by George! What could"
she want with Charing Cross or the Boulevard des Italians? Fancy the
nymph Syrinx at a woman writers' dinner!”
"“I don't know what you 're talking about, Walter,” said Lady Blount,"
whose mind was practical.
"“Syrinx,” said Sir Oliver, oracularly (he was a little, shrivelled man,"
to whose weak face a white moustache and an imperial gave a false air
"of distinction)--“Syrinx,” said he, “was a nymph beloved of Pan,--it's a"
"common legend in Greek mythology,--and Pan turned her into a reed.”"
"“And then cut the reed up into Pan-pipes,” cried Herold, eagerly, “and"
made immortal music out of them--just as he makes immortal music out of

"After they had eaten, the king's daughter said: ""O, do look at the"
"handsome apples up there on the tree! If you were really kind, you would"
"fetch me down a couple of them!"" The youth was not lazy, and climbed up."
"But he had forgotten his table-cloth and his purse, and these she took."
And while he was shaking down the apples his cap fell off. She at once
"put it on and wished herself back in her own room, and there she was"
that minute.
"""You might have known it,"" said the youth to himself, and hurried down"
the tree. He began to cry and did not know what to do. And as he was
"sitting there, he sampled the apples which he had thrown down. No sooner"
"had he tried one than he had a strange feeling in his head, and when he"
"looked more closely, he had a pair of horns. ""Well, now it can do me no"
"more harm,"" said he, and calmly went on eating the apples. But suddenly"
"the horns had disappeared, and he was as before. ""Good enough!"" said the"
"youth. And with that he put the apples in his pocket, and set out to"
search for the king's daughter.
"He went from city to city, and sailed from country to country; but it"
"was a long journey, and lasted a year and a day, and even longer."
"But one day he got there after all. It was a Sunday, and he found out"
that the king's daughter was at church. Then he sat himself down with
"his apples before the church door, and pretended to be a peddler."
"""Apples of Damascus! Apples of Damascus!"" he cried. And sure enough, the"
"king's daughter came, and told her maidens to go and see what desirable"
"things the peddler from abroad might have to offer. Yes, he had apples"
"of Damascus. ""What do the apples give one?"" asked the maiden. ""Wisdom"
"and beauty!"" said the peddler, and the maiden bought."
"When the king's daughter had eaten of the apples, she had a pair of"
horns. And then there was such a wailing in the castle that it was

OF THE BLOSSOMING OF THE TREE OF LIFE
CHAPTER LXXXVII
_Which has to do with the Binding of Books in Half-calf and the
Whimsies of Calf Love_
"When Noll had left his baggage in a quiet hotel by the Strand, and"
had refreshed his body with much splashing of himself in water and a
"change of clothes, he sallied out into the streets of London in a vague"
"wonder and surprise as to how to begin the search for Betty, yet firmly"
determined to start straightway in his quest--the Baddlesmere jaw set
firm.
"The summer afternoon was closing in, and the Strand was gay with"
people cheerily making their way homewards from work or amusement. But
homewards Noll did not take his steps; he felt a certain sense of shame
"about going to his own people without Betty at his side--and this, too,"
"not on his own account, but that it seemed disloyal to Betty and likely"
to make her future entrance into the family circle an embarrassment to
"autumn use, but he keeps putting it off, and probably it will not be done"
"at all. So far it hasn't mattered, but this morning's first wet snow has"
covered the hay outdoors and the maltreated land. And so it will remain
"till next spring. Poor Paul! He is an easygoing man at heart, but he"
"pushes doggedly on against a whirlwind; sometimes he smiles to himself,"
knowing how useless it is to struggle--a distorted smile.
"His father, the old man alone in his room, stands sometimes on his"
"threshold, as he used to do, and reflects. He is lost in memories, for he"
has ninety years behind him. The many houses on the farm confuse him a
"little; the roofs are all too big for him, and he is afraid they might"
come down and carry him off. Once he asked Josephine if it was right that
his hands and fingers should run away from him every day across the
"fields. So they put mittens on his hands, but he took to chewing them; in"
"fact he ate everything he was given, and enjoyed a good digestion. So they"
"must be thankful he had his health, Josephine said, and could be up and"
about.
*       *       *       *       *
"I did not follow the others across the field, but returned the way I had"
"come last spring, down toward the woods and the sea. It is fitting that I"
"should go back, always back, never forward again."
"I passed the hut where Solem and I had lived together, and then the"
"Lapps--the two old people and Olga, this strange cross between a human"
"being and a dwarf birch. A stove stood against the peat wall, and a"
paraffin lamp hung from the roof of their stone-age dwelling. Olga was
"kind and helpful, but she looked tiny and pathetic, like a ruffled hen; it"
"pained me to watch her flit about the room, tiny and crooked, as she"
looked for a pair of reindeer cheeses for me.
opportunity of trying those boots. Meanwhile he used to talk about
"them at meals, and he would polish them up every night before he went"
to bed.  When the great day came for the first trial of them to be
"made, he took a patronising farewell of his wife and family, ignored"
"the many eager noses pressed against the upper windows of the Palace,"
"and sailed off.  The motion, as perhaps you know, is a little"
"disquieting at first, but one soon gets used to it.  After that it is"
fascinating. He had gone some two thousand miles before he realised
that there might be a difficulty about finding his way back.  The
difficulty proved at least as great as he had anticipated. For the
rest of that day he toured backwards and forwards across the country;
and it was by the merest accident that a very angry King shot in
through an open pantry window in the early hours of the morning.  He
removed his boots and went softly to bed. . . .
"It was, of course, a lesson to him.  He decided that in the future he"
"must proceed by a recognised route, sailing lightly from landmark to"
landmark.  Such a route his Geographers prepared for him--an early
"morning constitutional, of three hundred miles or so, to be taken ten"
times before breakfast.  He gave himself a week in which to recover
his nerve and then started out on the first of them.
"[Illustration: _""Most extraordinary,"" said the King_]"
"Now the Kingdom of Euralia adjoined that of Barodia, but whereas"
"Barodia was a flat country, Euralia was a land of hills.  It was"
"natural then that the Court Geographers, in search of landmarks,"
"should have looked towards Euralia; and over Euralia accordingly,"
"about the time when cottage and castle alike were breakfasting, the"
King of Barodia soared and dipped and soared and dipped again.

"Jogues, Isaac, referred to, 73."
"Orange, Fort, Bressani sent to, 73."
"Rochelle, Bressani sent to, 73."
"Torture, Indian, Bressani by the Iroquois, 73."
ESCAPE OF BRESSANI                           73
"march of several days,--during which Bressani, in wading a rocky"
"stream, fell from exhaustion and was nearly drowned,--they reached"
an Iroquois town. It is needless to follow the revolting details
of the new torments that succeeded. They hung him by the feet
"with chains; placed food for their dogs on his naked body, that"
they might lacerate him as they ate; and at last had reduced his
emaciated frame to such a condition that even they themselves stood
"in horror of him. ""I could not have believed,"" he writes to his"
"Superior, ""that a man was so hard to kill."" He found among them"
"those who, from compassion or from a refinement of cruelty, fed"
"him, for he could not feed himself. They told him jestingly that"
they wished to fatten him before putting him to death.
The council that was to decide his fate met on the nineteenth of
"June, when to the prisoner's amazement, and, as it seemed, to their"
"own surprise, they resolved to spare his life. He was given, with"
"due ceremony, to an old woman, to take the place of a deceased"
"relative; but since he was as repulsive, in his mangled condition"
"as, by the Indian standard, he was useless, she sent her son"
"with him to Fort Orange, to sell him to the Dutch. With the same"
"humanity which they had shown in the case of Jogues, they gave a"
"for a fresh dwelling place, the hotel servants or the police raided"
her bedroom and found the little hoard of notes? This imagined
"danger made her want to cry. They were so friendless now, she in"
particular felt so completely deserted. Had she deserved this
punishment by Fate? Was there after all a God who minded much about
the sex foolishnesses and punished you for irregularities--for
"having lovers in your youth, for selling your virtue and inducing"
other women to sell theirs? Was she going to die soon and was there
a hereafter?' She burst out crying in an abandonment of grief.
An elderly gardener who had been snipping and sweeping in the next
house came up and vaguely recognized her as a well-known
"Bruxelloise, a good-natured lady, a foreigner who, strange to say,"
"spoke Flemish. ""Ach,"" he said, looking out where he thought lay the"
"source of her tears, at the dim view of beautiful Brussels through"
"the steamy glass, ""Onze arme, oude Brüssel."" Mrs. Warren wept"
"unrestrainedly. ""Madame is ill?"" he enquired. Mrs. Warren"
nodded--she felt indeed very ill and giddy. He left her and returned
"shortly with a small glass of Schnapps. ""If Madame is faint--?"" She"
sipped the cordial and presently felt better. Then they talked of
old times. Madame had kept the Hotel Leopold II in the Rue
"Royale? Ah, _now_ he placed her. A _superb_ establishment, always"
"well-spoken of. Her self-respect returned a little. ""Yes,"" she said,"
"""never a complaint! I looked after those girls like a mother, indeed"
"I did. Many a one married well from there."" The gardener"
"corroborated her statement, and added that her _clientèle_ had been"
of the most chic. He had a private florist's business of his own and
he had been privileged often to send bouquets to the pensionnaires
of Madame. But Madame was not alone surely in these sad times. Had
he not seen her come here with a handsome English lady who was said
to have been--to have been--fortunately--_au mieux_ with one of the
German officials?
they had nothing to fear. He was sorry the soldiers had helped
themselves so freely to the livestock; but everything had now
"settled down. Henceforth they would be sure of something to eat, as"
he himself had got to be fed. And all he asked of them was their
agreeable society.
"Two months went by of this strange life. Two months, in which Vivie"
only saw German newspapers--which she read with the aid of von
Giesselin. Their contents filled her with despair. They made very
"little of the Marne rebuff, much of the capture of Antwerp and"
"Ostende, and the occupation of all Belgium (as they put it). Vivie"
noted that the German Emperor's heart had bled for the punishment
"inflicted on Louvain. (She wondered how that strange personality,"
"her father, had fared in the destruction of monastic buildings.) But"
"she had then no true idea of what had taken place, and the"
far-reaching harm this crime had done to the German reputation. She
noted that the German Press expressed disappointment that the cause
"of Germany, the crusade against Albion, had received no support from"
"the Irish Nationalists, or from the ""revolting"" women, the"
"Suffragettes, who had been so cruelly maltreated by the"
administration of Asquith and Sir Grey.
"This point was discussed by the Colonel, but Vivie found herself"
speaking as a patriot. How _could_ the Germans expect British women
to turn against their own country in its hour of danger?
"""Then you would not,"" said von Giesselin, ""consent to write some"
"letters to your friends, if I said I could have them sent safely to"
"their destination?--only letters,"" he added hastily, seeing her"
"nostrils quiver and a look come into her eyes--""to ask your Suffrage"
friends to bring pressure to bear on their Government to bring this
"d-r-r-eadful War to a just peace. That is all we ask."" But Vivie"

In the meantime he received the news of the papal absolution. In
"connection with this he had, once more, to visit England, little"
dreaming that it would be the last time he should set foot on British
soil. In Ammonius's house of Saint Stephen's Chapel at Westminster on 9
"April 1517, the ceremony of absolution took place, ridding Erasmus for"
good of the nightmare which had oppressed him since his youth. At last
he was free!
Invitations and specious promises now came to him from all sides.
Mountjoy and Wolsey spoke of high ecclesiastical honours which awaited
him in England. Budaeus kept pressing him to remove to France. Cardinal
"Ximenes wanted to attach him to the University of Alcalá, in Spain. The"
Duke of Saxony offered him a chair at Leipzig. Pirckheimer boasted of
"the perfections of the free imperial city of Nuremberg. Erasmus,"
"meanwhile, overwhelmed again with the labour of writing and editing,"
"according to his wont, did not definitely decline any of these offers;"
neither did he accept any. He always wanted to keep all his strings on
his bow at the same time. In the early summer of 1517 he was asked to
"accompany the court of the youthful Charles, who was on the point of"
leaving the Netherlands for Spain. But he declined. His departure to
Spain would have meant a long interruption of immediate contact with the
"great publishing centres, Basle, Louvain, Strassburg, Paris, and that,"
"in turn, would have meant postponement of his life-work. When, in the"
"beginning of July, the prince set out for Middelburg, there to take ship"
"for Spain, Erasmus started for Louvain."
"He was thus destined to go to this university environment, although it"
"displeased him in so many respects. There he would have academic duties,"
young latinists would follow him about to get their poems and letters
"aseptics, for, ""after that he had heated his Ax red hot in the Fire,"
cauteriz'd the Wound but not with so much Art as he perform'd the other
Part for he so burnt the Flesh distant from the Place of Amputation that
"it had like to have mortify'd."" Taylor was tried and condemned to death at"
"Boston on May 12th, 1714, but for some reason not explained was reprieved."
"TEACH, CAPTAIN EDWARD, or THATCH, or THACH, _alias_ DRUMMOND, _alias_"
BLACKBEARD. Arch-pirate.
"A Bristol man who settled in Jamaica, sailing in privateers, but not in"
the capacity of an officer.
"In 1716, Teach took to piracy, being put in command of a sloop by the"
"pirate Benjamin Hornigold. In 1717, Hornigold and Teach sailed together"
"from Providence towards the American coast, taking a billop from Havana"
and several other prizes. After careening their vessels on the coast of
"Virginia, the pirates took a fine French Guineaman bound to Martinico;"
"this ship they armed with forty guns, named her the _Queen Ann's Revenge_,"
and Blackbeard went aboard as captain. Teach now had a ship that allowed
"him to go for larger prizes, and he began by taking a big ship called the"
"_Great Allen_, which he plundered and then set fire to. A few days later,"
"Teach was attacked by H.M.S. _Scarborough_, of thirty guns, but after a"
"sharp engagement lasting some hours, the pirate was able to drive off the"
King's ship.
The next ship he met with was the sloop of that amateur pirate and
"landsman, Major Stede Bonnet. Teach and Bonnet became friends and sailed"
"together for a few days, when Teach, finding that Bonnet was quite"
"ignorant of maritime matters, ordered the Major, in the most high-handed"
"way, to come aboard his ship, while he put another officer in command of"
"Bonnet's vessel. Teach now took ship after ship, one of which, with the"
"singing. In his first Preface to the _Geystliches Gesangbücklin_, 1525,"
he wrote:
"These songs have been set in four parts, for no other reason than"
because I wished to provide our young people (who both will and ought
to be instructed in music and other sciences) with something whereby
"they might rid themselves of amorous and carnal songs, and in their"
"stead learn something wholesome, and so apply themselves to what is"
"good with pleasure, as becometh the young."
"The period of the German chorales may be said to have begun with Luther,"
"1483-1546, and ended two centuries later with J. S. Bach, 1685-1750."
"Bach brought the chorale tunes to their highest perfection, using many"
of them in his larger choral works. He composed about 30 original
"chorale melodies, wrote reharmonizations for approximately 400, and"
composed many chorale preludes for the organ which are in wide use
today.
"The German hymns and chorale tunes, used constantly in the home and"
"school, as well as in the church, have been of great importance in our"
Mennonite worship in the past. They constitute the main body of material
in all our German collections of hymns. In an effort to preserve and
"emphasize this rich heritage, there was incorporated into the _Hymnary_,"
"a special section, Book III, made up exclusively of chorales."

"The Abbé spoke poor English, therefore the conversation was carried on in"
"French, much to the annoyance of some of our guests, who pretended to a"
greater knowledge of that language than they possessed.
"Soon after my presentation to the Abbé, the king arrived, and we all went"
"out to the supper table, where the Abbé's chair was on the king's right,"
with De Grammont on his Majesty's left. After the king had been seated a
"moment, he rose and asked us to be seated; so we took our places, all"
save the king dropping our hats beside us on the floor because of his
Majesty's presence.
"I sat next to De Grammont, almost opposite the Abbé, and had a good"
opportunity to observe the French emissary. The king's French was
"excellent, and the dinner conversation was carried on largely between him"
"and the Abbé. All subjects were discussed, but the Abbé adroitly avoided"
Dunkirk and seemed to prefer talking on religious and philosophical
"topics, in which he took the liberty to disagree with the king in many"
"respects, politely though positively."
"I listened attentively, hoping that some tone of the Abbé's voice, a pose"
"or a gesture, might reveal George Hamilton, if it were he, in the most"
"excellent disguise I had ever seen. But nothing of the sort occurred, and"
"before the dinner was over, I was still more convinced that whoever the"
"Abbé du Boise might be, he was not Hamilton."
"After dinner came the heavy wines, of which the Abbé did not partake, and"
"of which De Grammont and I drank sparingly. All the others, including the"
"king, were gloriously drunk long before the night was over."
"While smoking our pipes, the king, who was eager to get his hands"

[Footnote 111: I retain this statement of my explanation in almost the
same words as first written down in 1895. I was not then aware that
several psychologists had offered very similar explanations. Scherner
"(_Das Leben des Traumes_, 1861) seems to have been the first to connect"
"the lungs with dreams of flying, though he put forward the explanation"
"in too fanciful a form and failed to realise that other factors, notably"
"a change in skin pressure, are also involved. Strümpell at a later date"
"recognised this explanation, as well as Wundt.]"
[Footnote 112: It is the same with chloroform. 'There are marked
"sensations in the vicinity of the heart,' says Elmer Jones ('The Waning"
"of Consciousness under Chloroform,' _Psychological Review_, January"
"1909). 'The musculature of that organ seems thoroughly stimulated, and"
the contractions become violent and accelerated. The palpitations are
as strong as would be experienced at the close of some violent bodily
"exertion.' It is significant, also, as bearing on the interpretation of"
"the dream of flying, that under chloroform 'all movements made appeared to"
"out and maroon Captain England, and elect himself in his place. He was a"
"villain of the deepest dye, and burnt ships and houses and tortured his"
prisoners.
"The pirates sailed down the West Coast of India from Goa to Cochin, and"
returned to Mauritius. Thence sailing to the Island of Mascarine they
"found a big Portuguese ship, which they took. In her they discovered the"
"Conde de Eviceira, Viceroy of Goa, and, even better, four million dollars"
worth of diamonds.
"Taylor, now sailing in the _Cassandra_, heard that there were four"
"men-of-war on his tracks, so he sailed to Delagoa Bay and spent the"
winter of the year 1722 there. It was now decided that as they had a huge
"amount of plunder they had better give up piracy, so they sailed away to"
the West Indies and surrendered themselves to the Governor of Porto Bello.
"The crew broke up and each man, with a bag of diamonds, went whither he"
"would; but Captain Taylor joined the Spanish service, and was put in"
"command of a man-of-war, which was sent to attack the English logwood"
cutters in the Bay of Honduras.

One of Captain Phillips's crew. Wounded in the leg while attempting to
"desert. There being no surgeon on board, a consultation was held over the"
"patient by the whole crew, and these learned men were unanimous in"
agreeing that the leg should be amputated. Some dispute then arose as to
"who should act the part of surgeon, and at length the carpenter was chosen"
"as the most proper person. ""Upon which he fetch'd up the biggest saw, and"
"taking the limb under his Arm, fell to Work, and separated it from the"
Body of the Patient in as little Time as he could have cut a Deal Board in
"two."" This surgeon-carpenter evidently appreciated the importance of"
"first flowers seen after winter snows!--welcome, more welcome than"
"swift rescue to one in dire peril!--welcome, my Angel, into the"
"darkness of mortal things, which haply so sweet a Presence shall make"
bright! O sacred innocence that I am not worthy to shield! ... O
sinless beauty that I am all unfitted to claim or possess! Welcome to
"my life, my heart, my soul! Welcome, sweet Trust, sweet Hope, sweet"
"Love, that as Christ lives, I will never wrong, betray, or resign again"
"through all the glory spaces of far Eternity!"""
"As he spoke, his arms closed more surely about her,--his lips met"
"hers,--and in the mingled human and divine rapture of that moment,"
"there came a rushing noise, as of thousands of wings beating the air,"
followed by a mighty wave of music that rolled approachingly and then
"departingly through and through the Cathedral arches--and a Voice,"
"clear and resonant as a silver clarion, proclaimed aloud:"
"""Those whom GOD hath joined together, let no MAN put asunder!"""
"Then, with a surging, jubilant sound, like the sea in a storm, the"
"music seemed to tread past in a measured march of stately harmony,--and"
"presently there was silence once more,--the silence and sunshine of the"
morning pouring through the rose windows of the church and sparkling on
"the Cross above the Altar,--the silence of a love made perfect,--of"
twin souls made ONE!
And then Edris drew herself gently from her lover's embrace and raised
"her head,--putting her hand confidingly in his, a lovely smile played"
on her sweetly parted lips:

"sailed away with his prize from the harbour. This prize, amongst the"
"merchandise, contained 40,000 moidors and a cross of diamonds designed for"
the King of Portugal.
"He then took a Dutch ship, and two days later an English one, and sailed"
"back to Brazil, refitting and cleaning at the Island of Ferdinando."
"In a work such as this is, it is impossible to recount all, or even a few,"
"of the daring adventures, or the piratical ups and downs of one pirate."
Roberts sailed to the West Indies devastating the commerce of Jamaica and
"Barbadoes. When things grew too hot there, he went north to Newfoundland,"
and played the very devil with the English and French fishing fleets and
settlements.
"His first ship he called the _Fortune_, his next, a bigger ship, the"
"_Royal Fortune_, another the _Good Fortune_."
"On two occasions Roberts had been very roughly handled, once by a ship"
"from Barbadoes and once by the inhabitants of Martinica, so when he"
"designed his new flag, he portrayed on it a huge figure of himself"
"standing sword in hand upon two skulls, and under these were the letters"
"A.B.H. and A.M.H., signifying a Barbadian's and a Martinican's head."
"In April, 1721, Roberts was back again on the Guinea Coast, burning and"
plundering. Amongst the prisoners he took out of one of his prizes was a
clergyman. The captain dearly wished to have a chaplain on board his ship
"to administer to the spiritual welfare of his crew, and tried all he could"
"to persuade the parson to sign on, promising him that his only duties"
should be to say prayers and make punch. But the prelate begged to be
"excused, and was at length allowed to go with all his belongings, except"
three prayer-books and a corkscrew--articles which were sorely needed
aboard the _Royal Fortune_.
Belgium for Holland. But this last plea was said by the American
"representative to be unsustainable. For various reasons, the German"
"Government would not permit it, and he was afraid neither Vivie nor"
her mother would get enough backing from the British authorities to
strengthen the American demand. She must stop on in Brussels till
the War came to an end.
"""But how are we to live?"" asked Vivie, with a catch in her throat."
"""Our supply of Belgian money is coming to an end. My mother has"
considerable funds invested in England. These she can't touch. She
"has other sums in German securities, but soon after the War they"
stopped sending her the interest on the plea that she was an
"'enemy.' As to the money we have in Belgium, the bank in Brussels"
"can tell me nothing. What are we to do?"" The rather cold-mannered"
American diplomatist--it was one of the Secretaries of Legation and
"he knew all about Mrs. Warren's past, and regarded Vivie as an"
outlaw--said he would try to communicate with her friends in England
"and see if through the American Relief organization, funds could be"
transmitted for their maintenance. She gave him the addresses of
"Rossiter, Praed, and her mother's London bankers."
Vivie now tried to settle down to a life of usefulness. To increase
their resources she gave lessons in English to Belgians and even to
German officers. She offered herself to various groups of Belgian
ladies who had taken up such charities as the Germans permitted. She
also asked to be taken on as a Red Cross helper. But in all these
directions she had many snubs to meet and little encouragement.
Scandal had been busy with her name--the unhappy reputation of her
"mother, the peculiar circumstances under which she had left England,"
the two or three months shut up at Tervueren with Colonel von
"Giesselin, and the very protection he now accorded her and her"
mother at the Hotel Impérial. She felt herself looked upon almost as
Prussia. How he had loved England in the days when he was military
"attaché there. He had once wanted to marry an Englishwoman, a Miss"
"Fraser, a so handsome daughter of a Court Physician."
"""Why, that must have been Honoria, my former partner,"" said Vivie,"
finding an intense joy in this link of memory. And she told much of
"her history to the sentimental Colonel, who was conceiving for her a"
sincere friendship and camaraderie. They opened up other veins of
"memory, talked of Lady Feenix, of the musical parties at the Parrys,"
"of Emily Daymond's playing, of this, that and the other hostess, of"
such-and-such an actress or singer.
The Colonel of course was often absent all day on military duties.
He advised Vivie strongly on such occasions not to go far from Mrs.
"Warren's little domain. ""I am obliged to remind you, dear young"
"lady, that you and your mother are my prisoners in a sense. Many bad"
things are going on--things we cannot help in war--outside this
"quiet place..."""
"In November, however, there was a change of scene, which in many"
ways came to Vivie and her mother with a sense of great relief.
Colonel von Giesselin told them one morning he had been appointed
"Secretary to the German Governor of Brussels, and must reside in the"
town not far from the Rue de la Loi. He proposed that the ladies
should move into Brussels likewise; in fact he delicately insisted
on it. Their pleasant relations could thus continue--perhaps--who
"knows?--to the end of this War, ""to that peace which will make us"
"friends once more?"" It would in any case be most unsafe if, without"
"his protection, they continued to reside at this secluded farm, on"
"the edge of the great woods. In fact it could not be thought of, and"
another officer was coming here in his place with a considerable
suite. Eventually compensation would be paid to Mrs. Warren for any
insisted on signing the pirate articles and boasted that he was the first
"surgeon that had ever done so, and he hoped, he said, to prove as great a"
rogue as any of them.
"When the African Company's Guinea ship, the _King Solomon_, was taken,"
Scudamore came aboard and helped himself to their surgeon's instruments
"and medicines. He also took a fancy for a backgammon board, but only kept"
it after a violent quarrel with another pirate. It came out at his trial
"that on a voyage from the Island of St. Thomas, in a prize, the _Fortune_,"
"in which was a cargo of slaves, Scudamore had tried to bring about a"
"mutiny of the blacks to kill the prize crew which was on board, and he was"
"detected in the night going about amongst the negroes, talking to them in"
the Angolan language. He said that he knew enough about navigation to sail
"the ship himself, and he was heard to say that ""this were better than to"
"be taken to Cape Corso to be hanged and sun dried."""
The same witness told how he had approached the prisoner when he was
"trying to persuade a wounded pirate, one James Harris, to join him in his"
"scheme, but fearing to be overheard, Scudamore turned the conversation to"
horse-racing.
"Scudamore was condemned to death, but allowed three days' grace before"
"being hanged, which he spent in incessant prayers and reading of the"
"Scriptures. On the gallows he sang, solo, the Thirty-first Psalm. Died at"
the age of 35.
"SEARLES, CAPTAIN ROBERT."
"In 1664 he brought in two Spanish prizes to Port Royal, but as orders had"
only lately come from England to the Governor to do all in his power to
"promote friendly relations with the Spanish islands, these prizes were"
mother had better pursue: leave Tervueren and seek a lodging in
Brussels; or retreat as far as Ghent or Bruges or even Holland? The
clerk reassured her. The Germans had certainly occupied the
"south-east of Belgium, but dared not push as far to the west and"
north as Brussels. They risked otherwise being nipped between the
Belgian army of Antwerp and the British force marching on Mons....
He directed her attention to the last _communiqué_ of the Ministry
"of War: ""La situation n'a jamais été meilleure. Bruxelles, à l'abri"
"d'un coup de main, est défendue par vingt mille gardes civiques"
"armés d'un excellent fusil,"" etc."
Vivie returned therefore a trifle reassured. At the same time she
and her mother spent some hours in packing up and posting valuable
"securities to London, via Ostende, in packing for deposit in the"
strong rooms of a Brussels bank Mrs. Warren's jewellery and plate.
The tram service from Tervueren had ceased to run. So they induced a
neighbour to drive them into Brussels in a chaise: a slow and
wearisome journey under a broiling sun. Arrived in Brussels they
found the town in consternation. Placarded on the walls was a notice
signed by the Burgomaster--the celebrated Adolphe Max--informing the
Bruxellois that in spite of the resistances of the Belgian army it
was to be feared the enemy might soon be in occupation of Brussels.
"In such an event he adjured the citizens to avoid all panic, to give"
"no legitimate cause of offence to the Germans, to renounce any idea"
of resorting to arms! The Germans on their part were bound
"by the laws of war to respect private property, the lives of"
"non-combatants, the honour of women, and the exercise of religion."
Vivie and her mother found the banks closed and likewise the railway
station. They now had but one thought: to get back as quickly as
"possible to Villa Beau-séjour, and fortunately for their dry-mouthed"
impatience their farmer friend was of the same mind. Along the
"Again, in Eugene Field's “Hushaby Lady,” the language of which is most"
"simple, the child is carried away by the beauty of the sound."
I remember hearing some poetry repeated by the children in one of
the elementary schools in Sheffield which made me feel that they had
realised romantic possibilities which would prevent their lives from
"ever becoming quite prosaic again, and I wish that this practice"
were more usual. There is little difficulty with the children. I can
"remember, in my own experience as a teacher in London, making the"
experiment of reading or repeating passages from Milton and Shakespeare
"to children from nine to eleven years of age, and the enthusiastic"
"way they responded by learning those passages by heart. I have taken,"
"with several sets of children, such passages from Milton as “Echo"
"Song,” “Sabrina,” “By the rushy fringed Bank,” “Back, shepherds, back,”"
"from _Comus_, “May Morning,” “Ode to Shakespeare,” “Samson on his"
"blindness,” etc. I even ventured on several passages from _Paradise"
"Lost_, and found “Now came still evening on” a particular favourite"
with the children.
"It seemed even easier to interest them in Shakespeare, and they learned"
"quite readily and easily many passages from “As You Like It,” “Merchant"
"of Venice,” “Julius Cæsar”; from “Richard II,” “Henry IV,” and “Henry"
V.”
The method I should recommend in the introduction of both poets
occasionally into the Story-hour would be threefold.
"First, to choose passages which appeal for beauty of sound or beauty"
"of mental vision called up by those sounds: such as, “Tell me where is"
"Fancy bred,” Titania's Lullaby, “How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon"
this bank.”
"The husband died, and Mary once again donned male attire and enlisted in a"
"regiment in Holland. Soon tiring of this, she deserted, and shipped"
herself aboard a vessel bound for the West Indies. This ship was taken by
"an English pirate, Captain Rackam, and Mary joined his crew as a seaman."
"She was at New Providence Island, Bahama, when Woodes Rogers came there"
"with the royal pardon to all pirates, and she shipped herself aboard a"
privateer sent out by Rogers to cruise against the Spaniards. The crew
"mutinied and again became pirates. She now sailed under Captain Rackam,"
"who had with him another woman pirate, Anne Bonny. They took a large"
"number of ships belonging to Jamaica, and out of one of these took"
"prisoner ""a young fellow of engaging behaviour"" with whom Mary fell deeply"
"in love. This young fellow had a quarrel with one of the pirates, and as"
the ship lay at anchor they were to go to fight it out on shore according
"to pirate law. Mary, to save her lover, picked a quarrel with the same"
"pirate, and managed to have her duel at once, and fighting with sword and"
pistol killed him on the spot.
"She now married the young man ""of engaging behaviour,"" and not long after"
was taken prisoner with Captain Rackam and the rest of the crew to
"Jamaica. She was tried at St. Jago de la Vega in Jamaica, and on November"
"28th, 1720, was convicted, but died in prison soon after of a violent"
fever.
That Mary Read was a woman of great spirit is shown by her reply to
"Captain Rackam, who had asked her (thinking she was a young man) what"
"pleasure she could find in a life continually in danger of death by fire,"
"sword, or else by hanging; to which Mary replied ""that as to hanging, she"
"thought it no great Hardship, for were it not for that, every cowardly"
"Fellow would turn Pirate and so unfit the Seas, that Men of Courage must"
"starve."""
servile to be capable of feeling humiliation and too stupid to
"understand what danger is--that's the man who makes a good, steady"
soldier. We've seen men so horribly smashed up by bombs that it makes
"you sick to look at them, and then people expect us not to be afraid of"
"air-raids. The civvies haven't seen that sort of thing, so they may well"
"show plenty of pluck, although I believe there are a good many with"
"enough imagination to have the wind up when there's an air-raid on."""
"""Bloody true. You know, if there was a lot o' civvies an' a lot of"
"Tommies in a Blighty air-raid, I reckon the civvies'd show more pluck"
than the Tommies. My mate who's workin' on munitions told me 'e saw
'underds o' soldiers rushin' to take shelter in the last raid on London.
"O' course there was crowds o' civvies doin' the same, but 'e says there"
was a lot what didn't seem to care a damn. The other day we 'ad a bloody

"that's the 'ole truth o' the matter, I don't care what yer say. I didn't"
"know what fear was afore I joined the army. I know now, you bet! I'm a"
bloody coward now--I don't mind admittin' it. There's things I used ter
do what I wouldn't dare do now. When we go up the line I'm in a blue
funk from the time I 'ears the first shell burst to the time we goes
over the top. An' when we goes over I forgets everythink an' don't know
what I'm doin'. P'raps I'll get a V.C. some day wi'out knowin' what I

"""By the way,"" I interrupted, ""how did that orderly who works in the"
theatre get his Military Medal--he had the wind up more than any of us
"the other night?"""
"""I know whom you mean,"" answered a private of the R.A.M.C. ""He got it"
which the queen was giving that night. It was an unfortunate time for me
"to see Mary. My heart was full, not to overflowing, but to sinking, with"
my love of Bettina and her love of me. There was nothing I would not have
given at that time to be able to take her as my wife. I should have been
"glad to give my title, estates, and position--everything--to be a simple"
tradesman or an innkeeper so that I might take Bettina with happiness to
her and without the damning sin of losing caste to me.
It was true the king's brother had made a marriage of comparatively the
"same sort, but it is almost as impossible for a prince to lose caste as"
it is difficult for a mere baron to keep it. Bettina would not be happy
"in my sphere of life, nor could I live in hers, so what was there for me"
"to do but to keep my engagement with Mary Hamilton and, if I could, lose"
my love for Bettina.

"The queen's ball was to be held that night at St. James's Palace, and"
I was glad to have the walk from Whitehall across the park. The night was
"perfect. A slim moon hung in the west, considerately withholding a part"
of her light that the stars might twinkle the brighter in their vain
"effort to rival Bettina's eyes. The night wind came to me, odor-laden"
"from the roses, only to show me how poor a thing it was compared with"
Bettina's breath upon my cheek and its sweetness in my nostrils. Now and
"then a belated bird sang its sleepy song, only to remind me of the melody"
"of her lullabies, and the cooing dove moaned out its plaintive call lest"
I forget the pain in her breast while selfishly remembering the ache in
"my own. Then I thought of what the Good Book says about ""bright clouds,"""
and I prayed that my pain might make me a better man and might lead me to
"help Bettina in the days of her sorrowing, which I knew were at hand."

"It may do very well for a Frenchman to call it that, but we must call"
it a perfect volcano of water. A huge column goes hissing up as high as
"a steeple, with the speed and force of a rocket, and comes down in"
"thunder, and little rainbows are flitting about in the showery spray."
"It being Sunday, every thing and person is gayer than usual. Bands are"
"playing and soldiers are parading all through the town; everything,"
"indeed, is military, and yet little is foppish--a statement which to"
English ears will sound like a direct contradiction.'
Our traveller had been given letters to certain Berlin Professors from
"young Blackie, afterwards Professor of Greek in Edinburgh University,"
who had just translated Goethe's _Faust_ into the English tongue. 'I
went about half an hour ago to call upon a sort of Professor here to
whom I had a letter and a _Faust_ to present from Blackie--found him
"ill and confined to bed--was admitted, however, very well received, and"
shall call again when I think there is a chance of his being better. I
have still another Professor to call on with a letter and book from
"Blackie, and there my acquaintance with the society of Berlin is likely"
to terminate.' One other introduction to Ferrier on this expedition to
"Germany is mentioned in a note from his aunt, Miss Susan Ferrier, the"
only letter to her nephew that has apparently been preserved: whether
"or not he availed himself of the offer, history does not record. It"
runs as follows:--
"'EDINR., _1st August_."
'I could not get a letter to Lord Corehouse's German sister
"(Countess Purgstall), as it seems she is in bad health, and not fit"
to entertain vagabonds; but I enclose a very kind one from my
"friend, Mrs. Erskine, to the ambassadress at Munich, and if you"
"don't go there you may send it by post, as it will be welcome at"
liquefies in four minutes.[8]
"""And here, also, they used to have a grand procession"
"of priests, citizens, soldiers, sailors, and the high dignitaries"
"of the city government, once a year, to shave the head of a made-up"
"Madonna--a stuffed and painted image, like the milliner's dummy--whose"
hair miraculously grew and restored itself every twelve months. They
still kept up this shaving procession as late as four or five years
ago. It was a source of great profit to the church that possessed the
"remarkable effigy, and the public barbering of her was always carried"
"out with the greatest _éclat_ and display--the more the better, because"
the more excitement there was about it the larger the crowds it drew
and the heavier the revenues it produced--but at last the day came
"when the Pope and his servants were unpopular in Naples, and the city"
government stopped the Madonna's annual show.
"""There we have two specimens of these Neapolitans--two of the silliest"
"possible frauds, which half the population religiously and faithfully"
"believed, and the other half either believed or else said nothing"
"about, and thus lent themselves to the support of the imposture."""
[Sidenote: The House of the Virgin at Loretto.]
"I had read the story of the _Casa Santa_, or Holy House, the little"
"stone building, thirteen and one-half feet high and twenty-eight feet"
"long, in which the Virgin Mary had lived at Nazareth. In 336 the"
"Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage"
to Nazareth and built a church over the Holy House. This church fell
"into decay when the Saracens again got the upper hand in Palestine,"
and when the Christians lost Ptolemais the Holy House was carried by
angels through the air from Nazareth to the coast of Dalmatia. This
miraculous transportation took place in 1291. A few years later it
fewer than twelve Mrs. Teach still alive at different ports up and down
the West India Islands.
"In June, 1718, the bridegroom felt that the call of duty must be obeyed,"
"so kissing good-bye to the new Mrs. Teach, he sailed away to the Bermudas,"
"meeting on his way half a dozen ships, which he plundered, and then"
hurried back to share the spoils with the Governor of North Carolina and
"his secretary, Mr. Knight."
"For several months, Blackbeard remained in the river, exacting a toll from"
"all the shipping, often going ashore to make merry at the expense of the"
"planters. At length, things became so unbearable that the citizens and"
planters sent a request to the Governor of the neighbouring colony of
"Virginia for help to rid them of the presence of Teach. The Governor,"
"Spotswood, an energetic man, at once made plans for taking the pirate, and"
"commissioned a gallant young naval officer, Lieutenant Robert Maynard, of"
"H.M.S. _Pearl_, to go in a sloop, the _Ranger_, in search of him. On"
"November 17, 1718, the lieutenant sailed for Kicquetan in the James River,"
"and on the 21st arrived at the mouth of Okerecock Inlet, where he"
discovered the pirate he was in search of. Blackbeard would have been
"caught unprepared had not his friend, Mr. Secretary Knight, hearing what"
"was on foot, sent a letter warning him to be on his guard, and also any of"
Teach's crew whom he could find in the taverns of Bath Town. Maynard lost
"no time in attacking the pirate's ship, which had run aground. The fight"
"was furious, Teach boarding the sloop and a terrific hand-to-hand struggle"
"taking place, the lieutenant and Teach fighting with swords and pistols."
"Teach was wounded in twenty-five places before he fell dead, while the"
lieutenant escaped with nothing worse than a cut over the fingers.
"Maynard now returned in triumph in his sloop to Bath Town, with the head"
"of Blackbeard hung up to the bolt-spit end, and received a tremendous"
ovation from the inhabitants.
"Tall and angular, he kept his head in such a position that his chin"
"touched his breast.  He was the Captain's first lodger, and it was said"
"of him that he had a great deal of money hidden somewhere, and for its"
sake had nearly had his throat cut some two years ago: ever since then
"he carried his head thus. Over his eyes hung greyish eyebrows, and,"
"looked at in profile, only his crooked nose was to be seen.  His shadow"
"reminded one of a poker.  He denied that he had money, and said that"
"they ""only tried to cut his throat out of malice,"" and from that day he"
"took to collecting rags, and that is why his head was always bent as if"
incessantly looking on the ground.  When he went about shaking his
"head, and minus a walking-stick in his hand, and a bag on his back--the"
"signs of his profession--he seemed to be thinking almost to madness,"
"and, at such times, Kuvalda spoke thus, pointing to him with his finger:"
"""Look, there is the conscience of Merchant Judas Petunikoff.  See how"
"disorderly, dirty, and low is the escaped conscience."""
"Tyapa, as a rule, spoke in a hoarse and hardly audible voice, and that"
"is why he spoke very little, and loved to be alone.  But whenever a"
"stranger, compelled to leave the village, appeared in the dosshouse,"
"Tyapa seemed sadder and angrier, and followed the unfortunate about"
with biting jeers and a wicked chuckling in his throat. He either put
"some beggar against him, or himself threatened to rob and beat him,"
till the frightened mujik would disappear from the dosshouse and never
"more be seen.  Then Tyapa was quiet again, and would sit in some corner"
"mending his rags, or else reading his Bible, which was as dirty, worn,"
and old as himself.  Only when the teacher brought a newspaper and
"began reading did he come from his corner once more.  As a rule, Tyapa"
"listened to what was read silently and sighed often, without asking"
"anything of anyone.  But once when the teacher, having read the paper,"
"wanted to put it away, Tyapa stretched out his bony hand, and said,"
"""Give it to me ..."""

See you then.

What a boner!
Wait.
They check on your private communications?
They can do it.
They always find out anyway.
What if you called from outside.

Why would I do that?
- We could talk freely.
About what?
Take down my code.
Who knows.
You may need me.
I need no one.

Xavier.
Bernard. 612.
And my name is Thomas.
Thomas?
That's a nice name.
Eva is also a pretty name.
Maybe.
But it's not mine.
You're beautiful.
Why do you say that?
- Why what?
You can't say that.
It hurts me.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I find you beautiful.
That's all.
You just want to fuck me with your damn suit.
So my being pretty or ugly.
Shut up.

What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?
"Come on, shoot me."
You couldn't do it before.
You just don't have it in you.

Near the border.

They will give you anything.
Where did you get this?
My boyfriend.
He wants to kill me and take her.
And that's your daughter?
Yes.
I know you're still good inside.
I know you want to help us.
You don't know anything about me.
Please!
there will be no problems if we leave now.
I can't just leave to North Dakota!
- We have to be there Friday.
- Or what?
All done.
- That was it?
"- See, I told you I'm good."
"- No, don't worry, it's not permanent."
- Um...
Okay.
"What is this, like, some kind of memory test or something like that?"
- You'll find out.
"- Oh, okay."
You might feel a slight twinge as it initializes.
"Oh, okay."
Commencing at 5:38.
- You ready?
"- Yes, sir!"
Nearly there.
I thought I turned that off.
- All done.
You feel okay?
- Uh-huh.
Feel great.
- Watch the targets.

Um...
Is...
What do you see?
Like a... um...
Like a video game gopher.
- Is it more detailed now?
- Yeah.
"Yep, yeah."
- And now?
- Holy fuck!
So?
Women today fast for the long lives of their husbands.
You should know all this.
I do.
But how am I concerned?
Oh God!
I thought you'd fast and pray...
I've called so many other women over.
Okay.
I'll ask them to return.
No.
Let them be since they're here.
But ask me before you do it next time.
Tea?
No.
Juice?
I want nothing!
Can't I stay hungry for a day.
I can't hear you...
Just a minute.
What's going on?
What is it?
I want to hear Macarena!
Not now.
We have guests.
You can't be stubborn with me.
Now quietly come downstairs.
I'm ready.
How do I look?
You always look good.
Why are you crying?
Mom doesn't listen to me!
"Yeah, it's okay."
Look.
It's written in my notebook.
Right here.
See that?
"""It looks like her number came up."""
Let's see your notebook.
I didn't write it down.
I just thought of it.
Please.
Come on.
Can you believe this guy?
You know what?
"I'm going to have your badge, Officer..."
"Come on, Shifty."
Let's walk it off.
Excuse me.
I'm Stan Lawrence.
I'm the station manager.
Here's that list you wanted.
Oh.
"Great, great, great."
I'll make sure they get it.
How long did she work here?
Not long.
Just a few weeks.
I still can't believe it.
I...
I should have put more lights back here.
"Oh, no, no, no, no."
You can't blame yourself.
It was at midnight.
"He's got your looks, too."
And your brains.
Oops!
I noticed that.
She's a smart little thing-- smart.
Hey!
"Hey, where you going?"
She'll be all right.
Have a date.
Come on.
Come on.
Okay...
Marion.
What's this?
It's a date.
You eat 'em.
"How come you haven't found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids, like your friend Sallah?"
Who says I haven't?
I do.
Dad had you figured a long time ago.
He said you were a bum.
"Oh, he's being generous."
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
"You know, he loved you like a son."
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
"Not much, just you."
"Marion, get out of here!"
Duck!
Right.
Shh!
Shh!
Marion!
Come here.
Give me a hug.
Give me a hug.
What's the matter?
You can tell me.
We tell each other everything.
Do we?
Hello?
I'll meet you there.
- Hi.
- Did Marissa come back?
You smell like smoke.
"Yeah, we hot-boxed in Nordlund's car."
And didn't invite me?
"Dude, that kid was messed up."
- He was breathing.
- I hope so.
I can't believe this.
This house is cursed.
- You the owner?
"- Yes, I am."
What happened?
Not sure yet.
But it looks like somebody's been living here.
What?
It's my fault.
- You're okay.
- Disappointed?
Where you going?
Don't know.
"We both keep our mouths shut, they may never know it was us."
- What are you doing?
- You can do it.
I have faith in you.
- You...
- You what?
- You sw... ine!
- Help!
Help!
- Hold on!
Don't panic!
Don't panic?
!
I can't swim!
Help!
Help!
(Splutters)
What the devil are you doing here?
Day and night service.
I reported your leaky bottom for you.
- Are you all right?
- (Mayley) Yes.
Take him home.
He's a valued friend of mine.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
- Home to a hot drink.
We don't want you getting pneumonia.
Good night.
"Good night, sir."
"Come along, my darling."
Don't call me darling!
I'm sorry.
I should have thanked you for saving my life.
Half a crown?
"- Thanks, madam."
Beto...
Tomorrow I'll come to talk to you.
"- All right, madam."
Merry Christmas.
The new owners will move in next week.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
"I want to help you, but I don't know how."
I don't want to leave.
You could remarry.
"I can't live with anybody, I am a weird man."
So many years have passed.
"- Yes, madam, 30."
"Can you please leave me alone, Beto?"
"Yes, madam."
"Hello, Too."
"Fine, and you?"
I am calling to ask you for a favour.
Can you get a job for Beto?
"Yes, we all feel the same."
"Yes, I'll do that."
Of course.
I send you a kiss.
Bye.
One moment.
We'd better go.
Hello?
"Hey, Lupe!"
Why?
Right.
Can't someone else go?
"Really, really fun."
- What are you do...?
- We're just getting into it.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"No, this has been a good hang, but I think it's time to bye-bye."
"- Oh, that's... that's it?"
- Yeah.
Where do your serving spoons go?
Second drawer to the left.
"Thank you, Doctor."
I really love bonding with you.
Next time let's not dwell on Matt.
"You know, he's gone."
Who the hell have you been talking t...?
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Uh, hanging out with my sisters?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, thought I'd give it a try."
Was worried it might be weird.
Turns out I'm right.
How are you... how are you doing?
Fine.
You?
Fine.
Also.
Great.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
(sighs)
"I came in here to yell at you, and, uh, now I'm just sad."
Unless they've got a special job like you.
"- What about the navy, Billy?"
"- I've been thinking about the navy, but..."
"- Well, I can't swim a stroke."
- Then the air force is out.
- Why?
"- Well, you haven't got wings, have you?"
"- Take these over, love."
- Thank you.
"- All the best, love."
- Thank you.
- All the very best.
- Thank you.
Thanks very much.
Mrs Rose?
"David, darling."
I think I'd better go and get changed.
- Can I help?
"- No, you can't."
"Well, my boy, when do you join your squadron?"
"Tomorrow, sir."
A Spitfire.
I saw her yesterday.
Lovely kite.
There we are.
"Mama, I'm so happy."
"Oh, darling."
- He is a lovely boy.
- Isn't he.
Darling...
"Off you go, Emma."
Both of you.
"No, I'm good."
"I fixed up the guest room for you, but I thought maybe we'd go out to lunch first."
"I kinda just wanna crash, if that's cool."
Sure.
Sure.
It's cool.
Very cool.
Do you want me to show you where the room is?
- I'll find it.
- Yeah.
You can find it.
You're good like that.
He can find it.
I hope it's your daughter... who's gonna decide which home to put you in.
"Well, this is fun."
The two of us.
Getting a chance to talk and catch up... and shoot the breeze.
So how's school?
- Good.
- Oh.
Yeah?
"Well, you certainly have a lot to say..."
To someone.
- What?
- Nothing.
You know.
I text.
So I get it.
"Sorry, what did you say, mom?"
"You know, lol."
Omg.
Om-- you know what--g.
-No!
Is it wrong?
.
-I called her because she's my friend!
-Because Bela is your ex!
I don't care!
What does it have to do with this?
"Remember this, you can't leave the house"
-if I'm not with you.
-What did you say?
.
I'm not leaving?
.
That's not going to happen!
What?
Are you smothering me now?
.
Is that it?
-Is that what you want to happen?
.
-No.
I'll make sure you're not cheating on me
"That's why wherever you will go, you'll have to bring me along!"
"If you want to know, fine!"
If you're always like that...
-Why?
What are you going to do?
.
-I'm really going to leave you!
-Give that to me!
Give it!
-What the--
I'll be in front of the store at 7. I'll wait for you!
I wasn't going to go back to the department store.
Yes!
Oi!
What are you doing!
?
She's dead!
That's him.
That must be him.
It's revenge because she told everyone about him peeping into her room.
Who?
Who the hell is he!
?
He's not here.
He must've run away.
Where the hell is he!
?
Please don't be silly.
What do you think you're doing with that gun?
Get your hands off!
Stop it!
Stop it!
There he is.
That's him.
That's the guy!
Tomorrow night at seven.
Just one more time.
I'm used to being disappointed.
Tomorrow night at seven...
I want to see her.
I want to meet her.
I heard that you'd finished.
- What did the admiral say?
- Say?
About Harvey.
No objection.
"After all, it's the custom."
- Time to find your sea legs.
- Thank you.
- Get your things.
We'll get settled.
- I'm ready.
Harvey.
"Sorry, Mother."
"Goodbye, my dear."
Look after yourself.
"- Goodbye, Mother."
- Wait for me below.
- He'll find things a bit different.
- He's only 12.
Don't worry.
He'll be fine.
How long this time?
A year?
"- Less, perhaps."
"- Only ""perhaps""?"
- I hate goodbyes on the jetty.
- I know what you'll say.
- So I'll take my leave now.
- You left me days ago when you caught sight of the sea.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
God keep you both.
- What do you think of her?
Ok.
Oh... you know you love it.
"Ooh, you like that?"
"Huh, what about here?"
"Oh, work it."
Work it.
You better tag me in all these photos.
"Ok, I like that."
Oh.
Hey.
"No, seriously."
I can't find Drew.
I'm sure he's just finishing getting ready.
"Seven, you ever think about marriage?"
Do I ever think about marriage?
"To who, you?"
No.
Never.
No.
"Do you ever think about, you know having a family."
Kids?
"Yeah, I mean I want to."
Do you ever think about marrying a guy?
Maybe.
If they ever make it legal.
Or if I ever move to Canada.
Right.
"What about you, Dale?"
Do you ever want to get married?
"Excuse me, Dale?"
Hi.
We're gonna close the front doors now.
I-I...
Did.
"You only dated him, what... twice?"
"Right, twice."
"So, on 50% of your dates, you slept with rob."
Or you... you could say
I only slept with him on half our dates.
Wow.
What?
Nothing.
I just...
I never thought of you as...
What?
Easy.
Easy?
"Well, you wouldn't sleep with me until our fifth date."
You were married.
So are we!
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Do not go there.
You categorically told me we were over.
Right.
"In fact, the night that rob and I..."
N-n-n-n...
I actually called and asked if you wanted me to cancel my date.
And what did you say?
"""Go."
"Go."""
"I meant ""go on a date,"" not ""go fuck him""!"
Oh...
God!
Why did you have to tell me?
Stop.
Fresco.
"Hold up, hold up."
I do something wrong?
Nah.
I'm saying I want the whole thing tonight.
Oh.
Wow.
You cool with that?
Yeah.
Yeah?
"I don't want to see shit, a'ight?"
You won't see nothing.
Okay.
Damn.
(Gasping)
Damn.
Can I ask you something?
What's up?
"Well, you know when we met,"
How you said you were gonna take me out?
Yeah.
"Well, how come you don't take me out?"
How come you only ask me to come to your room?
"What, you don't like coming over here?"
"No, of course I do."
"I'm just saying, like..."
How come we don't we go out?
"You know like, to the movies, or to eat?"
Cause that shit is whack.
I don't think its whack.
Whatever.
Doesn't matter.
I still know she doesn't hate you.
How?
I'm a daughter too.
Vi?
She left.
Where did she go?
To get more bullets.
"Listen carefully, Daisy."
"When she comes back,"
I need for you to be the one to put me down.
It's very important.
Why me?
"Cause you and me are friends, right?"
"- I guess, but..."
- Will you promise me that?
- I can't.
- I need you to promise me.
- But I can't.
- I need you to do this for me.
- I can't.
- I need you to do this for me!
"- No, I can't!"
"- Don't argue with me, April!"
- But I'm Daisy.
- Just don't argue with me girl!
You promise me.
Say it.
- I promise.
- You promise?
"I said I would, didn't I?"
I have something to show you.

Who the hell is laughing!

Whos that!

Hey!
Did you laugh!

You laughed!
"Sorry, sir."
What the hell is sorry!

You will say the dialogues!
"Ok, sir."
III say it if you want.
Come!

You two could be perfect strangers.
"I think the one thing that we can agree on, today, is that you guys should be doing a lot better than just ""works."""
Pretty sure that's why you're here.
Oh.
That's it.
Great.
"Great job, everybody."
Thank you.
Lucy?
"Good day, sir."
I got room service for you.
I'm very sorry.
I didn't order that.
"I think your wife, she called me for you."
I'm...
This is just...
"Because I got a sunburn, 'cause it was..."
The sun was very strong today.
Yeah.
I know.
"This is good for sunburns, right?"
No.
Okay.
"It's good, yeah?"
It's good for sunburn?
"Okay, so I don't see anything."
See what?
There's nothing to see.
"Yeah, yeah, no, no, no."
It works great.
"Okay, I move now."
No.
"Phew, it smells."
It's some kind of a gas.
Come on.
You OK now?
"Yes, thank you."
This is some kind of science place.
- How'd you get here?
- It was Tony.
He was here.
I saw something!
What was it?
It's where Tony is.
I'm sure of it!
"A big, round shape."
A doughnut!
He's eating a doughnut.
No way!
Is it like a ball?
A great big ball?
- Yes.
- I know where he is.
Let's go!
"Hurry, let's go."
"Oh, thank you."
And thanks for everything.
"Come on, let's go."
We are about to make scientific history.
"And some money, too, I hope."
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.
It's a red light on the cooling system.
It must be a circuit breaker.
Restart the system.
(laughter)
- Fuck?
What the fuck?
How did you do that?
- I didn't do that.
It just happened.
"- Come on, what do you think--"
- Don't fucking touch me.
"Now, just tell me how you did it."
How the fuck did you do that?
Horace:
"Hey, it's a trick."
Horace Sr:
"Tell him it's a trick, please."
Horace:
It's a trick.
- I don't know any tricks.
I just watch nature happen.
- Nature?
You fucking freak!
What?
"My eyes didn't see that, all right?"
What did you do?
What happened?
"- It's all right, Pete, it's a trick."
He's doing-- Show him the trick.
- I don't know.
Horace:
Show him the trick or we need you to go.
- I don't know.
Here.
(glass breaking)
I found it.
It's on the floor.
You should be nicer.
"Eat a D, Nancy."
Sorry about that.
"Dude, that was so embarrassing, man."
"Dude, we suck."
Hey.
I took it right out before I gave it back.
"I knew we had it, man!"
- Shh!
"- Way to go, dude."
"Ooh, gets you all..."
"adrenaline, endorphins."
- I know.
- It's like a drug.
I know.
"Hey, you think this is how she felt when she took us?"
"I mean, what if we don't even recognize her?"
She might not recognize us.
"We need to get cleaned up, man."
We're less than an hour away.
"Going out for a few hours, Viv."
- See you later.
"- Okay, have good day."
- Good.
You're still here.
"- Hello, Mr. Heller."
"I almost done and, get out of here."
I go now.
"No, stay."
Please.
They arrested an innocent man?
Laughter.
* You can not tell you.
How can I do myself?
I find that?
"* Fend for you, miss."
The phone rings.
...
* You are very Melanie at Lupin.
Speak after the beep.
Bip.
"* Melanie, it was Jonathan."
I know where you're not.
ll have much time.
Remember me.
Kisses.
A knock.
...
You thought I would let you do that?
You see?
You wanted to screw up my marriage but yours takes off.
"That is good, the informers."
With what I told the cops Mamadou tone must be on the plane.
The airport!
Bitch!
"It is where, his fund puts forth?"
Damn ...
"So that, it goes there."
The engine.
Oh no.
Starts!
Starts!
Hey.
Is this from Vimy Ridge?
It is.
Did you shoot Germans in it?
Say again.
Did you shoot Germans in it?
Occasionally.
I can let myself in.
Mam might be asleep.
I'll just see you in.
What's this?
Herbert Kirkby.
From the choir.
Has he done something wrong?
"No, no."
"With it being late, I thought I'd see him to the door."
Right.
Yes.
"Very good, then."
"Baker did very well, as they all did."
The concert.
"He killed Germans in this, Mam."
Very nice.
"You go in, Baker, you chump."
"Sorry you missed it, Mrs Baker."
You'll perhaps manage for a future occasion.
Right.
"You won't be too cold, will you?"
No.
We're in the sun.
"We won't be sitting long, will we?"
"Now, lunch."
That was just an accident.
Come on.
Cheers.
- Straight As!
How does it feel?
- OK.
The best in the country.
"The minister of education says hi, by the way."
Don't you ever get laid?
- Of course I do.
- What now?
I'm going to do law at Harvard.
- I'II visit.
- Are we partying or what?
- I'm not sure about that.
- It's only X. Total love drug.
- We need love.
- I can't swallow pills.
- Just for fun.
"- What about you, kiddo?"
"Alex, isn't it tough always being daddy's boy?"
He's right.
You're such a girl.
Is it because your dad's a high court judge?
All right.
"- Welcome to the club, kiddo."
- He's doing it!
Cool!
Mind out.
Is he dead?
"Wake up, Alexander!"
Hi.
- Who is it?
- Huh?
Nothing.
"Sorry, not here."
It's really not there?
"No, I looked everywhere."
"Well, could you see me down here for a second?"
Me?
Why?
Only for a little while.
I just want to buy you a nice meal.
"Alright, I'll be right down."
- Okay.
- Okay.
Where are you going?
Who was it?
It's Sunhee.
She wants to see me.
Why?
I don't know.
I'll be back soon.
Take your cellphone.
What's she got to say?
"Yeah, I have my phone."
When did you arrive here?
You saw me yesterday morning.
Sure my wallet's not there?
Why do you make me repeat the same answer?
I'm sorry.
Something very important to me is in there.
You wanted to see me because of that?
Not at all.
I'm his uncle!
Jong-gu!
"Heung-guk, how could you do this?"
Sergeant.
"Did it with this, I guess."
"Stabbed him, like, 20 times?"
Holy shit.
What's that?
Looks like the body was moved here after the murder.
What a mess.
That's Cho-the husband?
Looks that way.
I'll be damned.
And the kid?
We took him to a relative
Why'd he do it?
"I don't smell booze on him, but he's not talking."
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?
What the hell happened?
"How's it going, Sergeant?"
I'm his uncle!
Let go of me!
Rotten bastard.
Couldn't he use GPS?
Why do I have to take him?
Ain't that it?
Get the wire cutters.
Pull it back.
What's that stink?
So.
Cho was killed here.
Paris.
Champs Elysees.
Gracefully.
Okay.
"And now, walk as if a string is pulling you from the crown of your head."
Walk as if you're hanging in midair.
"I said string, not rope."
"Yes, keep walking, good."
Shoulders down and turn around.
And...
Other side.
Walk with your foot in the air and...
Keep going.
It went really well today.
Good.
We did two more scenes.
Great.
I thought you'd come back.
You're mad at me.
Why?
You should move out.
You're paying rent for nothing.
"I'm going away, Dad."
Where to?
For how long?
I don't know.
Overseas is good.
You think so?
Yes.
I think your mother would be very proud of you.
"Good night, Gonki."
"Good night, Daddy."
And promise me you're not talking to your brother!
No.
Promise me.
Otherwise I'm very angry!
Promise me!
Give me your cell phone.
Now!
House arrest!
She wants to pull us apart.
Does that hurt?
- Does that hurt?
- No.
Does that hurt?
"Mama, please come back."
I'll do anything you want.
"Please, come back."
All I want is for you to come back to us.
Elias?
Cut another bit away at your ear.
There?
Better?
Now we look the same.
Now she can't keep us apart.
It's me.
Open the door.
Are we friends again?
I'm not angry anymore.
Please open the door.
Well?
Are we friends again?
I got something.
Thanks.
You've... already ruined me.
Exactly what do you want?
Your life.
Back then...
I had no choice.
You're saying you had no choice back then?
You don't have a choice now either...
you have to die.
No!
No!
NO!
Don't come.
Don't come.
Don't come.
Don't come.
Don't come.
Don't come!
Don't come.
Don't come.
I beg of you!
Please save me!
I beg of you!
I...
I...
Please save me...
The classified document is in the car crusher at the junkyard.
"Lee Yoon Sung,"
You reveal it.
Kim Young Joo!
Did you find it?
Upon the terrorist bombing attack at the Aung Sung Mausoloeum by North Korea.
It was asserted that the North needed to be punished.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
"Hey, I got it."
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
Which dude?
- That dude?
- Yeah.
No way.
He'd kick my ass.
True that.
"- This is so hard, you know?"
- Yeah.
I know.
It's simple.
"If you ask a cop if he's a cop, he's, like, obligated to tell you."
It's in the Constitution.
Constitution of America?
So go ahead and ask.
- You a cop?
"- No, no."
Not like that.
"Ask it, like, official."
Are you a police officer?
"No, I am not a police officer."
"Okay, then."
Hundred and seventy-five for a teenth.
"The price is the price, yo."
All right.
There you go.
Enjoy.
"Thanks, man."
Albuquerque Police!
The oldest and the ugliest.
You should beat me.
If you want...
-Beat her?
"-Come on, do it!"
"Move the lights, pay attention!"
"Get out of the way, quicly, quickly!"
Yeah you want me to hate you?
Whatever you want I'll do it.
I'm so ugly and you're so beautiful I think you should hit me.
"C'mon, hit me."
"Hit me,"
"You ugly old whore, you make me sick."
Cunt!
Let me see your beautiful cock.
And let me do it for you baby.
I'll do it and you could hit me if I do it wrong.
Beg for it.
You asked for it.
Let me see your beautiful cock.
"Come on baby, I'll do it good."
Come on.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
I can't.
Do it!
Do it!
I can't.
Beg for it.
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself.
"Come on, beautiful!"
Open up!
"Ursula, you're my dream girl."
I've been dreaming about you for months.
My name's not Ursula.
What is it?
Suzanne.
How old are you?
I don't know.
Have any kids?
Why not?
"Ursula, be mine!"
Only three bucks!
Damn bitch!
Always suspicious.
Always messing around.
I'm getting fed up.
Got any bright ideas?
I might if I had some bread.
Hold on.
Whas up?
An idea.
What?
Is staring you in the face.
Is still warm.
Don't start in again.
"Feels good, doesn't it?"
How's that for a smooth ride?
Hydraulic suspension.
"Come on, don't crap your pants."
Want some toilet paper?
"I hardly think she'd have the nerve to appear, let alone testify."
Have you heard what happened?
I was there.
I saw it.
You...
You mean you saw the man?
Did I?
"He was very suave, sophisticated."
A man of the world.
"You know, Nancy never had a chance."
"Well, that explains everything."
I'll let you see for yourself.
(ALL MURMURING)
Mr. Wilbur Hoolick.
WILBUR:
Hello.
I...
I can do a trick!
Want to see it?
"Excuse me, Aunt Nancy, I'm gonna do a..."
Help me with the trick.
"Oh, Wilbur, stop."
Help me with the trick!
I want to do it!
One trick.
Hold my hands and then...
All right.
Oh!
I landed right on my feet.
Very suave.
"And, uh, and a good trick."
"Oh, swords!"
- No.
Oh no you didn't.
"Listen, it doesn't matter."
"Arrest all of us, okay."
Just take us with you.
Just get us out of here.
Help me!
Don't trust her!
"No, wait."
They're with me.
They saved me.
It's him.
He's been keeping me prisoner for weeks.
You.
Get your face on the ground right now.
He's a psychopath.
He did things to me.
I told you she's innocent.
"My God, are you all right?"
"C'mere, it's gonna be okay."
Just take me away.
Oh God.
C'mere.
Angie.
"Angie, I need backup right now."
"It's over, I can't believe it's over."
Ow.
Pick the lock.
Why?
"Those videos that we saw, who was holding the camera?"
There was someone else in the room.
"Angie, I need back up right now."
Do what I said!
Clear out or I'll call the cops!
Cops don't scare us!
"Down, everyone!"
Noses on the floor!
Move it!
Strip!
Kill me instead!
A short poem...
"I wrote it, so listen!"
"""Eddy..."
"""Loyal friend, goodbye,"
"""Prince of the B.R.I.!"
"""You're a man so true,"
"""We will all miss you."
"""Beloved by everyone,"
"""Without enemies, not a one."
"""You're so dear..."
Shaddup!
"""That we'll all shed a tear,"
"""A new life you've found, now you're Riviera-bound,"
"""Why go away, leaving Titi this way?"""
"Great, Titi!"
The gift!
"We'll see you soon, dear Eddy!"
"We'll meet again, for sure!"
"Shit, guys!"
A mouse!
Let's split!
"Bye, thanks."
- How you getting home?
- A ride with Smao.
- Darling.
"- Here, sweetie."
Excuse me.
Quico!
Maria is here.
- Look at her beard!
"- ""Her""?"
"Careful, kid!"
"What, you think my wife's beard is fake?"
- Is she really a woman?
"- Yes, sir."
Don't you mind that she has a beard?
I sure don't.
And she doesn't mind that I'm a fire eater.
- You eat fire?
- I do.
Do it for us.
Eat it!
Eat it!
Gather 'round for my amazing trick!
I am about to take this wooden match and light it!
Let's hear it!
Eat more fire!
"Just one more time, if you please."
Do not try this at home.
It's dangerous.
Playing with fire means you pee...
In bed!
Eyes on the fire.
"That's enough, Foguinho."
We have a show tonight.
Your stomach can't take this.
"- Elizabeth, how are you doing?"
- Fine.
Good.
"Well, we'll catch up downstairs."
- I heard rumors.
"- All true, I'm afraid."
The one face I missed seeing in Recovery.
"I'm so sorry, Robert."
"What, about my arm or about not being there?"
- How are you healing?
- Hurts like a son of a bitch.
You?
Any sensory function yet?
Nope.
It's a motorcycle accident.
I have to go.
I'm sorry.
- Dr. Corday.
How was London?
- Good.
Timed your trip right.
Missed the pox scare we had.
- So I hear.
- How's Ella?
- Fine.
- Is it nice to be back?
I'm off to the ER.
I'll let you know.
Okay.
"Well, good luck."
"- Bite me, panty smellers!"
"- Ma'am, you need to calm down!"
"Come on, let's sit down."
Here's to the family.
Salute.
"I'm so charged, Sonny."
I never felt this way before in my whole life.
"I know, man, it's a great feeling."
"I mean, things are looking up."
This has got to be the beginning of some good stuff for us.
You know?
It's got to be.
"I'm so happy for you, man."
"Thanks, man."
How's the club?
It's great.
I couldn't ask for anything better.
I got more money than I know what to do with.
That's the way it should be.
"Yes, sir."
Oh.
We're smiling.
Must've been when we first landed.
Yeah.
You know who's in that picture?
You and me.
No.
It's me... and the godfather of my son.
You're kidding.
"That's what Julia wants, too?"
Yeah.
What do you say?
Yeah!
You bet!
- Very loud.
"Yeah, it's very intense."
This is what men listen to.
Yeah!
This is like Satan's lullaby.
It's brutal!
It's masculine!
Yeah.
Who wants margs?
- I would love a marg.
- I'll take a marg.
Man marg.
"It's not strawberry, I hope you don't mind."
It's just traditional.
That's cool.
That's cool.
I'm okay with that.
"He also said, ""rocks,"" but whatever."
"You know, men, they..."
"Sometimes they don't get what they want, and they deal with it."
- They deal.
- 'Cause we're men.
Who the heck brought lettuce on this trip?
Men don't eat lettuce!
- I didn't pack lettuce.
- Men don't eat lettuce.
But I will put some Lawry's salt on these burgers.
Both:
Lawry's.
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"- I like that, man."
"- Yo, Blaze."
"Cooper, get to the door."
"It's gonna be like my mum, I don't know, dead."
- Your mum?
- Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.
- Your mother is not in there.
- You're not in control of this!
It's in my head.
It fucking knows.
It knows.
- It knows!
- It knows what?
It knows I got this thing with my mum.
"Cooper, I promise you, she's not in there."
- Now open the door.
"- Oh, my God."
It's the only way I can get you out.
Listen to me.
"Okay, Okay."
Fuck.
Okay.
Whatever's in there cannot harm you.
"But I can't get you out unless you open that door, Cooper."
Okay.
Would you kindly open the door?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Okay.
"Okay, okay, I'm in the room."
Where's the access point?
Access point?
- There is no access point.
- What?
We're going to have a baby.
"Which, frankly, scares the hell out of me."
It'll be great.
Yeah.
"I'm sure it will, at times."
And at times I'm sure I'll be exhausted and angry and think I've made a total mess of my life.
I'll be there.
"You will, won't you?"
Even if I get confused and strange and horrible.
"Yeah, I'll do my best."
"I will, too."
"Connie, we're gonna have a baby."
I know.
That's great.
LUC:
I'm... (STAMMERlNG)
I'm going to be a father!
You're going to be an aunt!
(CONNlE laughing)
"Girls,"
I think you should come upstairs.
I'll be right here.
"You will, won't you?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's good.
"That's very, very good."
Commander.
What is it?
A group of people escaped the blockade.
What?
Stop!
Stop Mister!
Stop your r!
Hey!
Stop it Mister!
- Are you a part of these items?
- I am extra load!
I was extra load but now I am notll got rid of it!
"Let it be here, I will come back soon!"
- What are your burdens?
"- Those are my burden, can't you see them?"
The burden of misery and adversity!
The burden of cowardice!
What's your relationship with her'?
She is my sister!
- Your sister?
- Yes.
- Your sister?
- Yes.
Hey!
Mister!
Mister!
Officer!
My carfs wheel is there.
It's forbidden.
That's my wheel fell down there.
Go!
Go!
"No entrance, it's forbidden."
Ok!
But it has gone there itself!
"Go, go."
You might be able to catch him.
Come with me.
But-
Please!
Go to see him in Ito.
He's important for you.
Do you have money?
"Yes, I have some."
Good.
"When you see him, give him my regards."
Yes.
You're going to get me into trouble
What have you been doing these days?
"It's incredibly hard to be with you, but at the same time,"
I'm so lonely without you.
I'm terrible.
It's too late.
Too late for what?
Why?
"No, let me go."
It's late.
Let's go home.
I've always considered you very important.
I'm in your heart.
I still do.
"Well, good night."
What are you doing here?
It's a holiday.
What's wrong with you?
"You look sick, you know."
I went to see Kayama-sensei.
Did you see him?
I'm dead!
Hurry up!
You're so slow!
My God!
Sissoko!
"Hurry up, Niaré!"
- What's going on?
"- Greetings, Sissoko."
- I was waiting for you.
- Why?
- You called me.
- I don't remember.
That must be it.
"You know, Niaré, you lose your head easily in this world."
"Let's go in and talk, then."
I'm very short of time.
"- Come in, please."
- I'm afraid I can't.
I'll send you a message by phone tomorrow.
Good bye.
Do you need to whine?
Can't you see I'm not well?
"Right, you're ill!"
What was he doing here?
Who?
Niaré!
He came because you invited him.
You asked him to wait here.
You know very well that I didn't call him.
How could I?
I wasn't there.
You're not going to cry over that.
What's happening here?
What are you talking about?
.
Brother Migs!
"If you're always like that,"
-Why?
What are you going to do?
.
-I will really leave you!
...as her husband.
Brother!
Brother!
Oh no...
"Where are we going, sir?"
Do you know the way to Makati?
I'm lost.
I don't know...
I don't know how to go.
Bring me there.
Don't you have a car?
.
I'm Pacio by the way.
You're the one who cured my wife.
But she's doing fine now.
"But I really ran after him, sis."
I have searched almost the whole block but I really didn't see him anymore.
You chased him?
.
Then why didn't' you reach him?
What if something bad happens to him?
"Okay, change your clothes now okay?"
.
Hello?
"Hello, everything is fine here."
She got the boy from the bus.
- Good.
Hold on a second.
- One minute.
They aren't going home.
- Where are they going?
- How should I know?
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Sinan?
What are we going to do?
Shall we get out of here?
Candan is inside playing the violin.
"One's here, the other's there."
"Wait a little, just wait."
"I don't know, do something."
Follow them.
Follow them?
I said they got into the cab and left.
"Good, okay."
Hello?
Uluc?
I am going to kill you.
We're going to follow that car.
What are we going to do now?
How the hell should I know?
"Besides, why did you come here?"
The line got cut and I freaked out.
What's up with the violin sound?
What's going on?
So that we may continue the climb.
So it is witnessed.
So it will be.
So it will be.

He's more use alive than dead.
More use to who?
I can't tell you that.
"The government gave Carlos Mejia, the man who gunned me down in cold blood, a deal?"
Yes.
And you let that happen.
"I didn't have a choice, Cali."
You didn't have a choice.
That doesn't sound like you.
[Phone ringing]
[Sniffles]
[Phone ringing]
- Mills.
- You need to come in.
- What's going on?
- Tell you when you get here.

Sheena
Here I am.
Shall we...?
- Take it easy
Pump it up
- It's pumped.
Look
It's nothing.
"- Raj, where have you been?"
As usual.
Caught up with a girl
Girl...?
- I help her onto the train
And she falls for me.
- What...?
He bored me.
"He had me all alone, and he began flirting"
Same old hat... haven't I seen you before?
She sidled up to me.
- What?
I was scared!
"Only so much space, and there she was with me"
Then?
- Then what?
She was lost in my eyes
He was after my eyes.
Wouldn't shut up.
Boys these days...
These girls!
I just managed to come out unscathed
What's that?
"Addons Yes I see, Gwen, but do not worry."
Addons you will receive another assignment.
Addons you have to seduce Max.
You should store it somewhere.
We can not go from here ...
I can not see it.
You have seen.
"You must be clean, Max."
Asshole.
I killed him anyway.
Release.
Be careful.
Sitting quietly.
Lord!
Damn.
That's all right.
Do you think this plane was going to die?
I do not know.
Maybe.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Please help me.
"If not, my brother would die."
I can not afford it.
- What do you do now?
What?
- Luggage can be accessed here.
- Please.
- That's what I thought.
- Wait.
"- In my bag, I have a laptop."
With him we have access to the Internet.
He's my arch enemy...
in affairs of the heart!
Alright!
I promise you!
I won't be with him after you've rescued him!
Really?
"Yes, I really mean it."
Will you come with me then?
"Sure I will, wherever you go!"
Yoyo's locked up there.
- So high above!
- Let's go!
- Over there!
- OK!
From here!
I go first!
Come up.
Hurry!
Hurry up!
Old friend!
I feel good now!
- Commissioner!
- Yes sir!
Did he tell you where the 'Beast' is?
Ask him!
"Yoyo, tell us."
I won't!
"I'll let you go if you tell us where it is, or else..."
You'll get Amelian!
"(A million) ln that case, I won't say anything!"
- What?
Bring him Amelian!
It tires me out.
That's the Kung Fu Grandpa passed on to us.
Use your fingers.
I can't use it to fight.
Who lost a coin?
"Me, I lost a coin."
I lost a coin.
Who did that?
Bastard!
You soiled my laundry!
I'll get you!
It's not me!
Nothing to do with me!
"- Not me, not me!"
- Don't deny it!
I'll teach you a lesson!
Stop!
Brother Foon.
We're mates.
"Let me show you around, build up your confidence."
How do I get confident?
You mean...
Don't make it sound so bad.
You're learning the Tao of life.
- Tao of life?
"- Yes, let's go."

"Marshal, please come in."
What kind of place is this?
This is the most upmarket brothel in GuangZhou.
- Brothel?
- Yes.
I can take the pills myself.
"Okay, fine."
Will you come visit?
You call and we'll make a date.
"I'll get some licorice, coffee, tea, whiskey."
You name it.
Okay.
"Take care of yourself, alright?"
Thank you for everything.
I'll be waiting.
"Let's go by the house first, I'll change my shirt."
"But I brought the one you wanted, it looks nice on you."
Where do you want to sit?
- Next to you.
I don't want to go.
You're kidding me.
"Goni, please."
"Daddy, do as I say."
Don't talk to your father like that.
Don't tell me what to do.
Goni.
Let's give it a pass.
I can't.
Daddy.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Come on.
I'm sorry.
"I'm sorry, come on."
You'll be okay.
Mr. Ben-Shmuel.
Alex Dolgin's secretary asked me to take you to the rehearsal.
"-Aye, free."
And we'II take them together!
Is that the best you can do?
I'd say we've wiped out our bounty-hunter problem.
-For now.
-Aye.
For now.
I was wrong about you.
I acted foolishly as well.
"No hard feelings, aye?"
I'II buy you a refreshment.
"please, allow me."
I shall buy you a refreshment.
"No, no, I'II buy you one."
I insist.
"No, I must buy you one, to make amends."
It's all right.
I'II buy.
"-No, I will buy."
-I'II buy.
"-No, I will buy."
-I'II buy.
"-No, I will."
-I will.
-I will.
-Me!
Me!

"Please, I don't mean to interrupt but am I close to the end of this bridge?"
"No, far from it."
"Higher, all the way."
That's it.
You're awful big for 12.
"Oh, it's glands."
The whole family had glands.
"Why, my mother was 6'4""."
We called her shrimp.
"If you're only 12, you're pretty young to be traveling alone."
"Oh, well, that's all right."
I'm not scared.
I'm going be a space cadet.
Where are you going?
Home.
"Oh, here it is right here."
You're going to... (GROANING)
What's the matter?
"Oh, I'm train sick!"
The rocking.
Here's your ticket.
"Oh, I..."
I'm train sick.
The...
The rocking of the train.
I'm really sick.
I get nauseous on a train from rocking and when it goes fast and it shakes back and forth.
I'm really very sick from the train.
Would you please keep quiet?
Yeah.
"I dropped my gun, mister."
Wow!
(TITTERING)
My gun shoots milk.
Knock on the knocker!
Hi.
"I'm a fucking car, baby."
Lexus convertible!
"Oh, that's good."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Oh, God, that's amazing."
Yeah!
"Fellow, you're late!"
You're late!
"The last 15 minutes... have been a fucking rollercoaster of emotions for me, mate."
I didn't know if I was ever gonna see you again.
So I fired up some of this shit.
"Fire up my fucking nose, yeah?"
But there you are.
"It's okay, Henry."
You just lost power.
Come on.
"Hey, there!"
"Bring me some of that strong Russian shit, ladies."
"Okay, now where's that booster pump?"
Where is it?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking...
Yeah!
Fucking hell.
This is it.
"This is it, yeah?"
"Okay, hang on."
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, I gotta get this little fucker in there."
We'll get you out of here.
- What's your name?
- Ben.
"Hey, Ben."
I'm Doug.
Let's see if I can move some of this stuff out of the way here.
- How did you get caught in here?
- We were by the canal and the water started coming real fast.
"- Just get it out, please."
Just get it out!
- Mom told us to stay out of the tunnel.
"It ain't my fault, Joey."
The water just pushed me.
"All right, settle down, fellas."
It's nobody's fault.
- Are you okay?
- I'm cold and my leg hurts.
Let me take a look at it.
It's your lucky day.
I'm a doctor.
- Let me check this.
Does this hurt?
"- Yeah, a lot."
- Try not to move it.
- Is it broken?
- It might be.
"- Oh, no."
"- No, no...."
"- Don't cry, Ben."
"Yeah, Ben."
Don't cry.
It's nothing compared to what I've seen.
Or was it all of you?
"Was it you, Jones?"
Was it you?
Was it you?
Or was it you?
"You sick bastard, you're imagining things again!"
Oh yeah?
"You've been fishing with Ivan lately, Reynolds?"
How's that...
How's that tuna biting?
Let me see you talking your way out of this one!
Where is it?
Christ!
"What the fuck now, Reznik?"
Get him off me!
"You're through, you fuck!"
Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.
You're fired.
This motherfucker's crazy.
"You lost it, man."
Shit!
Damn it!
Where is it?
Asshole!
What the fuck did you do with it?
Idiot!
Hey!
Fuck you!
Get out!
What?
It's an occupational hazard.
"So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from this miserable life or what?"
You speak my mind.
Well done.
Come on.
An enquiry.
"- Yes, Sir."
Before 18th of September...
Did this guy stay here?
"No, Sir."
Are you sure?
Or do you want confirm with someone else?
I'm sure.
He is not our guest.
"Panju, this is where I stay."
Please come.
Do you know him?
No.
Take a closer look.
He was staying here.
I'm sure that he didn't stay here.
How are you so sure?
I never forget any guest's face.
I can even remember a guest who stayed with us 10 years ago.
Do you know him?
No.
Give the key for room number 205.
Why?
He is staying here.
Give the key.
We are investigating trusting people like this!
Come.
He was staying here for a while.
What happened to him?
- Open up!
You guys were gone a long time.
Where's Franz?
What's she doing here?
She wanted to call the police for her Franz.
"You almost sunk us all, you and your Biberkopf."
- Where's Franz?
- The cops got him.
That's a lie!
Shut her up!
It's not true!
"Henschke, we'll be gone a few days."
I'll tell you the address.
Quiet!
You're coming with us.
"Good luck, Biberkopf."
Buy my little gadget!
"Peep, peep, peep The dickey bird sings"
Let me outta here!
- Push him out!
- He squealed on us!
"Well now, Mr. Biberkopf!"
Welcome back.
You were gone a long time ― three weeks.
You boiling some punch there?
Have a look.
I'm not buying that.
It's gauze for bandages.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Me?
Paula.
So I can break this set up?
You mean from the other shot?
So like--
TRENT HAAGA:
Yeah.
-We're very late.
We're never gonna get a movie.
I'm just worried--
You're absolutely right.
Can we [inaudible]?
DAVE:
So I get from here to here.
Is that it?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Hey, Hasan."
Thank you.
That was great.
Thank you.
"Hang in, though."
We can still use you as the super stud that you are.
[Laugh]
"And we may need you as Toxie, too."
"Now, why is he getting out of the costume?"
Because he might be-
- I guess we got the real Toxie.
"Yeah, you're right."
WOMAN:
"I mean, I can put him back in it."
"Nah, it's all right."
Just stay handy.
"And we'll keep doing this, I think."
Like tomorrow we ought to do it also.
"Hello, Nina."
Take her to interrogation 819.
"Yes, sir."
What's the security configuration?
"Don't worry about it, Jack."
We're handling Nina.
"Ryan, you know what she's capable of."
That's none of your concern right now.
I'm sending you to medical to get checked out.
I'm fine.
I don't think you are.
What's this about?
We found evidence you've been injecting heroin.
"Tell me I'm off here, Jack."
Tell me I'm wrong.
I didn't think so.
"Ryan, I haven't missed a step."
I'm fine.
I have to cover my ass.
- I need to get you checked out.
- You're wasting time.
- Kim.
- Yeah?
I thought you'd want to know your dad's back.
What about Chase?
"Uh, he's a few minutes behind."
Thank you.
Kim.
Dad.
"Oh, god."
Hi.
She's here.
Run!
Don't let them catch you!
"Jeffrey, run!"
The cops are afteryou!
Freeze!
"Jeffrey, the cops are all around!"
The cops are everywhere!
Run!
"Jeffrey, run away!"
"It's me,Jenny."
Don't move!
Let's go.
"What's wrong, officer?"
Flirting isn't a crime.
Arrest him!
"Keep clear, everyone."
Let me through.
Open those suitcases.
- What were you doing at the airport?
- Chasing a piece ofass.
What's yourjob?
I'm a casting agent for movie companies.
- But you resisted arrest!
- I was drunk.
Stand up and walk a straight line!
- Where's your friend?
- What friend?
You know who.
He's in grave danger.
Help him.
Tell me where he is.
I want to help him solve his problem.
I don't get to do a door slam on me.
I do a door slam on you.
This is my bar!
That means I get the last
- friggin' door slam.
"- Oh, yeah?"
What about this?
!
- What about this?
!
- Ha-ha!
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah!
- Moving out.
"- Oh, yeah."
Aha!
"So, Trent wouldn't give the ring back?"
Tell me how that went down.
It was dimly lit.
Through the darkness I saw an Adonis.
"He looked at me, I looked at him."
The nipple went in my mouth.
I loved it.
I can still picture it now.
"Brett, are you OK?"
Are we not doing flashbacks any more?
"Anyway, I'm not giving up."
We're going to get that diamond back.
How do you get at diamond out of a guy's mouth?
How stupid can the guy be?
Let's just think.
For a year I was Trent oregano dealer.
"Now, you say it."
Is beautiful.
Tonight.
What?
What?
What're you doing?
"You're the guy's wife, Cora."
You told me that.
You were gonna leave me?
-I was writing you a note.
-Were you writing me a thank-you note?
-Is that what you were doing?
"-Cora, look."
Live here.
Live with the guy.
"Took a chance, we didn't make it."
Live with the man.
He wants to have a baby.
You understand?
He's changed.
He says the accident changed him and now I'm supposed to have his kid.
"How am I gonna do that, Frank?"
How am I supposed to have his baby?
I can't have his baby.
The only one I could have a baby by is you.
Okay.
Say you won't leave me.
Please.
"Just stall him, babe."
Just stall him.
-Going far?
-We're goin' to Ventura.
"Because I do not know whether night is a dream, and he hates me, and now he's going to give me to them like he did with the others."
They are going... to sacrifice me to the demons!
- It's all right.
It's all right.
You're just imagining things.
Everything is going to be okay.
- What the devil is going on in here?
!
"- My apologies, ma'am."
This poor girl is clearly suffering from some kind of delusional attack.
- Lucy... you cannot hurt me.
- I can.
I will!
- You can't.
Gunther.
No!
Let go of me.
The wolves!
The wolves!
No!
The wolves...
"- Thank you, sir."
Porter.
- Detective Thomas.
Good to see you.
- How're you doing?
Good to see you.
- I'm good.
I'm good.
"Please, sit."
- Sure.
- How are you?
"Since you have been decided, will you go with me also."
Ah...yes.
We go.
Lets go.
"Yet this traffic, no longer can be crossed."
It is truth.
Slowly...
-Sandro?
you have bound?
"-No, it is that I..."
-What you do?
"We go, we go, lady."
Where you are going to look for them?
In the day-care center?
The very ready one!
You accompanied her to house?
"Eh, boys, Prof. Cicchirini has bought a new car."
-No.
-That yes.
-I do not create it to me.
-If you I to it say.
We are going to let pass this opportunity?
No.
"Boys, a question:"
Which can be the car of Cicchirini?
I believe that it is the one with the canvas.
Bravo!
Right answer.
"-Goodbye, mother."
-Paulino.
Mother.
"I must go to me, we see you behind schedule this?"
- The fee.
For companionship.
Right.
This is all I have.
Hopefully that's enough.
We can stop by a cash machine.
"So this is what a day at the office is like, huh?"
Just another typical Tuesday.
Neil... and Grace.
Is it date night tonight?
How adorable you both look.
- I'm impressed.
- That's because it's authentic.
Everything in the spirit of the time period.
"Except tonight, the women are in charge."
Explore.
Make new friends.
Enjoy.
- Drink?
- Absolutely.
Two vodka martinis.
Up.
Olives.
- Have we met?
- No.
You look so familiar.
Yes.
So do you.
- Grace.
"- Oh, Audrey."
"Oh, now I get it."
You cancelled me so that you could do him yourself.
- Okay.
Is there a safe word you can think of?
Something easy to remember in distress?
"How about the word ""stop""?"
"- Good choice. ""Stop"" it is."
- Yeah.
"Okay, we'll leave you to enjoy your evening."
- Alright.
- You'll hear from me in a moment.
Just make yourself at home.
"Okay, all right."
"Well, take her easy."
Harlech...
Shadow.
Is this real?
"Yeah, it's real."
That's real.
It's really dead.
-  Cooper.
"- Oh, hey."
- Are you hearing me?
- Loud and clear.
Oh!
"Reaching for the Dutch courage already, I see."
- I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.
- Lame.
"- Well, we need you with a clear head."
- Okay.
Fair point.
Fair point.
This is high-quality craftsmanship.
This is nice.
He was good.
"He was very, very good."
"Señor, nobody has come out of there alive..."
Please.
Señor!
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.
Stay here.
If you insist Señor.
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue.
"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
Give me the whip.
Adios señor.
Adios stupido.
Dr. Jones.
Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I can not take away.
And you thought I'd given up.
You choose the wrong friends.
This time it will cost you.
"Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq."
Yes.
Too bad.
You could warn them...
if only you spoke Hovitos.
"Jock, start the engine!"
Get it up!
Be in the moment?
Programs!
Anybody need programs?
"Buy it now, buy it now."
Programs.
Programs.
Programs.
"Hey, you want a program, man?"
- Thanks.
I'm good.
- Cool.
I got ice cream.
Anyone?
Want ice cream?
"- No, I'm good."
"- Ice cream, guys."
Who's--who's hungry?
Ice cream?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Meeting Dave.
What are you doing here?
"Well, Dave gave me this ticket and told me to meet him here."
- What a jerk.
"- Well, look, I have zero intention of sitting here with you all night, so..."
Fine.
It's cool.
I'll watch the game by myself.
No way.
I'm gonna watch the game by myself.
No.
"If you're going in, I'm going in."
They're no way that you're gonna go in.
- Ming-kai!
- Tat-chi!
So you're the representatives.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Fantastic!
I've already heard much about you.
This will be a magnificent fight!
This is really an honor.
Yes!
"Sir, I won't fight!"
Sir!
"Ming-kai, we must count on you."
"Tat-chi, the Shaolin are depending on you."
Start!
Go.
Go.
Sung-chi!
"No matter who wins, see that my orders are carried out."
This is a fair duel.
I'll decide the winner and the new ruler of the martial arts world.
Watch out!
Not bad!
"You've improved a lot, too."
Don't stop!
Fight!
Fight!
Watch out!
Why do you want to be a priest?

It seems very friendly ...
"Do not worry with it, getting married next month."
"Really, who benefits?"
"So, something about you, Mr darkness ..."
- About me?
- Yes.
You do not need to profile even photos.
What can I say?
Hold them for me.
We waited in rare cases.
"Well, for me, is in order."
Damn.
And say once again.
Hey ... empty.
Let ...
Thank you.
That's all right.
This from the host ...
Hey!
We are ready to go.

Where have you been?
"Maria, don't go!"
Don't leave me alone.
- Dad!
- Maria!
"- My baby, I missed you!"
- I'll tell Barbuda!

Teach me how to walk on the tightrope.
I want to be part of your act.
- But you're so little!
"- Yeah, honey."
"Come on, please."
Teach me!
"We'll think about it, okay?"
Always remember that.
Aim at a spot ahead.
"Focus, and you won't fall."
"On the tips of your toes, then slide."
"Gently, just like that."
Yes.
Arms out and smile.
Smile to the crowd that's here to see you.
"Good, Maria."
"Did you see, Marcia?"
Our little acrobat!
Very good.
"Next, try it with the parasol."
Grab it either here or here.
Find the best grip.
Elegance.
"- Just myths, of course."
I doubt they're true.
That Hori...
Hiromitsu.
- Yes.
He died.
It's probably impossible to find out who has the other 11 tattoos.
Not at all.
But I'd like to know what this has to do with Lynn's death.
Nothing.
Just curious.
Actually I'm not supposed to give you this stuff.
Since you're on leave.
"Yeah, I know."
It's just for my report.
Oh well.
The case is closed.
"And anyway, you played a part in it, too."
Yeah?
"Yeah, did you check the list of names?"
Just a sec.
I got Lynn Wilson.
I need the other 11 people with a Hiromitsu.
Yes.
And all of them are reported dead or missing?
Thanks.
Thanks.

Grab the oar!
Are you okay?
You all right?
Yeah.
We gotta go to shore!
"Cynthia, we're out of synch again."
"You know, you gotta paddle on the opposite side of the boat!"
"Well, Jason, I can't see which side you're paddling on!"
"Well, turn around and take a look every once in a while."
"Otherwise, we are gonna capsize again."
"You get that, right?"
It was an accident.
I'll bet it could have been avoided.
Right?
Am I right?
Baby' I need you to paddle.
"Cynthia, paddle the boat, please!"
You know what?
Sit down.
You've got to sit down in the boat!
Cynthia!

How many children do you have?
Ten.
Five girls and five boys.
Five boys and five girls...
Bravo!
Thank you.
"Tell me, can the factory still produce more?"
How should I know?
Give the milk to the baby first.
Don't worry about my colleagues.
"Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?"
Can you hear me?
I can hear you too.
Good day.
How are you?
What can I say?
We're all ready.
Everything's fine.
Listen...
Up here...
Yes...
We're getting bored too but... lt seems to be the only solution.
There's no doubt about it.
"It could be any day now, we can't say..."
She hasn't eaten for three days.
"No, there's no doubt."
We just have to wait.
There's no other solution.
Can I ask a favour of you?
-It should be faster.
"-No, I get what she's doing."
It's sultry.
She's going for romantic.
"Is that what you're going for, Jane?"
A love song?
Come on!
Let him go.
"No, let him go!"
Let me at him!
Those are mine.
-What are?
-Your tits.
You're such a brute.
Hello.
Hi.
-Am I interrupting?
-Absolutely not.
"It's an unexpected pleasure, really."
We were just discussing romance.
Come on in.
"Sit down, come on."
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Yeah.
Have a good night.
I'm really starting to love this.
"It's dated, you know?"
It's not dated.
We just wrote it.
It doesn't even have a date on it yet.
-Why are you so contrary?
-You wouldn't respect me otherwise.
My--my jeans?
My cowboy shirt?
What?
A few things might have come from there.
I don't know.
"Ok, then let's go the other way with it, ok?"
What didn't come from the big and tall shop?
Ok.
I will show you.
The thing is they use very good fabric.
"There's nothing in there, is there?"
"Yes, there is."
This.
"Ok, fine."
Great.
"Well, you know what?"
"This is what I'm gonna be wearing from now on, so you better get used to it, missy, ok?"
I can't feel my hands.
"Hi, babe."
What are you doin'?
Lookin' at myself in various stages of fatness.
Look at this.
Come here.
Watch this.
You can actually see me gaining weight.
Hey.
Watch this.
And there goes my neck.
"Ok, would you stop this now?"
Here.
Just watch some t.V.

Something I said?
I've got a lead.

Oh!
Wynter.
"Hey, I hear you're looking for some venom."
"Yeah, do you know where I can get some?"
Um-hum...
How about straight from the source.
First time's free.

- You're wrong.
- I do.
- Ugh...oh...!
Let's be on our way.
- Why?
"- Well, didn't you know?"
They're competing against each other for the D.O.D. contract.
Are we gonna start going to church every sunday now?
Today's a special service.
It's...teenage sunday.

Not today.

Any card.

"Well, you can't do it so that I can't see it."
Just a sec.
"- Here, just --"

"No, they're not."
I can see it.
You're cheating.
It's not cheating.

We got any idea who hired this guy to kill Cutler?
"No, but courtesy of his parole officer, we have a current address."
So why don't we go ask him.

(gun clicks empty)
We need the paramedics right now.
"Right now, Catherine, go!"
"Catherine, now!"
"Paramedics, let's go!"
Okay.
Who hired you to kill John Cutler?
Don't you die on me you son of a bitch.
You hear me?
Hey!
Who hired you?

He'll probably call me.
"No, no waiting."
We are in this situation because of your bullshit...
So sort yourself out and take care of the matter tonight.

- Why?
I don't know.
They just want to meet you.
The CEO is Danish.
He wants to shake your hand before giving us the money.
Perhaps he doesn't trust us Indians.

You will love it.
What kind of place?
Like a place that has dancing?
There is everything.
Everything?
"Oh, my God, you guys, I want to go dancing!"
You want to go?
"Yes, please, regard me."
Follow me.
"Oh, my God, yeah, I want to go!"
It'll be a girls' night!
"Okay, but, honey, honey, honey..."
"Oh, my God."
You should just slow down here for a second maybe?
That's exactly what I need!
It's the second guitar solo that sorts the men from the boys.
"I was kind of counting on that, Sctan."
Joey?
Yeah?
I think it's time to show the donkey the snake.
"Cut his head, cut his head, cut his head!"
"Go, go, go!"
Dave!

Cut his head!
Big finish.
Star power!
"Look, I don't believe you're ill at all."
You just need more strength.
Take mine.
Really.
I have too much of it.
- No.
- Yes.
I want you so.
- No.
- Oh!
Forgive me.
I... fear that we would harm the memory of our beautiful afternoon.
Yes.
"Yes, of course."
All right.
Who's taught you to be afraid?
No wonder you're choking to death.
Someone's got to show you how to breathe.
Come on.
Come on.
You need light and air.
You need to move about.
Why stay inside wrestling with perfection?
Come outside!
Perfection is flowing all around you!
- MALLEFIILLE:

Are you serious?
"Okay, the president, she wants me to vote against her bill?"

Yes.
No.
"I mean, you're..."
"No, you're not being..."
"It's, yes, you need to vote no."
"Okay, I can..."
love it.
"Don't get it, but it's all right."
I just want to help.
"But, yeah, just let me know where I'm going."
- You need to know now?
"- Yeah, that would be great."
"What'd you say, ma'am?"
Mm-hmm.
I didn't get your invitation card.
Damn it.
"If I'd a gun,"
I'd have blown his head off.
"Pity, you've been suspended."
I'll get a gun tomorrow.
Is that easy to buy one in HK?
"A toy gun would do, baby."
This is it.
Chinese Tea.
You can go home when we are done.
Sure.
Take care of Lisa.
I know you'll take good care of her.
Scorpion Yong.
"You want trouble, I'll give you trouble."

Try fighting with my gun!
Fight now?
"Michael, wait."
Be careful...
Did you kill my brother Lin Long?
Lin Long?
I killed many in my fights.
But we'd signed fight contracts.
Which clan are you from?
We are the police!
"Whatever, please put down your gun."
I'm afraid of guns.
I beg you.
"Maybe I can help, you know."
You just need to communicate.
See this book?
It talks about all the different stages of forgiveness.
"- You know, they say that""s very important."
"- Thank you, sweetie."
"Daddy""s home."
How do I look?
You look great.
Thank you.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
I got some strawberries.
Do you want me to say things?
Dirty things?
Is that what you want?
How does she touch you?
Does she touch you like this?
"Does she let you, you know..."
- Would you like me to try that?
"- Don""t talk, Clara."
"I will try it for you, David."
It might excite me.
"You excite me, David."
See how we fit?
"I can hold you all night, David."
"- I hate it, Clara."
- I love it.
"- Oh, my gosh, y""all!"
"Lt""s beautiful."
- Wait.
"Hold that up higher, honey."
"If nothing else, kill me, please."
Make this end.
- You're gonna be...
"You're gonna be okay, Mary."
You're gonna be okay.
"- ""The gardens at midnight... beneath the gnome."""

You will tell him and he'll hurt me!

Isabel.
"Please, you can trust me."
- You keep calling me Isabel.
I am Mary.
But I remember you.
Margaret!
"- Jesus Christ, what did they do to you?"
What did they do to you?
- I dreamt I killed you.
- I'm still here.
- Did I hurt you?
Margaret!
No!
How can it be?
Why would you help me if I did this to you?
- You're my friend.
I know it wasn't you who did that.
We can't stay here.
You have to tell me everything.
Bulma-san
Bulma-san how old are met?
How rude!
Why do you ask me that?
!
well ...
I expected no less of a millionaire!
Goku has good friends!
Is it true that we have a plane and a castle as bingo prizes?
You are right!
But the special award is much more amazing!
Krillin!
We are three with Maron!
which is the second prize!
Huh?
Want the second prize?
Is there anything wrong with that?
I did not mean that ...
Goku is not here at this moment in time!
Why was he training ?
!
Are you going to let him see bingo prizes?
Goten!
This way!
Sorry!
Darn you!
What the?
let's open!
Yes!
Are these all bingo prizes?
it is too early to be surprised!
What is this?
Ah.
I think our table is ready.
"We should just sit right down, I think."
"Yes, thank you."
To the buzzer.
A Sports Illustrated moment.
I actually think I got hit by Kobe's sweat when he took the shot.
Nice.
You still down for hanging out?
Sure.
"Uh, do you..."
you know a bar around here?
Let's skip the bar.
Too many drunken fans.
Fine by me.
What did you want to do?
Let's get out of here.
Take a drive up Mulholland.
- Mulholland?
- My girlfriend's out of town.
- I don't have a curfew.
Hop in.
"Lt'll be fun, I promise."
That is a beautiful watch.
I have three sons and a brother.
Always looking for good gift ideas.
- Where did you buy it?
- Fred Segal's.
- Oh.
- Did their Christmas display last year.
An homage to 1940s noir.
Hm.
"- Thank you, Pete."
And this is my attorney:
Lance Lord.
I believe these are yours.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Hi.
How are you?
Thank you for doing this on a Sunday.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Don't mind if I do.
- Yeah.
"To be honest, I'm a little fuzzy on what this is we're doing."
"Uh, Dr. Barrett's made an offer on the farm."
An offer to buy it.
I've accepted.
I just need you to review these terms.
I represent supplies in the farm-to-table business.
We buy non-working farms and get them working again.
Okay.
Um...
"Dr. Barrett, if you can give us a moment,"
I need to confer with my client.
- Lance...
- It's just a quick chat.
If you don't mind.
"It's, uh, it's okay."
Of course.
"Uh, take all the time you need."
"I'll be, uh, outside."
Lance:
I'm sure Dad would have been here if he could.
[SNIFFS]
She's such a slut.
So?
"Personally, I'm very pro-slut."
"-What happened, anyway?"
"-She banged Jamie Jaffe, that's what."
She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.
"Hi, Taylor."
How was your weekend?
"Fine, I guess."
You didn't go to the rodeo?
[STUDENTS CHUCKLE]
That's my spot.
Sorry.
This is a skeev-free zone.

[BANGS TRAY ON TABLE]
-You shouldn't listen to those jerks.
-Leave me alone.
I just mean-
"- I'm sorry, that's all."
You?
"Dale, go!"
Well ...
Lord.
"No, it's not real."
It seems to me.
Rory had to pee with laughter.
How do you know?
It looks real.
"Come on, it's a reality."
There are millions of people watching us right now.
Addons Now that the penalty completed.
Back to the game.
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!
Max!
You'd be annoyed.
"Addons Are you having fun, Max?"
Locked.
Addons Max has violated the rules try to contact with people outside the game.
How can break the rules?
Addons I was in the terms and conditions.
Damn.
Addons I have to take a penalty again.
"No, please."
No more.
"Addons Max, you have to lose a friend."
Lord.
Addons Let us choose to Max.
Addons may not realize it.
Say you're sorry.
Addons Let's see.
They are your friends!
# A poor immigrant's daughter
# Too frightened to know
# She was leaving forever
# The land of her soul #
"Now, that's all you're getting."
It's more than you deserve.
Beautiful.
- I can die a happy man now I've heard that.
- You'll outlive us all.
Only the good die young.
"- Quiet, isn't it?"
- It's the country.
- It's always quiet.
"- Yeah, but... it's a bit creepy, really."
Yeah.
Where were you planning on staying tonight?
Or weren't you?
Ah...
You know...
I'll find somewhere.
I'll sleep in the car.
You know me.
I can sleep on a rope.
"You're a feckin' torment, Tommy."
"Well, look at that sky."
Look!
- There's a shooting star.
- That's a satell...
"A satellite, yeah."
I know.
I was just checking.
# I saw two shooting stars last night.
"Yummy, and you could be having that all day!"
"_Me,?"
A' es'!
- Is that him?
- Yeah!
"A looker, isn't he?"
"Jean, what's happening?"
Jean!
My hair flew away!
His hair comes off!
You look good in anything.
Just look at him!
He's real handsome.
My hair!
- We'll set things right.
- Right!
I bet those monsters at the mill are in on this.
"Get away, you monsters!"
I'm off to investigate.
Such a draft again!
You do it on purpose!
My poor head!
The pain'll kill me.
"At least it'll be over, without Elisa I have nothing."
I'm a lonely and deserted orphan...
"- No, you have me!"
- Exactly.
"Don't worry, your Grace."
I'm here to help you.
"Who are you, an apparition?"
The ghost of aunt Bertha Gloria.
"Ghost, my foot."
- No.
- Thanks for your help.
- Yeah.
Big and ugly.
"Man, this case is just getting better and better."
"If Taggot picked her up, she's probably at his place."
Doubtful.
He's married.
I know.
Right?
Why don't you take the lead on this one?
- Really?
- Sure.
What are you doing?
"Uh, exercise."
I'll meet you up there.
We just need to ask you a few questions about last night.
I'm a little drugged.
Pain killers.
Right.
"Well, this won't take long."
How well do you know off--
How well do you know Officer Taggot?
- Who?
- Officer Taggot.
He your boyfriend?
"No, no."
Then why did he pick you up last night from the hospital?
"That's right, we know about that."
He just--he felt bad that I got hurt.
"Valerie, hey, whoa!"
Focus...
"Repeat, we are at Code Red."
Recon plan Charlie.
Execute!
Let's move!
"Move, move, move, move!"
Yeah!
"Okay, come on, kids."
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.
"All right, gangway, gangway."
And this is how we find out what is in those presents.
"Okay, who's hungry?"
Here come the chips!
I've got Cool Ranch and barbecue!
What in the world...
Oh!
I thought I told him to pick these up.
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?
"Hey, these guys are professionals."
They're the best.
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.
Go on without me!
Just go!
A good soldier never leaves a man behind.
"Okay, everybody, come on."
Everybody settle down.
"Now, kids."
Everybody...
You sit in a circle.
"No, Andy."
Karate-chop me or something!
That is not...
Okay.
All right.
Let's just do one simple move.
Okay.
"Now, this won't wrinkle my top, will it?"
Ohh!
Wow.
That was actually fun!
Show me one more time.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, my gosh."
I thought I lost you again.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Back up.
Again?
"Oh, yeah, when we almost got killed,"
I thought I lost my phone.
It was really scary.
"Mentos-pramp-climb, test number two."
"Lesson learned... when pressure builds to dangerous levels, it must be released."
Is your lip getting better or your face getting redder?
Just gonna pop into the family room.
What the hell was that?
!
"Oh, I'm just getting started!"
Ohh!
Why do you have to be such a silly...
"Haley, stop!"
Mom!
"Phil, honey."
"But please, I can't accept."
What a nice pear!
"I'm Clemenza, you still have my goods?"
Did you look inside?
I'm not interested in things that don't concern me.
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.
Sure she would.
But who has money for a rug?
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.
"Yeah, sure."
My wife would like it.
That son of a bitch!
He isn't home!
"Damn, he didn't even leave the key."
"Well, he won't mind."
Come on in.
"Hey, Vito, come on in!"
This is your friend's place?
This is a real palace.
One of the best.
"Vito, give me a hand, will you?"
"Look how pretty it is, Santino!"
Come on in.
It's all right.
Hyman's in there.
-Would you like a tuna sandwich?
"-No, thank you."
...pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...
-Mr.
Thas all.
Is no big deal.
We just used up a little gas.
"Look, not a scratch oh, the starter needs adjusting."
"If you want me to fix it, I've got a screwdriver."
Go ahead...
Listen to their sob story.
You'll cry your heart out.
Wait...
listen.
I said hands up.
"Hey, Carnoles!"
Need the police?
I'll call them.
Wait...
There's something you ought to know...
We had a run-in recently in a five-and-dime store.
So we're kind of on parole.
Next time is jail.
"We don't want to go to jail, sir."
Poor slobs.
I'll put you in jail myself.
"Hey, how 'bout giving these hippies a haircut?"
"We're in France, all right!"
Watch out!
Jean-Claude!
What?
I'm all bloody.
Get a doctor.
What a mess!
Whas going on?
Have to get another car.
"If you love me, then you need to let me go."
"Oh, she's gone."
I wish I could cry on demand.
Thetearswon'tcomeout.
Go ahead.
I'll just find a place to park.
"You mean, you're not gonna drive off and disappear for 6 months?"
"Because this is my car, and my lease is up soon."
I'll be right back.
"Baby, get ready to get fragged."
"- Hey, where's Brian?"
- Parking.
Where's Adam?
"Oh, he's outside obsessing over the briquettes."
Is this even gonna work?
"Maybe we should hide the knives, just in case."
Oh!
Oh!
No!
No!
You cheated.
You cheated.
"Oh, come on."
"You looked away, honey pie."
I didn't cheat.
- Slap it.
Slap it!
"- Slapping of the... no, no."
See?
That's why I don't play with you anymore.
- You know what?
You are so cute when you pout.
Hello?
Meet me in the Brooklyn Navy yard.
You'll see some cranes there.
Go to crane number five.
Crane five.
"If you're not alone, I'm gonna have to kill you."
"That'll be 3:00 am, tomorrow morning..."
Dalton.
"Okay, eastland."
[Indistinct radio chatter]
Did you get a trace?
"No, it was too short."
Thanks for the tap.
[Car door closing]
[Clattering]
[Banging]
[Gunfire]
That's what it's like to be a victim.
That's what it was all about.
[Gunshot]
[Groaning]
"I had to do it, Dalton, huh?"
"You guys were gonna set me up, huh?"
"Come on, Dalton..."
Let's get out of here.
I'll help you... come on.
"No, no, you get out of here."
Don't play hero with me.
Let's just go.
Damn it!
You get out of here!
I'll cover you.
"Karen, that was worth $60,000!"
I need that money!
That's all we got!
They had a search warrant!
That's all the money we had!
I was depending on that!
Why did you do that?
I had to!
They were going to find it!
-They wouldn't have found it!
-They would have!
I swear!
They would've found it!
Why did you do that?
-They would have found it.
-Why did you do that?
"Oh, my God!"
-l had to do it.
"-Oh, my God!"
No!
"Paulie, I'm really sorry."
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.
"Yeah, you fucked up."
But I'm all right now.
"I can be trusted now, Paulie. I'm clean."
"On my kids, I'm clean."
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.
"Paulie, after what you said, I couldn't come to you."
"You know, I was ashamed."
"All right, on three, you're hauling ass."
"One, two..."
Three!
"Okay, this way!"
"Move, move, move!"
"Okay, behind the barricade."
"Get down, get down."
All right.
"Okay, steady, steady, steady, steady."
"All right, come to daddy."
"All right, there you go."
All right.
Got it.
Tanner!
"All right, get in there now!"
"We're coming, we're coming!"
Tanner.
"Tanner, come on, buddy."
Couple of things:
You just killed a good man...
And my legs hurt.
We translated your song.
We dug up every mine you planted.
Not every one.
"""Twin Tree""?"
That one went off 20 years ago.
How many people went with it?
Not a soul hurt.
- You're lying.
- Okay.
"I planted that mine on Mount Sutro, right on the trail everyone took to the top."
No.
just stand still.
Papi!
Stop it!
"Papi, please stop!"
Shh.
Papi!
"Stop, stop."
I fucking love you.
I'm not going to let you do this to yourself.
"Be strong, be strong."
There you go.
There you go...
beautiful man.
"Viente nueve, trienta."
You got 30 pills here.
And you got the testosterone blocker.
Okay?
Otherwise you be growing a beard with tetas.
You don't want that.
That should take care of you for the month.
Anything else?
Um...
"Oh, you wanna get pumped... huh?"
You got the coins?
"Yo, damn, that needle's big."
I can't believe you doing this shit.
The price you pay for beauty.
"You want some, too?"
"I'm just here for moral support, mama."
You want anything on top?
"No, Papi would kill me."
"Okay, just the culo?"
Yeah.
"I was very, very hurt."
I'm kidding.
"Brown, take the brown ones."
Don't take the white ones or the
Red ones.
Why brown?
Because brown is the
Ibuprofen.
The red and the white ones are
Left over from when I was
Seriously addicted to pills.
"Well, why didn't you just"
Throw them away?
Because I'm sentimental.
About pills?
Sarcasm.
"All right, so, uh, the red,"
Right?
Brown.
Brown.
Gonna take the brown.
Tell me he's not color blind.
I hope not.
Are you sure there's not
Anything I can do?
"Honey, come on, look."
"You handle the kids, right?"
You drive them to
And from school.
You take them to their games.
You do their laundry.

# That can't be changed with just a song
# I really want our lives to intertwine
# To make you proud
# To bring you joy
# So you can say
"# Yes, he's my boy"
# He's mine. #
"Thank you, Baker."
You'll hear from your teacher.
Morning.
You see that ceiling?
All them tiles might have to come down.
Sorry.
Hang on.
"Give me a sec, Tom."
Tubby.
Mr Brierley.
I'm glad I've seen you.
"Look, about the other day."
My wife's a bit...
She's at a funny age.
No. it was a very nice occasion.
Crisp breads.
Very gentlemanly of you.
Could we make amends?
Could I invite you and the lady...?
Enid.
That's it.
Could you both perhaps come to dinner?
"I'm talking about getting very, very rich."
"You count cards, right?"
All of you?
"As a team, yes."
- When?
- Weekends.
And Christian holidays.
- Where?
"- Vegas, baby."
"So, why are you telling me?"
"Well, let's just say a spot opened up on our roster."
How?
Jimmy got a job at Google.
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
"- Yeah, it's catchy, I know."
"Well, if you're making so much money at this, then why did he take it?"
"Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler."
Yeah...
This is crazy.
"No, Ben."
This is profitable.
"Yeah, I can't do it."
"So, I'm sorry."
"- Come on, Ben."
It'll be fun.
"- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun."
"No, it's not that."
It's...
"I just got a promotion at my job, so it's kind of not a good time for me."
We pay better.
"Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends."
Why not?
Is that paint?
"Yeah, looks like it."
"Hey, Gabby!"
"- Take a sample from her left fingers,"
- Left hand.
"Excuse me, Mr. Monk?"
I have a nephew.
He's ten years old.
He's your biggest fan.
He clips articles.
He thinks you're cooler than Spider-man.
Really?
Kids!
"If I could get your autograph, he'd think i'm some kind of hero."
"Sorry, Mr. Monk is working."
Maybe when he's finished.
- I'm sorry.
- Anything else?
"Clues, clues, scanning, scanning."
"No, that's it, all done."
You said something about an autograph?
That would be great.
Thank you so much.
I got.
Would you mind?
Would you mind?
Perpendicular.
Put your head down.
Your hair's in the way.
"Head down, head down."
Are you okay?
- She's fine.
I didn't see anyone either.
I made it up.
I am not going to drive my son around until he's 40.
The only thing stronger than Manny's fear is his need to protect his mama.
"Oh, no!"
He got away!
"But you did very good, Manny."
That was a frickin' rush!
But we're not giving up.
We're gonna find that guy.
No!
Are you sure about this?
Just go.
I'm walking home.
I can't even hear him it's so loud.
Can everybody just shut up?
!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Is this Phil dumpster?
- Stop.
"- What do you want, Gil?"
Got to be kidding me.
Hang on.
Is that your hot wife I hear?
"Hey, is she still taking those yoga classes?"
Hanging up.
W-w-wait.
Wait.
Real quick.
"The listing at 225 cedar street, it's mine now."
You poached my listing?
Let's get you outta here.
- You good?
-Yeah.
(COCKS GUN)
Stop.
Let him go.
"Wait, you're not gonna shoot me?"
"Once a stiff, always a stiff."
(GUNFIRE)
Go!
"Four, how did you get past security?"
FOUR:
You know me.
Scary boyfriend skills.
What is it?
You weren't there.
You didn't even hear that.
"Tris, we need to leave now, all right?"
"I'm sorry, Four."
What?
I'm sorry I didn't tell you that I was gonna go.
I wanted to say goodbye and I just didn't know how.
I didn't know how.
What are you talking about?
So even though I didn't get to say it in real life at least I get to say it now.
Even if it is just in the sim.
"Tris, we're not in a sim."
Don't you think I'd know if I was in a sim?
"Four, you're not in a sim."
You are the sim.
"Wait, wait."
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
- What's she like?
"Short and fat, with a moustache."
- A beaver.
- close.
We miss you.
"Bye, kitten."
Attempted murder.
Good morning.
- Is this yours?
- Yes.
That's 62 euro.
"- Why, isn't that how it's done?"
- Maybe in yourtown.
Good day.
And I thought...
Trash got thrown out the window.
"For convenience, we recycle."
"Today organic, Thursday paper, Saturday glass."
Sir...
Go play.
Why did he fine me?
- This festival is very popular.
- Saint CostabiIe is the patron.
"""Here you don't die."""
"It's what Joachim Murat, the French King, said."
"He came here to CasteIIabate, he wrote that phrase and then he died."
"- Smart gal, ourMaria."
- Let's go.
- What?
- Let's go.
These two weeks just flew by.
Go slow and call when you get there.
"Now, put it to good use."
I'm on it.
Twice the firepower means zero xborgs.
[grunting] Huh?
[grunting] [grunting] Let's switch up too.
[grunting] You got it. [grunts] [grunting] Hiya!
[grunting]
I just can't get over these new powers.
Yah!
You got that right.
Ugh.
[grunting] saber whip.
How many of these guys' butts do we have to kick?
Time to go to the next level.
Really?
- I'm in.
- Mm.
Let's try it.
Legendary ranger mode-- samurai.
[both] Ready.
[both]Ready.
Woo hoo.
Yeah.
They're doing it.
Whoo-hoo.
All right.
This is an historic moment for the Power Rangers.
Ready.
"Go go, samurai."
Power Rangers samurai.
- Sweet.
- Let's try another legendary mode.
"You will go back to school, won't you?"
"Well, if we was to go back to school, could we get as smart as Tia and Tony?"
- Maybe even smarter.
"- Yeah, sure."
Let's give it a shot.
Great.
I hope the school can take it.
"- Goodbye, Yo-Yo."
- Goodbye.
"- See you later, Yo-Yo."
- You promised.
"Tia, open the gate."
"No, everybody join hands."
Cool!
All right!
Flying saucer!
Will we ever see you again?
"Well, it's... it's kind of hard to say."
Thanks for everything.
And especially for letting me be in your gang.
"Take care of Alfred for me, OK?"
There you are.
- Where's your luggage?
"- Uh, we lost it."
There were a few problems.
- But you did have fun?
"- Oh, terrible."
I just knew we should have gone surfing.
Hey.
Let's do it the way Tia and Tony taught us.
Yeah.
- Ready?
"That'll be a buck, thank you."
Oh.
I got it.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
"Well, pretty good shooting, Billy."
"Hello, the house."
Anybody home?
[man] Come on in.
I'm in the kitchen.
"Hi, perry, how you doing?"
Saw you drive up.
"Just fixing myself something to eat, come on in."
It smells great.
- You hungry?
"- No, I just ate."
"Uh, what are you cooking?"
"Uh, sit down."
How do you like the place?
"You haven't been over here since Daddy died, have you?"
- No.
- I fixed the place up.
Cost me an arm and a leg.
"Well, I'll bet it did."
"I'll tell ya, things are gettin' so expensive,"
I don't know what I'll be able to afford.
I don't work.
maybe I need a secretary.
I used to love canned peaches.
I can't afford 'em anymore.
No way I could buy those.
Where's Stu?
"Look man, you don't have to be nice to me cause I'm going out with Haley, okay?"
I'm not.
Team sucks on a day without you man.
Ask Whitey.
I'm trying to avoid him.
That's cool.
Do what you got to do.
Usually do.
Am I hallucinating?
Did I just see you talking to Lucas?
"No, he was trying to talk to me."
The whole nice guy thing's wearing kind of thin.
You want to walk to English?
"Actually, I think I'm gonna cut out of here a little bit early."
Wanna join me?
Are you serious?
"Yeah, why not?"
You up for it?
"I can't, Nathan."
Alright.
"Well, look, I gotta get out of here so I'll catch you later."
Okay.
You know what?
Catch me now.
- Oh My God!
"- Nice, huh?"
"So, are we trying to get killed?"
"I told you, my dad's in Charlotte, it's okay."
I've never seen you like this.
Now you have.
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.
On the road.
At the edge of town.
- Did they have boyfriends?
- No.
Is it true they wanted to leave town?
- Who doesn't?
- I don't.
- You're lame.
- And you're jealous.
Okay.
- Did they ever say where?
- Anywhere is better than this.
"- Any friends with a white car, a Citroën?"
- No.
It's Quini.
- What?
- Her boyfriend is outside.
Can we go now?
You can leave.
- Your son?
- The youngest.
He's in Germany.
He's been working there for two years.
I have two more in Barcelona...
- ...and my daughter's in France.
- Can you tell me what you saw?
On the bend.
That's where it stopped.
- Did you see how many people were in the car?
- No.
- Were they forced into the car?
- I think they knew each other.
"That's, please don't take that call."
"I've got to, booty calls."
"I'm looking for the truth, Mr Sugar."
Alan?
"Alan, someone who's smashed up the shop."
Mr Sugar?
"You got some sort of problem, boy?"
We've got some talking to do.
And I'm looking for the truth.
"Yeah, well, I'm telling you the truth."
You want to smash my shop up?
Not particularly.
"Let's smash, let's smash it up."
Let's smash it up!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's smash it up!
I appreciate you're a little bit angry...
HE LAUGHS
Have one!
Have one!
These are beautiful.
They're great.
What do you want to ask me?
What do you want to know?
Have a nice fruit salad.
One of your five-a-day.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You can eat them...
Why have you got it in for Cowell?
"Cowell sent his boys around here, did you know that?"
Sculptor?
"Yeah, every family's got a"
Black sheep.
"Most families get, like, a"
"Retard, or a guy that likes to"
"Wear dresses, we got a sculptor."
"Yeah, retard, sculptor."
Same thing really.
"Yeah, there was a retard"
Sculptor.
60 minutes did a piece on him I
Think.
Yeah.
Really brilliant work.
"And he was real quick, too."
He'd make like one or two
Statues a day.
Only one problem though.
What was that?
He liked the taste of clay.
"So you're saying... yeah, he'd eat his own work."
"Goddamn, what a waste."
"Not really, you know every"
"Time he took a shit, genius."
"Ah, Lou."
"T, you and the probie go down"
"That way, Franco and I are gonna"
Head this way.
"What'd they say, 5 people on"
This floor?
"I said 5, 5."
Whoa.
The worst for me.
Bet?
A respectable girl who wants the worst.
"Does this suffering, we like to suffer."
And in theater you really have?
"The try, hear, I will help you."
Come.
Outcomes?
"If you off from me, you're lost."
For this ... for this!
At the station ...
Did ricambierò.
"And Mickey is happy, because this is the pleasure."
"The vision of Revelation,"
"Ia slut on his throne of blood, the fourth knight,"
"I'agnello the seventh seal, Kafka and his fish!"
Kafka   and his fish ...
Okay.
Okay.
"There, I can not ..."
I used to come here on holiday with my father and my mother.
"My father died there, in that room."
A shot in the barn.
But I still ment.
It was hung?
No.
Him ..
There is not successful.
Him ..
The rain ...
But she is raging mad.
What is?
- We can't lose him.
My husband's a good man.
You can't do this.
George is gonna die.
They see this is a con.
- They're gonna kill him.
- We got to go.
It's not just him at risk.
It's you too.
"And, by the way, the FBI, so let's get real here."
I'm not going to give up on my husband.
"Salt, at the end of the day, you're a Federal Agent."
"We do not negotiate with terrorists, and I'm sorry, but you know that."

Aborting now.
Pack it up.

Do not let your husband die for them.

[Plane engine humming]
It's time to move.
"Salt, get in the van now"
I'm going to go get George myself.
"Salt, stop."
Think about what you're doing.

I can't stop the car.
Tony's energizing it.
It's like your brother doesn't even know you.
- [Rocky] it's yo-yo.
Let's go!
- No.
Don't run.
You crazy?
You don't want to go to that school.
"Please, trust me."
"Now, come on, hurry."
"[Rocky] hey, wait for me."
"[dazzler] come on, you guys."
Get in there.
- Let's go!
"- Come on, get in."
- [door shuts]
- I'm dreaming.
You're surrendering to the board of education?
"Sir, you see that car going down the street?"
- Yeah.
- My brother's in it.
He ought to be going to school.
You ought to catch up with him.
Another truant?
"Oh, boy, we're gonna have a load."
"- Hey, what happened?"
"- Good driving, yo-yo."
"Yeah, that was neat."
[laughs] this bus can really move.
"Tony, look through the window."
The fair Eleanor.
Truth.
Who do you think should take the test next?
No one.
No one should.
"You have to choose a friend, or take the test yourself."
- Who're you gonna choose?
- Fuck you!
5 seconds... 4... 3... 2...
Chris!
- I'm so sorry.
"- Now that wasn't so hard, was it?"
Sorry.
I need a drink.
Luke... please.
Look in the drawer of the workbench.
Find something you can use as a weapon.
"Something small enough to hide, a s-screwdriver maybe."
- He's too fast.
"- No, no...not when he spins the bottle."
"When he spins the bottles, he's distracted."
"If you can get his gun, this is all over"
"I don't know, mate."
"He's going to kill us, Luke."
"And when he's killed us, he'll kill you."
Didja get that?
He'll kill you.
Chris... shall we?
It was me.
I sent the postcard.
I confess.
You were in Spain.
Must be somebody famous.
Name's Obediah Jackson.
"Chris, let me see that."
"What's wrong, Nathan?"
Somebody you know?
He's my father.
Hyah!
NATHAN:
How much further to Eagle Bend?
Town's just over that rise.
We should take a look before we ride in.
[chattering ]
"Can't do this, sheriff."
"No disrespect, judge, but this is my town."
-Looks like a hanging party.
-Let me see.
To the right of the water tower.
NATHAN:
That's my father.
"Now, hold on, Nathan."
No sense riding into a lynch mob without a plan.
Let's do this together.
Come on.
Enough of this.
We don't need a trial.
Let's go.
Somebody grab some rope and tie up his hands.
-The man deserves a trial.
-l can walk. I'm a free man.
"Yeah, you're free to swing."
Get a rope.
Tie up his hands.
–Yeah.
Over here.
"While I was checking the bathroom, this tile fell off."
It looks directly into Kayla's bathroom.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, God."
We got to get an A.P.B out on their car.
Jesus.
–You okay?
–Better than you.
"Looks like I taught you my last lesson, huh?"
Don't end up like me.
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.
Going after that guy was the right thing to do.
"–Hell, I got you shot."
–I always knew there was a bullet with my name on it.
And guess what?
I'm still here.
So are you.
"Hey, you really ought to get in there and see him."
Yeah.
Me and Vic aren't really talkin' right now.
He'd want to see you.
–Yeah?
–Yeah.
"Hey, what the hell is going on?"
"We found the peephole, Bob."
–What are you talking about?
This is ridiculous.
–Step away!
–It's clean.
–Pop it.
You're so unreasonable.
Let me do my work first?
Only 2 photos left and I'm done.
Shit.
I can't breathe.
Hey body.
"You really mean to get back at me now, right?"
Bring it on.
I'm not afraid.
Death is a natural thing for me.
I used to think we should all design our own funerals.
I want my funeral... to not be at a temple.
It can be in this room.
Just a nice coffin and flowers.
I like TK a lot.
Never seen them live.
I would want them to sing at my funeral.
I want them to sing the song 'Handkerchief'.
It's a hit song so everyone can sing along.

I'm not sure whether I want the doctor to come or not.
"I am sorry, doc."
I...
I died.
I broke my promise.
I don't have time to argue with you.
I will take full responsibility for this.
This boy is gonna die!
Let's do it.
It's a great story.
Let's go!
- What are you doing?
- I need supplies.
- I need a portable defibrillator.
- I got a spare.
- You're taking a hell of a chance.
- Damn right!
Let's go!
Hold it right there.
Here we go.
"One, two, three."
There's no room in here.
Give me the camera.
- All set.
- Get a minicam van and meet me at County.
"Here, here."
Close the door.
Let's go!
Patch your headsets back to the station.
- How's he doing?
- He's okay.
- You're filming this?
- We're live from Chopper Five with Dr....
"- What's your name, doctor?"
- Doug Ross.
Dr. Doug Ross from County General.
Just minutes ago Dr. Ross rescued a boy from a storm drain.
-Whoa Anthony--
He's a big boy.
He knows what he said.
What'd ya say?
"Funny, how?"
"Just, you know."
You're funny.
Let me understand this.
"Maybe it's me I'm a little fucked up, maybe."
"But, I'm funny, how?"
Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?
"What do you mean, funny?"
How am I funny?
"You know, how you tell a story...what?"
"No, I don't know."
You said it.
How do I know?
You said I'm funny.
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?
Tell me what's funny!
"Get the fuck out of here, Tommy."
Motherfucker!
I almost had him!
"You stuttering prick, ya!"
"Frankie, was he shaking?"
"I wonder about you sometimes, Henry."
You may fold under questioning!
What the fuck is it with you?
Shut up!
"- Siempre soy amigo, siempre del cártel."
- Shut up!
Shut up!
"All right, just speak English."
Lalo didn't send you?
No Lalo?
- Who?
- Thank God!
Christ.
I thought..
"What can I do for you, gentlemen?"
Anything!
Just tell me
- what you need.
"- This afternoon, an associate of ours offered you $10,000."
You should have taken it!
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?
Badger!
Brandon Mayhew.
The uncle.
That was your guy?
"No offense, guys, but I don't take bribes from strangers, you know?"
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.
- But I'll take your money!
Sure!
- No.
"That offer's expired, yo."
It was kind of low anyways.
"But okay, okay, I'll take it."
"Don't turn around, I told you."
What if I do?
You wanna bite me?
"Of course I won't bite you, but if you don't leave in 5 minutes, you're done!"
Because the car's going to explode.
You think I'm a fool?
Can't I get out in 5 minutes?
"Oh no, not 5 minutes, but 5 seconds!"
5 seconds?
Counting now...!
"5, 4..."
- Can't you slow down?
"- 3, 2, 1...!"
Damn it!
Still 2 more customers?
"won't scratch the backs of foreign devils, get lost!"
"I wouldn't do it for more money, damn it!"
Damn it again!
It's dangerous!
"Gosh, I forgot to ask where the Jew is!"
You're Yoyo?
"Yes, this is he!"
Prove yourself.
My father said so.
How did he know?
My mother said so.
"Alright, I believe your mother."
Thanks.
Who are you?
- Helle's my last name.
- Hello!
- Not Hello!
Ready.
Start.
Don't look down on me!
Damned guy.
Mada mada da ne.
Go home.
Ku'so!
Ugh!
What the hell?
What you doing?
When did you come here?
"Anyway, get out."
"Scared you, didn't I?"
"Scared you, didn't I?"
Get out.
It's been a long time since we were in the bath together.
That's disgusting.
I feel like getting out of here right now.
You're blushing.
You're shy?
Your skin's so thin?
Who's the one that wants to get out?
- Tell me clearly.
- Shuddap.
When we were bathing together while you were young didn't you like to put your legs like this?
- What kind of joke was that?
"- It hurts, it hurts."
You're early.
The English test turned out bad.
- No doubt about that.
It was horrible.
- I thought it was okay.
Nothing else?
Well.. she couldn't care less about who were you dating.
That she only cared about when you're with me.
And that she weren't calm we I'd leave.
What does Clara mean by that?
I want to meet Luisa.
Do you want to know how is she?
-Yes.
Luisa sings.
Does she play the guitar?
I don't think so.
Why not if she sings?
She doesn't sings modern songs.
She sings opera?
-Yes.
She's studying.
She haven't performed yet.
Then Berta was right.
She's much younger than you.
She is exactly 23 years old.
Much younger than mom.
And even younger than Berta!
He's 18.
He's studying economics.
He's 5 years older than you?
And what do you talk about?
Dunno.
About everything.
What do you talk with Luisa?
About everything too.
But it's not the same.
Why not?
We have to come up with something.
It won't be easy.
He'll think of something.
"Come, I'll help you."
I'm sure he would've taken us to the embassy in Sofia.
"No way, Louise."
The Turks may take offence at the King's frolic.
It may result in a diplomatic incident.
He would've taken us to Istanbul to avoid a scandal.
We are going home.
In an ambulance.
"Ludovic, the filming has to stop."
- Sire?
- I want to drive the car.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
- I will miss you.
- Jump in.
Han Solo springt in den Millennium Falcon.
- Hi.
- Hi.
And my donut?

I think he had a heart attack.
- We write a song.
- We write a song.
"- It is called ""boat"". - ""Boot""."
He goes so ...
Let's sing it simple.
Stop to sit at home and mope.
I can not bear.
It's repulsive.
Hospital graveyard.
- Maybe you should get it.
- Me?
Come on.
- Maybe you can come some good.
- So what is it that will help?
"- You're a cop, John."
I would be safe.
"- No one is safe benleyken, Rache."
Thank you.
- Where is Mike?
- There were some things he has to do.
- Work like?
"- Yes, I like business."
- You bring me Bella.
"- Yes, I brought."
- Who are you?
- My name is John.
"Brother, I wanted to look after a while."
- Do you always sleep with him?
- His name is Bella.
She is a girl bear.
"- My brother, say I'm too big for him."
- I never would not be very large.
Try to sleep a little.
- Will you tell me a story?
- I do not know any story.
Then we make up one.
My mother does this.
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
Long long time ago ...
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
Over.
Copy that.
Why did you let one of DI Orwell's stooges in on this?
I thought you and Ben were finally getting it together.
We're still working it out.
"Oh, he's a good cop, apparently."
It's just a shame that Orwell got him.
- How do you ever know?
- Know what?
- If someone's right for you?
- I don't know why you're asking me.
"I, er, suppose you just do."
"But when you do, make sure you hold onto it."
- Approaching now.
- Copy that.
Wait till he's past the jetty then head in with the light on.
What's he doing?
"Oh, Jesus."
Police!
Stop!
"Kevin Grey, on your knees now."
Ben!
Grey!
Put your weapon down.
You're surrounded.
They set me up!
Rrar!
Let's go.
"Go, go, go."
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
"- Ben, are you hit?"
It was a dark and stormy night...
Gingy?
My girlfriend kicked me out.
"You know, something about me being too into myself."
You?
But you are so adorable.
"I know, that's what I keep telling her!"
"I need a good woman, Muffin Man."
"I can help you, Gingy."
How about this one?
- I don't know.
- You like her?
No.
Weird hair.
- How about this one?
- Too skinny.
No!
Don't like it!
OK.
"Well, how about this one?"
Yes!
That's it!
She's perfect.
The girl of my dreams.
Wait.
More sugar.
But that is not the recipe.
"Trust me, Muffin Man, this girl's gotta be real sweet."
I want someone who will love me forever.
"I must warn you, Gingy."
No one has ever made cookies with this much sugar.
You are tampering with forces far beyond your comprehension!
- Nitrous?
"- Yes, please."
No.
More booze for me.
Seems all right?
"""Seems"" being the operative word, mate."
This will cheer you up.
"Shame Felix can't be here, he's always talking about you guys."
Really?
Yeah.
"I mean, you're his friends, right?"
"Yes, we are his very, very, very good friends, aren't we?"
Good old Mr. Felix.
"So, tell us about Chile."
Musta been a big decision.
"Uh, the family thought it would do him good."
Toughen him up finally.
Make him big and strong like his big brother.
"Oh, my God."
You have to feel this.
"It's like a rock, Gemma."
You'll have to excuse her.
- She isn't house-trained.
"- No, seriously, come on, have a big..."
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.
I'll sort it out.
My God.
Go on.
"Oh, sorry."
"Hi, there."
You've got a lot of scars.
What?
That woman...
What woman?
The one whose house burned down...
I knew I'd seen her before.
It's that naked woman from last night.
What?
The woman who was standing here last night.
Crazy fools.
They didn't burn to death.
They were stabbed.
All three of them?
Yeah.
"Freaked the hell out of me, too."
Prime suspect is the missus who hung herself.
What the heck happened?
Beats me.
Over here.
In here.
What?
Give us a hand.
A little more.
Foundit
Idiot!
Don't touch it with your bare hands!
What the...?
Are you a moron?
That's evidence.
"He should've wrapped it in cloth or something, right?"
Gokseong Police Station
"So, she killed everyone?"
That's what they said.
Stop crying and tell me what you want.
I want to listen to Macarena!
There's going to be music here soon.
Their music?
Yuck!
I want Macarena!
"Sing the song you sang the other day, aunty."
Not today.
I have an irritation in my throat today.
No one sings a song when we assemble for it!
Yes.
Some can't sing and some have a bad throat.
Sharma!
You can't even speak!
How will you sing?
"You sing a song, aunty."
Yes.
"Sing for us, Laxmi."
What was that?
Pali or Sanskrit?
"Explain the meaning of the song to us, Laxmi."
Very well.
It was fun...
I see you wearing that for the first time.
You look great.
"Is it only for today, or..."
"Don't get excited, aunt."
What's a matrimonial necklace with so many others?
Aunty...
Yes?
Yes?
God!
You'll live longer wearing my suit.
Make one for yourself.
24 inches!
Must be a good fighter.
Thank you.
Three foot!
What kind of cuff you like?
Wen's style.
6-inch cuffs.
2-foot splits and 5-foot-long suit.
1.8 foot for shoulders.
30 inches waist.
What are the needles for?
The secure your button.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
Let me measure your neck.
Have you finished?
I would have if you had cooperated.
What else you want to do?
Choose the material.
I'll take the piece on your hand.
Cut it.
I know you're the Demon Tailor!
Why do you want to kill me?
My Big Brother Tam King is angry with you.
Can you tell Mr. Tam?
"I want to be his friend, Liang Foon!"
Master!
- Give him his scissors!
"- Yes, Master!"
It's difficult to clean.
"When I was a kid, a tenement on our block collapsed."
Buried some people alive.
"From then on, every time I passed that spot,"
I believed I could always hear them moaning and crying for help.
You through there?
Get started upstairs.
"Why don't you go to bed, Stan?"
Why should I?
Because you make me sick to my stomach.
Douglas...
"All right, Stan."
"You've had enough, let's go."
Mr. Gordon will excuse you.
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Do you think I had too much to drink?
"Whoa, wait."
Wait a minute.
Wait.
"Good night, my dear."
Mr. Gordon.
"Let's go, Dougie."
Come on.
Here we go.
I want to show you that I can be neighbourly too.
Lynn?
"Well, he's in bed."
Probably dead to the world by now.
"Thank you, Doug."
"Good night, Gordon."
It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.
We're heading out.
Regards to President Wilson.
"Hi, it's me, Artie."
"No, I-I-I know."
I know.
"Look, please, do you think you could meet me?"
As soon as possible.
Artie does to us what he's making us do to them.
He keeps us in the dark.
"For all we know, we're decoys too."
"Look, we're all pretty good at our jobs, okay?"
We accepted the risks going in.
"Having intel in the field keeps an agent alive, Pete."
But Artie acts like keeping us alive
Isn't a priority.
"To him, we're just-- red shirts?"
- Yeah.
- Okay.
"First, he doesn't think we're red shirts."
"And second, that's so cool you knew what I meant."
Come on.
He's got a Tesla too.
Drop that weapon!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Grab the tsuba.
Ah.
You get a look?
- We get it?
- We got it.
Yes.
Now give it back.
I'll meet you there.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay.
I have to go.
"Yeah, don't worry."
I got it covered.
Save me some food.
Gus Walker?
This is the FBI.
Careful.
Guess his stolen art isn't an issue anymore.
Okay.
"Yes, ma'am."
Why would Walker steal his own work?
And who killed him?
Someone who knew what they were doing.
No signs of a struggle.
Clean shot.
It's professional.
I've got another question.
Where's the tenth piece?
The tenth piece?
"Yeah, there are nine recovered pieces here."
The surveillance from the gallery shows that Walker had ten photo collages in the show.
So where's the tenth piece?
That was my question.
?
who's here to pay me a visit.
"Special Agent Henson, how are you?"
I'm working.
Jack.
- Amy!
"- Amy, be careful!"
Go on!
"Get outta here, you hear me?"
!
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Go on!
"- Now, easy."
- Go!
Just go!
Come on.
Come on.
"Please, you have to leave."
"You broke your arm, Georgie."
Is it true you did it trick riding?
Or was it broken some other way?
You think I'm abused?
I didn't say that.
Why do you say that?
"Look, I know how the game goes."
"You people are always trying to put words in my mouth, trying to make me say things I don't mean."
"Now, that's not true."
I want you to feel you can tell me things.
You're in a safe place...
I'm not abused.
"Okay, I broke my arm when I was doing a trick riding routine for my aunt Crystal."
It was my fault.
I shouldn't have been doing it with her alone.
- Lou and Peter don't let me.
- Okay.
Always has been.
Good night.
What about the mouth thing we'd talked about?
- Mouth thing?
- I want to show off my new skills.
- Not right now.
- Go to sleep and I'll go to work.
- Can't we just...
"- Okay, I'll back off."
Sleep tight.
- I'm not ready for the tournament.
- You sure aren't.
- Did you give Mia head then?
- You're disrupting my swing!
It just occurred to me.
Try it out.
"If it works, I've got another trick."
- Just a little one.
- Could you open the door a little?
Well put!
It's all about opening the door and ringing the bell.
- Isn't that Mia's brother?
- Mads?
Yes.
"- Hi, Mads."
- Hi.
- Nice guy.
"- Yes, and one hell of a lawyer."
- Hi.
How was your swing?
- Fine.
I just bought a painting marketed as being mouth painted.
"John, listen..."
I've never done what you do.
I know.
Just ask him for the time.
"Or a light, or whatever."
You can do that.
I'll do the rest.
Do you want some fudge?
I've eaten tonnes.
I'd better save some for Manuela.
You OK?
I feel a bit...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can you...stop the car.
Stop the car.
"""It's done."""
Are either of the kid's fathers gonna turn up to this dance of theirs?
Abby's dad sends money in a card each birthday.
"Rob's dad, nothing at all."
I could come if you want.
To the dance.
They'd love that.
"They think you're great, you know?"
Rob said you were cool.
Got some catching up to do.
"Like you said, you're not going anywhere, right?"
"They're good kids, Jess."
You've done a brilliant job with them.
I can't find my shoe anywhere.
I'll need it for the beach.
"'This is freedom, isn't it?"
- Oh baby.
- I missed you so much.
"I missed you too, my darling."
I've missed you too.
We're gonna do that.
We're gonna swing.
We're going to be a family again.
Always.
"Marcus,"
Will you take me back?
"well, i don't know."
- That's all right.
- I need to think about it a little bit.
- Oh.
Oh.
"- Regina: see, i told you."
I thought about it.
Yes.
Oh marcus.
Oh!
Oh.
Mom.
"Oh, y'all go on."
I got this.
This house is busier than grand central station.
- Who is it now?
- Man: papa joe's furniture emporium.
"Well, what you want?"
We don't have anything else for you to take.
"Mama, you let them come in here and take whatever they want,"
Because everything i need i already have right here.
- Come and take it all.
"Ifwe're not there by midnight, someone else gets them."
"All right, I'll take you."
Meet me at the airport at 7.30 tonight.
"I'll wait at the information desk, okay?"
Ofcourse.
Will he come?
Will you go?
I trust her.
Everybody's here.
Let's go.
How's it going?
Right.
Full alert now.
I want you to check every inch ofthis place.
Everything's ready.
He'll never get away.
Don't worry.
We'll take care ofeverything while you're away.
Thankyou.
Have a nice trip.
"While I am gone, take good care ofthe company business."
Please take care.
Jeffrey!
Get away from here!
Run!
She's crazy!
Jeffrey!
"Jeffrey, the cops are everywhere!"
Run away!
"Jeffrey, the cops want you!"
Don't come near me!
"Jeffrey, are you there?"
Harry.
"What are you doing here, Bea?"
"- Oh, Harry, then you're not..."
- Not what?
"Oh, I don't know."
I had the strangest feeling.
- I thought...
- Yes?
You thought?
That you were going away without ever seeing me again.
"Well, why would I do that, Bea?"
- I love you.
Why...
"- Oh, I know."
"But I lost you for a moment, Harry."
- I was afraid.
- But you're not afraid now?
Of course not.
"Well, you see that everything's all right nothing has happened, that I'm the same as I ever was?"
Of course.
- It must have been a dream.
"- Yes, yes, a dream."
You're not angry with me?
Angry?
"Oh, I don't want you to leave me."
Ever.
"Oh, darling."
I love you so much.
- Please don't send me away.
- No.
"Yes, Father?"
It's a good thing I was worried about your behavior tonight.
"You raise, we go there."
We go.
We go to by the punitive expedition.
What happens?
Help!
Help!
help me!
They stop that crazy person!
"They do not touch to him, is infected."
It is not truth.
They are sadists.
"They see here, you will not escape to the Dr. Cicchirini."
-Stop!
-God mine!
They are going to kill me.
"You are going to receive your dose of woods, displeased."
"Get of crazy, cheater."
I am the Dr. Cicchirini!
Cheater you will be it.
One leaves!
They see here.
They see with the Dr. Cicchirini.
-Help!
Help!
-Stop!
Stop!
Mercy!
"Mercy, Dr. Cicchirini."
I pillaged to you.
Now Dr. Cicchirini is going to give a lesson to you.
To thus you do damage him.
"Away, old whore, I do not touch eggs."

I know this from experience:
You need a drink.
It's the village fool again.
"If you're so horny, you can use my current wife."
Look!
Pervert...
Jesse!
"Damn, damn, damn..."
Jesse.
Did I mess it up again?
"No, you're crying."
It's just the dust in my eyes.
"I'd like to invite you and your father to dinner, tonight."
"Goddammit, I'm desperate."
I feel dizzy.
My thesis is all fucked up.
What's wrong with me?
Twenty years of research and I have nothing.
Are you listening at all?
-No.
What?
What's happening to me?
-Jesse to the garbage can!
"Hi there, old faggot."
And plastic bag bimbo.
"Like father, like son."
-Come on.
"Sorry, guys."
Gotta go get laid.
He's an asshole womanizer but open about it.
-Right!
No one's been in here for months.
I'll use my imagination.
Annabelle.
"Coming, Mother."
- What's with the glasses inside?
"- My, um..."
Ahem.
My eyes are a little sensitive today.
- You're new around here.
"- Oh, on the contrary, I'm very old."
Bourbon.
Neat.
I haven't been gone that long.
I would remember someone who looked like you.
Yeah?
Where did you go?
- Around.
About.
- Heh.
Been there.
"Ha, ha."
I love to see a man drown his sorrows.
It's so sexy.
It's more like nursing my wounds.
And you?
I was supposed to be interviewing for the bartender job but I think the manager blew me off.
That's not very nice.
Yeah.
"Last time I was in town, I slept with her boyfriend."
- That's not very nice either.
- It happens.
"Yes, it does."
I shouldn't know about this?
A mother can't know about this?
"- No, I just mean..."
- You're graduating.
- I know.
- So we're here to see you graduate.
This is Raul.
So you and Raul are just here to see me graduate.
Don't be silly.
Your father will be joining me later.
- My father?
- Yes.
Remember him?
"Tall, bow tie."
"I remember Dad, Mom."
I just...
Rory told you.
Yes.
"That's okay, isn't it?"
It's a little late if it's not.
"No, it's perfectly fine that you're here."
Absolutely.
I'm just surprised.
- Who are you?
- I'm Raul.
- I just told you that.
"- Did Rory invite Raul, too?"
Raul is my cameraman.
Cameraman?
He'll be filming the ceremony for us.
He's very talented.
He screened an independent film of his as an audition.
Was that all right?
"Well, I suppose so, my darling."
"And so, go forth and slay the beast."
And take with you the royal blessings and also the blessings of Mother Church.
Bishop!
- Get out of here!
- Bloody sods!
- Is that all?
- That's it.
Right.
Herald?
Have the gates opened.
"Well, carry on!"
Open the gates!
Fare well.
Wait!
He took his vorpal sword in hand
Long time the manxome foe he sought
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
And stood awhile in thought
And as in uffish thought he stood
"The Jabberwock, with eyes aflame"
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood
And burbled as it came
Lance.
"Lance, lance."
Come on.
Come on.

Are you okay?
it was my mom's ring.
I didn't know he had it.
I'm gonna be leaving.
I want you to come with me.
Of course.
- Yeah?
"Right, let's rest and consolidate."
That's what I want to hear all day.
Call you when I wake up.
Bye.
What are you up to?
Where are you going?
Dinner with Lisa.
What?
I'm a bit hungry too.
I can sleep after dinner.
"You won't go, we're eating at street stalls."
Bullshit!
Who says so?
"I go there often, let's go."
Really?
More beer!
Coming!
"No big deal, I eat this often."
Isn't it better at my home?
Why do this comrade like our HK street stalls?
Cos Lisa likes it.
Why didn't you tell me so?
Why you never ask?
Why do you always talk to me like this?
Bad temper.
Yes...
"I'm bad-tempered, lots of faults."
"But my plus point, likes the famous jockey, Silent Witness,"
I never give up.
Lisa...
Marry me?
He's said it.
Uh!
- Ow!
"- Oh, sorry, babe."
What were you aiming for?
"Hey, got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling."
"I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
- Cool.
- Yeah.
Why do we keep hurting each other?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not...
- On the same page.
- Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
- I count that.
Are we OK?
"Yeah, sure."
"I mean, we had the talk, right?"
"It's just that every time you look at me, it's like you want to run away."
"Nah, no, no way!"
"Or if I do, it's just 'cause I'm busy."
"You know, I got places to be, stuff to do, you know, just like you."
"OK, well, as long as we're cool."
Cool as a...
Cool thing.
Look at them all.
They think I killed her.
Nobody thinks that.
Do they Fiona?
'Course not.
Terrible news.
So you better leave at once!
Down there!
Surround them!
Don't move!
"Daddy, I got the Formula!"
You think my daughter would help you?
Fools!
You'll die in a woman's hands some day.
You didn't kiss me.
"Yoyo, you've tricked me all along."
"Daddy, I want him dead!"
See!
I told you!
Your bad breath gave it away.
"Supermac 1, Yoyo, Robin."
You're done.
Say your prayers!
Ready...!
"Have no fear, there are women about."
More women?
Ha!
There are only men here.
Where are the women?
Sisters!
It's time to get rid of the traitor.
"And prove your loyalty to the country, show yourselves!"
Have you forgotten I'm woman too?
What?
She's a woman?
And I'm 100 percent woman!
"You're really dumb, I'm in front of you for so long."
And you still don't know I am woman!
"I feel your anger, yes!"
"Yes, I got your blood pumping, yes?"
No?
Now use it!
Harness it!
Hmm.
Boom!
Everybody into the children's pose!
Heads down.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
Yes?
"Yes, good."
Let's breathe.
"Excuse me, Salvadore?"
I feel like my sacrum is really tight.
Could you just help me stretch it out a little?
"Yes, of course, I will play the role of your husband."
Great.
"Boom, boom."
-.
Boom.
The rain room has fire.
I did not see that coming.
I was getting centered.
I was enjoying the island.
What if Joey had seen?
"Lucy, it was really inappropriate."
"Well, I didn't know that you were so concerned about how Joey felt."
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's drop it.
All I'm saying is that it was pretty uncomfortable.
-Don't.
How's the court?
We're digging our own graves here.
"Keep it, Superman."
"Coffee, please."
It's on the house.
-Thanks.
Where's Hakkarainen?
-I told him to get a job.
Said that to the King!
He'd rather kill himself than get a job.
-Let's drink to that!
Hakkarainen is going to jump from the crane!
Buy me a beer when you get down!
What's this?
You're off-duty.
I know him from way back.
Who am I to stop anyone?
"You want to exercise, fine."
Hakkarainen!
"Show us a somersault, faggot!"
You're a mountain lion!
You'll always land on your feet!
A career leap!
Where did the tomato go?
Show us a fucking triple lutz!
Get back or I'll jump!
-No you won't.
"Don't you know your old friends anymore, King?"
Garbage Jesse!
Dammit...
It's been a while.
"I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary... all's right with the world."
"$10,000."
"10,000."
Cash to you.
I'm not saying to throw the case.
Just... no talking to the DEA.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Yes.
What's it going to be?
What?
That dude wouldn't take a bribe?
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?
"""Morally outraged"", he said."
Threatened to call the police.
And Badger's gonna spill?
Like the Exxon Valdez.
So what do we do about it?
"Francesca, how about I follow you home?"
- No!
- For safety!
What?
"God, you are killing me with that booty."
"Talk to me, guys!"
Come on.
Just tell me what you want!
Jesus!
"No, no, no."
No.
It wasn't me!
It was Ignacio!
He's the one!
I haven't been a very good parent.
I know that.
I fucked up.
But I've always loved you.
"You're my baby, man."
Hello?
Yeah.
May I say who's calling?
"You've got a lovely accent, Sara."
Very compelling.
Where are you from?
What a coincidence.
I'm eating a bagel right now.
Hang on.
It's Sara from Israel for you.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm just taking a mental health day."
How is your mental health?
Haven't quite gotten to mine yet.
I'm still dealing with everyone else's.
"It's not true, that thing you said last night."
What thing I said last night?
The thing about my heart.
It's not true at all.
I can't control my heart.
I mean I wouldn't want to even if I could.
-Sara?
-Yeah.
Can I call you right back?
-Oh my God.
Mom says we should pull ourselves.
It can also ye are not.
It's crisis.
"Lars, you must talk to her."
"I've tried, but she is furious because we conducted the tour."
But you must have the agreement.
Lars.
"I have not seen him in 20 years, since the trial."
So he stands here.
Totally sick.
You just do not let her run over you.
Not this time.
-No.
She takes well to mind.
"Yeah, talk to her."
-Hey it's me.
-I do not know if I want to talk.
-How did it go with Tim?
-It goes well good with him.
He spoke to me twice without screaming.
"Angie, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry I went.
-Are you all right?
You were right.
It was a bad idea to come here.
-Has Something happened?
No.
I'm going home soon.
We can do as you said.
I might take me a little time off from work.
Maybe we can go somewhere.
I want revenge!
He said.
But before anyone could do anything...
Ba-bam!
"It was awful and it was terrible, and it was really, really scary."
What?
No!
Go back!
"Although the charming was fast,"
I was swift enough to repel the attack and leap to safety.
Which is exactly what he wanted you to do.
Oh!
"Charming laughed, just like a crazed maniac."
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Whoa-oa-oa!
"No, no, no, no, no."
"I'm sorry, but I would never let that happen to me."
"Instead, I..."
I...
I woke up.
Yeah.
That's right!
It was all a dream.
You mean a nightmare.
"You know you're on the ceiling, right?"
I will get you for this.
Oh!
And then the lights went out.
It was horrible and sad how Puss pleaded for mercy!
Mercy?
Please!
Said Puss with his last dying breath.
You want to be reduced to an arbitrary number on an arbitrary scale?
- You are trying to get me.
- Not trying.
Succeeding.
"- And spectacularly, I might add."
- You realize I hate you right now.
"Come on, ladies!"
Come on!
Show me something down here!
"Oh, life's a fight, people!"
Let's see some fighting spirit in here!
"Just five more, soldier!"
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Five!
- Two comes after three!
Four!
Three!
Two!
One!
I can't believe he sat on me.
- Is that a common occurrence?
- You haven't taken Benny before?
- No.
- He gets off on being a hard-ass.
- It's my first week.
"- With those arms, bro?"
You could have fooled me.
- Nice to meet you.
Chad.
- Kevin.
Yours?
I won it.
You won it?
On the horse Mr. Fawlty got a tip on.
"I hope you don't mind, I..."
"No, no, not at all."
"I didn't know you bet on the horses, Polly."
"Oh, I don't."
"Only I was in the town, and I passed the betting shop, and I thought, well, why not?"
"Well, why not indeed?"
"Jolly good question, eh, dear?"
"Pity you didn't let me put something on, really."
You realize how much we would've won?
£75 for a £5 stake.
"Still, you know best."
"Those were the odds, were they, Basil?"
"Yes, that's right, dear."
14-1.
I listened in on the wireless just to make sure it had triumphed.
"Enjoy your winnings, Polly."
Thank you.
Polly.
"Yes, Mrs. Fawlty?"
What was the name of the horse?
The name?
Uh...
I've gone blank.
Birdbrain!
Birdbrain?
"No, no, that came in third."
Uh...
Fishwife!
Is it still beauty?
Thank you for letting me know.
Your real look!
So I thought...
I also should tell you.
It's my real look!
My father was the same.
Bald head!
- Xiao Xue!
- Xiao Xue!
Bald head.
What can I do for hereditary?
It's okay.
Don't cry anymore!
I'm sorry!
"I wish one day,"
I can use my own design to build my own garden!
A place as nice as paradise!
"In that paradise,"
- will I be there?
- Of course!
"Because of you, it becomes my paradise!"
Oh!
Wait...
"When I'm graduate, let's get married, how is it?"
- Hello!
"- Xiamu,"
Xiaotian is leaving tomorrow...
Come to have dinner with us!
Xiamu?
Are you still there?
"Someone stands beside you, would it be me?"
- About as sure as an old man can get.
Is she related to you?
No.
Never met her.
"Anyway, thanks a lot."
Thank you.
Could I play anything particular for you?
"Oh, no, thanks."
"I'd love to some other time, though."
Good.
Come back again.
"Now, don't go doin' that, Mrs. Pauley."
You've done enough.
"I want to, Tickler."
?
"[ Piano Stops ] Well, I'm gonna have to earn it."
I don't know.
I have to think adout it.
"In any case, it can't go very far."
He has no education.
He is a dit uncouth.
And you are not a woman.
"You know, Renato, you're a real killjoy."
Are you OK?
"You do everything to hurt me, Renato."
Don't exaggerate.
I'm not exaggerating.
Let me tell you something.
I've had it with you.
I've had it up to here!
And I'm getting the hell out of here.
I've had it.
Contract money?
Hey moron come here.
Yes Boss.
That's it.
I've the advance money.
Fine.
Brothers will pay for their sister's betterment.
Fool.
No.
Tauji.
He's getting Shiv married to Ankita instead of killing him.
Why don't you say something?
The Boss has taken up anew contract.
The rules say... you may sacrifice akin.
But never miss a contract.
And anyway this is about blood-ties and not contract.
Because Shiv is my brother.
I'll say it three times.
He's my brother...
my brother... my brother.
Ayushman.
Remember.
The Boss' blood boils.
And when it does he spares no one.
You were right Ayushman.
We should've burnt him.
We should've buried him.
Go on.
Go...
Didn't you hear?
Shiv is the Boss' brother.
Brother.
Stay home.
It's an end-around.
GEORGE:
"No, no, it's not."
He's still got it.
He's still got it.
STEVEN:
Shit.
- Who let that happen?
It's embarrassing.
GEORGE:
Argh!
DEVON:
That is so embarrassing.
What?
Did any of you guys have a chance to get to the store?
"Oh, yeah, no."
"We're good, we got takeout."
"No, I didn't mean for you, I meant f..."
GEORGE:
"All right, here we go."
"- Come on, defense, wake up."
You have to be kidding me.
I just got a little bit more of this I gotta finish.
There's some laundry I'm gonna put away then I had another load of clothes in the dryer.
"I did get some of the food your dad likes, but some healthy stuff too."
"Just, you know."
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be okay.
[CAR ALARM CHIRPS]
[HAMMERING]
Bend your knee a little bit more.
"She can,t stand me."
"No, you,ve got her all wrong."
"She only seems cold and serious because she,s a scientist."
"She,s not really mean."
"You don,t think so?"
What did you do today?
Today?
Let me see.
I tested steering wheels and pens.
How was it?
Okay.
Steering wheels?
How was your day?
I made -
I was in the kitchen.
Did you see the results?
"There weren,t any."
It was just these guys who were there with different stuff.
careful.
Not under there.
Why not?
"I think tonight we,d better not."
Why not?
"I,m sure we,re covered with wires for a reason."
"CIaudine, you get 400 francs for this week,s groceries."
"Buy only what,s necessary."
You have 30 minutes.
Go.
You chose ariel.
What about two boxes of Dash instead?
Okay.
- Or three boxes of Omo?
At least you had an idea.
I didn't know which goddamn way
To go.
Yeah.
"You know, Lou, you know when"
"I get stuck like that, there's"
Only two people who's lead I'd
Follow in a heartbeat.
That's you and Tommy.
"You've saved my ass, goddamn I"
Don't even know how many times.
So tonight you didn't.
Yeah.
"That's all you gotta say,"
Is yeah?
Uh-Huh?
"No sweat, man."
"Hey, buddy."
Where's the mustard?
Thanks very much.
"You know something, pal?"
"You got to lose, like, 75 pounds."
"Seriously, bro."
If I got to pull you out of a
"Fire, it's gonna be awful slow"
Going.
Juice.
"Hey, lady."
"Wow, that's a really ugly baby."
"I mean, I'm sure she's gonna"
Grow up to be a very gorgeous
"Person one day, but there's no"
- You be easy now.
"Yeah, man, take it easy."
"My God, Miller."
I don't know where to begin.
"Nah, don't sweat it, kid."
There is nothing to say.
I wish there was some way I could repay you.
"Well, for starters, you can give me your left arm."
"In fact, that is why I came by here today."
"Isn't it, Tucker?"
Fair is fair.
"We are just razzing you, kid."
"You keep your left arm, I will keep my settlement."
Hell!
I've heard these guys who'd give his arm and a leg to get a deal like this.
"So, I guess you can call me lucky."
"Well, Miller, if there is anything I can do..."
"Nah, forget it."
No hard feelings.
"I'll see you around, pal."
Hey!
Help!
Hey!
Hey!
It's got my arm!
Somebody help me!
Someone help me!
Reznik.
"I got ya, I got ya."
"Be cool, be cool, alright?"
"Who did it, huh?"
Why didn't you turn the fucking braker!
Can people be evil?
- Where are you getting this...?
From your mother...?
-All her religious crap...?
- No.
You know what?
"Owen, listen put your mother on the phone, I wanna talk to her... she's not here..."
"All right. please have her call me when she gets back, alright...?"
Well.
Dad!
"Owen, I want you to get that crap out of your head, okay?"
You mother just... she has problems... and I'm gonna talk to her.
"So I don't want to hear any more about this, alright?"
alright?
...Yeah...
"You have a good night, pal."
I love you.
"And I'm sorry about the last couple months, but I'll see you real soon, okay?"
- I promise!
Maybe next weekend.
- Okay...
I love you!
Can I come in...?
...You have to say it You can... come in..
Are you a vampire...?
I... need blood.
To live.
- How old are you?
Really.
- twelve...
But...
I been twelve for a very long time...
Porter.
Have you heard of her?
Exactly.
Nouveau riche.
"Excuse me, Gunther."
Mmm-hmm?
What's down that way?
That wing is forbidden for a woman like you.
This way.
This is a...
This spot's reserved.
"Oh, anywhere is fine."
Oh... mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
If you need any...
"Anything at all, you..."
Oh.
Thank you.
Isabel.
Isabel.
Isabel.
I apologize for the unorthodox introduction.
I'm Dr. cairn.
Oh.
I wanted to make sure that all your needs are being seen to.
"Oh, yes."
The institute is lovely.
I'm happy that you're pleased.
You may be feeling stress.
So this tonic may calm your nerves.
How are you responding to the tonic?
I feel better already.
"Look, you got to trust me, okay?"
Everything's going to be just fine.
"Hi, there."
I'm Judy.
Who are you?
Becca.
You're the lady on TV.
"Stay here, Becca."
We'll be right back.
I brought your phone back.
You haven't played the message on TV yet.
I will.
I made a copy.
"Mrs. Jerome, I have to ask you one more time."
Where did your daughter go when she disappeared 12 years ago?
I already told you.
I don't know.
This may be important.
I'll tell you what's important.
Everyone believes Jeffrey's a victim in this.
I need them to hear my daughter.
"Look, I've called the hotline, like, five times."
Why the hell hasn't anyone called me back?
!
You know what?
Forget it.
Don't bother.
"Hey, you seen Nicky?"
She'll show up.
Don't worry.
"Come on, Peter, we gotta go."
Are you in or are you out?
Hello?
Yes I'm fine.
Normal.
Hear about what?
Of course I've read the newspapers.
"Yes, I'll wait."
Luisa.
I prefer to meet Laura by myself.
As you want.
Yes.
Yesterday.
Almost at eight.
Sometimes I heard him saying at dusk time.
When I walked in the terrace door was opened.
"When I saw it, I knew what happened."
Soon people screamed.
Windows opened.
Everybody showed up.
They said someone fell out.
As I was going up in the elevator he was falling down.
Did he try it before?
Never.
I was scared of him doing it before.
But he was fine now.
You know they had to confine him.
He told me the day we met.
He was very good now.
But I have an idea that comes to my mind.
Julian wanted to win.
To win?
Why don't we leave?
I'm afraid of people coming here.
How about getting some credits today?
You told that the elderly man didn't ask for food.
It's not a big deal to find a hungry man in our city.
One moment.
I'm Deepa.
I work in a clothing store in a shopping mall.
I'm Varun.
"Cutting, baking, boiling and frying things."
This is my profession.
Did you just extend your hand?
What?
For an introduction?
No.
Sorry.
I forget this all the time!
It's okay.
No.
Let's start from the beginning.
"Hi, I'm Varun."
Deepa.
Varun...
Excuse me.
Have it.
- Thank you very much.
Shall we leave?
Here...
With no control
"Somehow, I am becoming you."
Without the eyes laying sight...
I am becoming like you.
The fiber of my life shines colorfully.
While killing me with fondness...
Let's see what's down there.
(FOOTSTEPS CLANGlNG)
We're clear.
My God.
He only fired two shots.
"Oh, my God, it's David."
"(MUTTERS) Oh, my God!"
EMERSON:
They must have thought he was dead.
Bled out.
He knew there was a gun hidden down here.
You still with me?
"Yeah, feel nauseous."
"Yeah, well, puke if you have to."
I haven't puked since college.
Keep talking.
Where did you go?
-Brown.
"-Yeah, how long?"
Two years.
"Before you dropped out, huh?"
MAN:
There you are.
(david YELLS)
EMERSON:
They're looking for this.
Mainframe's connected to the computer.
So whatever's on this...
You said the codes were impossible to crack.
Unless you have the original cypher.
"But whatever they're looking for, it's on this, so can you?"
"Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it."
"I picked-up names,"
"Fill Dill, Cill, Guill, Dill, Hill, Trill ..."
Okay.
I've got it.
And will one-up Will.
-Good for you.
We could get our own school.
We are males.
-We adopts.
"-Takes you, I fit."
I have much to do.
"Okay, then can go, go quench your thirst for blood."
The many other Krills at sea.
Many would appreciate Krills have me as a partner.
I'm a hell of a partner.
You're the only school I have.
"You know that, but no intimacy."
-Are you hurt?
"No, I'm fine."
-I'm fine.
"-What is Seymour, gimme a break."
"No, no, Thank you, brother."
My kids are out there.
"Then, no!"
"Erik and Atticus, to hide."
Let's hide here.
"Rolls, rolls, rolls, where I can fly!"
"Look, My favorite penguins trapped a wall of ice."
Let's do a rotation.
-Forever.
Never seen so many seagulls in one place.
"Stay together, do not differ."
You know... .
- You look older.
More grown-up.
- A uniform helps.
- And all the decorations.
- Yeah.
- What have you been doing?
- Living in New York.
I remember you liked to write.
- I did some writing.
- Get any published?
"No, I got a job working for a book publisher."
"He didn't publish those books with the plain wrappers, did he?"
- Remember?
- No.
"- Yes, you do."
Remember?
- Yes.
You were always afraid.
And everything frightened you.
I can't get over how wonderful you look.
Really.
You look great.
Thanks.
"You know, you never said goodbye to me when you left Peyton Place."
You never even said goodbye.
"I'll never forget that Labor Day, Norman."
I won't either.
- I see you have two Purple Hearts.
- Yeah.
What brings you home?
Vacation?
I can't control it.
(DISTANT SCREAMING)
(PANTING)
I don't know when I've had such good sport.
"Thank you, fair lady."
You must feel honored to be chosen by a baron.
Bring her to me!
(ALL SNARLING)
(SCREAMS)
(WHINNIES)
(GROWLING)
What's this?
You're one of our kind.
You're wrong!
I'm nothing like you!
I'm a human being!
Unbelievable.
How interesting.
You're a seriously confused fellow.
One only has to look at your eyes to know what you are.
Unless you're...
Can it be?
A hybrid?
Is that it?
Hello!
"Sorry to interrupt the hunt, Baron Howard!"
And who are you?
A hunter as well.
Only my quarries happen to be vampires.
What?
I wanted your last meal to be special.
"So tonight, you dine on the finest silver."
A convention of predators?
"-There, there!"
-Why was not I invited?
-Will.
"-Guys, guys?"
-Will not go ...
-Get out.
-You will not survive.
Me misses.
Will stop.
I think the best part.
"If I'm invading your space, How about this?"
"No, no, I'm talking about, separated from truth."
More ...
Why?
My life is like now.
"I can change, be less invisible."
"See, you'll be great."
"See you, kid."
"Will, please do not let me."
"I'll take you, you, you, and you."
"Please, someone, anyone, I lost my Will."
"I beg you, please Will my return."
-Mano.
-Sven.
"-I will give to his wife, okay."
"-Okay, thank you."
"Right Sven, here I come."
Form a single queue and smiled.
You must be glorious.
And you must be Sven.
"It is a pleasure for me to know, seriously because I'm thrilled."
Tell me.
What are you doing?
- She wants me to buy her flowers.
"- It's not true, Master!"
That's enough...
I'll buy you some then.
"You naughty pair, go!"
It's all your fault!
- Don't behave like that next time!
- It's all your fault!
He asked me to go to the brothel with him.
So you!
Surely you know what kind of man he is by now.
You!
Interesting?
"Mr. Chao, are you satisfied with three girls?"
Not bad... not bad!
"That's fine, enjoy yourself!"
Ah-chuen!
Master!
Reward!
Yes!
"Thanks, sir!"
"Well, let me continue!"
Do you know what's happened to him?
What?
He can't stand it!
Look how happy you are.
"Jun-kit, you should enjoy yourself in this place."
Why are you sitting there like a fool?
"Come on, cheers!"
"Chung-Ian, go and toast to Mr. Hong."
Is that her mother?
I say yes.
And who's that Ghena?
Why does it smell of wine here?
What wine?
We had a drink with Mashka.
Today is her birthday.
We went to a cafe with the girls.
One bottle of champagne for the 5 of us.
"You do remember Mashka, don't you?"
"We came with her last year, remember?"
A little blond one.
- What have you got on your head?
- Grandma's present.
Take it off.
Grandma's present is for winter.
Go to your room.
Get away from the jam with your spoon!
Go to your room!
Lay off me!
"Oh, what great caviar I cooked!"
"Taste it, daughter."
I don't want it now.
"- Taste it now, I said!"
"- Come on, mama..."
Why does Irishka say that I got a big nose?
Is it really big?
That's how they joke now.
I wish you heard what she says to me.
And who is that Ghena?
Ghena is my colleague.
We work together.
"- Maggie, why don't you go?"
"- No, I'm good..."
"- I don't have a partner, so."
- We'll all be your partner.
"- Come on, we're all doing it."
- I'm keeping score in my head.
"You said you were open to loving some games, right?"
- Come on.
"- Play the game, Mags."
"Get up there, let's game it up."
- [overlapping chatter]
"- All right, games."
- Yay.
- There she is.
Team of one.
Team of one.
Let's do it.
- All right.
- Here we go.
"You're gonna crush it, Mags."
"Okay, okay, shh, shh, shh."
"Okay, everybody's forgotten about you!"
"You're all alone, you're all alone!"
Your only friend's an old man!
Nobody cares about you!
- All by yourself.
- You're lonely!
- It's just you!
- You're lonely!
- Nobody wants you!
- You're lonely.
And everyone forgot about you.
"That's very funny, Shrek, but I know it's you doing this."
"Hey, I..."
"I'm standing right here with you, Donkey."
No way!
This place is not haunted by a ghost!
"And when the sun comes up, Donkey will be the new king of... it's right behind me, isn't it?"
Aah!
- Donkey!
"- Oh, my goodness!"
Aah!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah...
"Well, that's what I'd call a knight to remember."
What do you say we scare ourselves up some dinner?
I'd say...
"Grab the kids, and let's get going."
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
He was so scared.
You probably won't see him for a month.
So what else have you got in your bag of tricks?
Hmm.
I've got seven eggs.
Perfect.
I love this holiday.
Hey!
I am not happy!
Run!
Run for your life!
- Keep away!
Keep away!
- Take it!
LookI know he's not dead.
I would feel it in my heart.
We're soul mates.
No.
Agent Lee.
I need legal help.
We have a suspect who's refusing a cheek swab.
I'll file for a DNA search warrant.
What's the name?
Rebecca Kemp.I'll e-mail you the info.
Listen... you miss working with us?
I think the legal department is more my speed.
"Why, do you miss me?"
"Uh, sure."
Boss...
Agent Lee is getting us our cheek swab.
Rebecca paranoid or guilty?
Might just be angry.
"At Finn, us, the world."
"Go back with her to her apartment, get Finn's stuff."
"And, no, I don't want to wait for a search warrant."
- I'll grab my coat .Wait at the elevator.
- Okay.
"Hey, you."
Where's my money?
"Yeah, you."
Did you and Jimmy spend it?
Please get away from me.
I don't know you.
I am Jimmy's fiancee.
James loved me.
He used you.
"Oh, look."
The Granola family left this.
- What is that?
- It's a native American dream catcher.
It's supposed to keep all the nightmares out and only let the good dreams in to protect your home.
It's flypaper for nightmares?
Mm-hmm.
- Let's keep it.
- Yeah?
"Hang it where, the car?"
It's not much of a home.
Maybe it's time we get a real place.
Are you saying...
Why not?
We've been on the road long enough.
Maybe it's time we retire the Bonnie and Clyde act.
So I think...
I think it's time.
Together?
- Don't you wanna?
"- Like where, Neverland?"
I'm serious.
We could do this.
Where?
Where?
I'll tell you where.
Close your eyes and point.
Whatever spot you pick... that's our home.
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
"Yeah, it's Florida."
- She's beautiful.
Toss your oars up.
We should say goodbye.
"Once we sail, we won't have a chance to talk."
"Goodbye, Father."
"Goodbye, Harvey."
- Boat!
"- Aye, aye, sir."
"Carry on, Mr. Crawford."
Boat ahoy!
"Captain's jolly boat coming alongside, sir."
- Full company aboard.
- Good.
This is Midshipman Crawford.
You must be proud to serve with your father.
Take the captain's son below and introduce him to his messmates.
Stand by to hoist.
Pass the word that Crawford is to be treated the same.
"Understood, sir."
Lots of women aboard.
"Wives, I reckon."
"Hello, my love."
Who are they?
Them?
They're the pressed men.
Follow me.
"Bye-bye, love."
Get those wretched women off!
- Hoist away!
- Dawlish!
Swing them over!
- Clear the deck!

What's the matter Mrs.James?
You better get some good rest tonight.
It's these the hard shifts.
"I had some bad news this morning, Miss."
My Jim's missing.
Oh!
Try not to worry.
I'm sure he'll turn up.
Oh!
"I do hope so, Miss."
I expect I'll feel better when I have cuppa tea.
That's right.
It's finishing time now.
A million bullets for dispatch by the morning!
?
But I tell you the girls have done 10 hours today already.
Yes.
I hear myself urgently.
But you expect these girls to run 14 hours on stretch.
Alright!
I'll ask them.
She doesn't have to ask us.
A million bullets by the morning!
Alright!
"Come on girls, it's gotta be done!"
Stop!
Stop there.
Stop right there.
"Well, you've been very nice, Mr. Thornton."
I
"- I suppose I was a little difficult, but..."
"- well, losing someone you've grown to love isn't-"
"- Yes, I know."
I'm sorry I was so rough.
"Well, I"
- I'm sorry I was so unpleasant.
Mmm.
I'm sorry that I can't think of a thing to be sorry about.
Ohh!
I suppose you've got friends and relatives back in the states.
No.
My husband's all I had.
- Why do you ask?
- Because we got a proposition to make.
Yes?
We know what brought you up here.
We've known all along.
"I mean, old man Blake's claim."
But how?
How could you possibly know?
"Give me that map, Shorty."
Yeah.
Did you ever see this?
"Or, uh, something like it?"
Yes.
"Yes, I've seen the original."
This won't do you any good.
It isn't correct.
I know it.
That's why I was going to suggest that-
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, boy."
"Oh, oh..."
"Oh, boy, oh, boy!"
Ow.
"Hey, kiddies."
Got your juice.
"Oh, thanks, Ethan."
"Thanks so much, buddy."
We can always count on you for juice and juice-related things and... really just juice.
But we love juice.
Are you kids okay?
"Oh, we're just great, thanks."
Last juice of the day.
Great.
"Uh, cran-apple?"
Wait a minute.
Something's up.
Why are you out of breath?
"Well, my trachea constricts due to histamines that my body produces..."
"Okay, okay, Rudy, stop talking."
Why are your shoes muddy?
Because I'm-I'm poor.
"Oh, I'm so poor."
And why are you in your underwear?
Because I am rich.
There's been a burglary.
Somebody stole my chocolate!
I am very shocked by that.
"Okay, what was rule number two?"
Always believe in yourself?
No!
- What?
"Cousin, cousin, where did you find Mickey?"
In a train.
- What transport?
- Me
Are you an innocent?
I could say I'm a virgin man.
Not for long.
It hurts.
I bleed.
"No, you're enjoying it."
That's me bleeding.
You come when I will.
Ready?
"Leon, do not expect."
"Forget the address, forget everything."
Mickey is doing well.
Begone!
I'd like to ...
I can not ...
Yes?
Do not give money here.
Autographs and postcards Post exclusively.
Hungry?
The ladies are asleep.
Do not make any noise.
Come into the kitchen.
"Coffee, chocolate, tea?"
"Below, we, you know All of your disasters."
"Floods, terrorism, wars, famine, innocent martyrs."
"Propaganda, we would laugh."
We want to see.
Don't worry.
"What are you doing, you stupid girl!"
She's very beautiful.
- Who is she?
- Your daughter-in-law.
It's 10 and she is still sleeping.
Had too much to drink last night?
"She is an alcoholic, mom."
"She and Gurmeet Singh will get along so well, I can't tell you."
Good morning.
Good morning.
"Gurmeet, Saira."
"Saira, Gurmeet."
My mom.
"I seek your blessings, mom."
She also pays respect!
"That's enough, drama queen."
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Are you alright?
I'm done for.
What happened?
Look at your hand.
What's happening?
"Quick to jump into bed, quick to propose."
- Awesome.
- Then what!
Yesterday we met your parents.
Today we met mine.
"So now we are kind of engaged, huh?"
Are you asking or telling me?
Do you have full on attraction?
I can not hear you!
Does your heart hurt?
Let me have a look.
"The old warriors believed, that the heart was sacred."
"That if a hunter tasted his flesh,"
I could look at the spiritual world.
But I do not see any spiritual world.
"Maybe she was the only one, who had no soul."
Food for the creatures of God.
"You disappoint me, Bishop."
I expected much more from Mara's husband.
You are more trash than the man.
Barbarous and cruel.
A daughter.
"Our daughter, Mara."
"Come on, Bishop."
Follow me.
How can you leave us alone ?
!
Are you my daughter?
My name is Aluxia.
I have been waiting for you.
- I'm dead?
- Do you feel dead?
Not quite.
Just tired.
You've been dreaming.
Yes.
And you were there.
I do not want to get lost.
"- Leave it alone, Aluxia."
- Ok dad.
How's your leg?
How about you?
"Fine, mama."
I'm fine.
[Speaking Greek]
Your Uncle John passed by to visit me.
"Oh, really?"
When?
Last month.
Too tight?
No.
"Mama, you have to stay off it."
You can't go up and down the stairs.
You have to give it a rest.
Ok.
"Mama, I could take you somewhere where you would be safe and wouldn't be alone."
There would be people around.
You wouldn't be sitting here listening to a radio.
[Speaking Greek]
You understand me?
"This is my house, and I'm not going no place."
"Dimmie, you worry for something."
"No, mama."
You are not happy.
"Tell me, what is the matter?"
"Mama, I'm all right."
"I'm fine, really I am."

- Here we go.
- Here we go.
Richard!
Hi.
Hi.
I thought your car was over here.
It is.
It's down there.
You could give me a ride to it.
Doesn't that break the rules of the thing?
This can be like the afterlife.
"You know, like we're angels or something?"
Cute.
What are you doing in my car?
"No, I don't know you, and you certainly don't know anything about me."
"I mean, what if I'm a killer of children?"
Yeah.
"Well, that would put a damper on things, wouldn't it?"
"See, you're acting like I'm just this regular man."
Like a man in a book who thewoman in the book meets.
I'm not doing that.
Did I just invite myself into your car?
Is that what I just did?
"-Well, I'm sorry."
"- No, I'm sorry."
- I'm sorry.
-You should be.
Good.
Terrific.
Canyou get out of my car now?
Okay.
Okay.
"Both of you, out!"
"- But we're waiting for a call, sarge..."
- Look.
Stand by at home.
I will phone you when the call comes in.
Good.
We'll both be at my place.
"I don't care where you are, as long as you're not here."
Got it?
- Right.
- Good.
Good.
"Hey, why your place?"
I want you to see Melinda.
- Melinda?
- Yup.
"Oh, yeah, the one with the sexy feet."
Right.
And you'll get a free introductory lesson to the Poncherello School of Cool.
"Hello, Henry."
"That's a boy, that's a boy."
Feel better?
What do you think I should use?
Do I give her my Redford approach?
"Or maybe I'll be more continental, like Rex Harrison."
I just want to see her feet.
"Well, maybe I'll try my Stallone."
"Hey, hey, come here."
Hey!
"Hey, Ponch."
"Oh, mister, don't open that hood."
"Don't open that hood, whatever you do."
You didn't eat the turkey sandwich I brought you last night.
I know you must be hungry.
So I...
I've prepared a protein drink and a wonderfully nutritious salad.
"Looks good, doesn't it?"
Doesn't it?
Yes.
You look pale.
- Do you have a fever?
- No.
Let me see.
Watch what you're doing.
Damn it.
I don't have time to change.
It's getting late.
- Are you going out?
"- Yes, I'm going out."
Where?
"Well, let's just say I'm..."
I'm going to make a house call.
What does that mean?
"That's my business, Mrs. Carrington."
Just as I want you to make it your business to clean up that mess.
And to eat something before I get back.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Travers.
"Yes, please come in, you've been expected."
"Why, thank you."
"Anna, please take Dr. Travers' coat."
Thank you very much.
Mrs. Carrington?
Yes.
"I have seen it, Shiv."
What happened?
I am remembering a few things.
Just a second.
It's a classic 70mm 3D Jodha Akbar scenario!
Oh God!
I look so hot in that costume.
And Zak was getting beaten up back then as well.
Take a look.
He looked like a joker back then too.
And you were so sexy back then too!
Press it again.
Press it again.
Go to hell if you don't want to believe it.
Baby... slave...
Massage my feet before you leave.
- Get lost!
- Farewell my subjects!
Wow!
Helicopter!
Who am I?
Osama?
Shiv...
- Yes.
- Don't move.
- What happened?
There's a spider on you.
What are you doing!
Where did it go?
- I feel ashamed.
- Why?
"Back in that life, you had killed a tiger."
I made friends with a transvestite prostitute.
Another one?
Big deal.
Uh...
I slept with Olivia!
You what?
!
That's good.
Yeah.
More stuff like that.
Tell her where.
"Uh, okay."
In your living room.
"Kitchen floor, on your bed... where your head goes."
Olivia!
"Oh, I'm not ashamed of anything I did to him."
"I am, a little."
Can you at least wear the gloves?
You're getting palm sweat all over the steering wheel.
Don't worry.
I'm getting everything.
"Over the shoulder, over the shoulder!"
"Abby, over my shoulder!"
"Okay, all right."
"If it makes you feel any better, way more people than this have gathered around to see my vagina."
That does not make me feel better.
Nor I.
Billie!
Billie!
Zack!
Did I miss anything?
I love you.
"Oh, it's Wayne."
How are you now?
"Oh, not so bad."
"Yeah, this one's too hard."

Trouble in paradise?
"If there was, she wouldn't know it."
I'm not talking to her.
Well played.
Wait it out.
That way she'll come to the conclusion that you're upset with her and ask you why.
- Precisely.
- She should anyway.
- If she's smart.
- I know.
- Why are you mad at her?
- She acts like...
You should try an open relationship.
Could be productive.
You could also try a hall pass.
Don't bother me.
Stealing is bothering.
Nobody steals anything on my shift.
Yeah!
Wha... we've been locked in here all day.
I don't buy it.
"I don't buy it, either."
I think I know who likes chocolate.
Everybody.
"Yes, right."
But especially kids.
I heard this one say she wants to put her face and her feet in it.
I stand by that.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
Would you be dumb enough to hide it in here?
"I guess you're dumb enough to think we would hide it in there, Ethan."
"Yeah, you gorgeous idiot."
Or maybe you kids hid it in the bathroom.
Whew...!
"Eh, maybe give it a minute in there."
It's not in there.
"Get up, Rudy."
N-No.

"That's why we have lots of ammo, Zelda Sayre."
Allow me.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Speak up!
Marie.
Marie?
- I found her.
I promised her not to tell you.
What're you saying?
This is Marie's tattoo.
Don't go.
Don't go there!
Shit!
Schrader.
Call out a large-scale search for H.K. Minks.
"Yes, Minks!"
Schrader.
What a shame.
But it had to end this way someday.
I didn't think anyone knewwhere she was.
Howthe heck did they find her?
You're not serious.
We just have to see your face.
We only need this here.
That's how Gunzel probably contacted lrezumi.
We' ll get him.
He can't pass this up.
"Maya, it's just a matter of time before you're discovered."
You don't understand a thing.
I'll keep my eye on you.
Nothing will happen to you.
You thought differently yesterday.
Damn it... yesterday!
"All right, come up here."
"Professor, mind the Torch."
You all right with this?
Yeah.
Hang on.
Hit it.
"All right, stop it."
"All right, professor."
Your turn.
Come on.
Top rope.
Hang on.
"Oh, blast."
"Hold on, MacGyver."
"Pull it, Kelly."
Pull!
Come on.
Come on.
Thanks.
Oh.
Let's go.
"Thousands of years ago, before time itself was measured, as we know it, there... was..."
Atlantis.
"It was a great city, dedicated to art and science."
"And the people of Atlantis lived in high-rise buildings, and had indoor plumbing."
"They also invented geothermal technology, and there are even more important lessons to learn from Atlantis."
"Now then, what are they?"
"Yes, Brian."
They created democracy.
Very good.
Yes.
Another.
Under what name are you working at the Ministry?
"Delacroix, Delacunt, Delacock!"
"And then, Jewish names like Ben Asshole that smell fishy in the Ministry?"
Stop your bullshit!
Lay off.
He's honest.
Like honest?
"Be honest, then!"
Keep it simple and straight.
You love her how much?
You don't get it.
She's very expensive.
Sorry...
Thank you...
It's not right to burn people.
I'll give you everything.
"My name, my memories, my life."
My handkerchief.
"Throw me away whenever you want, if you have to."
Idiot.
"Don't get hooked, that's my woman."
You want to love her too?
"- Yes, that's my handkerchief."
- And me?
Oh yes!
And you?
Maybe.
Lovers...
Friends...
A meeting of ends.
"I'm taking her, she's too decent for you!"
- Looks serious.
No I mean we've hung out a lot but...
nope.
Well if you were telling me you were just going to leave him to the uneducated models in LA then I am going to have to jump his bones.
For both of us.
So are you an actress?
No no not really.
I thought I was for a minute but.
Turns out it's not for me.
Way too much self-analyzing.
So what do you do now?
I design jewelry.
These are mine.
They're very nice.
- Thanks.
Did you hear?
Hear what?
Zaps magazine just named you number one in their Hottest Man Alive issue.
Yes!
Can I...
"Oh, come on are you kidding?"
"I mean come on Cece, it's Zaps magazine."
Yeah.
- It's not exactly...
Wait you're leaving?
Yeah where's Becca?
She's with the producer.
Make sure she gets home OK.
Ok!
Bye... mwa.
Hang on excuse me for one second.
"Hey, Dale..."
Hey Dale.
Unable to move without putting them in danger.
"Will contact the supervisor, and launch the assault."
- Heard!
- Wait.
"Today, it does not burn the garbage."
Sorry.
Mr. Matsuda!
Why my father hostage?
Your father has traded against the girl.
What?
!
What it seeks to do ?
!
I hate those who do it alone!
Sorry.
We will try to learn more.
Your father know the hostage taker.
When your mother died it is your father who stopped Otoharada.
What?
As for his responsibility to the crime he committed...
"Hey, Matsuda!"
What do you do?
- Get out there!
- Heard...
There's your sister inside.
See you later!
Sayu...
Yagami!
Dad...
Dad!
Was recovered girl!
The leader?
- West Virginia?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Something's come up.
You're kidding.
Something of national interest in West Virginia?
"No, scientific."
I'll tell you about it later.
Cy's beginning to look rabid.
"Keep him at bay, okay?"
Are you okay?
You sounda little stressed.
"No, I'm fine."
I'll talk to you later.
We were parked up here... and sort a making out in the back seat.
And what happened next... is sort of hard to explain.
"Next day, I woke up and...both my... my eyes were swelled up."
What did the doctors say?
He couldn't explain it.
See this one here?
It ain't never healed.
We're getting engaged.
That's good.
"Yes, talk me?"
Talk me?
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.
Mr. Klein.
Hello.
I want to speak with you.
Ok.
Last night I woke up... with the worst headache
Should be just around the corner.
It's number 24.
24.
24!
- 24.
- Are you done?
"Sorry, let's do this."
What's the guy name?
Her who was it?
- Her ex-boyfriend?
- No!
"No, the ex-boyfriend had an alibi and he checked..."
God.
"That's right, you weren't at the meeting this morning."
But I had to shop for a dress.
I can't wear the same thing every show.
I had to wear the same blouse three times last week.
Three!
Three.
"Three, tres, three."
- Hello.
- Sorry.
Just remind me.
"All right, his name is Malcolm O'dwyer."
He's some kind of lottery fanatic.
Wrote a bunch of fan letters to Marissa before she was killed.
Hey!
I'm a big fan!
- Thank you very much.
- Not you.
The Lotto girl.
You'll thank me later!
- Was it?
"Fucking hilarious, he totally did you."
- Have they chucked him out?
- Doubt it.
"Not gonna chuck him out for that, just a scuffle."
- He kicked me in the cock.
- Good shot!
- What happened to Hannah?
"- Erm, I think you blew it when a twelve year did beat you."
I fucking slipped!
He's talking to a load of Northwood lads.
- What?
"- They don't look twelve, to be fair."
"Fucking hell Si, you muppet."
We are so dead.
What?
Dead?
That should be the end of it!
"Simon's taken a beating, a child's honour's been restored."
- I didn't take a beating!
- Yeah.
This is Northwood.
"It's not the end, it's the start!"
- We do what now?
- I get Charlotte?
- Is she hard?
"- No, she'll get them thrown out!"
"I'll go find her, you go and hide somewhere."
- Hide?
"- Yes, hide."
- Toilets?
- Charlotte!
- Don't you have any friends?
- None in particular.
- Who drove you to work?
- Where did you see him?
Out the window of Mr Moravia's office.
I don't miss much.
"That's Stiller, a guy I work with."
- How about that woman?
- What woman?
The one that gave you the lunch.
"That's Rose, Stiller's sister."
- Is she your pash?
- My what?
Your passion.
I don't know.
When you're...
"when you're flying all the time, you don't really have much of a chance with women."
I think you hide behind that scar too much.
- You ever do anything with her?
"- What do you mean, ""do anything""?"
"You know what ""do anything"" means."
You're blushing.
Your veins'll be too close to the skin.
I've known people like that.
I'm hungry.
Hey!
Hey!
Wait a minute!
- It's Stiller!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Jimmy!
"Yeah well, let's call it my retirement plan."
You killed Yale.
And Paolo.
You dragged them into this.
Now give me the fucking numbers.
You're outta luck asshole.
I forgot 'em years ago.
Really?
Oh you did?
I don't think so.
"- Papa, please help us."
- Please...
Mama?
You know it's gonna take me a little while to get to Zurich so make yourselves at home.
There's a bottle of Chateau Le Fit in the cellar.
You kids knock yourselves out.
I'll see you at the bank at four.
You remember where that is.
"'Kay, we're not staying here."
And I am not letting you out of my sight.
Get her ready to go.
Hurray.
"No, no."
Please.
- Please.
- Listen.
Listen to me.
Listen.
"You say nothing about this, and your daughter will be home tonight."
Talk to anyone and she's dead.
You understand what I'm saying.
"Look, I"
Get me another commander.
"I'm here, sire."
I can't wait to get my tentacles on 'em.
"Damaras already called up tentacuss, boss."
And more xborgs stand ready.
Good.
Crush this resistance.
Hard. [remote screaming] [laughs]
I'll show the prince how easy it is to handle these humans.
[laughs]
I hope he likes the way I'm redecorating the place.
"[screaming] [super red] Hey, squidface."
Huh?
[grunting]
Ah.
The Power Rangers.
"I've been warned about you, but you look different."
Huh.
You should have heeded that warning.
Ugh.
So much for introductions.
Get them.
[battle cries] Let's switch.
It will double your blasting power.
Thanks.
My super mega saber's all yours.
Thanks.
You gotta have the right tools for the job.
Ugh.
Yeah.
Let's get that job done.
I'm on it.
It's possible.
"Oh, my God."
What are we going to do ?
Everything we can.
Another great vacation getaway in the Pegasus galaxy.
Where is everyone?
There's smoke from the chimneys.
They're inside.
Can't say I blame them.
There's nothing I hate more than a damp cold.
Let's check this out.
"Howdy, folks."
- Who are you?
- Sheppard.
"This is Teyla, Ronon, McKay."
You from Ratira?
No.
"From over the mountains, then?"
A little further.
Then you've come a long way.
You'll be in need of food and drink.
Sit.
I take it you don't get many strangers around here.
No.
Especially not those that travel near dark.
Why is that?
You really don't know?
Callum.
What's your business here?
"No business, really."
We're just travelers.
We got in an accident.
"Oh, my God!"
We almost got in an accident.
That seems like a really important distinction.
"There was this big truck, and it barreled through a stop sign, and it missed our car by inches."
"Oh, my God!"
And everyone's okay?
"- Yes, just very shaken up."
- Aw.
"But, Mitchell, I am so sorry that I yelled at you before."
It's fine.
"Look, I brought you the birthday card for mom,"
- and you can sign it.
- Okay.
Thank you.
"- ""To our best friend."""
- Mm.
That's a little sarcastic.
It's her birthday.
- I don't know.
"- No, I mean it."
"Mitchell, I almost died."
I want our mom to have a great birthday.
"Oh, and we're doing this again."
- Okay.
"- Oh, God."
Yeah.
Hi.
"I'll be there in a sec, yeah."
"Okay, my deposition got moved up."
That's great.
So I'll just have to move everything... you know what?
"You know, i thought it might be him."
Oh.
"Well, what happened?"
Did you come to any conclusions about anything while you were out?
Mmm.
"I'm okay, ma."
I'm really okay.
- You sure?
Talk to me.
- I...
I just feel like...
Remember saul on the road to damascus.
Of course.
I used to read you that story.
Do you remember when god struck him and he went blind?
- Yes.
Yes.
- He went blind for three days
"And then when he came back,"
You remember how he saw the error of his ways?
"Mm-Hmm, yes."
"Well, i was running today..."
- Mm-Hmm.
- ...and i was trying to clear my head.
"I was trying to hear from god, mama..."
- Oh.
- ...and i just started looking at people going by.
I saw this mother.
She was playing with her kids.
She was pushing her child on the swing.
"And, mama, that..."
The mother looked like
You killed Jerry the bookie with a bat?
It's not like a half mil is gonna hurt you with that lottery ticket.
"- Get me the money, Russ."
- Ohh!
"Great, Gig."
We gotta talk about this.
"I'll fuckin' ball-bat you, you creep cock sucker."
"Okay, okay."
Okay.
[ Coughing ]
- Mint Listerine?
- Yeah.
- When did they come out with this?
- I don't know.
- Is it good?
"- Yeah, it's good."
[ Tires Screeching ]
"Look, just give this Dale guy a little extra money."
- It's better than losing it all.
- Better than being dead too.
"Crystal, he hits people with commemorative bats!"
He's not gonna hit you with a bat.
He's your friend.
- What?
- Wanna see the jacket i got?
He's not my friend.
I just met this guy.
How can he be my f -
- Look - $900.
- [Sighs]
Made in Italy.
I'm not screwing around anymore.
She'll be lucky to get married.
You'll be lucky to avoid getting married.
- To who?
- Don't ask.
- You're expendable.
- Eli's in love.
- Would you like to bring her?
- You know her.
Gracie's friend Carla.
"Oh, my goodness."
Really?
She's so lively.
"Yeah, lively, that's her."
- She's bizarro.
- That's you.
"- You're welcome to bring her, Eli."
"- Okay, I'll ask her."
"Dad, did you read my essay?"
"When you write it, I'll read it."
"Oh, my God, that reminds me."
That money for the pictures was due yesterday.
If you'll give me the form like I keep asking...
"Oh, Rick what is it?"
I've been subpoenaed to appear.
Subpoenaed?
To appear where?
Before a grand jury investigation of the Atlantor project.
[Rick] No.
You're right.
"Walter, this is unbelievable."
Okay.
All right.
"Look, he's been through a lot."
"Just don't break his heart, OK?"
"Oh, my God!"
I just...
You know...
Wh...
What can I say to you to make you understand that we are not together?
"You know, if you don't believe me, you can ask..."
Ask my boyfriend.
- You have a boyfriend?
"- Yes, I do."
It's a very serious...
I love him.
"I'm sorry, I..."
I guess it was just a misunderstanding.
Mm.
- I'll let you settle in.
"- Yeah, OK."
And please feel free to spread the word.
No.
Listen to this.
"""Spend two weeks at a sixteenth century Tuscan farmhouse."
"Each night, you prepare an authentic Italian meal learning from local chefs."""
Wow.
Interested?
Two weeks cooking?
"What part of ""vacation"" do you not understand?"
- Are you expecting a fax?
"- Well, no."
"I mean, yes."
I am.
My papers from my office.
Hold on.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.
Thepresident'swithme.
"This guy, Stenz.."
made multiple calls to a secure line in D. C..
but we don't know who received them.
The database was wiped 30 minutes ago.
Really?
Did you check Walker's personal records?
"His computer, his emails?"
"You don't know Walker, John."
He was a dinosaur.
The man still used a pager.
"Oh, shit."
Listen.
"Carol, I got to check something out."
We'll see you outside.
I don't believe it.
"I think I know how Walker got the codes, but I'm gonna need your help, sir."
Move back!
Move back.
Emily.
"Oh, baby, you okay?"
"Oh, thank God."
"Thank God, baby."
Did you see my routine?
Yeah.
"Oh, I'm so proud of you."
"You were beautiful, baby."
You saved us.
You know that?
"Hey, stay with Mommy for a second, okay?"
We just got back off tour.
"- You had a band, didn't you?"
- We're Silicone Valets.
"- You didn't teach these Flop Idols, did you?"
"- Yeah, tried to."
For me sins.
"- Too rebellious to teach, us."
"Weren't we, Miss?"
- No.
Just too thick.
"- Do us a quarter, will ya, Moz?"
"- Oh, two quarters for me."
Cheers.
"Quarters, eh?"
You are doing well.
"Oh, yeah."
Now who's thick?
Keep the change.
"Well, you completely cleared me out."
I'm gonna have to have a major restock.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Ah, well, better get back."
- Nice to see you both.
- Yeah.
"Oh, actually this is our first EP."
"It's called ""Exhibit A""."
Thanks.
"Hope the teaching works out, Miss."
"Yeah, I know I couldn't handle a load of kids screaming' at me every day."
"No, 'cause that's for successful bands, i'nt it?"
Bye.
"All right, fella?"
- Stop that!
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"- Don't worry Miss Morgan, I'll call the police."
"Don't call the police, this is my husband!"
- He doesn't have a key?
- Don't ask.
"See, I told you I know her better than you."
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
What... what... what is going on?
What are you doing here?
"Well, I..."
I came to see YOU.
Why?
- Why did you come to see me?
- Well...
I...
"In... in... in light of our last conversation, and after speaking with Henry, I..."
I...
I've come to realize... that... alth... alth... alth...
although you might... might have significant reservations about e... e... even considering...
Gregory!
What!
I'm aging here.
What is it you want to say?
"God, you're beautiful."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Gregory."
What?
"I'm so sorry... for the way I acted and for the things I said, I..."
"- I know that I hurt you, and..."
- That's okay.
"Billy, I could bust through this really easy, but it would cause a mess."
"So, what I could do is--"
"I can get the molding off, and I think that's the way to go."
[opens knife]
Are you all right in there?
"Well, we got a little problem here, but"
"I""ll get you out."
"Just stay calm in there, remember, most accidents happen in the home."
There it is.
I don't believe that they use doors like this.
I'll get you out.
As easy as pie.
Be careful of that water now.
when you're in the desert.
I'll have you out of there in a second.
There we go.
Now just one little push and we're home free.
Help!
Help!
Help!
[car starts]
Billy?
"Where are you, Billy?"
Come on out.
Let's play.
[singing indistinctly]
"I miss you, Daddy."
Daddy!
"Oh, Billy!"
Billy!
Billy?
Billy!
I'm just letting you know.
"Okay, 10-4."
"Hop in, boys."
We got to make a stop before we head to the Malcolm place.
Open this door!
"Goddamn, Lureen!"
Harlan!
Goddamn it.
Harlan!
Settle down.
Settle down.
"Harlan, goddamn it."
(GLASS SHATTERS)
You calm down now.
Let go of me.
"You want to take a ride with me, huh?"
You want to take a ride with me?
"He laid out all night drinking, Hurricane."
Okay.
What are those men doing here?
"They're not here to take him away, are they?"
It's okay.
She locked me out.
I understand.
"I understand, I understand."
"Now look, you laid out all night drinking and you knew she was going to do this, didn't you?"
Yeah.
"You say you're sorry, I'll bet she'll let you in."
LUREEN:
He knows I will.
We'll go to church on Sunday and he'll feel a whole lot better.
You won't let them take him away?
That's all we need for now.
"You know, I don't think they're going to Jeremiah's at all."
Me either.
Fantasia's coming home to see her kid.
"Hey, Hurricane, just how well do you know this gal anyway?"
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
"Ha, ha, that's real fucking funny."
Fuck.
Goddamn her.
Ronnie.
Lila.
"Why, look at you."
You've gone to Hollywood.
Look at you.
You're all grown up.
"Stand back, let me have a look at you, girl."
"Yeah, you're still ugly."
I'm just playing.
You look fine.
"You know what, I'm feeling fine."
I'm going to go see my baby.
I'm going home.
"You can't go home, Lila."
The cops are after you.
What did they say?
Get in the car.
"You know, I didn't do the things they say I did."
"Yeah, I know that."
Being on the run makes you look guilty.
I already look guilty.
And looking guilty's being guilty for black people.
"Hey, buddy."
This place has gone totally downhill.
"Hey, buddy, where'd you come from?"
"I saw you inside, raising hell."
"Yeah, that chump took my backpack!"
"So, Natasha..."
Yeah.
"Man, what about her?"
Have you seen her?
"Long gone, bro."
She hasn't danced here in months.
You know where she is?
"Last time I saw you, you wanted to punch my face in."
You remember that?
- Vaguely.
- It was that chick.
Zoe.
- Out of the picture?
- Out of the picture.
- You got blow?
"- No, man."
Why would I have blow?
Natasha...
Got a couple ideas where she might be.
There he is!
"Welcome back, Conner!"
- Ah!
"That really does hurt, man!"
- Chemical burns will do that.
Not too serious.
Looks like the EMTs did a good job irrigating.
That ambulance guy brought my camera?
"Oh, wow, complaining."
"That's very interesting, considering nobody invited you."
"Before I came along, you were on a skateboard."
Oh!
Oh!
You like them?
"Yeah, I guess."
"Well, what do you like?"
Everything.
"Well, I don't know."
I don't really listen to music.
"Dude, that's kind of weird."
Why?
What do you like?
"Uh, right now... punk."
"I'm sorry, Avril Lavigne doesn't count as punk."
Oh yeah?
"Well, what about the Cramps?"
Stiff Little Fingers?
The Clash?
Sex Pistols?
I listen to the same music as Marissa Cooper?
I think I have to kill myself.
"Listen to punk, huh?"
I'm angry.
That's it right there.
Looks scary.
"Well, then, you can stay in the car."
"You recognize this place, Ryan?"
This isn't...
Where are we?
"Well, it's one of my mom's housing developments."
Look at this.
4 more break-ins on casino boulevard.
It's getting so you can't walk out the door anymore.
"Well, you can walk out the door."
You just can't go left.
That's not the point.
"A man should be able to walk out his front door, turn right, turn left, or walk right out into the street if he wants to."
"Don't make me lock you in the house, dad, ok?"
"Well, hello."
Ooh.
That shirt looks sexy on you.
Does it?
"I, uh, hadn't noticed."
"Hi, I'm Doug."
I'm a pisces.
I like walks in the rain and bags of pork rinds.
"Work it, baby."
Work it.
"I got the trash, babe."
That'll be our deal.
"Every time you buy me a shirt, I take out the trash."
"Oh, that's ok, honey."
I got it.
I got it.
"No, really."
It's fine.
What--what is this?
Barry's big and tall shop?
What?
"Oh, that's trash, baby."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop?
Did I?
Back to work.
"Hey, Kelli Ann."
Did I get any calls?
"Since you asked me 11 minutes ago, no."
Not a lot of phone traffic.
"- Oh, my God."
- What?
What's her name?
Who?
"The girl, Alex."
There's no girl.
"You can't hide it, man."
I know strung out and you are strung out.
"Okay, please."
KELLI ANN:
This is amazing.
"You can't focus, right?"
"Jumping every time your phone rings, checking your e-mail 100 times a day wishing you could write songs."
"No, feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations."
"It's always the same and it has happened to you, my friend."
Shit.
"Welcome to my world, asshole."
Let me get the door.
Sure I can't interest you in a little beef and broccoli?
I gotta finish this stuff.
Okay.
- Yeah.
So I'll see you at home.
- Okay.
I love you.
I love you too.
- Okay.
I forgot mine...
Please...?
Give me the fucking keys!
Thanks!
"- See you at home, little girl..."
- Hey!
- Shut up!
- But I didn't say anything!
Shut up!
"Abby, I did it!"
You did what...?
They were gonna push me in a hole.
In the ice.
So I got a big stick and I hit him in the head really hard.
He had to go to the hospital I almost got suspended.
But I did it.
What you said.
I stood up to them.
Owen Yeah?
- Hey...
You wanna go somewhere...?
- Where?
"""ENTER UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH"""
- It's pretty cool huh?
- Yes.
This this kid who used to live in the building.
Tommy.
"He would come down here and drink and smoke with his high school friends, and.."
"And when they weren't here, He would play ping-pong with me."
He was really cool
Then he had to move away.
I kinda like it here...
He saved Ben.
- We're his parents.
How is he?
- It's too soon.
- The news said his heart stopped.
- It's going now.
- How's he doing?
- Coag looks good.
Lytes are normal.
- Blood pH 7.37.
- Thank God for small miracles.
- How's the patient?
- He hasn't gone into DIC.
There are reporters crawling all over.
- What's his temp?
- Eighty-five degrees.
- He's not warming up enough.
- Heated pleural lavage?

- She's bipolar.
She's bip...
She's an official lunatic.
And you let us get in a car with her?
"I tried to talk you out of it, but you would never listen to me."
If you would've told us she was crazy.
"No, near the mall."
"No, I'm fine."
"No, Mom, I just need you to come pick me up."
"Mom, no, please, just come pick us up."
"Izzy, I'm so sorry to have to put you through this."
"Grace, it's me."
I always knew.
I always knew there was something different about your mom.
Go.
Go.
"I'll deal with Olivia, okay?"
- Mom?
"- I'm up here, honey."
How could you do this?
You lied to me again.
You stopped taking your medication again.
"- Oh, I have my medicine."
- I hate you.
I'm done.
I'm so over it.
I have my medicine.
It's right here.
Something to preserve.

A walk with me feels like a date to you?
"No, not really."
There should be a sunset for a proper date.
And flowers.
A light drizzle...
Soft music...
A long walk...
And endless conversations.
Conversations.
And what if it starts pouring down heavily?
Then?
What happened?

"Um, are you still with her?"
"Look, I told you..."
I told you we were having problems.
Are you still with her?
"All this time, you were... ..you were just lying to me about being separated."
"Technically, she was in Melbourne, I was here."
"Oh, my God."
I...
I just wanted to be with you.
"Oh, my God."
"OK, I can explain everything."
Do you know what?
Don't even bother.
Because I can see that the next word out of your mouth is gonna be a lie.

Yes.
What shall we do?
This wasn't mentioned in Fubuki's report.
"Have Jinpu, Usyuki and one more stay behind to guard, and the rest of you, go down to the lowest layer."
Damn you!
This is special agent Fubuki.
The two Dangaioh pilots are in my custody.

- Is that a problem?
- No
- No?
Close your eyes.
Come on.
Okay.
All right.
"Oh,my."
They're gorgeous.
But why?
Tonight is your night.
You're going to be hearing a lot of speeches from people and...
I'm not going to bore you with one of my own.
I'm just...very proud of you.
"Jeff,there's something I need to tell you."
- sara.
- Hi.
"Senator,we still have to meet with the governor's people."
And security's now requested we arrive an hour earlier.
Thank you.
You should get ready.
Was there something...?
No.
"Later,when it's,um... when it's just us."
All right.
Shall we?
Okay.
"Don't reference the early readers program, at least 15 people in this room voted against it."
"Sugar, could you just do me one small, little, teensy favor?"
Anything.
Could you leave me alone for like 30 seconds?
Anything but that.
"Yeah, I forgot my gumdrop buttons."
Yeah.
"Could you run over there and get 'em for me, please?"
Sure I can.
I'll be right back.
"Gingy, Gingy..."
"Run, run, run as fast as you can, if you want to remain a gingerbread man!"
"Oh, Gingy."
I don't understand.
I thought you were happy.
"- Oh, well, I..."
- It's all my fault.
I should have tried harder!
"No, no, no!"
Don't try harder!
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.
I can be pretty!
Really pretty.
The girl of your dreams.
- Remember?
- Leave me alone!
Gingy!
"Let go, Gingy!"
"Fall with me, so we can be together forever!"
Here's a thought.
You let go!
Together.
Together for...
You know it'll be three months until we get a spare part.
Make sure it doesn't happen again.
It won't.
Back to work!
I've got them very cheap.
Take a look at the large one.
- How much?
- 350 FM.
That's for women!
Try it on.
Too small for my girlfriend.
Look at him!
She's looking good.
How much for the trousers?
I'll give you 50 FM.
"No, 150!"
I can't give you more than 50... for that used rag.
I've made some progress with a serious man.
A rich man from Sarakollé.
He just needs to swallow the bait.
This has no future.
"She'll end up getting married, like our sisters."
Watch out!
The Director's coming.
You old whore!
Who did you date yesterday?
"In the afternoon, Seydow."
The ugly one?
Is the Minister in?
I'm Makan's secretary.
Fatou!
The Director wants to see you... tomorrow at 4 pm.
Ow!
Stop!
Ow!
Ooh!
Ah!
Ow!
-
- What's going on?
-
"- I'm just having fun, that's all!"
"You get dressed up to do a bit of shopping, not to be knocked over by an errand boy!"
"Of course not, Mrs Featherstone."
"Come and sit here, my dear."
Take the weight off your purse.
Not even me husband used to get as close as that!
Whereabouts did you catch her?
I don't know.
Everything went black.
She's a widow woman.
Everything's black to start with!
"God, it could have been anywhere!"
"Hey, come on, you're supposed to be customer--finding."
Get out there.
Go on!
"Dear, dear!"
"You look sad, Granville."
You poor love!
What is it?
It's advanced training.
"Oh, if it's only to do with the shop!"
I thought you were really depressed -- heartache or something.
That's what I mean.
"Brevity, the soul of wit."
But he was a writer.
Look at all these letters.
"No, there's something weird about this."
"Monk, look around you."
That note's probably the least weird thing in the whole apartment.
This is the birthplace of weird.
But why today?
This guy was a lottery nut.
Isn't tomorrow night the big jackpot?
Yeah.
"Yeah, he probably knew he'd never win, which makes him a whole lot smarter than me."
What do you got?
Contact lens case.
With only one lens.
Fluid!
It's fluid!
I need a wipe.
I don't have a wipe.
G-give me a wipe.
Just I need a wipe.
Where's Natalie?
I'm your biggest fan.
I never Miss a show.
Thank you.
That means a lot.
"Natalie, what's your favorite number?"
"My gosh, there's so many."
- Mine's 19.
- That's a good one.
Do you think it's gonna come up on the show tomorrow?
"I'm sorry, Mr. Monk."
"None of my business, but I know you and Bradfield were..."
He really liked you.
Anyone could see that.
Like I said... none of my business.
"When I mentioned Clifford Bentley, that last fella spat on the floor."
Right.
This is it.
Reggie Barker.
How would David move the body on his own?
I've seen a wife butcher a husband twice her size.
You'd be surprised what people are capable of when shit hits the fan.
Not long before evening drinking.
Someone should be in.
Open up!
Police.
I can see you!
Idiot.
Sarge?
Stay there.
Make sure no one comes out.
"Reggie Barker, is it?"
"- Where are you going, mate?"
- I don't want no trouble.
- The Bentley boy's upstairs.
- David's here?
Yeah.
Stinking the place out with that bloody stuff.
"Is his old man here, as well?"
- He's CID.
- So?
So I don't want no part of this.
- Help me move him.
- Yeah.
"No, you don't."
'Cause I just made it up.
"Don't you want a warm, wet jimmy ha-ha?"
No.
You live there?
Cool.
I'm gonna live in an apartment.
"Next year, maybe."
"- Yeah, right."
- I am.
"My sister's gonna get a loft apartment, and she said I could live with her."
She won't even letyou sit in her car.
- Can we come in?
"- Yeah, can we come in?"
We'll be good.
"Go eat it outside, Robby."
Okay!
I just need to put on my jacket.
- Can we see your parents' room?
- My parents are separated.
My dad sleeps there.
"He'll be home, like, any second."
"We're each going to do it, and you have to tell us what the difference is."
"Like, how it feels different when she does it from when I do it."
Exactly.
"Thank you, Rebecca."
"You're welcome, Heather."
- But first we need a towel and-
- And a washcloth.
Right.
A wet washcloth and a dry washcloth.
Brought you something.
- Is it chocolate?
- No.
"Oh, wait... it is chocolate."
How's she doing?
"Couple more hours, and she should be out of the woods."
Mel...
I don't think you should come to Dallas.
I said I was scared.
I didn't say I didn't want to go.
"I know, but..."
You're getting cold feet.
- No my feet are fine...
- Liar.
I think you're going for the wrong reason.
Is this your thing?
Thrill of the chase and then lose interest?
I'm the bad boyfriend you want to make happy.
"- Peter, what the hell?"
- And you don't even know it.
- I'm going to Dallas.
- I don't think you should.
Tough!
"You made your bed, you're gonna sleep in it... with me."
I saw you kissing Jerry.
- That wasn't...
I wasn't kissing...
- Looked like you were.
He was kissing me.
- I actually came up here to see a patient.
- The jackass?
- Don't...
Ted Carter?
- No.
"- Don't you lie to me, don't lie!"
I'm not lying to you.
"Doc, help me."
I need your help.
"What do you mean by ""help""?"
I don't want to have the baby.
Give me something.
There's nothing I can give you.
Tell me who's responsible.
I can help you that way.
You can get married.
He's already married.
Then he'll have to take care of you and provide for the baby.
Who is it?
- Please just give me something!
- Selena!
"I've done a lot of things, but I've never broken a law."
What you're asking me to do is break the law of man and God.
"Now, tell me, who is the man?"
"Selena, tell me who he is."
Who is he?
It's my stepfather!
It's my stepfather!
It's Lucas!
"Hi, doc, come on in, have a drink."
I've got Selena in my office.
Selena?
What for?
She's pregnant.
I told her she'd get in trouble.
"- I have not been a good person, mama."
"I put everything in my life before you,"
"Before my daughter, before the man that i love..."
My husband.
"Yes, well, we can just put god's will back in our lives."
"I've lost everything, mama..."
Everything.
"But like saul, you can get it back."
"Mom, i just..."
I think it's too late.
- No.
"No, it's never too late."
"- Yes, i don't think..."
"- Yes, it is."
"- You'll see, regina."
It's never too late.
"- I'm right here, mama."
- Oh my god!
- See?
See?
- Oh my baby!
- Oh my baby.
"- I'm so sorry, mama."
"Oh marcus, look at our baby."
Look at you.
"Oh, sweetheart, will you ever forgive me?"
- Please?
"- No, mama, you were forgiven"
The minute i walked in the house.
It's me who you need to forgive
For doing all those things to you.
And then after that we can go swing and go to the park.
"- I'm sure you do, Mr. O'dwyer."
- It's not just a game.
Not to me.
- I can see that.
"- Where were you a week ago monday, sir?"
A week ago monday.
"That would be 4, 7, 23, 35, 44, 53."
- Excuse me?
- I was here.
Like always... watching a drawing.
Three prime numbers!
I did not see that one coming.
- Do own a pair of scissors Mr. O'dwyer?
- Of course I do.
Who doesn't?
"May I see them, please."
- How about some metallic paint?
- Paint?
"Yeah, a shade called titanium black."
Do you think I killed Melissa Kessler?
You do have her picture up all over the wall?
I've got everybody's picture up on the wall.
"I mean, these are the past lottery girls."
The jackpot winners.
People who work there.
"Secretaries, gaffers."
They all know me.
I'm a freelance journalist.
"I, publish a newsletter."
Lotto bulletin.
"Yeah, I've seen that."
What's this?
"I'll take you to a movie, ok?"
"Oh, I love you."
"I love you, rags."
"We'll have a good day, huh?"
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Mr. Dennings?
"Well, you know, it's ok."
"Well, thank you very much, but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?"
You like him.
"Yeah, I like him."
Don't you like him?
"Hey, what's going on?"
"What is this, huh?"
"You're going to marry him, aren't you?"
"Oh, God, are you kidding?"
Me marry Burke Dennings?
Don't be silly.
Of course not.
Where did you get that idea?
But you like him.
Of course.
"I like pizzas, too, but I'm not going to marry one."
You don't like him like daddy?
"Regan, I love your daddy."
"I'll always love your daddy, honey."
Burke just comes around here a lot because...
"Well, he's lonely."
Don't got nothin' to do.
"Well, I heard..."
Differently.
"Oh, you did?"
What did you hear?
-Come on!
-Let's go!
Bring Sandra back to her room first.
Why?
Is there a problem?
I'm pregnant.
I had my check up with Dr. Gamboa.
It's already 7 weeks old.
I'm having such a hard time.
Your husband will come back to you!
So stop crying now.
Stop crying.
"When his memory comes back, who else will he come home to?"
What if his memory doesn't come back?
"Whatever pain was caused by your relationship with Migs, it also has beautiful memories."
"And most of all, stop pleading or begging on that Bela."
Her conscience will haunt her more if you have no connection.
Do you still love Migs?
.
Yes.
I love Migs so much.
You have to wait for him to get better.
"Migs, stop it!"
Come on!
-Why?
I used to do that.
-No.
Oh!
"Wait, I forgot something."
-I'll come back.
-Okay then.
What?
Take care.
What?
"Come on, Allie, just step down."
- She's scared.
"- No, I'm not."
"You're not helping here, Zack."
- Zack wets his bed.
- I do not!
- His whole room smells yucky!
- Liar!
"Hey, hey!"
Since when do you go after her?
You're twice her age.
"- She's a liar, I hate her."
- He hit me.
You hit her?
- Don't ever hit her.
"- I didn't, I just swung my arm at her."
"What was the deal that we had, huh?"
I'm not through with you yet.
What was the deal we had?
"When I'm not around, you protect your little sister and your mother."
I can't stop any big guys.
"Don't worry about the big guys, I'll take care of them."
How?
You're never around.
"I don't care any more anyway, cos Mum said if you don't come back, she's gonna get me a new dad."
- Excuse me.
"- Can you ask someone else,"
- I'm on my way home.
"- I'm Beth Felton, I'm Beau's wife."
"Oh, well, I'm Megan, Lieutenant Megan Russert."
Stop calling here or I'm calling the police.
"Oh, my God."
Who was that?
No one.
Noannie.
"It's just some idiots calling saying stupid things, okay?"
Like what?
"Brian, it's stupid."
"Like what, Noannie?"
He says he hears I put out to white boys.
"He calls here again, you give the phone to me."
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Yeah.
"This is all my fault, isn't it?"
No.
"No, don't you ever say that."
"Noannie, look."
"Look, this has nothing to do with you."
Come here.
Come here.
"I know, I know, I slept with my paralyzed boyfriend's best friend."
It's the worst thing I've ever done.
It would be great if you said something.
"Sorry, I'm just thinking how hard that must have been for you to tell me."
And I'm really glad that you did.
I just want us to be honest with each other.
Do you still have feelings for him?
Nope.
No.
No.
Okay.
I could use good some employees.
They don't challenge you at all in this hotel.
How much?
"Three Euros an hour, plus tips."
"Three Euros, fixed?"
Fixed.
Welcome!
"Nora, you've made the right decision."
I hope that in the next few years...
"Viktor, that's enough."
... we'll lay the groundwork for a great program.
Here's to a fruitful cooperation.
- Harmann.
That's you.
"Yes, but please don't interrupt!"
There's more.
Can I choose now?
Pop culture.
It crashed.
"So tell me, I heard you were politically active?"
Do you still want to see the rest?
Yes.
That'll be a bit difficult  without hands.
I'm listening.

"- Yeah, I'm all right."
"Let yourself in, will you?"
What happened?
That crazy kid.
She locked me up with my own cuffs.
- Where's the keys?
- Over there.
Hi there.
Anybody hurt in this wreck?
I thought I told you to get plastic folders for this stuff.
Your scrapbook is like you.
- A mess.
"- Give me my pants, will you?"
Come on.
- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.
I also got two feds.
Mulderig and Klein.
What do we need those pricks for?
"Because our department's got about 908 bucks to make buys,... ..and they can get all they want from Uncle Sap."
Hello.
"These yours, darling?"
It's like renting' a video.
"Once you're finished with it, you just pop it back through the slot."
I've got a new baby lined up.
"Oh, aye?"
One of me own.
- You what?
- Yeah.
- You're not pregnant?
- Yeah.
- Aren't we?
- Mm.
Bloody hell.
Aren't you gonna congratulate us?
"Aye, yeah."
"I'll crack open a bottle of Ribena Toothkind, shall I?"
We're gonna envelope together.
How are you gonna support yourselves?
The money from two paper rounds don't go far.
- I wanna set up a nursery.
- No.
I were gonna call it...
Crash Bang Wallop.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
I need to be there.
"- Hiya, Moz."
"- All right, Alex?"
How you doing?
Just on me lunch break.
"Thought I'd pop in, get a little bit mashed."
"- You still teaching at secondary school, then?"
"- Yeah, for me sins."
Felix.
Wait a minute.
Dad... what is it?
"That sweater, Zoe."
Whose sweater is that?
It's my friend's.
He lent it to me.
"""He""?"
"Oh, no."
No.
Are you hanging out with boys?
"Zoe, I've had this talk with you before."
All boys are bad.
All of them.
"Yes, Dad, yes."
Seriously?
"I gotta go, okay?"
I love you.
"- I love you, too."
- I love you.
"Bye, bye-bye."
My dad always says never judge a book by its cover.
"Take Pin, for example."
"The guy looks like he swallowed a bag of lemons... but underneath it all, he's surprisingly..."
"Surprisingly likely to be a horse thief, after all."
Sedatives.
Pin... what have you done?
Go away
Stay out of our village you slut streetwalker
Go away
We don't want to live with you anymore
Go away
Miss Elizabeth Dollon.
Ah!
Let her in.
She comes from Switzerland.
"Sir, where is my brother?"
"Miss, I beg you, rest easy."
He was arrested but it probably was a mistake.
"I know, but it is terrible."
"You know, Miss, what would be truly terrible is that he was really guilty."
Why did you not free him?
He has therefore not been able to defend himself?
"On the contrary, Miss."
H defended himself.
And where is he now?
Can I see him?
Listen...
I would rather...
I mean...
I fear that seeing him
You're hiding something.
"I want to see him, you hear me?"
"He's dead, isn't he?"
"Alas, Mss."
"No, it is not possible."
This is not true.
He was killed?
"Listen, lead me to him."
You can not refuse me.
It's too horrible.
"I beg you, calm down."
I'll take you to your brother.
Your brother was innocent.
And you can count on him.
Have a wonderful trip.
"Enjoy the spring, and not least the Parisian gentlemen."
"OK, I'll try."
Ace!
(doorbell rings)
It's open!
- I'm just about to leave for Paris.
- I know.
Camilla told me.
- I'm here for the keys.
- Keys?
Of course.
I'm really confused.
- I'd better show you around.
- Yeah.
Didn't get much of a tour the last time.
"That's Camilla's shelf, that's yours."
"You can make up a different system if you want, you and..."
Camilla.
"Jesus, Johan!"
What are you doing here?
You never called.
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I lost your number.
"I tried to find it, but..."
I don't know what annoyed me most.
Him appearing from nowhere.
Again.
Or him sharing my flat with Camilla.
(traffic noises from outside)
(heavy breathing)
I was taking that kid!
I should have gone tonight!
I should have been with you!
"It's all right, Julie!"
It's all right!
Julie!
!
I can't fight no more!
I can't fight no more!
"I know, Bill!"
But you won't have to!
I can't fight no more!
"You won't have to fight no more, Bill!"
"I'll make it up to you, darling!"
We'll get that cigar stand you were telling me about!
!
or maybe even a piece of that fighter!
"It's going to be all right, Bill!"
You wait and see!
Julie!
I won tonight!
- I won!
"- Yes, you won tonight, Bill!"
We both won tonight!
We both won tonight!
[ENGLISH]
"Yes, this is my town."
It's not new to you.
"You've read books about it, you've seen movies."
People are always talking about New York.
"It's the most exciting city in the world, they say, the most glamorous, the most frightening, and above all, the fastest."
How old is he?
I'd say about your age.
My age?
Sit down.
But you don't understand...
Sit down!
I'm telling you all this in confidence.
He's the only hope we have of catching the killer.
The man we're after is after Hoolick.
He's after Hoolick.
"When he strikes, we'll catch him."
But we need someone to keep an eye on Wilbur every minute.
Do you mind if I tell my girl about this?
You're to tell no one.
Wilbur's life is at stake.
It's more at stake than you think.
I knew we could count on you.
We'll keep in touch with you.
Good day.
Good day.
My age?
"Hello, Mr. Miles."
Not now!
(WILBUR WHISTLING)
Wilbur?
"Oh, hello, Uncle Bob."
Did you see those men?
I saw them.
Wilbur.
What?
"When you were on the train, did you spend the whole night in Nancy's drawing room?"
Aunt Nancy's drawing room.
"Yet, you guys are going to ship him off to a group home?"
Am I the only one who gets how much that sucks?
It's okay.
Really.
Good luck with it.
It looks perfect.
Good night.
Good night.
Got a little...
Playstation.
Perhaps... are you running away?
"Go back in the house, Seth."
"Hey, hey, hey."
You can't just run away.
What are you thinking?
"What about, like, Child Services, or my dad?"
"Okay, then, wait."
"Hey, I want to come with you."
"You know what I've always wanted to do, besides sail to Tahiti."
I want to do that whole Kerouac thing...
"Hit the road, stop at diner to diner, the pancake tour of North America."
No.
Fair enough.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
"New town, get a job somewhere, save some money."
Great plan.
Sounds like you've given it a lot of thought.
You got a better idea?
"Actually, I do."
Seth...
Hey... can I talk to you?
Thanks.
You and Amanda should take a walk around the marina.
Sunsets are really pretty.
Maybe we will.
Dead man walking.
Hi.
Hello.
Can I come in?
There's a front door.
I wanted to see you.
This is quicker.
What happened?
"Oh, I"
- I slipped and hit my shoulder.
Jumping off another roof?
"Kyle, I've learned my lesson."
And I'm here to learn another one.
"You said I have to work my way up to do things like levitate, so start teaching me."
I can't.
There's nobody around.
I have plans tonight with Amanda.
"Oh, Amanda."
She's home?
As a surprise.
You're anxious about it.
"Your heart's beating really fast, I can tell."
"She told me, ""We need to talk. """
So?
You don't think that means anything?
Uh... it means she wants to talk to you?
Isn't that a good thing?
That's what I thought.
Forbidden!
Officer!
This wheel didn't understand ifs forbidden area!
"It's rolling, rolling, rolling up to there."
Itjust happened.
"It's rolling, rolling, rolling up to there."
Itjust happened.
Now you come down and give it to me!
I can't come down!
It's forbidden!
Go.
So I am coming in by myself to pick it up then I will go!
Are you going to come in?
!
It is forbidden.
No way!
Go.
Go.
So I would bowstring to get it.
"It's not forbidden for this rope, is it?"
Where are you from?
Bushehr_
- Where are you going to go?
- Tan
- Where are you going to go?
- Tan
Tangak!
- Where are you going?
- I am just gonna get some water.
It's out of water then
That's it.
There is no water inside it.
No.
But I bet you do.
Mm-hmm.
"I bet you have a big, thick pair of bifocals."
"She doesn't have daddy issues, she has granddaddy issues."
I'm ending it.
"Ted, I beg of you, don't quit on a body that won't quit."
"Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet on a bumper sticker."
That's going in the journal.
"Wait, did you steal my dream journal?"
No!
"Now, get back in there before all your teeth fall out and you're naked in front of Shaker Heights High School in a play you never rehearsed for."
Bastard!
We don't connect on a single thing.
It's over.
It's not...
"Look, Carly, I got to tell you something."
"I just, I don't see a future here."
"Oh, my God."
Are you dying?
"Oh, that is so hot."
Hey... is that R2-D2?
Do you like Star Wars?
I love Star Wars.
"Me, too!"
♪
"I mean, I've only seen the new ones."
Close enough.
So?
Yeah.
I knew it!
I could feel it.
"Oh, jeez, we gotta find out who she is."
"If this guy's feeling cornered, all bets are off."
Tonight's his last chance to get revenge on anyone who's ever wronged him.
She's most likely his next target.
[Dialing]
"Garcia, we're gonna send you some photographs."
- What do you want me to do with them?
- Blow up the background.
See if you can find anything that tells us who this girl is.
I'll hit you back.
[Man] Uh-uh.
We're closed.
"No, you're not."
Not to me.
"Boy, what's wrong with you?"
Get out.
Not tonight.
Where is she?
Where's Tracy?
"Kaman, I said... get out."
Can't.
I can't do that tonight.
They coming after me.
What have you done?
I just need to see her.
"I told you, don't come back in here."
It's over.
"Son, you need to get some help."
"Don't you do it, old man!"
Aah!
- [Blows landing] - [Crying out]
[Groaning]
"I do know that often, when Stan and I are together, this happens."
And you believe?
"It happens, Mr. Gordon."
"When I was a kid, a tenement on our block collapsed."
Buried some people alive.
"From then on, every time I passed that spot,"
I believed I could always hear them moaning and crying for help.
You through there?
Get started upstairs.
"Why don't you go to bed, Stan?"
Why should I?
Because you make me sick to my stomach.
Douglas...
"All right, Stan."
"You've had enough, let's go."
Mr. Gordon will excuse you.
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Do you think I had too much to drink?
"Whoa, wait."
Wait a minute.
Wait.
"Good night, my dear."
Mr. Gordon.
"Let's go, Dougie."
Come on.
Here we go.
I want to show you that I can be neighbourly too.
Lynn?
"Well, he's in bed."
Probably dead to the world by now.
"Thank you, Doug."
This is not funny...
Multala!
Viljanen will be your backup until Toropainen recovers from his cold.
Alarm!
Alarm!
Daycare center.
Breathe the light summer air.
Feel it caress each molecule in your body.
Repeat in your mind:
I can do it.
I can do it.
I can do it.
Good.
"Come out, Viljanen."
There are gas bottles in the basement.
We need more units!
There are burning chemicals here.
Did you inhale smoke?
This can't be true!
Jesse Viljanen!
Marjukka!
What are you doing here?
Viljanen!
There are children inside.
I'll take care of it with Multala!
Let's go.
"Take some oxygen, firefighter."
You became a firefighter then.
Wait!
I'll take a blood test.
I became a nurse.
"We were pretty wild back then, right?"
Priya!

"Priya, are you there?"
"Hey, leave her!"
Priya...

Please let her go!

"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"

"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
Leave.
Leave that.
Do you love her very much?
It is said 'Love is blind.'
"She looted us all, taking advantage of that."
Don't get fooled by such women.
Tie it properly...
What are you doing?
"By deceiving visually challenged people with love,"
I'm here for a few days.
- My cell number's on there.
- Of course.
"Were you and your aunt, uh, close?"
For most of my life she was a birthday card with a $5 bill in it.
But she never missed a birthday.
I understand.
How about you?
How well did you know my aunt?
My great-aunt.
Oh.
She came in once a year.
- Like Santa Claus.
- Heh.
She was very sweet.
"When I called, they told me that you had spoken to her just before she died."
I'd like to know what you thought of her.
- I don't know what I could tell you.
- We could talk about it over drinks.
Uh...
I don't know.
Heh.
Consider it.
You've got the number.
I will get these to the Revenue office.
Thank you.
I didn't know my dad was coming.
He wanted to know how somebody could beat me.
If I slacked off.
I didn't.
You know I didn't.
I told him we tied but you got the slot.
Fat Pig swallowed my 'Beast'!
Fat Pig again?
Why would the Emperor find this so important?
I'd better cable Tokyo tomorrow.
And have somebody come pick this up.
Usually the safest place is the most dangerous.
"And the most dangerous place, the safest!"
Who's that?
Did you see someone go past?
Who was it?
- Where is her?
- Chase... I've forgotten you're dumb!
Use your imagination...!
Charade?
Great!
3 words!
The first word...!
An old woman?
A bitch?
Gallstone?
Boobs?
No boobs?
A woman?
Can't be that simple.
"Since you're so smart, clean up the toilet tomorrow then."
The second word...!
A stripteaser?
A female hen?
Get off.
You thief!
A woman thief?
This house will be put under strict security.
"And, you know, I didn't - we didn't have our parents already."
"So, it meant my being alone."
"And if my sister wanted to go out, she went... and I was left alone... at home."
"You know, it was a - It wasn't a good situation."
- When did Max die?
- Nine days ago.
- Pardon?
- Nine days ago.
What was wrong with him?
"He fell, and we don't know what's wrong with him, what happened yet."
- But he died.
- Yes.
My best friend.
[Woman] Claire?
- Are you leaving?
- Okay.
The nurse is here.
L-l-I just want her to have a look at you.
"She's just, um -"
- She's not doing very well.
- Do you have any pain?
- Pardon?
- Do you have any pain?
"What do you mean, ""Do I have anything?"""
Pain.
Do you have any pain?
Pain?
[Chuckles]
"Yes, I have pain from what I heard... about Max."
- Do you have headache or something?
- Max
"- Max is gone, is he?"
Let me think about it.
don't you?
Frabjous Day.
How could I forget?
Wish I'd wake up.
do you?
N-Of course.
This has all come from my own mind.
Which would mean that I'm not real.
Afraid so.NYou're just a figment of my imagination.
I would dream up someoneNwho's half-mad.
yes.
But you would have to beNhalf-mad to dream me up.
(LAUGHS ) then.
I'll miss you when I wake up.

You have very poor evaporating skills.Nl should be the one.

Who is Henry?

- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Henry and I are going to do with Akan.
- Henry?
Who is Henry?
- Did you see what happened upstairs?
- Did you see what you did?
- We'll go with you to destroy them!
- That fag white hair is dead.
You wanna go on a bike?
You can go on a bike.
Just...
You wanna go?
"- Okay, go on your bike, yeah, yeah, go on your bike."
"- Okay, well, you don't know."
Obviously you're not fans.
You're heating on me 'cause I'm supposedly not a fan.
"Not happening, chicken banger."
"Okay, I'm just going for the book, so."
"Yeah, around here, after 7:30, it's Alice in Chains or nothin'."
"Oh, now, now."
"What's your name, bud?"
"Hey, I'm Blake."
"I'm a hard rocker too, so I get it."
"And I'm married, butt pirate."
Hey.
"Hang on, buddy."
"We're all friends, here."
No need for the name calling.
"- Fuck off, Eddie Bauer!"
- You know what?
- Whoa.
- I've got this.
You can't talk to my friends that way.
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.
I bet I can pour this beer on your head...
Like that.
Oh!
"Hey, come on, that's a..."
That's a perfectly good Molson.
"Hey, shit-head!"
"Try that again, and this is gonna happen to your dick."
"Yeah, that's right."
That's your ding-dong in two pieces!
"Oh, I want you to hit me so bad right now!"
"Oh, no, don't."
I'm coming.
Seth Cohen says happy birthday.
Who?
She says thanks.
"Uh, look, I got to go."
Bye.
I got to go meet my friends.
My... other... friends.
"I should get back, too, and protect my cover."
"But wait, listen."
"We have to promise not to tell anyone about this place, okay?"
"Now, Ryan's not going to obviously, and I could get grounded, so that leaves Marissa."
I can keep a secret.
See you tomorrow.
"Me, too."
We'll fix this place up.
Cool.
"I'm telling you, Ryan, this plan is foolproof."
"Hey, Ryan!"
"Hey, Ryan, you ready?"
"Okay, the key here is not to panic."
Do you have your supplies?
"Yeah, but there are cops at your house."
"I mean, do you think it's safe?"
I'll handle Johnny Law unless...are you losing your nerve?
Meet me in the driveway.
He couldn't have gotten far.
We'll search the neighborhood.
Seth.
I was going to get you.
We got to talk about Ryan.
- [Doorbell Buzzing]
[Sighs] I'll be right there!
Who is it?
[Danny] Miss Elliot?
Yes?
Miss Karla Elliot?
Yes.
We're having wiring problems in the building.
Do you mind if I come in and check your baseboard outlets?
Are you kidding?
"7:30 at night, and you're gonna take outlet inventory?"
"Oh, well, if you're eating, I..."
I could come back later.
It won't take but a few minutes...
"No, if you're gonna crawl around the floor and count little holes in the wall, come on in and get it over with."
Come on.
Okay.
Who was that?
[Chuckles] I don't know.
He'll be gone in a minute.

And help all the others.
Do you promise to come to my birthday?
I swear.
And I'll be calling you every other day.
Okay?
"And that's not going to be a lot of times, because I'll be home in 8 days."
Perhaps you can take me there one day.
Perhaps.
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

Werewolves.
Come with me.

Who knows what that involves?
"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Henry."
You... little... pussy.
"Gentlemen, please go check that shit out."

My ego wants to kill you but higher-self doesn't.
"Jesus, baby."
She was talking to the man.
Shit.
Look at this.
Dude's got memory lock on.
"Well, that's all I can do for you, mate."
Time for a reboot.
"See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully."
Hey.
He's awake.
You might see a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrated, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
Alright.
Now.
Can you focus only over here?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Burying you is like burying treasure.
I really don't understand what Akan's think because...
"Henry, stop kicking around."
"You're almost there, mate."
Here's where you gotta get to.
....
We're moving to a new home.
Why?
I thought you loved to live by the sea.
I do.
Beautiful sea breezes.
I can imagine the view ofthe clear blue sky... and the deep blue sea.
Great!
Packyour things and wait for me.
I'll be here.
Why didn't you leave Hong Kong immediately?
What stopped you?
- Are you the new janitor?
- Yes.
You're doing a lousy job.
This is a fire escape.
"Look, there's garbage everywhere."
What if there's a fire?
I can't fy away like a phoenix.
I pay my monthly maintenance fee.
"If I find you goofing offagain, I'll file a complaint."
Don't leave any garbage here.
Move it all away.
Shit!
"Jeffrey, you're back."
"Yes,Jenny."
Are you with a friend?
"Yes, he's my old football buddy."
We grew up in the same squatter area.
Yes.
He's...
"I'm Dumbo, he's Mickey Mouse."
That's what you called each other?
I swear I didn't do it.
Who did this?
Brother...
Brother...
Brother...
Konda Reddy somehow knew about our people trying to escape.
They are taking away small children.
I tried to save a few.
But they found them.
Let the attrocities end with me.
You must save our men.
Let me be the last man to die.
Leave no one.
- Father...
- Kill me.
You bastard!
You came looking for your father.
Kill me now.
How dare you kill my man Cuddappah Raja?
Now kill me.
"You said he'll come as your saviour, right?"
I will kill him infront of your eyes.
and put his dead body under Gocha's feet.
"Velu, don't worry about me."
We must save these people.
Kill him.
Kill him.
He is my son Velu.
Vetri Velu.
"Konda Reddy, you think you can kill me?"
My son will surely send you to hell.
"If you are a real man, fight with him."
Previously on Fringe:
- There is more than one of everything.
OLIVIA:
Who the hell is this guy?
BROYLES:
We've recorded him at over three dozen scenes all of which relate to the Pattern.
- Why?
What is he doing?
BROYLES:
Watching.
Observing.
- We refer to him as the Observer.
WALTER:
"We were dead, Peter."
Until someone grabbed me.
"We were saved, both of us, by a man that I had never met."
- You talked to him?
WALTER:
He wouldn't be any use.
He just observes.
I have said too much.
I am not supposed to get involved.
MAN:
Nice specs.
I've never seen anything like them before.
They're from somewhere far away.
I don't have any money.
"Oh, that's okay."
I'm gonna give you one of these anyway.
There.
"Oh, that's great."
Thank you.
So far you haven't shown me a thing.
"You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right into next week."
- Knock it off.
- Don't tell me to knock it off.
"Cut it out, will ya, for Christ's sakes!"
There's nothin' goin' down.
Get some sleep.
Blastoff. 180.
200.
Good Housekeeping seal of approval.
210.
US government certified.

Lunar trajectory.
Junk-of-the-month club.
Sirloin steak.

Grade-A poison.
Absolute dynamite.
89 per cent pure junk.
Best I've ever seen.
"Ifthe rest is like this, you'll be dealin' on this load for two years."
- It's worth the half million?
- How many kilos?
- 60.
- 60 kilos...
"Eight big ones a kilo, right?"
This stuffll take a seven-to-one hit on the street.
"By the time it gets down to nickel bags, it'll be 32 million."
"Thank you, Howard."
Take what's left there with you and good night.
Uh-uh.
So she is in town to kill someone.
And this is the site of her hit.
Hey.
Hey.
"I'm--look, I'm sorry."
I...
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm just...
"I got a lot of stuff to do, you know?"
Can I take a rain check?
Sure.
Catch up with you later?
"Yeah, absolutely."
Okay.
Bye.
Are we way off base here?
Maybe we're chasing after something that doesn't even exist.
Has anyone ever told you to stick to your first instinct?
I've heard it once or twice.
I'm sure you have.
I want 'em at least another 15 feet back from the stage.
"Officer, hi."
What's going on here?
Setting up for tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Big human rights celebration.
Joseph Dellaman's giving a speech.
The ex-political prisoner?
The rally's here.
He's giving his speech in the square.
About what?
Maybe we should take him to see a shrink.
"Look, honey."
"If we can just be patient,"
I think we can handle this.
We both love Mikey; right?
We're the ones that are gonna help him out.
Mom.
Mom!
( Gasping ) Mikey.
I was looking for you.
- What are you doing?
- I have something for you.
"Mikey, you have to learn to knock."
They're for being such a great mom.
Why don't you take the flowers downstairs and put them in some water while I get out; okay?
Mom.
Hmm?
"Mom, what if I..."
I'm getting cold.
"If I threw this in the bathtub, it would work just like an electric chair."
You're right.
Be a good boy and unplug it.
( Gunfire on TV )
This is so cool when they blast their way out.
- How do you know?
- I've seen it three times.
"Hi, guys."
How many dead?
"I know how much you miss your cat, so I got you a new one."
"Oh, thank you, Mick."
( Doorbell Ringing )
"Yes, my lord."
She is quite important to me.
Too important.
- Master...
- Silence.
I can sense her powers growing stronger.
I would hate to think you are training your own sith... apprentice to destroy me.
Never.
My allegiance is to you and you alone.
Then you must prove it.
Eliminate her.
She's my most trusted...
I said eliminate her!
"As you wish, my lord."
Ventress.
Split up.
Looks like I'm her favorite.
I'm kind of disappointed.
Only the droids follow me.
You want to race?
Come on.
I'm going to need some help.
Where are you?
I'm hit!
I'm heading toward the separatist flagship.
I see you.
I've got her.
"Master, I need your help quickly."
I'm surrounded.
"You have already lost the battle, child."
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.
No.
Pardon?
Pate maison?
Yes.
Your lunch date.
"It was with a girl, wasn't it?"
"As a matter of fact, yes, it was."
Des ecrevisses?
Oui.
Now I'm going to spoil your fun.
How dreadful of me.
"Don't tease the animals, Mrs. Brown."
You might get bitten.
Du saumon?
Oui.
"My, we're in a bad mood."
Excellent.
"Et vous aussi, monsieur?"
"Nothing for me, thanks."
Tres bien.
Merci.
Why were you and John glaring at each other when I came in?
I told him our product was 20 years out of style.
A lot of people still buy it.
Three times as many would buy furniture like this.
What's that?
Sketches of a new line of modern furniture that we're not bringing out.
May I look?
You can have them.
Are these your own ideas?
"Well, some of them."
I had a designer working on it.
"Oh, I think they're awfully good."
Xiaotian has back.
Aku want to be with him tonight.
Can we watch movie tomorrow night?
I don't have time for tomorrow!
"- Then, the day after tomorrow."
- No time either.
Xiamu.
"Xiamu, it's a gift for you!"
Please take it!
"Xiamu, she has been fall in love with you for a long time!"
Consider I have taken it.
Sorry!
Is this the place?
It can't be wrong.
Why did Zhang Jingyu tell us to go for this place?
This place is not bad!
I'm scared!
Let's just go home!
It's okay!
I'm here with you.
What is going on?
Yawang!
Let go of her!
What is happening?
Run faster!
"Uncle Tang, don't beat Xiaotian anymore!"
- Stop it already!
- Get up!
Go to sport field and run 10 kilometers!
You deserve it!
"Girl who not go home in the midnight, is a bad girl."
"Xiaotian, the time has passed."
No le dejen mover.
Take off your clothes.
She's clean.
"Viktor Karp, I'm Regan."
Agent Regan of Homeland Security.
ETU.
I'm out.
That's why I'm here.
What happened here?
I had a baby.
The humans took it.
Why you want to see Liana?
I'm her daughter.
Liana doesn't have a daughter.
You're at home.
So I see.
I had you brought here.
We needed you someplace private in case you said something you shouldn't.
"Flynn, you got a drug problem."
No.
- No.
I got an alien problem.
"- Well, you need to deal with it before I let you back on the team."
Team?
Right.
"'Cause we're all just team players, aren't we, Truss?"
You're using me.
You're using Regan.
God knows what you got on Briggs.
You are privy to information that is beyond classified.
"And if I don't come back and play, you're gonna contain me?"
If I have to.
Better than you posing as a Japanese!
"Damn Robin, I quit."
Gosh...
Something terribly important is missing.
What did you lose?
I lost a toothbrush!
I'm not kidding. it's an heirloom.
Passed on through the generations.
For good fortune. lt's very important.
I'm afraid I'll have to search you all.
"Right, stealing right under the Commissioner."
And Inspector Robin's nose.
It's really too much!
"I agree to a search, I'll go first."
"Yes, I approve of a search!"
No need for you.
"Dumplings, you do it!"
"Oh yes please, come!"
Not him. I meant her.
- Inspector Robin!
- Sir!
You're responsible for security tonight.
"If you don't find the toothbrush, I'll have your head!"
Yes.
- Fools!
- Yes sir!
Get away.
Salute!
- Body search!
- Yes sir!
Hurry up!
"If we can't find it, I'm done."
- For a job.
- You don't have a job?
- Did you see the pretty fish over there?
- Did you lose your job?
My daddy lost his job.
- Did you get a new job?
"- Yes, giving big shots to little girls."
- Mommy!
- Big shots.
There you go.
- Mrs. Riblet.
Weak and dizzy all over.
- Be still my heart.
- Smell something?
- Yeah.
"Ma'am, smoking is not permitted in the hospital."
This is my glaucoma medicine.
My grandson grows it.
"Oh, no, thanks."
Put that there.
"Why don't we put these away, so that we don't get busted?"
- Smells like primo stuff.
- Yeah?
"God, I miss the '60s."
- New computer?
- Yeah.
CD-ROM.
I'm connecting us up by modem to Mount Sinai.
Pooling our resources.
A couple more things.
Dr. Benton goes nuts if you're late or don't answer a page on the first beep.
He has a bad temper.
It's empty.
Just one bullet.
Hey!
Stop.
Ram.
Gopal.
What's his name?
Verma.
Stop.
Stop.
What are you?
What if he had fired?
If he had fired Bittoo would be dead... and Verma's son would've been hanged.
The same thing... will imply on Boss and Shiv.
I didn't get it.
Boss will kill Shiv... and he'll be foreshadowing crime.
But the Boss workforces.
I don't trust my father.
It's an old rule.
First clear the garbage then clearly record.
Hi Ankita.
Hi.
Why did you come out?
From today your outgoing...
Yeah hello.
And your phone's incoming is barred.
Go lock yourself in the room.
There are 200 channels on Tata Sky.
Sit at home and watch television.
I'll call you when it's time for the engagement... and nuptial ceremonies.
Don't come out until I don't call you.
Go.
I'll say.
Ka-chow.
You're gonna fit right in in California.
My goodness.
It looks like you've helped everybody in town.
"Yeah, everybody except one."
"- Hey, is it getting dark out?"
- What?
What'd he say?
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?
"Now, what was I supposed to do after that?"
They fixed their neon!
- Low and slow?
"- Oh, yeah, baby!"
"Just like in its heyday, right?"
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.
Shall we cruise?
"Oh, thank you, dear."
I'd love to!
"- No, no, no."
- Lizzie!
I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him.
"Hey, Miss Sally."
May I have this cruise?
"- Of course, Mater."
- Uh-uh-uh!
"...and again and I said, ""No. "" He asked me again, and I said, ""No. """
"But, oh, he was a persistent little bugger for a two-cylinder."
"Finally I said, ""All right, one little drive. """
Oh!
"And it's left-hand drive, so you're a cheapskate."
It's true!
It's never overtaken anyone.
That's what passengers are for.
His dog ate it.
She did.
A couple more I have to stick up -
"Mitsubishi Evo VIII, we looked at."
Where's it go?
AUDIENCE:
Sub-cool?
Wrong!
Why is it sub-cool?
It's a proper car.
It's fast and it handles well.
That's nothing to do with coolness.
It's like having ginger hair.
Anyone else got any thoughts on it?
MAN:
Uncool.
Uncool.
"He says it's uncool, he's kind of right."
"The thing is, it's very gender-specific."
"If you're a man, it's really uncool."
"If you're a woman, it's fantastic."
We wanna meet you.
"So it kind of goes there, as does...the same story with the Subaru."
Yeah.
Put that there.
Right in the middle with the F60.
"It's funny, it's the way of the cool wall."
"I've got one last one here, the Peugeot 206 GTI 180bhp."
"It-it's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that, but I..."
I wanted...
"the opportunity to show him that I could be there for him, you know?"
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
This is what...
"recovery is all about -- you know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
"Uh, recovering drunk."
"Wife, sister, mother."
"Two kids -- boy, 10, girl, 8."
Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
Assembly line -- boring.
Come on.
I told you.
Went on and on and on.
"Well, okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high-security."
'Cause you mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
Hi.
"Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.
- I didn't want to go home.
In a little less than 14 minutes.
"When I was your age, I used to love school."
I remember once we had to do this time capsule...
"You know, fill it with important things"
And bury it in the backyard
So we could dig it up when we were grown.
Really?
And... and did you?
Did you dig it up?
Oh.
Moved before I could.
What a shame.
"You know, I think of it every day of my life."
You have?
"Oh, my god."
That's so many days!
"So if you look at number five in your handout,"
"Using the chunking strategy, what is the answer?"
74.
112.
Excellent...
Mostly everybody.
Here.
Let me show you.
You're thinking addition.
You need to...
I don't need your help.
I can do it myself.
"Nice job, mr."
Heck.
You get it.
"Well, now that you explained it, it's comin' pretty easy."
I thought you loved to live by the sea.
I do.
Beautiful sea breezes.
I can imagine the view ofthe clear blue sky... and the deep blue sea.
Great!
Packyour things and wait for me.
I'll be here.
Why didn't you leave Hong Kong immediately?
What stopped you?
- Are you the newjanitor?
- Yes.
You're doing a lousyjob.
This is a fire escape.
"Look, there's garbage everywhere."
What ifthere's a fire?
I can't fy away like a phoenix.
I pay my monthly maintenance fee.
"If I find you goofing offagain, I'll file a complaint."
Don't leave any garbage here.
Move it all away.
Shit!
"Jeffrey, you're back."
"Yes,Jenny."
Are you with a friend?
"Yes, he's my old football buddy."
We grew up in the same squatter area.
Yes.
He's...
"I'm Dumbo, he's Mickey Mouse."
That's what you called each other?
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling isn't mutual.
- We have our own bikes.
Fucking hell.
"Sometimes it is easy just to say ""yes""."
"Henry, catch it!"
"Oh, God."
I thought I'd lost forever Henry.
I was so scared.
I was so scared and you fell.
I thought I'd never see you again.
"I love you, Henry."
I love you.
How sweet.
If I took this moment and put it in a cup of tea.
I wouldn't need sugar.
"Yuri, please."
We can go now.
"Every year, 100000 baseball bats are sold in Russia."
"And at most, 50 baseballs."
Gives an idea of a great Russians pastime?
"This is a rare, survived bat."
Estelle.
"Would you, please, be so kind and stand up?"
No.
Or you wanna take her place?
"Estelle, your boy is quite a knight."
Sacrificing himself to keeping you alive.
Only for my dick... to kill you later.
"Are you sure, Henry?"
Are you sure?
"- I didn't hear a ""no""."
- Brilliant!
"Come over here, Henry."
Tell him I'll pick him up at 7.
Tell Nathan to come see me.
I'll do what I can.
Peyton?
Peyton!
- Where's Peyton?
- Dressing for school is my guess.
Who are you?
I'm the guy who's about to take that rake from you and beat your scrawny ass.
I'm her dad.
Who are you?
Oh.
Sorry.
The front door was open and I thought...
I'm Lucas.
Larry Sawyer.
"Hey dad, do you know where my..."
What are you doing here?
Oh he's trying to rake me to death.
What?
!
I thought you were... nothing crucial.
I'm gonna go put this back.
"- So, who's the guy?"
- What guy?
The one that's got you smiling.
That'd be my dad.
"Oh, I'd be smiling too but for entirely different reasons."
"Dude, that's my dad!"
Don't go all horndog on me.
There's a line!
"Speaking of which, I really don't wanna cross any so tell me if this is totally inappropriate to ask."
"I mean, you call these problems?"
"""Oh, it's horrible."
"Someone wrote in the sky for me. """
I'd kill to find a little note in my diaphragm case.
Oh...
But that's just me.
Then maybe he should be with you.
"No, Joanne."
"Joanne, wait."
Wait.
This is the best party ever.
- Nice speech.
- It was horrible.
I thought it was great.
"Oh, happy people complaining."
"No, they deserve to be yelled at."
I'm Richie.
Lina.
"No, I know."
Um
"- You sat in front of me in Ms. Klinger's class, but then in fourth grade you were gone."
We transferred to private school.
After Kat was expelled for telling Mr. Dubin he looked like a penis.
"He did, he kinda looked like a penis."
"Yeah, and the turtlenecks didn't help."
I like your hat.
Are-are you making fun of me?
'Cause I don't think I could handle-
"No, I like it."
"It's, um... jaunty."
Hey.
"Couldn't have looked like crap just a little, huh?"
Theta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things.
One of which is pain.
"The fact that he's no longer screaming makes us feel better, not necessarily him."
Chase!
How's cameron?
She's not giddy.
Fever's down.
White count's improving.
Has she said anything to you?
"You mean like,""I completely understand why foreman did what he did, and I hold no grudge?"""
What I did... did save my life.
Get in here and help!
Forget the suit!
He's tachycardic!
Wide-complex looks like v-tach!
It's not cryptococcus!
What?
- House was wrong.
The samples were negative.
So what is it?
We don't know!
- Give him in the amio.
Do we have any more leads?
That was our lead!
Foreman!
So the treatment isn't doing anything.
Foreman!
He's in v-fib!
No good.
Hit him again.
"Come on, man."
"Come on, joe."
like your girlfriend claimed.
He didn't?
He was murdered.
Skinned.
It was never solved.
The colleaguesthink that it was a kind of
"Personal vengeance, because the murderer or murderess took several days to skin him."
"Now guess who left New York a day after the murder, even days before the press found out."
She lied to you.
Probably from the beginning.
She played with you like a cat with a mouse.
She screwed you and whoever worked with her.
Where is she?
Where is she?
- Who?
No.
No...
Where is she?
Wait!
Where is she?
- No.
"Please, don't."
No.
This won't get you anywhere!
I'm meaningless.
You didn't accomplish anything.
[Sighs]
What?
[Ding]
Morning.
Did a package arrive from booth Allen in Chicago?
- Adam.
"No, dude, that is Adam."
"Dude, that is Pete."
Can you give us a sec?
"Live it up, football jocks!"
- It's all downhill from here.
- Oh!
It's going down!
I just heard!
"Here, tonight!"
It's going down!
Nice dress.
Did your mom make it?
"Listen to me, damn it!"
"I didn't see them, but I heard their plan."
"""At 11:00 sharp, we shank the dork."""
"Ellie, some poor kid's getting pantsed!"
"No, this can't be happening."
Not now!
Not again!
"Boo, you got your crazy face on."
A-are you all right?
[ Sighs deeply ] 1987.
Senior prom.
I was so excited.
"I had a cool tux, a hot date, and a plan to help my best pal Bucky Martin score a dance with the girl of his dreams."
Bucky Martin?
Sounds like a stud.
- He actually wasn't.
- Stop it.
"But I knew he could be, if he-- if he just believed."
"And then when I saw Cindy Lee standing alone at the punch bowl,"
Yes.
- Stand up.
Do you prefer?
"- No, you're fine."
""" Marjorie and Jo-Jo love romantic evenings... and romance in New York City always starts on Broadway."""
""" Marjorie and Jo-Jo love romantic evenings."""
Sorry.
"""They enjoy fine restaurants."""
I've been searching for a fabric the color of this bay...  for some time now.
I'm serious.
I love this color...
dirty green.
You're putting me on.
Wow!
Your eyes are the color of this bay!
"Man, you're weird."
They are!
Look at me.
Look at me.
Let me check.
Incredible.
Exactly the same color.
You're the first person that says they're green.
But they are...
dirty green.
"I think so too, but everyone else thinks they're brown."
No.
That guy who works with your father...
- Which one?
- The one from Niteroi.
Roberto.
"He's not gay, is he?"
- Look.
Good Sir Knight.
Good Sir Knight.
We're so grateful to you for rescuing us from those foul fiends.
Upsy-daisy.
"Very gracious of you, Sir Knight."
"We're very undeserving, really."
We're just humble fisher folk.
"However, we do have this maiden daughter."
As there is this custom the knight quite often marries the maiden he's rescued.
"Say hello to the knight, Griselda honey."
It was me that rescued you.
Will you clear off?
"What do you say, Sir Knight?"
Good Sir Knight.
- Well?
- Hark.
Be gone.
- Wait!
- Come back here!
"Sir Knight, come back, please!"
Griselda.
Mr. Fishfinger.
I've got to go.
Sorry about your hand.
It hurts!
I've missed you.
I've kept your potato.
Bye!
You really are a big disappointment to me.
I thought you were gonna make something of yourself.
He is the king's champion!
"And ""druid's noch""?"
A period landmark.
The location of the astronomicon.
"I'll call karen,"
Then we'll be off.
After we find andreas.
You mean rescue him from the gural nataz?
(karen:) hello?
Huh?
"Karen, nigel."
"Yeah, I need you to look up a site."
It's called the druid's noch.
Circa 70 a.D.
This all seems so strange:
You helping to rescue my son.
"Yeah, well don't read"
"Too much into it, da veiga."
It's you he needs saving from.
"Thanks, karen."
"Okay, she's on it."
I have to go.
"Here, take this with you."
"Sydney, we may need that."
We don't have that luxury.
He could trade it for andreas.
"Because that's what you do, isn't it?"
"Trade, steal..."
"When I show this to the gural nataz,"
They will decipher the code
"Just as you have done,"
And then they will send out more agents.
You have to find the astronomicons
You're my partners.
You're holding so many options on land you could buy Brooklyn.
You could probably buy Staten Island too.
"Would you excuse us, please?"
Of course.
I got an appointment anyway.
Good.
Then it works out nicely.
You sure BankExchange is all set?
We got everything we wanted.
Now you can get something else for me.
- What's that?
- My name out of the papers.
How?
"With $40,000."
"What am I going to do with $40,000?"
Let me ask you a question.
"You ever heard of a cop with $40,000?"
Who wasn't crooked?
"A cop with $40,000 would make big headlines."
Say hello to Nettie for me.
I will.
- Take care.
- All right.
That's for the dead cop.
Reverend Chapman will introduce me?
With one sentence.
And then what?
Get out of here.
- And which way is that?
- Side door.
No.
"Find it, or in five days,"
Serena Price drowns in Black Pine Cove.
"Good morning, muffin."
I'm fancier than a muffin.
I'm a croissant.
I know what kind of croissant you are... ham and cheese!
A vegetarian can't be ham and cheese.
I'm chocolate.
"Two chocolate croissants, please."
- Coming right up.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- I'll go get some.
Yay!
"Hey, you know you're gonna have to make them yourself when we run away to Fiji."
Did you get that call yet from your office about...
I've got my Aplus investigators on it.
"Gonna hear something soon, okay?"
I will be right back.
Yay!
"We love you, Mommy."
Love you guys.
Sorry.
"No, no."
Hey!
Serena!
"Serena, did somebody come in here?"
A messenger was here.
He brought something for Daddy.
- What?
- A yellow envelope.
"You know, like this."
Wait!
Hold it!
Wait a second!
How do I break it to her gently?
I don't know.
You're good at that sort of thing.
I'm not that good at it.
"Now, wait a minute!"
Thomas!
Thomas!
Break it to her gently.
Break it to her gently.
He did it to me again.
"Hi, Lena."
Saul's got this little problem.
His heart attacked him.
"No, that's terrible."
"'Janet Clark, please report to maternity.'"
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
Could you tell me the status of a Saul Greenberg?
An ambulance brought him in a while ago.
Possible heart attack.
Sure.
I'll check for you.
No ambulances have checked in since this morning and that was a pregnancy.
That's impossible.
The ambulance left about five minutes before I did.
They may have gone to another hospital.
Was it a private ambulance?
Yeah. international Life Support.
- And his doctor?
- This is not the time.
- It's the perfect time.
"Truth, Gemma."
- I love you.
"- Oh, shit, Chris."
Give me another chance.
You know you want to.
No!
Sorry.
"Serious buzzkill, Chris."
"- I say the moment's passed, mate."
- Yeah.
I choose truth.
- Felix isn't in Chile.
- So... where is he?
"Well, what happened was that he hung himself."
What?
He hung himself.
"Right here, from that crossbeam there."
"- Is this a joke, mate?"
"- No joke, mate."
It's what happened.
I'm in Afghanistan stewing in sweat and fear and blood.
"And when I get home, my kid brother's found swinging from the rafters."
The groundsman cut him down.
True story.
But this is terrible.
"It's been hushed up, naturally, 16 generations of French Catholics."
"Suicide's about as shameful as it gets, not to menton a faggot cop-out."
So why are we here?
I need to get the bottom of it.
Family honour's at stake.
"- Hey, come back!"
- Prostitute to get rid of this thief!
"- Stop, Give me that wallet!"
- Give the man his wallet!
"- He worked hard for the money, g.t guy!"
"- You worked hard, right?"
- Hold on there.
Do not fucking move!
- Fuck man!
Hello?
What's going on there?
- Want to play?
- Listen.
As for the last case?
"Laboratory, was caught in a match."
"- Mason, have checked the records."
You were right about the delivery.
- Where do I said that?
"- Yes, the better."
I received a delivery address in person.
1132 Orchard Glen Park Road.
- John ...
- Flee!
Jesus Christ man!
We take a look at dirt.
What are you doing?
"Yes, I hazırlıyorsun papers."
I love the computer.
"A real angel of death, believe me."
"Yes, I'd be more optimistic than we used to."
"Okay, Pete."
"All gone, tell him."
Some of the kids at school told the police...
-...that you and Taylor didn't get along.
-Yeah.
But I never wanted to kill her.
Never.
Do you believe me?
"Yeah, I do."
[SIGHS]
A couple more questions.
"On the day this happened, did you happen to smell anything?"
"Anything, like what?"
Like rotten eggs or sulfur?
No.
"Okay, um...."
Did you notice any black smoke?
"What, are you crazy?"
[SIGHS]
[SIGHS]
So?
I think she's telling the truth.
The way she talked about being there mentally but not physically.
Kind of sounds like demonic possession to me.
-Kind of?
-She didn't see any black smoke.
Or smell sulfur.
Maybe she's not a demon.
Kids can be vicious.
"Well, I mean, we're already here, might as well check out the school."
Right.
The school.
-What?
"-Truman High, home of the Bombers."
I know the risk but I have to know her.
Elena.
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
"- Anna, your face."
- It's nothing.
It didn't look like nothing.
- Matty tells me you broke his heart.
- Mom.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb under the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
"Twenty-seven vampires, Damon."
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
"Annabelle, close the door, please."
"Hey, Bethanne."
What are you guys watching?
You've been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
- Mm.
"Did you get enough, sweetheart?"
- For now.
"Anna, are you hungry?"
Did you want a little?
"No, thank you, Miss Gibbons."
Why don't you lay down and get some rest?
She's fine.
"Aren't you, Miss Gibbons?"
Not when he's your dad and he acts like your diary is part of the collective unconscious.
Wait.
"Sorry, I keep thinking about people sitting on this couch talking about being sexually abused."
That's what makes it fun.
You're a good kisser.
Am I a manly kisser?
Do you want to go to my prom with me?
N.Y.U. has proms?
Shit.
I'm drunk.
I should be honest with you.
I don't go to N.Y.U.
- Where do you go?
Hunter?
- St. Anne's.
The high school?
How old are you?
- Old enough.
- Wait wait.
"You want me to go to your senior prom, right?"
You're 18?
"- No, junior prom."
- You're 17?
- 16.
- 16 years old?
But I'll be 17 in two weeks.
You're 16?
"Oh my God, oh my God."
Don't freak out.
I haven't been a virgin for almost a year.
I probably know more about sex than you do.
"I know plenty about sex, okay?"
Thank you.
Impossible!
The enemy?
Hi!
You've got some nerve!
Isn't that the warning alarm?
Shut up!
You horny robot!
Let's hurry.
"Yes, but this may be a false alarm..."
"See you later, Romlin."
"But, I would like to continue..."
Is everything okay?
"Yes, all hands are preparing for battle."
What's going on?
Nobody's attacking us...
"Right, Manami?"
I doubt they've retreated.
Here it comes.
Are you really going?
Disengage Dimension Code Protection.
Manami!
"Condition level, rapidly deteriorating."
How's the pilot?
"Flail, do you read?"
Flail!
It's no good.
There's no response.
It has incredibly fast reaction time.
Who is this enemy?
I'll leave the rest to you.
Keep calling out to her.
"Yes, sir, that is correct, sir."
- We are on full lockdown.
- Hey!
We need help up here now!
Security sweep!
Open up!
Thirty seconds.
Secure Air Comm.
Meet at the rally.

Heading for Castle Sky.
You've reached the voice mail of Emily Cale.
Why aren't you texting me?
"Em, as soon as you get this, call me back."
"- Keep moving, keep moving!"
"- Martin, I'm right outside the Capitol."
What the hell is happening?
Do you have the president?
I have Eagle.
"Call WFO, get as many men as you can to the Capitol."
I'll dispatch everyone I can spare.
I want a hard perimeter around Castle.
A hard perimeter around Castle.
Eastside Gate.
"Come on, let's go, people."
"Fred, open the gate."
Come on.
Prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.
We're going to visit my little sister.
I had hoped to have a champion by now.
Why don't you slay the Jabberwocky yourself?
You must have the power.
It is against my vows to harm any living creature.
(SPUTTERING)
We have company.
"Have a look, Bayard."
BAYARD:
Bielle.
(BARKING)
I'm so happy to see you.
I thought they were going to...
So did I.
"But they didn't, and now here I am, still in one piece."
And I'm rather glad about that now that I'm seeing you again.
"I would have regretted not seeing you again, especially now that you're you, and the proper size."
And it's a good size.
It's a great size.
It's a right proper Alice size!
-Hatter.
-Size.
Fez.
I'm fine.
Where's your hat?
Mmm.
-Cheshire.
"-How's the arm, love?"
All healed.
"Goodbye, sweet hat."
- Hello.
"- Hey, baby."
Fucking psycho.
Fucking psycho.
Fucking psycho.
Fucking psycho.
Fucking psycho.
Where's Marie?
Who?
You know who.
Marie is my waitress.
My!
You're chatty tonight.
"Darling, I'm your waitress!"
What's going on here?
I've never seen you before.
What are you talking about?
"You come in here every night, sitting on that same stool, staring at your coffee."
"To be honest, I was starting to think that you were a mute."
I wanna see Maria!
"Mister, there's no Maria that works here."
Is everybody in it?
Let's have a laugh on Trevor.
"Whatever Ivan was paying you, he's wasting his money."
"Go home, Mister."
Get some sleep.
Don't forget your post-its.
"Christ, Stevie."
How could you!
Nicholas?
"You'll have to pay your utility bills, partner."
You know how difficult it is shaving' in the dark.
What's happening?
Deep breaths.
What are you doing?
Giving you the chance to prove that Pure Bloods aren't immortal.
"Pure Bloods could die, and that we, the infected ones, will be the ones to take you all down."
I...
I...
I thought you loved me.
I do.
For everything you've just done for Marcus and I.
Who is infected now?
"I know it hurts, mom."
- Please don't!
- I can't.
Stop it you bitch!
It has to work right?
Tell me it's gonna work!
I'm so thristy!
"I can smell him, he's right there."
"I'm so thirsty, honey, please!"
Why isn't this working?
"She's fed to many times, she's been turned for too long."
Let me out!
What can I do?
You can let me do it.
Mom!
Krista?
I'm sorry.
Butchered in bed in hollywood's
Premier sex playground-- Lenny stein--
"Music producer, maverick executive,"
"I don't think you are, Dad."
"You know who's in there, right, besides the little girl?"
Her mother and her father--Charlie.
That means he knows.
And that's two people with a lot of information that have had some pretty bad experiences with us over the years.
They have to go.
"Dr Penzler, too."
I can't risk a leak.
It's too important.
They don't matter anymore.
It's all about Allie.
"You're not in charge here, Mary."
I am.
Take a step back.
Calm down.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
"Just, the two of them having gotten together has made me a little nervous."
- They could really gum us up.
"- No one's getting killed here, Mary."
Of course not.
CYNTHIA:
I got to go to the bathroom.
Grab a cup.
Knock yourself out.
"Lisa, hows he doing?"
He's still breathing.
Are you all right?
I just don't want any more bad news.
Mr Watson?
"Luke, when he died, he wasn't mad at you anymore."
DALE:
"Thou dost stone my heart, and makest me call what I intend to do; a murder... which I thought a sacrifice:"
I saw the handkerchief.
He found it then;
I never gave it him:
send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.
- He hath confess'd.
"- What, my lord?"
- That be hath used thee.
- How?
- Unlawfully?
- Ay.
- He will not say so.
"- No, his mouth is stopp'd;"
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
O!
my fears interprets:
"- what, is he dead?"
- Had all his hairs been lives... my great revenge had stomach for them all.
Alas!
He is betray'd and I undone.
"Out, strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face?"
"O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!"
Kill me to-morrow:
let me live to-night!
"- Hay, if you strive."
- But half an hour!
"- Being done, there is no pause."
- But while I say one prayer!
It is too late.
"My lord, my lord!"
"What, ho!"
The third name.
"Yeah, the guy in Cleveland."
What about him?
He's the district attorney there.
"All right, we'll handle it."
Anything else?
The last name.
It's gotta be done on Friday.
That's the 13th.
Friday the 13th.
It'll be done the following day.
Some of the boys think it's bad luck to take a contract for the 13th.
We can't push our luck.
"Sorry I can't ask you to stay, Lew."
Gotta get dressed for a dinner.
"Next time, for sure."
Hi.
Come on in.
"I'm Lynn Harper, Mr. Gordon."
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to welcome my new neighbours.
I'm glad you believe in being neighbourly.

Then we'll have dinner.

Open the valve.
"Excellent dinner, Mrs. Harper."
Everything was delicious.

"Becky,that is good to know."

- Bye.
Excuse me.
"Mrs.Collins,you have a call on our house phone."
Who is it?
"She didn't say,but it sounded urgent."
What do you bet it's marcy.
Ahem.
"Okay, you're not helping, really, with my nerves here, so I gotta go."
Goddamn it.
"Hi, I'm Lucy Miller."
Um...
You must be Maggie.
I'll be representing you.
"I brought warm, comforting beverages."
Or what's left of them.
The rest is on my new white shirt that I wore to impress you.
"Uh, can we sit?"
Great.
Oh.
Sorry about your chips.
Um...
"Look, uh, yours is not a hopeless case."
Seems pretty hopeless to me.
Hm.
I can see that.
I'm not saying it's going to be easy.
They do have your son's voice on the 911 call.
I don't even know what happened to me.
I didn't mean to scare him.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
"You know, um, I'm scared too."
You're scared?
This is my first day in the field.
That's comforting.
I volunteered.
I specifically wanted your case.
A charity case.
Because I think I can help you.
"Foon, that painted face did it."
That clown again?
The opera troupe might be involved.
I thought so!
You stay out of this!
"Marshal, if you need any help, just ask."
No need.
I'm the Marshal of seven provinces!
"When I'm on a case, I can withstand anything!"
"Reporting for duty, Marshal!"
I've arrested all the painted faces.
But I don't know who's the murderer.
Quiet!
Reporting for duty!
Who's the murderer?
Reporting for duty!
"Marshal, you've made a mistake!"
I've got to go on stage any time now!
- Snake Tongue!
- Here!
Are all the painted faces here?
Yes.
We got everyone.
What about him?
- He escaped.
- Numbskull!
- Useless...
- Reporting for duty!
Stop!
Make way!
Where do you think you're going?
What are you doing?
A clown ba...
It's like a baby...
It's like a clown that is a baby.
- I said cl... clown baby.
- Mm-mmm.
You said baby clown.
- I don't even care.
- Yep.
"""Clown Baby""?"
What in the hell kind of a name is Clown Baby?
"Bro, it's perfect."
Nobody's gonna bet on a guy named Clown Baby.
He's gonna be a huge underdog.
- Which means we stand to make even more money off him.
- Exactly.
"- Oh, that's brilliant."
"- Hey, pal, 500 bucks on Clown Baby."
"Oh, Dennis. 500?"
"That's all we got, dude."
You saw Charlie.
We turned that kid into an animal.
"Oh, yeah?"
Call me a Holocaust victim?
Say you're prettier than me?
"Okay, maybe that part might be a little bit true."
We'll see how pretty you are as soon as I punch a hole in your...
Wha...
Where the he...
Who took my shit?
I might have had some.
"What did you just say, you little bitch?"
I might have had some of your pills or whatever.
I'll get the money tomorrow.
You focus on the arrangements.
Are you done with the hospital arrangements?
I came here after paying the advance amount.
My brother's friends are with him at the hospital.
He is repeatedly asking to meet you.
"Once the transplantation is done,"
I will be the first person to meet him.
She is cooking a story to rob him.
Priya?
Are you crying?
"Thanks for being there, Vikram."
Be strong.
I'll be there for you.
Your company is all I need.
Everything will go smoothly.
Who is this woman?
!
Even I want to fall in love with her!
I'll pay.
What's your lover Vasundhara saying?
"Start, start..."
Go closer!
Follow them.
"You, moron!"
We have to take the other route now.
Move...
- Idiot.
- We lost them!
"Panju, call Alphonse."
I'm not able to reach him.
Bye.
Did anyone come to visit me?
who do you mean?
We are all here.
My friend.
Which friend?
Did anyone by the name Deepa visit me?
Deepa?
No.
No one like that had come.
Where is my phone?
Did she call me?
I need to talk to her immediately.
I'll leave.
"Sadhana, wait."
Where are you going?
He is asking about someone called Deepa.
I asked for my phone.
I need to talk to Deepa immediately.
I need to see her.
What is this?
Sadhana was the one who took care of you.
You didn't even talk to her.
"I will talk to her, later."
I need to talk to Deepa now.
Will you give my phone?
What do you think you are doing?
We have been praying for your recovery...
We have spent a lot of money and waited.
You must be happy for getting your vision back.
You are reciting someone random woman's name!
- What did you say?
What?
I don't recognize anybody's voice.
Don't make any mistakes here or do anything stupid.
Don't tell me how to live my life.
- Cut them loose.
- All right.
OFFICER:
"All right, this way out."
MARTINEZ:
Let's go.
[DOOR OPENS]
"- Hey, Greg."
"- Hey, John."
KELLY:
How you feeling?
MEDAVOY:
Okay.
"You know, all right."
John....
- Could I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.
"John, when you got separated, did you give that a lot of thought?"
"Did you have it pretty well worked- out, what you were going to do?"
- It was her call.
- It was Laurie's idea?
Yeah.
"For me, you marry, you marry for life."
Me too.
"You know, that's exactly me too."
"But when it happened I was so busy being pissed off and hurt, I wasn't listening."
She was trying to tell me why she wanted to leave.
But you know what?
She was right.
- Yeah.
You do?
What should we do now?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
"Oh, yeah."
Memory serves.
"Now that I have your attention, listen up."
"You do not come into my town, threaten people I care about."
Going after Elena?
Bad move.
You leave her alone or I will rip you to bits.
Because I do believe in killing the messenger.
You know why?
Because it sends a message.
[GASPS AND GRUNTS]
"If Katherine wants something from me, you tell that bitch to come get it herself."
[KNOCKS]
- Hi.
- Hey.
I couldn't sleep last night.
"You were obviously upset about something, and I just walked away."
That's not me.
That can't be us.
"You're my friend, Elena."
"If you need me, I'm here for you."
And I'm sorry I couldn't show you that yesterday.
I met my birth mother.
Oh.
Was it?
Are you okay?
[GRUNTS]
TYLER:
You're his kin.
"People would keep coming in, 'cause they associate you with your old man."
Maybe you should hang with las viejas on 190th.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Doctor says you're getting out of here soon.
They set you up with a daytime nurse for a couple of months.
I spoke to the insurance lady.
I put a little extra in to get you through the next few weeks.
- Gracias.
"- You've got a real gift, Carlos."
Don't let go of that.
"- Put me down, carajo!"
- I got you.
"- Put me down, coño!"
- I got you.
Nice!
Let's get some light in here.
"Better, right?"
"You have some nice plants here, Mr. Eddie."
Let me knot it for you.
They could use some water.
Let's take this jug.
Carlos:
"Turn it, dude."
You're gonna break the window.
- Mickey:
Stop fucking bitching.
- Carlos:
What did I tell you?
- Daisy:
You'll hit the walls.
- Shit.
- It.
Move.
Mother!
Let go.
Mother!
They do not touch to me.
"We go, walk."
You do not resist.
-You lower those hands.
Mother!
Paulino.
I am the Dr. Cicchirini.
Let go!
Mother!
I am innocent.
-Poor little bastard...
-It is a Judiciary error.
How it is going to be a judiciary error?
Paulino!
Paulino!
They are going away to cool meatballs.
Son mine!
Senorita.
Whereupon expensive you return to appear?
You have found another disease to arrange for me?
"No, no."
"Then, stop to bother me."
By the way?
"You know nothing of an ambulance, of a patient who flees?"
No...
"Better, because my fiancee spent three days in the jail before clarifying the misunderstanding."
If I discover who has been I twist the neck to him.
"If you're happy, I'm happy."
Don't you feel well?
Is your boss treating you all right?
Forget it.
"Hey, you speak Italian?"
Hide this for me!
Next week I'll come and get it!
"Abbandando, meet my nephew!"
How's business?
"It's good, it's good."
Fanucci's mad.
Says the neighborhood's getting sloppy.
"People don't pay on time, don't pay the full amount."
Says he's been too nice to everyone.
So Fanucci's changing?
Sure.
He wants double from everybody.
Even from my father.
"I'm a friend, right?"
So you'll let him work here?
I've got some bad news.
I feel rotten about telling you this...
But Fanucci...he's got a nephew...
And you have to give him my job.
"You've always been good to me, ever since I came here."
You looked after me like a father.
I thank you.
And I won't forget it.
Vito!
"Oh, no!"
Take this to your family.
Thanks anyway.
He's the district attorney there.
"All right, we'll handle it."
Anything else?
The last name.
It's gotta be done on Friday.
That's the 13th.
Friday the 13th.
It'll be done the following day.
Some of the boys think it's bad luck to take a contract for the 13th.
We can't push our luck.
"Sorry I can't ask you to stay, Lew."
Gotta get dressed for a dinner.
"Next time, for sure."
Hi.
Come on in.
"I'm Lynn Harper, Mr. Gordon."
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to welcome my new neighbours.
I'm glad you believe in being neighbourly.
Always.
"Come, I'll introduce you to my husband and his brother."
Then we'll have dinner.
Lead the way.
Open the valve.
"Excellent dinner, Mrs. Harper."
Everything was delicious.
Thank you.
And it's Lynn.
"I understand you're in the lumber business, Mr. Gordon."
- Right.
- Does that mean trees or...?
No.
Splendid.
That's exactly what we're going to do.
- Mumsie!
- I have it all worked out.
- I've recced his barge.
- Wrecked his barge?
!
"No, Reconnoitred."
He lives on a barge.
"- But, Mumsie..."
- Shh!
Hello?
Are you that Dennis creature?
This is Flora Ransom here.
I have your money.
Come and collect it at 7:30 tomorrow night.
"Now, you get the pills, I'll prepare the trunk."
"""Solder wire to hole marked Z."""
And that's that.
- Wonderful.
- Whatever's that?
"That, my friend, is the bomb completed."
Now for the gunpowder.
Get out my Indian army colonel with the overdraft clothes.
(Doorbell)
Mr MacGregor?
My name is Lord Mayley.
- Yes?
- We haven't met before but you're said to be a very decent sort.
- You're very kind.
- I'm sure you agree that we should help each other.
- How much do you want?
Here you go.
Brittany Gold.
Get out of the car.
I'm sorry about the tape.
Don't worry.
"Billy won't show it to anyone, especially not your wife."
Karl Stoltz is dead.
"You know who that is, right?"
Did you really think
I was going to let a bitch like you set me up?
I'm really sorry--
You know what?
I could run you in right now for the vials of shit that I know you have on your person.
- Fucking bitch!
- Aah!
Chain in or out?
"In, please."
"All right, listen, I don't know who's going to be there today, okay?"
- Yes.
- I need you on your A game.
- All right?
- Okay.
Laser focused.
Okay?
- Pee less.
- Right.
"Also, please learn how to tie your own tie because you're a grown-ass man."
"- Oh, well."
- [sigh]
"I'm so proud of you, sis."
What are you--
What the fuck is wrong with you?
10!
10!
- 10 cardboards!
- Wonderful!
- Ugye?
- Great!
It was worthy.
"We struggled for him, but was worthy."
Where is the kind Tót?
He was it here yet before.
- Lajos.
- Daddy!
Do not sleep eternally.
#Girls!
Respectthe lad well.#
"I am glad that you have a so good mood, my dear Tót."
"I do not know it, how I shall express my gratitude."
"- Come on, major lord."
"- But yeah, yeah."
- I'm happy and satisfied.
- I am glad.
I say only so much that was Helebrant second lieutenant till now my room-mate.
"But, if I return onto the front, the your dear Gyula your son gets into his place."
"This is beneficial because it surrounds the schoolhouse, a guard doubled where I live."
Oh my God.
"For my son, good man like this his commander."
We thank you.
Kind angel.
Oh what are you doing?

"Xiaotian, I love you!"
I'll wait for you!
Yawang!
Mother!
Father!
How is it?
Was it hard?
- Yes.
"- It's allright, no problem!"
"It's done, don't think about it anymore."
Let's go home and rest.
I have cooked some delicious food for you!
- You came too?
- Uncle asked me to come.
"I see, you forced to come."
"Yawang, I really miss you!"
Are you allright in the university?
"Sometimes, I think..."
"You have entered the university that you want,"
I have entered the military academy.
We are getting close to our perfect life!
"I told you, we will be together for not much time anymore."
Let's go for it together!
- I...
- Is the next stop is your school?
When yor class will be ended today?
5:40 p.m.
5:40 p.m?
I'll pick you up.
Let's watch a movie later!
I don't really like movie.
You don't?
"His pride, my pride."
- Please.
- Enough talk.
Time to play the game.
Hello.
Hello-ah.
Friend of yours?
"It's Jonesy, open up!"
Get rid of him.
I'll be listening.
"Luke, Luke, what's going on?"
I've been calling you for hours.
"- Sorry, man."
"- Not a sound, people."
Thought it's gonna be some country house megabash.
"No, it's a total wipeout."
No one here.
Just a few losers.
"- Well, I may as well come and say hi."
"- Seriously, you don't wanna go in there"
"Seriously, I do."
I've been on the road three hours.
"20 pound carried from the station, treading through this mud, to follow your fucking GPS."
"Plus, I've got a shitload of gear that I'm supposed to be shifting tonight."
"Can't let you in, mate."
It's a private party.
Is this some kinda wind-up.
"What's going on, Luke?"
N-Nothing.
- Are you standing me?
- No.
"That's it, isn't it?"
Do yourself a favor.
"When you get home, turn on the Hallmark channel."
Just live in it for a few hours.
"Brian, just stop, all right?"
"- All right, but I just think..."
- Brian.
"Oh, shit, that's Dad's room."
Dad.
You!
You told me to go into the light.
- What?
"- Oh, yeah."
There was a light.
"I almost walked right into the goddamn thing, you ungrateful little shit."
You wanted me dead.
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
And I'm a freaking five?
I said you were making a comeback.
I'm a goddamn ten.
I'm just...
I'm just glad you're alive.
"I know you are, kid."
I'm just breaking your balls.
Look at this.
I've been up ten minutes.
Already my Tinder is blowing up.
"Yeah, all right."
"- How do you feel, Mr. Farrell?"
- Never better.
These comas are a dynamite way to catch up on your sleep.
I might need another one in a couple of months.
Being single is exhausting.
What are you doing?
Big Brother has such a tragic death
Can't I even make him an altar?
There's not enough space even for the living
Who cares about the dead!
You...
What?
What are you guys arguing about?
Don't you know that dad is sick?
"Brother Jin, please rest in peace!"
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Go away!
"Master Fan, I've a secret to tell you!"
What secret?
"We shouldn't talk here, I'll wait for you at hillside"
Come here quick!
Come here!
Hey!
I'm here!
What secret?
You really want to know?
Since I asked you out
I'll surely tell you!
Someone wants to kill you!
Who?
Who dares to kill me?
Say!
This man is very skillful
I don't think you can handle him!
Do you remember a year ago
At the pharmacy?
"People, please, move out of the way, please."
Keep this door open.
"Come on, open the door."
- Bring him in.
Is he conscious?
"- No, ma'am."
"- Oh, my God."
- Calm down.
He's going to be all right.
He's going to be all right.
We'll cut him right here.
Gauze.
- That's good.
- On your left.
"Thank you, nurse."
"Dr. Simmons, take a look at this."
Heavenly father...
I know everything happens for a reason... so I'll just leave it in your hands.
Amen.
Excuse me.
I need somebody to talk to about my friend.
I'm worried about his condition.
What time you get off work?
I just want to discuss his condition.
Visiting hours are over.
Good night.
"You're doing much better, Mr. Reed."
Don't try to talk.
You need your rest.
"My name is Vanessa, and I'm going to take great care of you."
Understand?
Just push the button on the side of the bed... and I'll be there.
"- Oh, this is your car, right?"
- Yep.
See?
Fixed it.
Okay.
You're backing up?
Just fucking go straight.
"I took a precision driving class, Dan."
I think I know what I'm doing.
"Ma'am, we've lost Pierce."
I'm sorry.
We should have hired Navy SEALs instead of those two actual seals.
How do you lose a whole person?
"A cuff link I get, but not a person."
Okay.
She said she's losing her voice.
Just heard from a reporter who says Moyes thinks the White House hired lobbyists to destroy its own bill.
"- Oh, my God."
- Jesus.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"She said you fucked up, Ben."
And I'm mad as hell that you put Gary in the shit.
You need to get him out.
"- She didn't say that, Gary."
"- Yes, she did."
"Everyone, shut your fucking holes!"
The president is not sick.
- You guys are.
You're parasites.
You're like an infestation of mediocrity.
I don't care if you're a 1950s radio broadcaster.
"So, do you know what everyone is saying?"
What?
About how you and Angela had sex.
- Who?
- You and Angela.
No.
Who's saying that?
I don't know.
People. I mean.
"She told me the truth, of course."
What truth?
How far you guys went.
Well.
Yeah.
Because nothing happened.
"Right, so how come it's all over school?"
"I mean, you're not talking it up like some low-life..."
"derelict cretin telling everyone you did her, are you?"
J ust checking.
- H i Brian.
- H i.
- This is Gina.
- Hey.
- Right.
H i.
- Brian saw the entire thing.
I heard you actually chased the gunmen.
- Chased the gunmen?
- l would have screamed.
I have to leave the room when my father uses the electric knife.
"I think chase is a little bit strong, but I was going to check out the situation ..."
because you know if there's a gun--
You say that like there's only one problem.
God knows what Lance is going to come up with while you try to produce a mother out of thin air.
Pay the bill.
[line ringing]
"Hey, uh, I hope you're having a great Sunday because we got a big fucking problem."
Marjorie:
Okay.
How soon can you make it to Bridgeport?
Why?
Because I need you to be the rope.
Okay.
Who am I playing?
Pete's mom Maggie.
"Uh, isn't she, like, north of 50?"
"I just played your mistress a few years ago, Marius."
"What, now I'm your mother?"
"What is this, Hollywood?"
"Well, we're screwed if you don't."
Ohh.
Do you have any idea of her height?
No.
Oh.
Good.
I'll sit.
"Uh, need to be dark, and I'll need something that makes them not want to look too closely."
Okay.
"I need to know a few things about her, please."
I don't know much beyond her name.
"Well, figure it out."
- [phone rings]
- Shit.
Yeah.
- Are you doing okay?
- Yeah.
- What have you been up to?
- When?
All this time!
I've been looking out the window.
The window?
What were you looking at?
"Just looking, Barbuda."
I see.
How are you doing in school?
"The principal says that I'm behind, Barbuda."
Behind?
How come?
Didn't you showher how you can read?
"How you can draw, write and walk the tightrope."
Didn't you tell her that your mom made you study every day?
"Don't worry, sweetie."
You'll get the hang of it in no time.
Don't worry about that.
I miss you already!
I hope the circus comes by Rio de Janeiro again.
"Next time, I promise I'll bring Foguinho."
"Come on, my tightrope walker."
Barbuda.
Can you take me up there someday?
Ask your grandma.
She'll take you.
"I want to go with you, Barbuda."
Can you take me?
- Mom!
- Maria!
"Seventeen black, we won!"
Great!
"Fortunate in games of chance, unfortunate in games of love."
we won.
"What, thats all?"
yes.
Ok then
Thanks
Here.
You where splendid.
"Truly, you looked marvelous."
"Enough with the complements, you know that there is no room for them between us."
What time is the meeting?
Tonight at midnight.
And Uli?
He is carrying out a small mission.
You are becoming quite the dangerous Cassanova.
Me?
Why do you say that?
I have my reasons.
Should I bring Mr. Dinamo's car?
"No, bring mine!"
"Adriana, wait!"
wait.
What happened to you...you are quite the mess.
I was trying to stop a man from shooting a woman.
Who was he?
"I do not know, It was dark."
And who was she?
"Don't know, I only saw her shadow."
"Oh, sure."
"Ah,I see, there goes your ""ghost."""
- What's going on?
- I just got fired.
"Oh, my gosh, are you serious?"
"Oh, don't act so shocked, Carrie."
"All the times I've watched ""All About Eve,"""
"and I didn't even realize you were ""All About Eve-ing"" me."
What are you talking about?
Me?
I didn't want to get you fired.
"I mean, I've been working my butt off to save your job."
Yeah?
"Well, nice work..."
Taking my assignment and all.
"Bennet, you vanished."
I couldn't reach you.
"And apparently, you were out partying."
So what was I supposed to do?
Not stab me in the back.
Thanks for being such a good friend.
I didn't mean to get him fired.
Oh.
- Who are you?
- I'm Dorrit...
Bradshaw.
I'm just waiting to meet my dad.
"Oh, I didn't realize Tom had kids."
"Yep, me and my sister."
Don't worry.
I won't be long.
I just need some money.
Got it.
"Don't tell him, but he's super easy to manipulate."
Yoon.
"Yoon, he said the crack doesn't look good."
It looks retouched.
The photo is unrealistic.
Okay.
One more thing
"I am sorry to bring this up, but you forgot to erase the finger of the guy who's lifting the athlete's leg."
Shit!
Don't try to make any excuses.
Shitty work is shitty work.
Shitty work because you suck!
No excuses will do.
Yoon.
Yoon.
Are you listening?
Yeah.
About Adidas.
The 2nd lot.
"The set with the girl, they want to take a break."
Who's doing it then?
Nobody.
It's just a break.
Just a break?
No such thing.
"Who is doing it, Je?"
Jerd.
Hello Peng.
"Hey, I heard you lost it?"
You heard about that?
"Even though I'm in another office, when Je got chewed out, I knew about that."
Accidents happen sometimes.
But some people who are hit by car once are handicapped for the rest of their lives.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.
- I'm sorry!
- You're sorry!
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
BOTH:
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
Amy's almost here.
Any last words of encouragement?
Ignore all your instincts.
"Oh, my God, Clark."
"Don't look, it's pornography!"
The worst kind...
Long-form narrative.
"""Clark's Playbook of Scenarios to Help Jack Break Up with Amy""?"
"Okay, I'll give in."
It's my playbook of scenarios to help Jack break up with Amy.
"It's a little overthinky, right?"
"It's weird, but kind of sweet."
I wish someone paid that much attention to me.
Maybe there's someone that does.
And he's a lot closer than you think.
Have you tried... online dating?
"Damn it, Clark."
"Amy, I wanted to talk to you because..."
"Oh, I just thought of another crazy payroll story."
Buckle up.
"It was a Friday, of course..."
"That controls the automatic functions, breathing, sleeping, wakefulness, intestinal functions."
She can open her eyes but as a mechanical action.
"Her brain is dead, she's got no ideas or feelings."
Come in.
"Hey, you!"
Come on in!
"Yes, you."
Hello.
- My name's Benigno.
- Marco Zuloaga.
This is Alicia.
- Was it your first night here?
- Yes.
The first is the worst.
Then you get used to it.
What are those boots for?
They stop her feet from twisting sideways or falling forward.
- They look like Ibizan boots.
- Do they?
I've never been to Ibiza.
I know you.
From my writings?
No.
It was at the theatre.
We happened to be sitting together.
I didn't notice.
At one point you started to cry.
I told you about him.
"He cried watching ""Cafe Muller."""
I have to go.
So soon?
We haven't had a chance to talk.
There's still due process.
"Out here, due process is a bullet."
I want you to keep that lighter.
It belonged to a medical specialist in Captain Coleman's team.
"After delivering a Montagnard baby, he was on his way back to camp and..."
His friends found him about 3 clicks out.
"Beheaded, mutilated."
His wife couldn't have recognized him.
And that V.C. In there did it!
That has nothing to do...
Tell it to Captain Coleman.
And shout it loud because Arlington Cemetery's a long way from here.
DOC:
Next.
Now what is it this time?
That old ear bothering you?
Methiolate.
I'm not going to hurt you one bit.
Now just hold still.
That's it.
Don't move.

Want me to take a look?

I have an offer...
Zero.
You say island white is the most addictive narcotic on the market.
Where's your proof?
It takes a lot more than hired muscle and a shiny factory to impress me.
You want proof?
I want 100% customer retention.
Follow me.
"Guys, I found Bosley."
- What?
Where?

"Here, and..."
"Oh, my God."

I'll be your eyes and ears.
Meet your first and only customer.
- Who is she?
- She's nobody.

How do you brake?
"Oh, man, I know that look."
"Hey, homework starts as soon as they're done kicking my butt, Pops."
"Babe, I didn't see the harm."
Dinner's almost ready.
You and the kids get started without us.
"Come on, come on."
"Come on, come on."
Uh...
"It was my fault, not theirs, you know."
I-I pushed them into playing.
"Yeah, you're good at that."
Why did you do it?
The card game.
The kid you found dying in the street.
- No.
- How about not lying to me for once in your life?
I was trying to get out from under.
These guys-- they had my money.
Whose money?
The money for the... for the shop?
The money you loaned me-- it wasn't enough.
Off-ramp and a subway stop already budgeted for.
But I'm left holding the bag.
What are you complaining about?
The bag's full of cash.
Minus a year.
You can weather a year.
You can weather 1 00 years.
I've got partners.
You're my partners!
You're holding so many options on land...
... youcouldbuyBrooklyn.
You could probably buy Staten Island too.
"Would you excuse us, please?"
Of course.
I got an appointment anyway.
Good.
Then it works out nicely.
You sure BankExchange is all set?
We got everything we wanted.
Now you can get something else for me.
-What's that?
-My name out of the papers.
How?
"With $40,000."
"What am I gonna do with $40,000?"
Let me ask you a question.
"You ever heard of a cop with $40,000?"
Who wasn't crooked?
"A cop with $40,000 would make big headlines."
Say hello to Nettie for me.
I will.
-Take care.

"- Yes, you are."
"Fine, I'm shouting."
Happy?
I know this music.
Isn't this...?
What is this place?
"Judging by the food, it's still a Lebanese restaurant-."
Judging by the hairdos it's Yemenite.
Israelis?
- They're onto us.
- Should I take it off?
- You're paranoid.
- So why are you whispering?
Tel Aviv?
Are you from Tel Aviv?
- Jerusalem.
- Why didn't you say so?
Menashe!
All Israelis are our guests.
We'll treat you like kings.
I'll get you drinks and we'll have a toast.

So I guess you've heard.
Sharon's dad is okay.
That's great.
"No, I hadn't heard."
I'm obviously the last person in Pittsburgh to hear.
- So you're friends with Sharon now?
"- Well, so, you are, right?"
Look.
"We all know what's going on around here, okay?"
- Which is that you are jealous.
- What?
And you.
You are totally flipped because...
Rayanne finally did something nice for once in her life.
Which she did by taking Sharon to go visit her dad.
And now both of you just want to be sure that you both still are friends.
Which you are.
So shut up!
Let's kill him.
"Say a prayer, Vasquez."
I'm going to kill him.
"- l've been knocking, but..."
- What?
Your mom let me in.
I came to drop off your bag.

- A group you probably hate.
"Okay, I'll go."
I'm glad your dad is going to be okay.
My father almost died.
"By erasing Simeon, you made space for me."
I fill him now.

Captain Latimer...
your children... they are afraid.
Hold them.
It's not really my area.
It is now.
What's happening?
Doctor!
The globe.
It's turning to rain.
"All of it, the snow, look."
He's dead.
What happened?
"The snow mirrors, that's all it does."
It's mirroring something else now.
"Something so strong, it's drowning everything else."
There was a critical mass of snow at the house.
If something happened there...
Salty.
Salt water rain.
It's not raining.
It's crying.
"The only force on Earth that could drown the snow, a whole family crying on Christmas Eve."
The Wu-tang Sword is really fierce.
Please stop or someone will get killed!

We'll bring them here!
Wait.

Invite the master of the Shaolin martial arts school here.
I have an idea!
Cheers!
I've always admired Shaolin kung-fu very much.
"Especially your kung-fu, Mr. Liu!"
"Not at all, Your Highness!"
"I just know a little, you don't have to praise me."
I haven't exaggerated it.
Your fist is really marvelous.
"Of course, if my master's kung-fu wasn't good,"
I wouldn't be his student.
Shut up!
"Please excuse her, she's spoiled!"
She's right.

"If you stop now and nobody gets hurt, you won't have to go away."
"But before any of this, was there anything good in your life?"
"Yeah, I had my chair set up how I wanted."
Chicky and me had some things worked out.
"All right, you got your chair back, and I'm going to put Chicky in jail but I never noticed any shortage of whores in town."
"Now, come on, Ernie."
"What do you say, huh?"
"Come on, Ernie."
Come on.
Just take it easy.
Just relax now.
Come on.
That's it.
And he has to absolutely speak to me?
"Okay, I'll be right down."
KELLY:
You okay?
"- Yeah, thanks."
How you doing?
No fun busting this guy.
I think he's gonna get ROR'd.
- The booking's clear.
- Thanks.
DONNA:
"Detective, here's your file."
- I gotta take you to get fingerprinted.
- Thanks for the coffee.
All rise.
"For his excellence, inquisitor general don Tomás de Torquemada."
I must send you on a mission I wish I never would've had to send you on.
(WHISPERS) Look.
It can't be.
Do you care for my daughter Amelia?
Of course I care for her.
"I'm here, dining with you."
(ISABELLA I OF CASTILLE) What is this?
Abraham Levi is under my protection.
"I believe that there is only one possibility left, and you know what I'm referring to."
Run!
Guards!
Obey.
No man will be left behind.
(SALVADOR) What do you think?
that I don't wish he were here instead of burning at the stake.
(WHISPERS) Destroy the diary this very night.
Quick!
She's here!
"Quick, hurry up!"
"- Hello, everyone."
- Hello.
Am I late?
No.
"I'm even early, it seems."
So...
Is everyone here?
"Oh, no..."
I see that...
Our own Philippe.
I didn't do nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Stacey, put up that gun and listen."
You're sunk.
"I know it, big boy."
I just want you to listen to what this rat's gotta say.
Remember what happened to Limpy?
"In about two minutes, you're gonna get worse."
"Honest, Stacey."
I ain't done a thing.
"In two minutes, you're gonna get this .38 between the eyes."
"Don't shoot me, Stacey!"
I didn't never snitch on you.
I ain't talking about you snitching on me.
I'm talking about something I learned from Shake Edwards.
"No, I don't know nothing."
I'm talkin' about you framin' Ross into this joint.
Honest.
We never framed him.
[SCREAMS]
Start talking.
I can't.
I don't know.
"Wait, wait."
I'll talk.
Okay.
This is a confession without coaching.
"And it's gonna spring Ross, so remember it."
"Okay, canary."
Start singing.
Who framed Ross?
I did.
[ENGLISH ACCENT] ...hello?
"- Oh, good, Portugal's here."
"- We saved that wall for you, Christine."
"Oh, great."
"Oh, I get the whole wall."
Okay.
Just set up.
[CLEARS THRO AT]
[CLEARS THRO AT]
Exports.
Imports.
Portugal.
"Yeah, you know, Christine, you don't have to stay."
I'm sure you have a shift to run off to or something.
"Oh, no, no, no, I don't work shifts, Marly."
"I assign shifts to people, because I'm the boss."
I have a corporate credit card.
I've got 35 points accumulated.
"Two thousand more, I get a flashlight radio."
[LAUGHING]
[CLEARS THRO AT]
So you wanna open up the bottle of port?
Heh.
It's 8:30 in the morning.
Oh.
"- You don't have any vodka, do you?"
"- Yeah, where's Russia?"
[LAUGHING]
You know what would help?
If you could set out the plates for the international feast.
"Oh, sure."
"So, I have this new guy cooking for us."
"Yeah, well, I fucked up."
After that night on the bridge...
I blamed you for Jimmy.
"Yeah, I blamed me, too."
- I looked for you at the funeral.
- I couldn't deal with it.
An empty coffin like my mom's...
The river took half my family.
"It never gave them back, either."
I was wondering what happened to that picture.
"You, me and Jimmy at my dad's cabin."
All going to be cops.
- Brilliant idea.
- Look at us now.
I'm a dropout.
Jimmy's dead.
- And you're one of those...
- Water dogs.
It wasn't your fault what happened to Jimmy.
He had something wrong with him.
"He did, like my mom."
"Nobody noticed it, until he beat that suspect."
But I noticed it...
I never did anything about it.
You did the right thing.
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.
"- So, are you back now?"
- I'm back.
- You want to get something to eat?
"- No, I've got to meet a girl."
Danny...
I want action plans on my desk in one hour.
Stay vigilant.
I'm not losing any more of you.
Now I got to go call krzeminski's wife.
I'll call his girlfriend.
♪ There's a somebody I'm longing to see ♪
♪ I hope that he turns out to be ♪
♪ someone who'll watch over me
♪ I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood ♪
The usual?
"Yes, please."
♪ I know I could always be good ♪
♪ to one who'll watch over me
Anything else?
Uh... ♪ although he may not be the man ♪
I...
I thought I might
Tell you about my day if you have a moment.
"Yeah, that would be a nice change."
I got plenty of time on my hands.
All ears.
"Uh, it's just that..."
One of my co-workers died today.
"Geez, peg."
That's too bad.
Right there on the job?
"Yes, it was sudden."
I know how you feel...
blindsided.
Like when my cousin ralphie got hit by a bus.
"Granted, he did just knock off a newsstand, but still."
Big shock.
Sound?
Sound rolling.
Speed.
"Dunkirk film, scene 17, take one."
"Good luck, Lieutenant Lundbeck."
Action!
"- Here, boy."
- Here.
"Come on, boy."
"Don't be a fool, Johnnie."
There's a sniper out there.
And he's got a friend.
It's a Karabiner 98 Kurz.
Best damn gun since the Win chester 73.
I'm most awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I've lost my line.
Cut.
Jesus.
Twenty-three takes.
We only stopped because we ran out of film stock.
The War Office wanted him.
The distributors wanted him.
And no one thought to give him a bloody screen test?
"Well, can't we replace him?"
This film has a significant part to play in putting the national case to the American public.
- He's the template.
"- If that lump of Yank stays, the film fails and the national case with it."
He is a brave boy.
Would you or I be so brave?
Is Mr. Baker all right?
- He lost one of his grandsons.
- Oh...
"Higaki, we're counting on you."
- We are counting on you!
- We are counting on you!
Isn't this what idiots say?
Don't be jabbering around me.
Apologize Higaki.
I can't forgive what you said just now.
"If I lose, I'll kneel on the floor to apologize."
"Higaki, you know what you gotta do?"
The day I lose to that chibi is the day I die.
I'm a pro.
Sixth match.
Hyotei's Higaki against Seigaku's Echizen.
You... are the pillar of Seigaku.
"Ah, you don't have to be so bothered, it's just a tennis game."
"But chibi, it doesn't matter what kind of genius you are, I won't give any chances."
I'm the real genius.
A dog that doesn't bite barks the most.
Hoh!
A kid like you wouldn't know.
"Weak, huh."
Love - 15
- Out!
- 15
- All
30 - 15
That fellow.
40 - 15
Game Seigaku.
One game to love.
Seigaku leading.
"Damn kid, dares to look down on me."
"I never thought I'd say this but, I hate strip clubs now."
"Hey, Trent, quit twerking."
Don't look at me while you're twerking!
- Don't look me in the eyes while you're twerking!
- He's looking at me!
Tell me where you pawned Candace's ring please?
Oh the ring.
News flash.
I never pawned it.
- You turned it into a tongue stud?
"- Oh, my God, it's perfect!"
All right.
You're gonna give that diamond back
OK.
"As Matthew McConaughey would never say, all wrong, all wrong, all wrong."
Trent says no.
Trent smells so good.
"OK, OK."
I got this.
I got this.
Come on.
You heard the lady.
- The diamond belongs to Candace.
- What are you gonna do about it guv'ner?
"Well, I think that speaks for itself."
"Sorry, guys."
You're never getting this back.
"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go show my capitalism."
Capitalism's what I call my dong now.
"Hey, Trent."
You're on the main stage in five minutes.
Watch out.
Shit.
"Okay, go to promo."
The breaking news appears to be...
"Higher, higher!"
"...That, ah, for some stupid reason"
I have become the suspect.
"Hey, easy flatfoot."
I am with child.
Ow!
Ten thousand years old...
I can't take this.
"Welcome to ""Ends of Days Exercise."""
"Let's start stretching, shall we?"
Breathe.
And breathe.
Breathe in the darkness and let out the light.
You're letting go of life.
Feel that stretch.
"And now that we are nimble, let's do some cardio."
Start running on the spot.
This is good;
"it makes us feel like we are only 1,000 years old."
Let's get your seven hearts beating.
"Let's get your heartrate to over 3,000 beats per minute."
"Coffee, miss Gablechuck?"
"No, thanks."
So I'm sure you've heard about Heather Weather?
"Yes, that she was murdered."
"No, that she'd been shaving her age."
She's really 62 years old.
"Wh- oh, um..."
I'm not surprised.
What's yourshow tonight?
"Here, this is formaking a Zenne out of me."
You're a natural.
"Take this, idiot."
Go to my apartment and take whatever you want.
I don't need yourfilthy stuff.
Ah OKthen...
Don't you everwear colorless clothes again.
I don't want to see you in white ever again.
I'll miss you too.
Answerthe phone.
Please.
You sneaky little cunt.
"You faggot's daughter, you!"
My brotheris saving himself from you.
Your God left you a cripple.
You're gonna die here all alone.
Dad.
"One, two, three, four..."
"Five, six, seven, eight."
"Ahmet, raise yourarms."
Ahmet?
"Follow him, son."
"Ahmet, raise yourarms..."
"Four, five, six, seven, eight."
And we neverforget to smile.
Abig round of applause.
"That's one, two, three solid leads."
Three.
We'd need 30 private contracts to make up the kind of revenue we're out.
"Hey, we're doing our best here."
And now I'm here.
- So you want money from me?
- Money?
"Earn it, yes."
Together with you guys I wanna earn money.
Work together.
I thought it would work out in a more respectable way but I've been a fool.
"Now, I'm here."
What am I supposed to do?
Play a barrel organ?
"No, I'd rather be a thief."
I did the best I could.
"But that is over, forever."
Even if I lose my head now.
- So that's your new attitude?
- No no no no!
I did the best I could!
Now I'm here and I will stay!
Now you can think about it.
- What are you doing here?
"- Franz, come home please!"
What happened to you?
- What happened to you?
- None of your business!
It's gonna be allright.
Do you really think so?
I've been starving and freezing and it all turned out just fine.
You are Mieze.
I used to be Franz's girlfriend.
I'm Cilly.
I really know nothing about Franz.
You look very pretty.
- Capote.
- Capote?
- Capote.
Sweet tooth.
"Straight-up fag, Mr C."
- Flaming!
"- Thank you, Mr Ricard."
We can now promote you up to kindergarten.
Anybody else?
"Once, twice..."
"Miss Johnson, I apologise if any of this is over your head."
"If you see me after class, I'll give you some chapters."
Anybody?
It's a non-fiction novel.
"Capote mixed true events with things he couldn't know, so he made them up."
He created a new genre.
White folks back then felt safe.
Capote scared them.
He took hardcore crime out of the ghetto and placed it in America's backyard.
That's what makes the book special.
"Yes, that's part of it."
That's all of it.
We got a debate going on now.
Capote wasn't first.
Richard Wright and James Baldwin did the same.
"Wasn't nobody trying to read them, though."
A lot of people read them.
A lot of people like who?
You?
Didn't think so.
"Hey, yo!"
"Mr C, Mr C."
Just hold your horses.
POLICE RADIO:
Something came in for you at 3813 Hanover Lane.
You're to proceed...
Hanover?
That's where I just was.
What the hell is this?
A damn merry-go-round?
[Tires squeal]
[Siren wailing]
[Tires screeching]
"No, this is Burris."
Let me have Detective Donaldson.
"Richard, we got a problem over here at Audrey Matthew's."
"Uh, you better get the boys from the coroners."
"Yeah, that's right."
I don't know yet.
We haven't had a chance to talk.
"Just get on over here, huh."
[Siren wailing]
"Well, girl, what happened?"
Who is she?
Electrocuted.
She was electrocuted in the bathtub.
I know.
I saw.
But how did the curling iron fall into the tub?
There's no shelf or anything above the tub.
It's funny.
"When I saw her, I thought she was healthy."
Saw who?
Who was in there?
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"""
Now just pump the brakes right there.
- I got a question.
- Have at 'er.
Then I got a comment.
"Well, let's hear it, good buddy."
"Now, my question."
"When have you ever heard a girl go,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
- Well...
- Other than in a porno.
- I don't believe I have.
- Me neithers.
That's because we don't say that.
- Well...
- Not unless it's in a porno.
WAYNE:
Now my comment.
"You see, the way Dary did the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's"""
"is not the way they do the ""yes, yes, yes"" in pornos."
That's the way they do it.
"The girl gets all excited, and she goes,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
"Yes, but the way you're doing the ""yes, yes, yes, yes's"""
"is not the way they do the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
DARYL:
It is the way they do it.
"They go, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
- That's exactly how they do it.
- WAYNE:
"No, they don't."
What they do is they find a super-high pitch for those first four yes's.
What a pleasure.
Good to see you.
"Good to see you, Bob."
"Dad, um, do you have a second?"
I want to talk to you about something.
Sure.
Please sit.
¶ not to let it go ¶
"You know, the contest that I won at boarding school..."
It was for drinking...
"Absinthe,"
And that was probably one of my-my tamer nights.
"The truth is I-I've had a pretty wild past,"
And I've been a part of more than one scandal.
"Serena, I don't care about any of that."
¶
I know.
I guess I was just...
Scared that...
"Once mom gets better,"
You...
You may not wanna stick around
If you knew the real me.
¶
"Honey, I want nothing more"
Than to be a part of all of your lives again.
I'm trying to figure out how big a role I can play
Without stepping on anybody's toes.
Yeah.
"You know, I love Rufus..."
But you're my dad.
He's not.
"Now, if somebody comes around your little sister and starts talking like that, you just gonna stand there and smile?"
No.
"You're gonna ask him to stop, which I did."
"And if they don't stop, what?"
You're not gonna do anything?
So are you saying you should not have apologized?
Not the way he's talking.
So that's a yes?
He didn't deserve an apology.
He deserved worse than what I gave him.
I should've messed him up worse.
"And with that latest salvo from Smash Williams, it appears the Dillon Panthers problems are far from over."
"Turn it off, will you, Crowley?"
"Hey, hey, hey!"
Hubby's home.
"How was your day, darling?"
It was...
It was good.
It was good.
"I sold a car, so..."
What?
You did?
Out-freaking-standing!
"Oh, man!"
You did!
Whoa.
"So, what?"
"You're like, you're like a car salesman now."
You're like Willy Loman!
"Yeah, you a salesman, huh?"
Yeah.
I guess I am.
Don't hurt my daughter!
Let her go!
Deepa!
"Had you given the money, you would've saved a life."
"Trying to be a hero, are you?"
Go to hell!
"You moron, I'll kill you!"
If you even think of going to the police...
You will be inviting trouble for yourself.
Deepa.
Varun...
Varun...
Stop.
What happened?
Where were you?
What happened?
Every last piece of gold jewellery bought for the wedding is missing!
I called you N number of times.
Aunt told that you left the house this morning with a bag.
All the jewels are missing.
And you turn up like this now!
What happened?
Mom...
Deepa...
- Her again?
Why bring her up again?
What happened?
Deepa's dad met me yesterday.
He said Deepa was kidnapped and asked for my help.
So...
"So, I took the jewels to save her."
But everything went wrong.
- You haven't invited alfred?
- I'm afraid so.
Do you think it'II be a disaster?
Why do you laugh?
This will be judgement day for George.
She should pay for her sins like any other fallen woman.
She can't avoid everything by being a man.
That's not alfred at all.
This gets better and better.
- Who is it?
- FeIicien MaIIefiIIe.
- He's the children's tutor.
- He can discipline those two savages!
"I wonder where I shall put him, though."
"In George's room, of course."
That's what he's accustomed to.
No!
He is a handsome brute!
How does she merit all these men?
(Marie) He looks angry.
I don't think he appreciated being left behind at Nohant.
- George!
- George!
I'II give you a horse to ride back to the inn.
- There's something I must confess.
- Drat!
We've been seen!
Shit!
(MaIIefiiIIe) George!
"Not that one, monsieur!"
He's a devil!
By God!
Someone has entered valid launch codes.
Captain on deck!
What the hell is going on?
All 24 of our nuclear missiles went live.
This can't be right.
"Sir, we have nuclear missiles spinning up on the Albuquerque."
"If our allies see us launching a full scale nuclear strike, they will respond."
Russia and China will launch.
We'll have World War Ill..
unless you level the White House.
Four minutes to target!
I need a final gonna go for payload delivery.
God forgive me.
Go.
Go!
"Raptor Alpha 1, Operation Free Castle.."
..is a go.
Copy that.
Dropping to attack altitude.
"Cale, Walker's trying to launch a nuclear attack."
"If he does, it'll start World War III."

Cale?
Cale?
Head to the South Lawn!
Almost there.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
I'm gonna enjoy this.
Bandar Abbas.
What?
"We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice."
You gotta be kidding me.
You start there where the road begins.
You finish down there where the road ends.
Holy shoot!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
How long is this gonna take?
"Well, fella does it right, should take him about five days."
Five days?
But I should be in California schmoozing Dinoco right now!
"Then if I were you, I'd quit yapping' and start workin'!"
"- Hook him up, Mater."
- Okay-dokey.
Freedom!
Maybe I should've hooked him up to Bessie and then...
then took the boot off.
Whoo-hoo!
"Goodbye, Radiator Springs, and goodbye, Bessie!"
"California, here I come!"
Yeah!
"Oh, feel that wind."
Yes!
No.
"No, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
Outta gas?
How can I be outta gas?
"Boy, we ain't as dumb as you think we are."
"But how did, how did... you...?"
We siphoned your gas while you were passed out.
- Ka-chow.
- Goodbye.
- Hi!
What faces!
- We were worried.
Knowing you were around here alone...
The town's dangerous.
- It's not Iike milan.
- Not at all.
- Where were you?
- Around.
- Here?
- I was looking for a perfume shop.
"There aren't any here, there's a town store."
- The NannineIIa.
- It's not a perfume shop.
"- If you ask, what'II she say?"
"- ""No, not on yourIife."""
"What can you expect, we're in the South, right?"
"In CasteIIabate, right?"
"And I'm an idiot, right?"
"Darling, wearthis, they might shoot you."
Think she knows?
Get out of my sight.
I tried to tell you the truth so many times!
"- The alcohol, friends, mandolin?"
- What?
"It's true, cholera, threats, ""I sacrifice formy family."""
- I said what you wanted to hear.
- I don't get you.
"We've created a strange magic, it's been better since we separated."
"So, we'II continue being separated."
You have to forget about Chicco and me.

"The same woman, twice, and she died both times, the same woman!"
"Doctor, what are you talking about?"
"Something's going on, something impossible, something..."
"Right, you two stay here, stay right here, don't move an inch."
Are you coming back?
Shouldn't think so!
But where are you going?
"To find her, to find Clara."
Ha-ha-ha!
But Clara's dead.
"What's he talking about, finding her?"
"I don't know, but perhaps the universe makes bargains after all."
Where are you going?
Short cut.
Through there?
I hate this place!
Don't you think it's creepy?
"No, I don't believe in ghosts."
Clara!
Oswin!
Oswald!
Watch me run!
Ha-ha!
Miss me?
Who the hell are you?
I'm the Doctor.
I'm an alien from outer space.
"I'm 1,000 years old."
I've got two hearts.
And I can't fly a plane.
"You're running away with a space man in a box, anything could happen to you."
"You could use your influence, I'm sure."
"And of course, you'd know your secret would be safe with me..."
Servalan.
I'm sure it would.
But I don't submit to blackmail.
There's always a first time.
And it's better than being executed.
"After all, how many people have you killed to conceal your secret?"
You mean now?
Twenty-six... so far.
"You can't afford not to believe me, Avon."
- How the hell did she get off the Liberator?
- I don't know.
"Look, we both saw her."
It was Servalan.
You're just running away from the truth.
"All right, I believe you."
I didn't want her to die like that anyway.
I need... to kill her myself.
- Yablonski.
- Ho.
Hutchinson.
"Hey, Hutch, this is your lucky day."
They finally forwarded this from your old unit.
- I'd glad I got it before I go home.
- Horner.
"Klinger, Maxie."
Mulcahy.
Maxie?
Maxie.
Maxie.
"Yes, your son was saying a similar thing."
Stepson!
I didn't realize that you two were close.
We were talking about the collection.
"I was interested, of course."
"100,000 Euros,up..."
Sorry?
I was just saying... no matter.
Georgina!
Have you seen Dawn and Sophie?
I've lost them.
"No, sweetheart, I haven't."
"I'm sorry, you were interested..."
Are you ready to talk?
You can't do this!
Christos...
You're psychotic!
Maybe.
Give me the bloody key!
"First, tell me..."
Tell you what?
Give me the key.
Give me the fucking key!
Christos...
"What is it, what do you want?"
"Ok, for starters, I have Jeffrey Anderton upstairs eyeing out my collection like it's a fucking yard sale."
Anderton!
Is that what this...
"Fucking idiot, it's called evaluation and you're insane!"
Those are my paintings.
Give me the fucking key!
I met John Brandeis.
"No, they'll think I liked you."
"Thank you, sir."
Bloody silly place to die.
Captain Murray's dead.
Bury him.
"And what then, him?"
"We're lost, aren't we?"
So we'll be heading south towards Lisbon and home.
My orders are we continue north.
What for?
What are we doing up here anyhow?
"Did you ask Major Dunnett or Captain Murray to explain their orders, Harper?"
No.
"But with all due respect, Captain Murray and Major Dunnett were proper officers."
"Now they're dead, there's no shame in going home."
We go north at dawn to Casa Antigua.
"Carry on, Harper."
We've been having a chat.
We?
Me and the lads.
And?
We're not continuing north.
We want to go south.
MEN Aye
- What the hell do I care what you want?
Eh?
who the hell do you think you are Harper?
Do you think the British army is a bloody d-d...?
"Democracy, sir."
Comes from the Greek word demos.
It means...
"Shut up, Harris!"
- She's messing with you.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I kept texting her telling her you insisted we bring something.
- Where is Daddy?
"- He'll be here, a few minutes."
"Which reminds me, I should finish dinner, huh?"
"Luke, would you take our bags up to my room?"
"It's the first one on the left, the one with the Hello Kitty poster."
Allison.
We sleep together.
I'm not gonna be a hypocrite.
"No, no, of course not."
I didn't raise you that way.
It's sweet that you care what I think.
Come on.
"So, what do you think?"
- I think he's really nice.
"- I know, right?"
And cute too?
He's adorable.
"Oh, honey, hand me the meat thermometer, would you?"
I have not made a roast chicken in I can't remember how long.
This thing does not look done.
- This is not...
- Is she here?
"Oh, at 150 at least, don't you think?"
Mom.
When?
Heh.
Tonight.
Are you freaking kidding me?
Tonight?
I found her.
"You know, there's a town car waiting for you at the airport."
I don't need a fancy car.
I just hopped on the bus.
Saved you some money.
So this cruise...
You just happened to have a layover in Seattle?
"Well, I've always wanted to check out the Space Needle."
I understand you can see mount Rainer from the top.
"Oh, really?"
Anything else you want to check out?
You gonna take me or not?
"I got back-to-back surgeries, ma."
You gotta give me a little more notice.
"Yeah, yeah."
I gave birth to five doctors.
I know the drill.
"I can wait, maybe meet your colleagues."
- Is that Mark Sloan?
- Yeah.
Mark Sloan.
"Oh, mrs."
Shepherd.
You look great.
"Oh, damn."
Catch up later?
"Uh, oh, perfect timing."
"Um, mom, this is Meredith."
"Meredith, finally."
Hi.
"My son has been acting like a dog with his favorite bone, hiding you away."
I hope you're free for lunch.
Ah-ha!
Just the man I'm looking for.
Wow.
"Look, a spot just opened up in the lawn dart game"
- In the park.
"- Oh, that is great news!"
"Is what I would say if I could go, but I can't."
What?
"No, we've been waiting for months for this spot!"
You don't think I know that?
I'm the one that put us on that waiting list.
But I can't go because
I've got to wait here for the police to come and arrest me.
Right...
"Well, good luck with that, Baberella."
"Oh, do you want to be on the visitor's list"
In the unlikely event they allow me one?
"- No, I'll just wait for you on the outside."
- OK.
No.
[ Baber sighs. ]
- Hello!
- Oh!
"Hi, sweetie!"
Hi!
Oh!
Uh-oh!
"Cooking turkey bacon again, the gateway meat."
"Well now, some would call it the gateway to heaven!"
"Not Muslims of course, just people who like bacon."
Are you OK?
You seem a little tense.
Thank you.
Vinnie sure likes strange places.
It looks like Monday night in Key Largo.
He's impersonating Mafia.
Vinnie Zapatti's a joke to his uncle but a dangerous joke.
"As far as I'm concerned, they're all dangerous jokes."
Do me a favor and don't write them off just yet.
I said they were dangerous.
Wonder what Vinnie's doing in a place like this?
Wonder what we're doing in a place like this.
- This is it.
- Where's our boy?
- I don't know.
- Think Vinnie had a change of heart?
"If he's a Zapatti, he has no heart."
- Let's go.
- Don't turn around.
"Marybeth, right?"
Who's this?
He's the deputy mayor.
Deputy mayor?
"What do I need you for, then?"
Don't get smart.
I'm the only chance you got.
All right.
Let's go.
This a Searider?
"What, you know boats?"
I worked on a shrimper like this.
This ain't no Searider.
It's a piece of shit.
They call it a Surfrider.
(SYLVIE GASPING)
Athos!
Let me help you.
Where is Grimaud?
Dead.
I shot him.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Show me.
He was there.
I shot him.
He fell right there.
The others are in grave danger.
GUARD:
The Governor is here to see you.
I'm not receiving visitors.
You have not heard what I have come to say.
"When this is over, Philippe, and justice has been served, you'll pay for how I have been treated!"
"I am a son of France, a prince of the blood."
And yet you lock me up here like an animal!
(CHOKING)
(FERON BREATHING HEAVILY)
"It doesn't get any easier, this killing."
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
You better swap clothes with him.
(GROANS)
Hurry.
We don't have much time.
GASTON:
I take it the King doesn't know about this?
No.
You really think it's necessary to go after them?
"If it's the slightest chance they are walking into a trap, yes."
"Dirk, stop right there."
[FIRE ROARS]
"So long, Barry Cook."
You all right?
Barry was my friend.
And I just burned his bones.
"Well, he's at peace now, Sam."
"If Dad had let us stay just a little longer maybe I could have helped the kid, you know?"
You read the coroner's report same as me.
Barry was on every anxiety drug and antidepressant known to man.
School was hell for that kid.
His parents had split up.
He just wanted out.
"It's tragic, but it's not your fault."
"To tell you the truth, I'm glad we got out of that town."
I hated that school.
It wasn't all bad.
"Heh, how can you say that after what happened to you?"
[STUDENTS YELLING]
DEAN:
That kid's dead.
-Dean--
I'm gonna rip his lungs out!
-It's not a big deal.
-Not a big deal?
Look at yourself.
-If Dad was here--
-He's not.
I am.
And as soon as I'm finished with that dick--
"Just shut up, okay?"
-I don't need your help.
Maureen!
Maureen!
Them fish look like mama after she takes her arm vitamins.
"Maureen, get off the goddamn ice!"
You're gonna fall through!
You forgot your pussy!
No!
"Daddy, water!"
"Daddy, water!"
"It's okay, buddy, it's okay."
"Only your butt got wet, what the fuck is wrong with you?"
"He almost drowned as a baby, you heartless whore!"
I did?
"Daddy, Billy kicked me in the eye a little."
Jesus Christ!
"- Daddy, water!"
"Daddy, water!"
- Frank?
"Sue, start the car, we're going to the hospital!"
You're grounded!
Out of my way!
My daughter's bleeding to death!
"Wait for me, Mommy!"
"All right, my daughter needs a doctor right away!"
"Listen, take a seat, fill this out and we'll get to you as soon as we can."
"Oh, no."
"No, no, no, no!"
I don't fill things out.
You fill things out.
She needs a doctor.
"Yeah, how about she waits like the rest of us?"
How about I take the brake off that thing and send you right out into the snow?
Let's just clear some of this.
I'm on pine cone duty.
"To be fair, when we make tents I'm normally the one who just pretends to be busy the whole time."
"Oh, it's good..."
-...that the instructions are in Swedish.
"-Don't need instructions, Liam."
-Here we go.
This is the one we need.
"-Yeah, this is the floor."
What?
You put it through the things or this?
-What you do with this?
"-And this bit goes on there, I think."
Stick the-
- clip the little siIver--
I think we've done the wrong one.
"Looking good, lads."
Because then the other bit goes over the top of it.
"-No, you have to--"
-This is not going very well.
That little hole.
"Oh, there we go."
I've smashed it.
Liam's nearly clocked it in about five minutes.
Has anybody got a hammer?
Where are you making the fire?
Here.
"Oh, thanks, lads."
Yeah.
Cheers.
You're not doing a tepee fire?
"Listen, forget what they taught you in Scouts."
"Bitey-bitey, eyes shut tighty!"
Oh.
"Hi, Dad."
"Don't you 'hi, Dad' me, you little prick."
What did I say?
What's the one thing I told you to do?
Floss?
Keep your nut down!
I did!
"So why, for Sphinx's sakes, is there not one, but two protests going on outside that door?"
"The Professor did that, not me."
"Well, hang on..."
And why are you chucking apples at some geezer strapped to a column?
Aurelius.
"Great to meet you, sir."
Love the beard.
It's jugball.
It's...
"He invented it, it was all him."
"Finally, he admits it!"
I couldn't give a pharaoh's fat one.
I've only come here cos I've been contacted by the bloody Emporium.
"You've spent 15,420 dinaris, and mostly on caviar."
"That wasn't me, I promise."
Right.
"Tutankhamen, give me the bleeding card back."
I don't know where it is.
I haven't seen it since I gave it to...
"Oh, brilliant."
"Have you got my card, boy?"
"Mm, yeah."
"Give it back, then, fuck face."
"- Huh, that's sweet."
"It's pathetic, but sweet."
"- Yeah, that's my niche... pathetic and sweet."
Hmm.
What?
No.
Mom!
"I don't know, maybe."
"Okay, I love you, too."
And say hi to Daddy.
What?
How old are you?
- Seventeen.
- What?
!
Really?
You don't go to school?
I used to.
I got kicked out.
"Of Corona, Matre Day, and even Newport Union."
"After that, my parents had enough, said, ""Go away, get a job, move out,"" which I did."
"I got my own studio on the numbered streets, and I work here, and I've never been happier."
- Yeah?
This is you happy?
"- Look, you barely earned these, but..."
"Hey, right on."
Thanks.
Ah!
"All right, Summer's going to be very stoked."
On-on the band.
"I hear they're really good live,and I think the best thing for our friendship, is like, a good, live, band."
"As a girl, I feel I should probably warn you, that this whole little game you're planning, she's gonna see right through it."
Watch out!
Look out!
Mater?
Mater!
Mater!
"Hey, take it easy, Mater!"
Oof!
Yee-hee!
He's nuts.
No need to watch where I'm goin'.
Just need to know where I've been.
"Whoa, that was incredible!"
How'd you do that?
Rearview mirrors.
"We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want."
"Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race."
"What's so important about this race of yours, anyway?"
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!
I've been dreaming about it my whole life!
I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it.
"And when I do, we're talkin' big new sponsor, with private helicopters."
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.
What's wrong with rusty old cars?
"Well, I don't mean you, Mater."
I mean other old cars.
You know?
- Not like you.
I like you.
"- It's OK, buddy."
"Hey, you think maybe one day I can get a ride in one of them helicopters?"
Filip!
He's not here either.
I found him!
"Here, quickly!"
Come on!
Help!
Let's bring him outside!
I couldn't extinguish it.
I think I might have given too big a dose.
Let me go!
Departure is in one hour.
Greetings to you all.
"- What is it, please?"
- A contemporary custom.
There.
I have a surprise for you.
A cake!
Right!
With Nasper-cream!
And that's not all!
The best is yet to come.
Watch and wonder!
"This is Adam Bernau's violin, about which he wrote in the Memoirs, that it was his companion throughout his entire childhood."
It's so moving to think that I'll have the chance to see the living Adam Bernau in less than 2 hours.
And on his 11th birthday.
I hope we'll only be there for 4 hours.
It seems unreal.
"When my parents boarded the spaceship, that seemed so unbelieveable too."

Depends.

"Relax, Jack Lalanne."
It's low-cal.

"No, no."
Not the ingredients.
The something extra.
"Chill, man."

What kind of supplements?
Sam:
Here.

Do you remember this guy?
(man #1) Hell of a man.
"Sure,I remember him."
Did he ever ride in your cab?
"[chuckles] 20, 40 times."
Who knows?
"He was a cab rider, strictly cab rider."
"Yeah, he didn't drive?"
Never.
He used to sit in front.
He sat in front?
"Oh, yeah."
Really?
Yeah.
"That was your dad, world-famous architect."
"Yeah, that was your father."
Do you remember him at all?
"(man #2) A little bit, vaguely."
Did he ever ride in your cab?
Vaguely.
He loved the women.
"Not the young ones, but he loved the women."
-- Do you remember what he looked like or
(man #1) His face was pointed.
"Yeah, and his hair was-- his hair was, you know, very thin, like a blond."
Like a what?
(man #1) Like it was blond.

"Oh, blond, uh-hu"
- Yes.

The source of the Nile is in Abyssinia.
Is it?
Interesting.
- How do you do?
Edward Ferrars.
- Margaret Dashwood.
"It adjoins this property, and would be a desirable addition."
- I'll ride there and speak to...
- Gibson.
- He'll be pleased enough to sell.
- He'll want more than it is worth.
Have I hurt you?
Thank you.
Forgive me.
That was my father's favourite.
Thank you for helping Margaret.
She's changed since you came.
I enjoy her company.
- Has she shown you the tree house?
- Not yet.
"Would you do me the honour, Miss Dashwood?"
- It is very fine out.
- With pleasure.
- Margaret always wanted to travel.
- I know.
She's off to China soon.
"I'm to go as her servant, on the understanding I'll be badly treated."
- What will your duties be?
- Sword fighting and swabbing.
Which will take precedence?
"W-Well, you see..."
Would you like some food?
It's my mum's birthday today.
She's even got lots of food stalls.

"Hold on, you two."
We can't go about accepting handouts.
"I'm King Pilaf, you know?"
Aw...
Oh well.
"If you say so, Pilaf-sama..."
Is that so?
Okay then.
Y-You fools.
You're too obedient.
How about going against my orders sometimes and bringing me back a bit?
.
It's all tasty.
"Well, if you insist, I guess I'll have to eat it."
Delicious.
You two dig in as well.
Pilaf-sama.
Even 150-fold gravity has outlived its purpose...
"Excuse me, Vegeta-sama?"
Leave.
You're interrupting my training.
"B-Bulma-sama called, she wants you to come to her birthday party."
Just go away already.
Tell her I'm not going to any such thing.

"What's going on in that head of yours, not coming to your pretty wife's birthday party?"
We didn't even get the Joni Mitchell.
"Oh, don't, yeah."
Food and Drink.
"Food and Drink, OK."
I can tell you you will be looking for cocktails.
You have ten seconds to confer.
OK!
Single word ones.
Single ones...
"Mojito, screwdriver..."
Erm...
Time's up.
I didn't hear a lot of cocktails there.
Are you not big cocktail drinkers?
They are.
These two love them!
But we like two-word cocktails!
That's a bit inconvenient then.
Yeah!
"Simon, in the middle, we're going to start with you."
"You have 45 seconds, remember those passes."
You're looking for cocktails.
Reveal the hive.
Mojito.
"Mojito, correct."

Screwdriver.

"Oh, you are locked out of the hive!"
"With 32 seconds left to go, and two passes to go!"
"You wanted to get screwdriver there, but you can't quite get it, because there's no R. Bad luck."
You've got one point for mojito.
- Yup.
I love this.
"- Ari, you look sexual."
- You were right there the whole time.
- We were so close.
- You really do.
- We were so close.
- You really do.
You look drunk but great.
"Pete, you can really tell how much you love New York with these shots."
And it's sexy.
Sexy at the same time.
- NY.
- Sexy NY.
I do love New York.
"I think it's part of what makes the film, you know, special."
- Absolutely.
- Or specialer.
"But look at these shots, you can tell you're a New Yorker and you love it."
Does anyone remember this reference?
- No.
- It's the fifth lady.
- What?
- What is that?
Wanna know what that's a reference to?
"Sex and the City, when it was over all the girls, they were always talking backstage about the show."
"And they were like, ""New York, it's the fifth lady."""
Didn't Kim Cattrall play New York?
But it is.
It's like in this.
"New York is, like, the biggest character."
That's true.
But please don't be sad.
It isn't your fault.
"Hey everyone at my funeral, you don't have to be sad."

"I wanted to talk to you again, even as just a friend."
Shit!

So the doctor told you not to die.

I am sorry.
I surrender.
"But you won't forgive me, right?"
Goodbye everyone.

It isn't even beautiful.
Hello Peng.
Hey you.
Don't call me a douchebag.
But your job isn't finished.
Just a little more.
I asked Lisa to send one day late.
She's like a guy.
What more could you ask for?
- I'm telling her I'm with you.
- No.
"Michael, what are you doing?"
Don't tell her you're out with me.
"No, I'm gonna screw it up."
I can't lie.
You're both gonna hate me forever.
Leave me out of it.
- I have faith in you.
- No.
Come here.

Come here.
"Michael, Michael."
"Hey, Michael, come here a second."
My boss said to tell you that there's this guy who really wants to buy this thing coming by tomorrow.
But he is full of shit.
"I mean, I've worked here for three years."
You're the first people I ever showed it to.
"Smoked a lot of weed in there, though."
It's good for that.
- Hello.

Okay.
I called the ambulance and the fire volunteers.
I gotta go.
Chris is moving into Kenny's?
"I think so, so they can, like, figure some stuff out."
I don't get it.
"- Total shock, which I love."
"- I'm like, ""Wait."
"What?"""
- What's happening?
- Wait a minute.
What?
"- ""Why are you grabbing on me?"" - ""What's going on?"""
There was previously a scene there with Mike and a transvestite.
- You can catch that on the DVD too.
"- Oh, yeah, I forgot about that."
- In the deleted scenes.
- That's what I was recovering from.
"Are most of the scenes that are deleted on there, or did you pick and choose?"
We got a great scene with Kat and Jesus.
We've got Trannie Tris.
- Thank God.
- Trannie Tris.
- All the oldies but goodies are there.
- Do you say:
"- ""When I say 'Jesus' you say 'Christ""'?"
- That's in there.
Yes.
- That was fun.
- Yup.
Do you have the bathroom scene at the?
In the Catholic school.
Is that in there?
"- No, I'm afraid not."
- No.
"- That was kind of omitted, right?"
"- Oh, God."
- That was fun.
I've only seen him a few times...
Why?
You think this is related to the murder case?
Maybe.
I began to believe that two of victims were part of a Satanic cult.
What?
We found another body few days ago...
Same M.O. The victim was completely drained of blood...
But there were bite marks on the victim's neck.
Small ones.

"Don't lie to me, Elizabeth."

I'm sorry.

"The policeman, did he see you?"

I had to get out of there.

Max!
"[Wolf whistles] Ya look great, kid."
- Ya look sensational.
- [Barks]
[Gasps]
- [Pants] - [Sebastian mutters]
[Barks]
[Eric] Max!
Max!
"- Quiet, Max."
- [Barks]
And then what?
"The old bag, fit for Ziegfeld Follies."
Aglaé!
To keep her happy I should have been equipped with the obelisk of Luxor.
- Mary
- I'm speechless!
- What are you up to?
I didn't hear you come in.
This gentleman let me in.
- Will you join us in the lounge?
- I'm heading for the kitchen.
Idiot.
André's got guts.
He does love me.
I'm sure he prefers me to his mother.
I share him so I can act better in the play.
Do you understand?
You've no right to judge me!
You've got too much fog in your head for that!
At last!
It's okay.
He's clean.
"Hey, St. Fruitcake, do you have news from Mickey for Mary?"
- I don't know where he is.
- Same as Mary...
You've come to join the winning team?
I've been telling you that he would find me.
He's my puppy.
Like my sweet little brother!
He knows about tomorrows.
"I'll give you your tomorrows, but hands off my today!"
"Mary got back her ticket, but for a price."
"Mom, Dad, you did all the hard work getting me through high school."
You deserve a gift.
But what do you get the Cadillac of parents?
A Rolls-Royce.
"Oh, my goodness!"
How did you afford that?
"- It was only $2,000."
- Huh.
"Judge Thompson, from the club,"
- got me into a police auction.
- Huh.
"If I had 40 more dollars, you'd be looking at a speedboat."
"So, what do you think?"
It's... it's wow.
- Right?
!
"- I loved the macaroni necklace he made me in first grade, and I even used the perfume he gave me in fifth grade, but this car is so gaudy."
People are gonna think I played for the Knicks in the '70s.
It's the most beautiful gesture
- I have ever seen.
- (car door opens)
It's 100% class.
"Hey, Mom, didn't you say you had some errands to run?"
Oh.
I... in a little while.
"Uh, yeah."
"But... um, gosh, it's got fur."
Wow.
It's like driving a lion.
"Hey, before you go, give us a honk."
All right.
"(horn honks to the tune of ""We're in the Money"")"
Who do you think you are?
- You can't treat those boys like animals.
- I'll treat them any way I like.
"- And if you don't like it, you can leave."
- I will.
"But I warn you if I can get to the authorities, you haven't heard the end."
"Miss Griffith, I demand your resignation immediately."
And you can have it.
- I've been waiting for that.
- Yeah.
Come in.
"- Hello, Miss Griffith."
"- Hello, Jimmy."
- Going somewhere?
- Yes.
Where you going?
I'm leaving.
You're kidding.
"No, I'm not."
First Patsy and then you.
"I'm not quitting you, Jimmy."
I've been fired.
Thompson fired me.
What?
Jimmy.
"Quite a delegation of our boys to see you, chief."
A delegation?
- What do they want?
"- I don't know, sir."
- How did they--?
- They got a hold of Walters.
He seemed a little scared and he told them they could see you.
He didn't.
It was my idea.
I knew she needed a transplant.
"You can arrest me now, detective."
I'm ready to go.
"Detective Munch brought you here tonight, didn't he?"
He is in a lot of trouble.
He did it for me.
I would never say that in court.
Read my lips carefully.
John Munch never came to your apartment tonight.
He never brought you here.
"In fact, you don't even know where this place is."
You got it?
Yes.
Detective Stabler.
What are you doing here?
- Have you arrested Mr. McGovern?
- Yes.
What's gonna happen to him?
Have to hand him over to the FBI.
He'll probably go to prison.
For trying to save his son's life?
Because he bought that kidney.
He had no choice.
His son will die without it.
I know why he did it.
But...
There's nothing I can do.
"I gave you Dr. Swan's name, because I was afraid to die."
"If Kyle McGovern dies,"
I'll live with that the rest of my life.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
"Ugh, this is such a lame disappointment."
All this hype and then nothing.
"It's like everyone saying, ""Go see The Blair Witch Project,"" right?"
Hey!
Are you listening?
"What'd you expect, Noah?"
"Some giant neon sign flashing ""Piper was... here""?"
Uh...
"Hey, um..."
"Let's jet, okay?"
Before someone else shows.
Someone else!
You're a genius.
That's why the lock was broken.
"'Cause someone else got here first, right?"
Someone who didn't want anyone to find whatever was in here.
"So, that means there was definitely something to find."
Right?
- Oh!
What do we have here?
"- Hey, hey!"
You can't just take that.
- It might be there for security.
‭
"- First, this is new."
"Second, that thing over there is for security."
Someone's been keeping an eye on this place.
Maybe Eddie...
- Who's Eddie?
"- Ugh, the Crescent Palms guy."
Come on.
-She kissed me.
-That makes me feel so much better!
-lt didn't mean anything!
-The hug or the kiss?
-Neither.
-lt meant your arms around her body.
-lt meant her tongue in your throat.
"-Well, it was her tongue- l don't wanna hear this!"
-Sorry.
Stop.
-Let go of me.
-Just listen to me.
Why should I?
You lied to me.
-l didn't think it would happen again.
-You were wrong.
-l didn't want to embarrass her.
"-What are you talking about, Pacey?"
This your boss hitting on you.
"If you wanted to stop it, you could have."
And you didn't because you like it.
You are attracted to her and-- lt's really obvious to me.
"If you didn't want her to hit on you, why didn't you quit?"
Because maybe I need this job.
I'm not exactly rolling in money here.
I can't afford a place to live.
I'm not a rich college girl who can quit when the mood strikes me.
That's cool.
You know what?
"Screw the girl, keep your job."
Have your cake and eat it too. lt's fine!
You're still here.
Sorry.
I don't know the lady.
"Oh, well, it doesn't matter."
I'm trying to locate a Mr. Pierce.
I don't suppose you know him.
"Not intimately, but I do know of him."
"And from what I've heard, I suggest you check at the bar."
Thanks.
Sorry I couldn't help you.
Don't give it a thought.
"I'd like a messenger sent to Mr. Julian Kirk's home, please."
5963 Mandolin Road in Bel Air.
"To a Miss Lenore Adams, Village Motel on Lankershim Boulevard."
Room number 32.
"Yes, that's in North Hollywood."
"I'd like your fast service on that, please."
20 minutes?
That's fine.
[door opens]
"[laughter, chatter]"
Blue Streak.
It's all ready for you.
You made good time.
Not much traffic this late.
That'll be 4 bucks.
Sounds like a party at the big house.
You ought to try reading with that racket.
You ought to crash it.
Bet there's nobody sober enough to even notice.
Keep the change.
Much obliged.
Good night.
"The train goes down, goes around Lake Waste Water, and comes right back."
"It should back in 15 minutes, so we should just jump on it."
But when is Ethan gonna stop by the Juice Caboose with his next delivery?
Let me check my watch.
In exactly... 15 minutes!
This is gonna be close.
Mmm.
Speak to me.
You're hiding from me.
I'll find you.
Ooh...
"You have got a lot goin' on here, girl."
Ugh.
"Ah, there you are."
A California Central Coast Syrah.
"Okay, Bobby."
Now you taste your wine.
This one is probably...
wine.
I would say red.
Or it could be white.
I'm also realizing that I'm not as good at this as I thought I'd be.
"No, you're not."
"Chablis is a wine, right?"
You guys aren't answering me.
I'm gonna say that's a good sign.
I'm going with Chablis.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Bobby."
You're not good at this.
Poor Bob.
"I can't see your sad, pathetic face right now, but I bet it's crying."
I'll tell you what.
Have you got money?
This is most important.
No worries.
What do you think?
Walk!
Get on your knees!
It's funny...
Are you deaf?
OK!
Take me back to Paris to talk with Jorkalom and you'll money!
"That's what we've done already, and you blew it."
"Listen, I..."
Are you still ga and missed!
"No, no!"
Jorkalu gonna go away.
Say He'll not joking.
"That we will kill you within the next time and throw in his backyard, in front of his wife and children!"
Here we go.
Look at this!
I think I found Thomas Riffauta.
Let's see.
I think this is it.
"No permanent residence. 1.72 m, few sentences, but nothing serious..."
That's him.
He was with Sophie Mazerat and Hugo Rozier.
They were there when the bomb Rozierovim exploded in his hands.
I just saw him in that neighborhood with a black guy.
-Kidding.
I saw him in the squat!
Maybe just buy drugs.
Where did you get his name?
From Joséphine Karlsson.
- Then what's in Algeria?
- Nothing.
But you just started to say something about Algeria.
Nothing.
We were kids in Algeria.
I don't remember a thing.
Everyone only asks about her.
"""Pretty Jonah, pretty Jonah."" What about me?"
Why don't you ask about me?
What if I'm sick?
Are you sick?
"And where's your husband, Dorona?"
Why isn't he there?
And why don't you let your father mourn with you?
Was it nice of you to throw apples at him?
Did you hear that?
I'm going to bed.
I'm going to shower.
I'm going to die.
What now?
Nothing-Count me out-.
"I'm an orphan, I don't want to be a bastard, too."
What's up?
- Is Natanel here?
"- Yeah, over there."
Do you always have to be late?
I have a teachers' meeting.
- You brought water from home?
- Yeah.
Happy?
"Watch what you breathe, the air here isn't kosher."
"Cut the religious crap, Natanel."
I don't believe such a place exists.
Where is this?
What are you talking about?
The city.
We're not allowed to go to the city.
In the city there are no rules.
"Everything is possible, and everything is available for a price."
"Lucky for us, our needs are small."
What are our needs?
T o see a woman naked.
Let me see the money.
"Come on, let me see the money."
The money.
Let me see the money.
The money.
Keep it moving.
"Come on, come on, give me the money."
"All right, come on."
Keep it running smoothly.
Looks beautiful on you.
Give me the money.
Thank you.
That sure is a lot of milk money.
"Kevin, some things are more important than milk, all right?"
"Well, what do you need all this money for, anyway?"
"Oh, we're going to buy a pros thetic leg."
For his dog.
His dog lost his leg.
"So, what'd you tell your dad?"
I said I was eating at Kevin's house.
I said I was eating at Brad's house.
I said I was eating at Frank's house.
I'm done.
♪
You done?
YOU DONE?
!
(metal scraping)
"So you're done, eh?"
(hacking)
(spitting)
You done now.
Go on!
CLANG!

There's no way!
Take a seat.
Let's see...
Posession of marijuana with intent to traffic...
"Certainly not original, eh?"
"Look, I've already told you, I got it from my mates, alright?"
I wasn't trafficking anything.
"But, you're the only one here right now, aren't you?"
"Now, the drugs we can plea out, that still leaves the theft over for the joyriding."
"Oh, come on, really-"
- That's rubish!
"I mean, that's Rudy's father's car!"
"Well, you took his Mercedes without his consent."
"Last time I looked, that's a crime, Mr St. Clair."
"Mr. Irving, will he have to go to jail?"
"Well, likely."
"Since Mr St. Clair took it upon himself to fail to appear, twice."
Worst case scenerio?
Two years.
He just wants to show off.
Give me 30 of that!
How much is it?
- 15 Mark.
- 15...
"Here, 20 for you."
Keep the change.
"Give me something to drink, I'm quite thirsty."
Life is just wonderful!
"Ah, Reinhold!"
Let me introduce you:
this is my friend Casanova from Casanova.
Make room for him!
Meet these 3 beauties from Pankow.
"Move over, I wanna talk to my friend."
"Reinhold, it's always a pleasure to see you."
No you gotta put him on a radiotor to warm him up.
What's the matter with you?
Don't get mad at them.
"Go away, children, go!"
"I tell you, women are trouble."
"But at home, I have a wonderful one."
A gem!
Then why don't you bring her along?
You better leave the woman you love at home.
They're just too curious.
Now what?
"They do nothing but steal and cheat, these criminals!"
- Criminals?
- And Franz is starting to scare me too.
Franz?
He was in jail already.
- Sorry.
I think I took the last one.
And the bread?
All we have are the ends.
This is like The Hunger Games.
"You do know those books aren't actually about food, right?"
"Sorry, guys, I'll hit the market today, I promise."
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Are we out of... ?
- Everything!
"- Bacon, we've got bacon."
Have some bacon.
Come on.
I made it last night.
I want everybody home for family dinner tonight.
- Five p.m. Yes?
- Wrestling won't be done...
- What about dance?
- Do I hear six p.m.?
Anybody?
"I have work, I was just gonna eat there with Daphne."
But I will eat here instead.
"Um, I'm supposed to go to the batting cages with Connor."
"Batting cages, as in baseball?"
"Yeah, Connor and his dad go all the time."
And they invited me.
"I think that's great, sweetheart."
I never knew you were a baseball guy.
I haven't really played that much.
"But who knows, maybe I'm really good."
"- Yeah, maybe."
"Ifyou don't tell me whereJeffrey is, this is your funeral."
Throw this garbage away.
- Give me the money!
- Are you sure you still got bullets?
You wanna bet?
"Jeffrey said, always save one last slug."
"Either foryourself, oryour enemy."
Hurry!
Turn around!
Goddamn it!
Get him!
Promise me one thing:
"If I don't make it, take me to a hospital."
Have them save my corneas forJenny.
Ifthat's impossible... organize my money and send her abroad for surgery.
Don't think like that.
It's the first decent thing I've ever done.
Will you help me?
What's that noise?
"Who is it,Jeffrey?"
Sidney.
Here's your money.
I fought for it like a man.
This is my last tribute to a friend.
"Sidney, you didn't have to do this."
He said I was a dog.
Now I'm not sure if I'm human or a dog.
"Sidney, nobody can call you a dog."
Sidney!
Sidney!
Sidney!
Am I a dog?
- Who's on first?
- Sick one.
Frank Chambers.
"Forty years old, severe chest trauma when a walkway fell."
Wrecking-ball crane collapsed.
"BP, 80 systolic, but headed the wrong way."
"Tachy 120, denies LOC."
Crepitus on right side.
Page Surgery.
"- Mr. Chambers, can you talk?"
- Hurts too much.
He thought his ribs were broken.
- You are?
- His secretary.
Sustained a facial lac and chest pain but refused treatment.
- You need to be examined.
- After.
He's decreased on the left.
- Let's hear it.
- I've heard it since Michigan Avenue.
"Ken Ambrose, 34, tib-fib fracture with dislocation."
F. D. had to lift a flower shop off his leg.
Not a shop.
It's a kiosk!
"- Abdomen's soft, non-tender."
"- Vitals normal, tachy at 120 with a liter in."
- Gave him ten of MS.
- Don't touch!
It hurts!
"Okay, bear with us."
We'll give you something.
"- Oh, God!"
I took care of his...
Why did you want to kill Serena?
I didn't... get...
Why?
Hey.
"Hey, hey."
"Listen, look at me."
Look at me.
Why such a frowny face?
We just beat fate's ass to the ground.
Guy on the motorcycle...
"DeBray could have a partner, and the partner could have shot him to stop him from talking."
"Hey, Cupcake!"
Tell the lady what you just told me.
We tracked the bike.
Registered to a David Loquasto.
He was in here earlier today to I.D. the jewelry.
His sister was the fifth victim.
I've never seen either of these.
"We couldn't stop the man who killed his sister, so he took care of it."
See?
"You still holding me, Captain?"
Case closed.
What'd I tell you?
Not a partner.
Revenge.
My baby's gonna live.
Yeah.
Long enough to turn into a teenager and make you wish otherwise.
Don't forget about Mimi.
She didn't die.
No.
Black.
Damn it!
What do you want?
"You're on leave, and the Gunzel case is closed."
Gunzel was no serial killer.
Not in the usual sense.
He was filling orders.
And not just for Hiromitsu.
Orders?
From whom?
Someone called lrezumi.
There are collectors...
Gunzel was just the tip of the iceberg.
There are others...
- Schrader!
Gunzel was in prison.
He couldn't have committed every murder.
If it was murder!
All 12 people with a Hiromitsu are reported dead or missing.
Come on.12
Has Gunzel's death been made public?
Tomorrow.
- We have to stop it.
Until we knowwho's behind it.
We?
"- Yeah, I wanna work the case again."
What's the lawyer's name?
Schoubya.
Frank Schoubya.
"Call me by my first name, since we're spending time together again."
I'll clear things with my superiors.
I got him!
You don't want to end upNlike Aunt lmogene.
do you?
No.
So you'll marry Hamish. and your life will be perfect.
It's already decided.
dear.
I'll leave you to it.
just you and me?
Do you know what I've always dreaded?
The decline of the aristocracy?
Ugly grandchildren.
But you're lovely.
You're bound to produceNlittle...
Imbeciles!
The gardeners haveNplanted white roses when I specifically asked for red.
You could always paint the roses red.
What an odd thing to say.
You should know that my sonNhas extremely delicate digestion.
(RUSTLlNG )
-Did you see that?
N-See what?
I think.N-Nasty things.
I do enjoy setting the dogs on them.
Nhe could get a blockage.
(RUSTLlNG )
Did you see it that time?
-See what?
N-The rabbit.
Don't shout.
pay attention.NHamish said you were easily distracted.
-What was I saying?
N-Hamish has a blockage.
Tomorrow?
"Tomorrow, can I sleep in your basement?"
Can you drop me at the office?
All my stuff is there.
Because that's where you're sleeping?
Yeah.
And I've got some business that I have to take care of in the morning.
"You know, he's right."
Wasserman.
"About you and I, this connection."
Yeah.
Hi.
"Oh, is Sophie asleep?"
-It's like 12:30.
Yeah.
"- Dr. Storper was right,"
- I don't have a fear of flying.
- Ok?
"He thought it was a symptom, but not the cause."
"He didn't know what the cause was, but I know now."
- Ok?
- I have a fear of losing you...
I have a fear of losing you.
Here.
Thanks.
"See, the flying triggered a panic reaction because it was taking me away from you."
The real life stuff has been taking me away from you.
We talked about this.
We did that on purpose.
I wanna be with you and Sophie.
I wanna help you with her.
"I wanna live here, marry you even, if you're into that."
- So I'll call you?
- All right.
- Is Stanislav at his work?
- Yes.
Too bad you didn't bring Irishka.
I've missed her so much!
Your glasses gave me a fright.
Thought something's wrong with your eyes.
"No, I'm all right."
"To hell with them, take them off!"
"Here, Shurka sent you a note."
She had a baby at last!
A swell boy!
Could hardly deliver him.
It's about dress patterns.
And she wants a necklace for the New Year.
"- Here, have an apple."
"- I don't want it, mama."
"- What about you, young man?"
- Merci.
What's the matter with you?
"Oh, what are you doing, mama?"
Why did you have to smear it all?
I smeared it all!
Goodbye!
"The general, we rode together."
Handsome man!
Came to inspect exercises.
And in my compartment was the chief engineer of a fishing factory!
About my age.
"I nicknamed him ""a man with a mustache""."
He got a mustache like a cube!
"Well, you can't."
You can't just ask her like that.
- Why not?
"- It would be terribly rude, asking someone if money is theirs."
That would be so embarrassing!
"Rubbish, Basil."
"Hello, Fawlty Towers."
Polly Sherman?
"Yes, certainly, I'll get her straightway."
Hang on.
Polly!
"Terry, where's Polly?"
In there.
- She saw you with the money!
- What?
She saw you counting the horse money!
She's just coming...
"oh, hello, dear."
Here she is.
Found her in here.
"As I was just saying, Polly, my wife would like a word with you about a slightly delicate matter."
"It's not delicate, Basil."
Don't be silly.
He thinks it's embarrassing for me to ask you about that money I saw you with earlier on in the office.
I wondered if someone had handed it in.
Mrs. Richards has lost some.
The money?
In the office?
"You were counting it, weren't you?"
Did someone hand it in?
"Oh, no."
"No, it's mine."
-Start with the truth.
The super saw you leave her apartment before water came through the ceiling.
Let me ask you a question.
What question did you just ask me?
What was the question you asked me?
When the last time you saw her was.
"I told you the last time that I saw her alive, right?"
"-When I saw her after, she was dead."
"-Why didn't you call it in then, Mike?"
I had a couple of changes of clothes and shaving stuff in the apartment.
Where's the stuff now?
"It's in my locker, John."
Couple of shirts and some shaving stuff.
"Come on, let's go."
SlPOWlCZ:
Come on.
KELLY:
Let's go take a look.
"Beautiful, beautiful."
Great.
That's beautiful.
Embarrass me in front of the department.
Great!
-Nobody's gonna embarrass you.
ROBERTS:
"Yeah, right."
-What's it look like?
-l don't know.
-He deny the super's story?
-Says he was there after she died.
-Only time he was there.
-Believe him?
It's Dave and Sharon's engagement party.
That's what I'm saying.
"Obviously, we don't report it tonight."
There is a dead fucking st-rotting corpse in the storage unit.
You can't smell anything as long as we keep the door closed.
Wow.
It's been down there a week.
What's one more day?
Uh-uh.
Look.
"We let the party happen, we look at tomorrow's photo... and if it shows the cops taking our testimony and shit, I'll call 'em myself."
I have to admit.
I am kind of curious to see one more photo.
All right.
Fine.
One day.
But... one day.
(MUSIC)
- What time is it?
- Twenty till.
"Well, just in case tomorrow's photo shows the end of the world-"
(INHALES) I'm going to enjoy myself.
Do you want to dance?
And he adopts his classic glazed-over look.
What?
(CROWD CHEERING)

"(BULB POPS, WINDS DOWN)"
Hmm.
You son of a bitch.
(MUSIC)
"-Yes, sir."
-You got the cigars?
"-Yes, sir."
"Now, you boys have done a darn good job."
"Uh, uh..."
what's your number again?
"-Uh, 43, sir."
-43.
-Your number?
"-27, sir."
27.
"You take care of me, I'm gonna take care of you."
You boys may be used to deadbeats but not in this corner.
"You're in good shape, I'm taking good ca..."
"On the double, walk, hup, hup!"
"Here we go, hup, hup!"
"All right, now, look."
BELLHOP:
"Big doings tonight, eh, sir?"
We're going to have a big-time reunion-- my old squad coming.
-Yes...
"-These poor souls never lived before, like I'm going to show 'em."
"-Look, uh..."
"-Yes, sir."
No reason why I can't shack 'em up here.
No use in them getting a room.
"What the management don't know won't hurt 'em, you know?"
"-Get that stuff out of the bag, will you, kid?"
"-Yes, sir."
I tell you what I have to have done.
A lot of things have to be done real quick.
"You're doing a good job, kid."
Put the web cam in on.
I will watch it all.
- Done brother-in-law.
"Bring faster, like a bride!"
My friends arrived!
Hi..
"Hi, buddy.."
- Hi dude.
Happy marriage anniversary!
- Thank you!
Come.
All these are my childhood friends.
Hello.. hi.
"You would have passed Degree, by the age they were in diapers, right brother-in-law?"
"Do not search for logic, you will miss magic."
Happy wedding anniversary Tukaram sir.
- Thank you very much..
Our Vasundhara madam has sent this gift for you.
Oh..
Thank you.
Take and keep this inside.
"Madam, this is your marriage day."
Can we see your marriage album?
That is..
Album got burnt in the fire accident.
"Buddy, let us start the party."
"- PK must come, right?"
"You mean PSPK, Is Pawan Kalyan coming for the party?"
[PSPK:
PowerStarPawanKalyan]
It is not PSPK who is coming.
"Just PK, my friend."
FINN:
Maybe.
Or-
Or what?
The camera took a picture ahead of time?

"Oh, yeah, right."
Thursday.
Friday we went to the movies.
"Saturday we lost power, used candles."

Monday.
"That's tonight, Tuesday."
Tomorrow.
Bullshit.
"Mr. ""B"" invented a camera that takes pictures of the future, and he only used it to look in our apartment?"
Doesn't make any sense.
"Well, maybe he's testing it."
"Yeah, and this thing isn't exactly portable."
"Well, he's a scientist, so there's got to be some sort of logs or documentation somewhere."
It was he who arrested 10 years ago following a settling of drug-related.
That's him.
All 2 at the height of summer was messed 10 pairs godasses.
It must have cost money...
- Matsuda!
That's not the problem!
- But yes!
"This is not money, but their legs !"
We can do nothing without money !
It was an expensive summer.
"M. Yagami, you got it!"
Congratulations.

You will see
"I'll have your skin too, you'll see"
- You heard.?
You'll see!

The hospital contacted us
Your wife goes wrong dot

"You've been called many times, why not come to you?"
Mom!

Mom
- Dad!
Why is he nosing' around?
"Oh, great."
Goons and government.
That's big time.
"That's mob, Thomas."
"Rick, I am not jumping to any conclusions."
just 'cause it looks like... just cause it looks like he is a government witness.
Whoa.
Roger's a mob stool pigeon?
"Bullets flying' all over the place, and you got a race?"
"You really believe her, huh?"
Rick!
"Okay, okay."
"I told you I'd check it out, and, Thomas, I will check it out."
"Um, Thomas, listen."
I thought after the race I'd throw a little celebration.
Like a congratulation gesture.
"Yeah, yeah."
Just us guys.
Yeah.
And maybe a couple of TV reporters.
"You know, a human interest story."
Get a little publicity for T.C.
"You know, war buddy helps pal."
Yeah.
TV reporters.
"And how about some wire service stringers,"
"Rick and a couple of photographers, Life Maga..."
Thomas?
Thomas.
"Magnum, it's here."
Ta-da!
"He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me."
What are you talking about?
Where's that bonding strip?
"And another thing, stop with this spaceman thing!"
It's getting on my nerves!
Are you saying you wanna lodge a complaint with Star Command?
Okay!
"Well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh?"
"-Don't even think about it, cowboy."
"-Oh, yeah, tough guy?"
The air isn't... toxic.
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet!
My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!
You actually think you're the Buzz Lightyear?
"Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!"
"Hey, guys, look!"
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!
"You're mocking me, aren't you?"
"Oh, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"Buzz, look, an alien!"
Where?
Yes!
It's Sid!
Don't move!
I thought he was at summer camp.
They must've kicked him out early this year.
"Oh, no, not Sid!"
Incoming!
-Who is it this time?
-I...
I can't...
"If anyone's going to make it in this town, it's going to be me and my band The Teardrops."
"Livi is recording in my sister Megan's studio, so she's hooking me up with some sweet backstage passes."
"Gotta go, amigos, don't want to be late for the rehearsal."
See ya.
I'm sick of Tanya throwing shade on us.
I gotta go.
I'm late for the hotel.
"Come on, buddies."
Oh.
"Mia, hang on a second."
Let me get this straight.
- You're going to Heartlake Hotel?
- Yeah.
Because you're the official dog walker?
So you've got access to where Livi is staying?
I guess.
"Olivia, memory-stick me."
Voilà.
The key to our success.
But Tanya said that Livi's going to Heartlake Studio.
Even better.
Give it to her there.
This is it.
Stardom awaits.
"Argh, slow down."
"No, I could have done, he said..."
Excuse me.
"Yes, I'll be sure to pass that on."
Thank you.
Deliveries are around the back.
"Actually, I'm here to see Livi."
I'm sorry.
I don't have a cat.
You don't have a cat?
"Well, how do you explain this?"
"(STUTTERING) Well, uh, maybe the wind blew against it and knocked it over."
"Nancy, there's somebody in here."
Are you accusing me of hiding a man in here?
"I'm not accusing you, Nancy."
I trust you.
I don't trust Wilbur.
How can you pick on anyone as sweet and fine as Wilbur?
"I know him a lot better than you do, Bobby."
Leave me.
Wilbur is not what he seems to be.
"Oh, you found that out, too."
The first night.
First night?
"I know he seems kind of silly and awkward, but inside he has a fine and sensitive spirit."
"""A fine and sensitive spirit""?"
Wilbur?
I don't want to talk about it anymore tonight.
I've had a hard day.
Why don't you go to bed?
I will.
I will as soon as I take my shower!
(SHOWER STOPS RUNNING)
Wilbur?
Yeah.
Oh.

I think it's great.
"No, really, Travis."
"I-I-- actually, I think it's brilliant."
"[ Chuckles ] Oh, hey."
"Here, take a flier."
I knew Travis was a genius!

Never mind the security.
Okay.

"You'll have to excuse me,"
Lieutenant Columbo.
I'm terribly sorry.
How can I help you?
"Oh, that's very nice of you, sir."
I appreciate that.
After what I did.
Gee whiz.
Where was I?
This is a little difficult.
I'm looking for a Mr. Daley.
Sid Daley?
"He wasrt at his house last night and he wasrt there this morning, and they just told me at his office that they don't know when he's gonna be in, so I was wondering if, you know,"
I thought maybe somebody here would have an idea where he might be.
"Yes, this is about Claire, isn't it?"
"Yes, sir."
Yes.
I'm afraid it is.
I heard about the shooting on the radio.
And I still...
I still can't...
I mean I...
I can't quite...
I keep expecting her to walk in through the door.
I know it's silly for me to think that...
You'll be fine.
"I'm not actually talking, am I?"
This is bad.
I'm just going to go call for a...
Just try not to move.
This is really bad.
If there's a Smokey or a mobile EMT unit with your ears on...
I got a seriously injured fellow here on Route 7.
"I got you, good buddy."
He's on the shoulder and...
Good.
Block him from oncoming traffic... with your truck.
Don't run him down.
I don't think the company would be too crazy about...
Just do it.
I'll call the Sheriff's Department...
"This is Deputy Frank Downes, Oxford County Sheriff's Department."
I have my ears on and am en route.
Copy.
"All right, so are we, Deputy Downes."
"Kingdom, this is Castleview 19."
Do you read?
"Five-by-five, 19."
We're going mobile.
"Sir, can you hear me?"
"Sir, can you move your arms and legs?"
How's he looking?

I don't know.

It was underneath the floor mat.
"Bullshit, man."
You can't do that!

It was underneath the fucking floor mat.
It was in Algeria.
That's where she met him.
Met who?
Maurice.
"He wasn't handsome, actually."
"He was thin, black as night, but she didn't care."
A 16-year-old girl.
Our father wanted to die when he found out.
He made her life hell for a whole year.
He locked her in her room so she'd jump out the window.
Until they decided to run away.
Only I knew where they were hiding.
I was afraid for her sake so I told.
That's the big secret?
That Morn had a lover when she was 16?
What was his name?
Maurice?
Maurice what?
- Was he older than her?
"- No, he was just a boy."
An orphan.
They said he was a Communist.
- That's why they kept them apart?
- No.
- Then why?
"- He was an Arab, I think."
An Arab?
- Are you sure?
- I'm not sure about anything.
"Okay, what happened when they got caught?"
They sent her to Paris and made her have an abortion.
Why?
Really?
That should be OK ln you get

Searching a grave?
Why did you do it?
It wasn't desecration was it?
What were you after?
It was Camille Séguret's grave
Did you know her?
Where is the body?
"When the watchman caught you, it was gone lt wasn't there"
- Where is it?
- We never touched it
Where is Camille Séguret?
What do you mean?
"She was buried there, wasn't she?"
So where is she now?
I think she's back
Back?
Back from where?
From the dead
It's hard to describe
"First, I saw a great light that dazzled me lt felt like I was going blind"
What now?
We chase them.
Chase them?

"Jeez, Brick, what do you got in here?"
This thing weighs a ton.
"Well, I told you, there's been a measurable increase"

"Well, so long, kid."
- Don't spend it all in one place.
- So long.
"Well, good-bye, Mrs. Blake."
"Good-bye, Shorty."

"Hey, Shorty.!"

"Yeah, we got to do something."
"- Hey, what if we had a girls' night?"

"You know, like, to let her know we're still friends."
"Oh, yes, I have such a great idea for that."
"Wait, me, too."
Wouldn't it be cool if we had the same idea?
- Yeah.
"- Okay, let's say 'em at the same time."
- Ready?
- Okay.
"- Three, two, one."
Get wasted.
- YouTube dance tutorials.
We could do both of those things.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Or we could just do mine.
"All right, here, to girls' night."

Girls' night.
- I need this so bad.
- Yeah.

You saw who come in here?
"Your boyfriend, Wilbur."

"What's wrong with you, darling?"
"Oh, save your ""darlings"" for Wilbur."
"I tell you, at this moment, Wilbur is in his room sound asleep."
He's not here?
He's not here.
He's in his room sound asleep?
He's in his room sound asleep.
"Okay, I'm gonna find out."
You do that.
Good evening.
(MUMBLING)
We're delighted that you both could come.
We were happy to come.
"Would you excuse me, please?"
Certainly.
Enjoy yourselves.
I've been trying to see you all day.
I locked my windows.
And what's that supposed to mean?
You can figure that out for yourself.
(ALL APPLAUDING) Maybe Wilbur can help me.
"Bob, I don't know what's come over you lately."
You've just got to stop picking on Wilbur!
"Bob, what are you waiting for?"
What?
Now snap out of it and be a part of this family again.
"- Okay, fine, I'll go sledding."
- Good.
Because your attitude is starting to affect the children.
Just look at Bill.
"Come on, come on."
What's wrong with you?
"Oh, it's beautiful."

"- Ah, Christ, Bill."
Maybe he won't notice.
"- Hey, Frank!"
Hey!

I thought that was my job.
You sexy thing.
Excuse me.
Vic?
Sorry about your van.
I'll pay for the damages.
I can't take bread from my main man who lost his gig.
I remember once I was out of work for a whole winter.
"Oh, wait, that was a vacation."
Hawaii.
"Hey, Frank, you should go to Hawaii, man!"
It'll do you wonders.
"See a volcano, drink a volcano, be a volcano."
"Have fun in Hawaii, Frank!"
This isn't my snowmobile!
He's such a kind soul.
"He's a drug addict, Sue."

There's nothing to talk about.
You were right.
I was wrong.

"It isn't that simple, Michael."
"You think you can let the job be who you are... all you are, and you can't."
It's dangerous to think that you can.
I know I can be...
passionate...
- but I'm good at what I do.
- I know.
- It's no secret that things between us have been-
- Little rocky.
It isn't easy for me either.
"Evelyn comes along, and she's attractive... sweet, needy."

"Earl, I'm sorry I busted your head so hard against those bars."
"That's all right, Tom."
This is Father J. P. Rank.
- How do you do?
"- Fine, Tom."

- How long you had that Bible?
- Twenty-eight years.

I think so.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
"- I understand you're getting married, son."
"- Yes, I am, Mr. Horn."
"You take good care of her, now."

- She was also my wife.
- He hired me to find you.
"- Don't toy with me, especially about Bobby."

"Then I drank for a decade, persecuted by nightmares."

"Yeah, personal training brothers."
"Kind of like Hans and Franz, but, uh, less German."
[ Laughs ] And you're certified in...
Makin' people sweat!
Yeah.
Kickin' ass and takin' names!
That's how we do!
Uh...
[ Both chuckle ]
"Uh, to clarify, uh, what my brother's trying to say is, w-w-we both have a passion for-for fitness and helping people."
"Oh, us too."
Hm.
"In fact, that's how we first met."
I was Maritza's first client back in Peru.
"I was on a student visa -- homesick, stressed, eating my troubles away."
"Oh, he was the size of a casa."
"Oh, it's true!"
[ Chuckles ]
"Hey no, no."
"Dont talk to me, madam!"
Why?
- I have stolen and sold all..
..thejeweIIery of little miss.
What nonsense are you talking about?
"Hey no, I am telling the truth."
I am telling the truth.
I am a thief.
Athief!
And why are you talking to me?
You should hit me.
Hit me.
- Krishna!
"Madam, I didnt feel bad.."
..when Vicky brother slapped me.
I even endured when sister-in-Iaw Naina called me..
..a dog.. a dog that but today..
"..today when sir slapped me, it didnt hurt me here.."
"..it hurt me here, here."
"What, he slapped you?"
-Yes!
"He not only slapped me, he has.."
..so asked me to leave the house!
"Now even I wont stay here, I am going."
"And listen madam, forgive me if.."
..unknowingly I have hurt yourfeeIings.
What is this that I am hearing?
You raised your hand on Krishna?
You told him to get out of the house?
What do you think can our Krishna steal?
Even if God comes down and testifies..
- What took you so long?
- I needed a cigarette.
"Got a problem with that, little miss?"
- Can I have one?
- Yeah.
"- Oh, do you have any weed?"
"- No, can I have my mail?"
"- Hello, baby."
- Would you like to take Evie?
- Certainly not.
I can't afford to smell of vomit.
"- Yeah, I know, I remember."
- Maybe one of the other girls can take care of her.
- Is M free at the moment?
- Thank you.
- Um.
What did you do that for?
"- 'Cause it's not the first time a client's written me a love letter, Lily."
- Really?
Like what?
What kind of stuff do they write?
"Well, like what?"
"Roses are red, violets are blue,"
I pay you money and we fuck.
"- Yeah, pretty much."
"- Now then, Joey is it?"
- Yeah.
Katy.
Katy.
- I'm an employment officer here at the Elizabeth branch.
Do you know why Centrelink has called you in today?
- 'Cause it's my birthday?
"Wal, you're living in a bubble."
"Mate, those seats are gone."
They're rooted.
And I don't mean that in a nice way.
That's the status quo.
We're not married.
Every year they hold the State party conference in a different place.
That's usually a lot of fun for the wives.
"You know, my Joe's got his eye on your David."
Why?
Is he gay?
"Oh, I don't know what he is sexually."
I'm just married to him.
(Women laugh)
"Wendy, Wendy, stop yelling."
Thank you.
"Listen, Wendy!"
Just don't speak to John Bartrop.
Do not speak to him.
"There's no point in speaking to Bartrop, OK?"
Leave the school out of it.
I'll talk to Fuzz.
Leave it to me.
I'll talk to him and Mrs Robinson.
Yeah.
Who's John Bartrop?
"A puff of air in a mohair cardigan, and my new name of choice for telemarketers and Mormons."
Right.
Bang!
"The first cut gets him there, and then he's down, he's dead."
"And then bang, bang, bang, three symmetrical wounds there."
And then...
- What is it?
- It's people seen from above.
From the sky.
"See, these are people walking."
That's a person lying down.
And that's a person standing up next to a person lying down.
This is me... and you... and everyone we know.
Where is dad?
"""R."""
"""I."""
"""N."""
Come on.
Come on.
"""G."""
"We have a whole life to live together, you fucker!"
But it can't start until you call.
- Eldercab.
- Macaroni.
This can't be a regular thing.
Tell them that you can't come in before 9:00.
It's not a regular thing.
Last week I had to leave early one day-
Why did you have to leave early?
Is everything okay?
"Honey, go back to bed."
Was it the boys?
No.
Jesus!
"I have a personal life, you know."
"Oh, okay."
So I'll take them for longer next week.
"But you have'em this whole week... because Dave and I are going to the coast until Saturday, okay?"
Champagne?
"- Whoa, baby!"
- What are we celebrating?
We're celebrating that we've been living together for a month.
Almost.
OK...
To being flatmates for a month.
- Almost.
"- Sit down, please."
"So, what are we having, then?"
- Having?
- Dinner?
In the oven!
Did you like what you just saw?
Yes.
You're a very attractive woman.
But I think we should just keep it as flatmates.
Having a good time doesn't have to change anything.
"You have needs, and I have needs."
What would be more sensible than to try and fulfil those needs   in the comfort of our own home?
- I don't think this is gonna work.
- Sit down!
Turn off your brain and relax.
"Camilla, I don't..."
Just relax.
- Camilla...
- Shhh!
(music gets more aggressive)
(music stops abruptly)
Sorry!
Sorry.
I guess it's time for a shower.
"I don't know, kid."
I'm too old for you.
I'm 31.
How old are you?
Almost 17.
"Means when I'm 21, you'll be almost 36."
That ain't so bad.
"- Edgar, I have to pee."
- God!
"How are you back there, Tillie?"
"- Hey, I'm pulling."
You talk.
- It hurts too much.
You talk.
It's hard for me.
I haven't had a lot of practice at it.
"When I was a kid up in Michigan, we'd go hunting."
For three days we'd not say ten words to each other.
Everybody just does what has to be done.
- Never told you about my first instructor.
- No.
His name's Sloaniger.
"God, he could talk."
"He'd yell at me, scare me to death."
"I was all thumbs for a while, the way you are."
"Dammit, he stuck with me."
"You know, he finally sent me off soloing."
I cried.
It's true.
"Before, I never felt I belonged anywhere and my parents didn't bother with me."
I kinda grew up all over the place.
That day I was up there by myself and I was just... weaving through clouds and...
"Now, uh, take me back to my hotel, please."

"[ Woman ] Going for a ride, kiddo?"
"You know my rules, Bobby."
It's after curfew.
"You weren't thinking of leaving, were you, Diane?"
Not with two years left on your contract.
"You can't hold her, Jessie."
"Think not, kiddo."
"Of course, if you want to buy her contract, it's worth at least 20 grand."
"But I like you, Bobby."
I'll let you have her for 1 5.
You haven't got 1 5?
That's too bad. [ Chuckles ]
"Well, I suppose I'm just gonna have to keep her."
"Well, of course you can visit Diane... for a more reasonable fee anytime she isn't occupied."
"- Dutch is gonna have to kill me, Jessie."
"- That's up to you, Bobby."
"Bobby, no."
Get in the car.
"Diane, get in the car!"
No!
[ Man ] There's a fight.!
"- All right, Jessie."
I'll stay.
- Sailor!
With Toxie lovemaking.
She's been established.
So there wasn't really too much we could do.
[Inaudible] [gasp]
"Yeah, baby."
It's good for the baby.
HEIDI SJURSEN:
"Oh, baby."
[Moan]
[Moan]
Cut.
It's done that way just to [inaudible].
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
I'm just trying to convince the actress
"To take her clothes off, something which was contracted"
"To, and something which was agreed upon,"
"Something which was rehearsed, and something"
Which was pre-recorded on tape.
INTERVIEWER:
And this isn't gonna happen?
That's what's going on.
But now we're gonna shoot Toxie.
Who's doing Toxie's makeup?
Anybody doing Toxie's makeup?
Or are we not making this movie?
"Yeah, we have somebody who's doing it."
[Chatter]
MAN:
"Lloyd, it was a closed set."
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yes, I agree."
But people can stand by.
You know I got to go do this thing.
Where are my keys?
Over there.
It's a mess. lt's like a pig pen.
"What do you think I got you the dishwasher for, huh?"
I hate doin' the dishes...
Fucks with my nails.
You gotta be smart.
Look at all this powder around here.
It's enough to put us away forever.
Henry..stop.
Loosen up.
What are you doing?
You don't have to go anywhere.
Make them wait.
Nobody knows for sure just how much was taken in the daring pre-dawn raid at the Lufthansa cargo terminal at Kennedy Airport.
"The FBI says $2,000,000, Port Authority Police say $4,000,000."
"The city park says $5,000,000"
Those son-of-a-bitches!
...from the scene of the heist at JFK.
It looks like a big one.
Maybe the biggest this town has ever seen.
"Come here, you!"
Come here!
Look at this genius.
This genius!
"Merry Christmas, Jimmy!"
-Who's this?
-That's my wife.
"Come here. I want to show you something, Jimmy."
Isn't she gorgeous?
I bought it for my wife. lt's a coupe. I love that car.
Sorry.
Then what's wrong?
I guess I just miss my friends.
"Everything is going so well for me, but it feels empty without everyone around."
"Korra's gone, Mako's in jail, you're doing..."
Business lady stuff.
Team Avatar's fallen apart.
I know.
Things have changed so much since we first met.
Why don't you come back in and fish watching the mover with me?
You go ahead.
I need another minute.
That's weird.
Whoa... ahh!
Ugh!
They're after the president!
"You're too late, Nuktuk."
"Soon, my doomsday device will shoot this block of ice into the earth's core, freezing the entire planet."
And I will be the ruler of ice earth!
I don't think so.
I don't think so!
Huh!
Ha!
"Mr. President, get back!"
I'm here to help.
Looks like there's nowhere to go.
Uhh!
Secure the president and call for backup immediately!
"Nuktuk, look out!"
"Bolin, look out!"
Hyah!
This is unbelievable!
"- You, nothing!"
Who said anything about you?
"I let her work for me, paying her under the table.That doesn't concern you."
- Unreported employment?
"- Yes, that's my concern,"
I'll take care of it myself.
- Taxi!
- Police headquarters!
"Room 12, Mr John."
Room 12!
- Dr. Wulff!
- John!
- I'm just tagging along.
"- Please, have a seat."
Thanks a lot.
You own a laundry.
"No, my wife has a laundry."
I am a haulier.
- What is it about?
- Do you know a certain Pauline Karka?
Is she dead?
Mentally unbalanced?
"Yes, certainly, she's insane."
"What did I tell you, Karl?"
Something is not quite right.
"She's not mentally sound - a quite common... pathological liar, I told him."
"Any word from her is a lie and whatever she has told you about me, that's all a rotten lie."
You cannot believe it.
About you?
She hasn't said a word about you.
- What?
- Do you know a Willy Koslanski?
- Greetings!
- Greetings!
"Faiz, what happened?"
Be seated!
This is my very dear brother.
I love him very much.
I had sent him there for studies.
"What kind of studies is he doing that, he has become like this?"
"Brother, there is someone whom Faiz loves."
- She does not care for him?
- No!
"I mean, she did care earlier."
- But not now.
What say?
"- Yes, brother."
The thing is... he is right!
So my brother is spoiling his life being a romantic.
- What say Bobby?
- Yes brother!
"This is the same girl who was with you... in the restaurant while shoot out too place, isn't it?"
"- To Ameena baug, please!"
- Where?
- Ameena baug!
- Okay!
Come dear!
Come!
I wish to see that happiness which you had earlier.
Come!
I have brought you that gift... which you shall remember all your life.
Look there!
"Brother, what's all this?"
"She didn't care about you, isn't it?"
Welcome.
- Thank you.
- This is my wife.
- I see.
Have you met Anna?
You must.
"- This is Jacob, who I told you about."
- Congratulations.
Christian.
This is Christian's mother.
There you are.
Care for a drink?
"Yes, please."
- Cheers.
Welcome.
- Thanks.
- Can I play?
- Yes!
Are you any good?
Good?
!
I'm the best.
Aren't you playing together?
"I stand not just before you, Anna   but also my boss and father-in-law, Jørgen   and Helene and, of course, the rest of you."
"Anna, we met at Jørgen's firm when it was in the suburbs."
I didn't dare speak to you because you were the boss's daughter.
Then one day you needed to borrow 1000 kroner.
Jørgen wasn't there and so I had to lend it to you.
You'd think he was marrying Jørgen.
"But Jørgen and Helene, I would like   to thank you for the way you've welcomed me into the family."
I know you think it's early for Anna to marry   but please know that it feels very right to me.
"Anna, I love you more than all the world."
"Um, cool."
Cool!
Now I get to go yell at 1 2-year-olds.
"Um, Karen, thank you."
Uh...
This is a good thing you've just done.
"Well, I hope so."
[Rick] And you called him at home?
And you still have the messages from yesterday?
I need to know if he's getting these messages or not.
"Okay, well, look, if he calls in, just tell him again."
[dialing]
- Who are you calling?
"- Uh, Miles."
You've called 700 times since yesterday.
Cell phone.
"Oh, well, that makes it all make sense."
I think Miles may be in flight.
He just got back from vacation.
As in fleeing.
A fugitive from justice.
Should I put a hold on the concrete?
"Judy, I'm not allowed to talk about it."
Because I'm not.
If you could please respect that.
"Lily, I need you to come in here for a second."
- How much do you know about it?
- Excuse me?
- Lily.
- What?
Stop pretending.
You know what I'm talking about.
"in purple trunks, Stoker Thompson!"
- Give him a gun!
"- Hey, Pop, where's your wheelchair?"
And in this corner!
!
"at 198 and 3/4 pounds, in white trunks!"
!
that promising young heavyweight from Middletown!
!
Tiger Nelson!
"Yeah, Nelson!"
Let's get it over with!
"Don't hurt him, Nelson, he's an old man!"
"Okay, you know the rules!"
"I want a nice, clean fight!"
"No heeling, rabbit punching, gouging!"
Break when I tell you!
Go to a neutral corner in all knockdowns and keep them above the belt!
The customers came to see a good fight!
Shake hands now and come out fighting!
May the best man win!
"Don't bend, Pop, you'll never get up!"
"Don't forget, stay away from him!"
That's the stuff!
Stay with him!
"Oh, quit stalling!"
Let's have some action!
That's it!
"- Don't worry, I ain't gonna finish you yet!"
- You ain't finishing nobody!
"Let him have it, baby!"
Let him have it!
The King's?
Yes.
You've come to me because all other efforts have failed?
I have.
How far are you willing to go to reclaim his love?
To own it it forever.
As far as I need.

"Not to worry, gentlemen."
Everything is under control.
Carry on.

"Take that, prohibition."
-Alice has returned to Underland.
-Where is she now?
-In Salazen Grum.
Forgive me.
I allowed her to divert from her destined path.
"No, no, no, no."
But that is exactly where she will find the Vorpal sword.
We have our champion.
Rest now.
You've done well.
(SQUEAKING)
ALICE:
Have you seen a hat around here?
"You must find Alice, Stayne."
"Without the Jabberwocky, my sister's followers will surely rise against me."
Ugly little sister.
Why do they adore her and not me?
STAYNE:
I cannot fathom it.
You are far superior in all ways.
RED QUEEN:
I know.
But Mirana can make anyone fall in love with her.
"Men, women,"
(ANIMALS GRUNTING) even the furniture.
Even the King?
I had to do it.
He would have left me.
"Majesty, is it not better to be feared than loved?"
Not certain anymore.
"Oh, let her have the rabble."
I don't need them.
You shouldn't be stuck in some stall balling.
And isn't there someplace else you'd rather be?
"- With my mom, but..."
- But what?
Where's she at?
At the hospital with him.
But it's... it's kind of upsetting there.
- You should be there.
"- l know, but..."
Angelica.
"Oh, my God."
We have to go with Sharon to the hospital.
I'll get Tino to drive us.
He loves hospitals.
"And Ricky will come, too."
The four of us.
Right?
Come on.
I have really been cutting Bio a lot.
"So, I should probably skip the hospital."
So I'll see you later.
Hey.
is this where you come to smoke?
"I'm always doing that,  I'm always asking questions I already know the answers to,"
"- So, are you crying or something?"
- l guess.
- How come?
"- Because I'm lonely,"
"Because I have no friends,"
"Because I'm a terrible, terrible person,"
Because of my friends father is in the hospital.
And he could die.
Hey!
How did you get up there?
From further up.
Is this the country road between Kamenice and Bournak?
- It will be when it's finished.
- And when would that be?
A year from now.
- More exactly?
- In May.
"Hold on, for Heaven's sake!"
"All right, all right!"
I'm all right!
But I don't really know the exact time.
Is it '84 now?
"It's half past four, if you please!"
"Just stay there, I'll fetch help."
1984.
"Floods in Italy, the Security Council is having a meeting..."
Everything fits.
Call the Central World Brain!
We have to wait for that.
Only Katya knows the password.
Let's try it like this:
Adam 84 calling CWB.
There isn't the slightest hope without the password.
Do something!
Can't you hear it's picking up interference?
Just search under the letter P. Quickly!
"Not that, that's Periodicals!"
Maybe the next one.
We said unobtrusively!

Happy New...
Sawasdee Pee Mai is better.
"Hello doc, Sawasdee Pee Mai."
"Umm doc, last month I'm..."
Number 134.
Sorry...
Damn your hands are freaking cold.
"Just like when you rode that roller coaster, right before it flipped upside down."
I'm Assanai.
Am I in the wrong room?
"No, you are not."
Doctor Chonnikarn is doing rounds in the ward.
Today let me check on your progress.
That's okay.
I can come back next month.
Why?
So I can be examined by Doctor Imm.
She's handling my case.
I'm following her treatment plan.
She wrote down all your history.
So your treatment plan is the same.
C'mon.
I studied the same specialty as Doctor Imm.
I won't kill you.
Let me see your arm.
It appeared to me he was dead.
So I went in pursuit of the suspect and called it in.
He got into a dark four-door sedan.
Late model.
Headed east on Malpassat Road.
"I got a partial on the plate, George-Robert-Victor."
George-Robert-Victor...
George-Robert-Victor- Zebra-9-0-3?
That's Officer Pritchard's car.
- Was it a black Chrysler 300?
- Uh...
Was it Pritchard you saw?
I only saw him for a second.
"It was dark, but... but who else could it be?"
Okay.
Have you photoed the body yet?
What topic?
Your sexual orientation.
My sexual orientation?
"Yes, your sexuality."
If you like men or women.
"When you came to see me, you said you were still a virgin."
Well...
"To answer your question in some way,"
I think I'm oriented more towards men.
Was that why you came to see me?
I can't remember now.
I guess so.
But I'm fine now.
Do you have a partner?
More or less.
I'm not alone anymore.
"I mean, he's not anyone else's either."
It's just...
- We're not actually married.
I bought the ring myself in Woolworths.
- I see.
- In love enough to run away with him.
Just too proper not to care what other people thought.
"- Er, behind..."
- Better get moving.
Hilliard's looking for you.
Wants to discuss the stuff you wrote for Uncle Frank's death.
- What did you think?
"- Too long, obviously."
But apart from that...
"His final moments, believing Brannigan and Johnnie are the sons he lost in the last war..."
- Well...
- Hmm.
"""Such an age you've been gone."""
- Really.
- Hmm.
"I still think we need a little more in terms of... of, um, of back-seeding."
"Oh, I'm..."
"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Hilliard, but Mrs. Cole has a train to catch."
- What?
- She must go.
- Wha--
- It's...
- It's a personal matter.
- Oh.
"Well, will she be back tonight?"
- Let's get you into makeup.
- Hmm.
Police!
A policeman has come!
Inspector Arivazhagan.
Can I come in?
He got in and started threatening us.
The car being involved in the accident...
Ashwini having driven it...
The windshield of the car having broken...
He seemed to know everything.
He threatened that he had evidence for it all.
Ashwini and I...
Ashwini immediately pleaded guilty.
"Ashwini is an NRI, right?"
"Yes, Sir."
- Hit-and-run case.
"If an FIR is filed, she can't go back."
You must help us!
"Please, Sir!"
I ensure that a case is not filed.
"But if any of his relative create a problem, we need to silence them."
That will cost you.
"No, Manoj."
"Sir, I killed him."
I accept my fault.
"Keep quiet, Ashwini!"
Sir...
What should we do?
Manoj.
Where is Ashwini now?
She didn't like me bribing the cop.
She felt guilty and left the same day.
I don't know where she went or what she is doing now.
I've always been loyal to you.
What is this?
So...you're staying?
"Yes, I'm staying."
What do you want me to do?
"Hey, Anthony."
How would you like it if I taught you how to catch the really big fish?
-Would you like that?
-Okay.
"You know, when I was your age,"
I went out fishing with all my brothers and my father.
Everybody.
I was the only one that caught a fish.
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?
"Every time I put the line in the water I said a Hail Mary and every time I said a Hail Mary, I caught a fish."
Do you believe that?
It's true.
That's the secret.
-Do you want to try it out on the lake?
-Okay.
What else have you got?
Everything will be okay.
-Did my brother go back?
"-Yeah, don't worry."
"He's ten times tougher than me, my brother."
He's old-fashioned.
"He didn't want dinner, just wanted to go home."
That's my brother!
Nothing could get him away from that two-mule town.
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.
-Have you got any cigs?
"-Oh, sure."
"Oh, what a-"
- What a pretty case.
-silver?
-Yes.
"Yes, read the inscription."
"Oh, there is an inscription."
"Why, I can't make it out."
"""And if God choose I shall but love thee better after death."""
"Why, that's from my favorite sonnet by Mrs. Browning."
"-Why, you know it."
"-certainly, I do."
"well, there's a story connected with this inscription."
It sounds like a romance.
"No, no, it's a pretty sad one."
The girl's dead now.
She knew she was dying when she give me this.
"A very strange girl, very sweet."
-Very....
-She must have been very fond of you.
"Sick people have such deep, sincere attachments."
-That's right.
They certainly do.
"-Sorrow makes for sincerity, I think."
It sure brings it out in people.
The little there is belongs to people who have known some sorrow.
-I believe you're right about that.
"-Oh, I'm positive I am."
"-Hey, Mitch!"
-deal me out.
I'm talking to Miss--?
Oh!
Wow.
Are...
Are these... from the street?
You know what?
You're lucky I'm here.
I'm gonna let you use my fall tablescape.
"There's nothing wrong with my table, Viv."
You are so funny!
Greg!
Hi.
I'm Viv.
It's so nice to meet you.
You're too bony for me.
"I didn't think that you could do anything worse than making out with my mom, but congratulations."
You topped it!
"Well, she was desperately peering through the window."
What was I supposed to do?
The same thing that you do if someone asks if you have a minute to save the environment...
You look at your shoes and you keep moving.
"Darling, you are stunning."
"Oh, those stems!"
Tell me...
Were you ever a stewardess?
"Why, no, but thank you."
I'm Viv!
"I'm Kathryn, Katie's mother."
"Kathryn, forgive me."
"I'm sure you've been talking about this all day, but I have to ask..."
What happened to you?
No-o-o-o-o!
"Pay up, girl!"
You will not leave before the summer?
We can no longer trespass upon your sister's goodwill.
- You will come and stay with us.
- I should like that.
Edward has long been expected by our mother.
"Come as soon as you can, Edward."
"Remember, you're always welcome."
- Can't you take him with you?
- We can't afford him.
Perhaps he could make himself useful in the kitchen...
Forgive me.
Miss Dashwood...
Elinor...
I must speak to you.
There is something of great importance that I need to tell you...
about my education.
- Your education?
- Yes.
It was conducted.
"oddly enough, in Plymouth."
- Do you know it?
- Plymouth?
No.
I was four years there.
In a school run by Mr. Pratt.
- Pratt?
- Precisely.
Pratt.
While I was there...
"That is to say, he had a..."
has a...
You're needed in London this instant.
That's her.
I'm suddenly nervous.
You're going to be great.
I'm having the strangest craving for a corn dog.
There may be one left.
Seat?
How about that?
"Fourth quarter, Team Frank comes through in the clutch."
"Oh, yeah."
True love on Valentine's Day.
What more could you ask for?
Yeah...
"Hey, uh, so, you know, we reserved the limo for another two hours."
What do you say we drive down the beach?
"Uh, that sounds suspiciously like a Valentine's Day date to me."
"I don't know, that might make us break up."
What if I said I had newfound faith?
I would say I agree.
I have newfound faith.
I agree.
Okay.
"Onward, Jeeves."
"Yes, yes, yes, to the beach."

I'm pregnant.
What ?
Previously on The O.C.:
"Sandy, we're having a baby."
I just want you to find something that you really care about.
I could be a critic.
You mean spending your whole life watching movies and telling people how terrible they are ?
"Be her knight in shining armor, of course."
"Evelyn, this is Fiona."
We work together.
- Hello.
Thank you.
- Pleasure.
Evelyn.
What happened?
I went to the courthouse to try to get an emergency custody hearing.
-Some guys were at my car.
They knocked me down.
-How many men were there?
"- Two, I think."
- You think?
Could there have been more?
Probably the same guys that came by Doug's place.
"Michael, ifJasper's caught up in the middle of this, I will never forgive myself."
"Please, you gotta bring him home."
It's all right.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
It's okay.
- What happened to the trademark Westen emotional distance?
- She was upset.
Obviously.
Where's your head at?
"Fi... if you're gonna help me, you can't have this attitude."
Attitude?
"If you're gonna be like this, I think I'm entitled to an attitude."
- Maybe I should do this one alone then.
- Maybe you should.
"- Hey, what's up?"
"- Oh, hey, come in."
This is Dr. Black.
Tracy and Jacob Myers.
They're very good friends.
- Hello.
Lovely to meet you.
- Hello.
Dr. Black is our star brainiac here at the Cube.
Oh.
"""May the source of strength who blessed the ones before us help us find the courage to make our lives a blessing."""
"So, Jacob's experienced a sudden spiritual conversion."
He's bonkers.
We've always been bad Jews.
I can count on one hand the times we've gone to temple.
All of a sudden...
I'm enlightened.
Beautiful office.
I think we need a full neurological work-up.
I'm happy to help.
Would you like to come to my office?
You can tell me all about it.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- It's okay.
- Oh.
- What are you doing?
- The Myers are philanthropists...
- I'm just standing here.
- You're standing in the hallway.
"- And they've just recently joined the board at the Cube,"
- so make sure they get VIP treatment.
"-Oh shit, we gotta go."
-Wow!
The mother lode.
- I think you're right.
"No, wait, wait, wait."
Go back.
Jaelen.
Is this her?
-It is.
-Who is she?
- A young woman Jaelen had the good taste to fall in love with.
"- You do have a good taste, my friend."
-She's being held at the Dulce Base.
I'm quite sure her friends and family would be interested to know that.
- How soon would you be able to upload?
-Right now.
-Where are the files going into?
-To an old compadre of mine.
- They'll upload to sixty [ indistinct] globally.
The initial launch should reach about 6 million people.
What's ETA?
-Just under four hours.
- By morning the flood gates will be open.
35.39 degrees north.
And 106 .54 degrees west.
- Southwest corner of the Haines Canyon Reservoir.
-Remember.
Sun fall.
You'll give them the Purean.
"And Robert, you can go with them."
"- Like you, Jaelen, there are people that I can't leave behind."
Not with what's coming.
This is the Jordan family estate?
Wasn't no Jordan family nothin'.
This is where I was in foster care.
Oh.
Sorry.
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
I'm so lucky I got out of here.
"It's not luck, I mean..."
"You got out of here because you're very talented, and... people love you, and..."
Are you peeing?
Where's Donaghy?
I wanna talk to him right now.
"Last time I saw him, he was riding a crane camera."
"Oh, I have Pete for you."
"Pete, oh, my God."
I didn't know.
"No, hey, listen."
It'll--it'll give me a chance to spend more time with my kids.
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You have the best job in New York.
Don't quit over this.
Don't buy all the hot dogs.
Okay?
I don't want to do this without you.
"Hey, I thought we cut the Cat Lady sketch."
We're two minutes short!
"So, let me introduce myself."
My name is Lurleen Katz.
And these are my cats.
She's using a real cat?
That's enough!
You're mistaken.
No mistake!
Witnesses?
I will be a witness.
He is Lun Taichen.
He's your father's old accountant.
"And he caused your father's death, by betraying him and watching him die in jail."
And then he drove your mother to insanity.
Shut up!
Who are you?
"I'm Old Honshu, Jeng's old servant."
"I know you stole that factory from them, and then all their land, and after that you got rid of every last one of their servants."
"But here you are, hunted by the police."
"You, you, ran away that night."
"I met you a few years ago, and I've been following you ever since then, just waiting for the chance to get my revenge."
I want to see you die before my very own eyes!
You're telling lies!
Honshu!
You go!
Right.
Come with me!
Uncle.
Where's Lun Sanye?
He escaped.
You okay?
Nevermind.
(gasping)
You okay?
Lun Sanye.
Lun Sanye?
"Tell me, what happened to Mei?"
"Mrs. Brendan, I believe I can explain."
"You see, Willy, here, had a tummy ache last night."
"There was no place for him to sleep, so I invited him to stay in my drawing room."
"Well, I..."
I think that was highly commendable.
I apologize if I have violated any rules.
"Well, under these circumstances..."
Meeting's adjourned.
That's right.
"I'm sorry, Nancy."
"Well, I..."
I better be going.
"Now, it would be a shame to lose such an adorable little boy so soon."
Why don't you stay for the Saturday night party?
I'm sure you'd enjoy meeting all the little girls.
"No, I think I'd better be running along."
Good.
"Thank you, Aunt Nancy."
"Goodbye, everybody."
ALL:
Goodbye.
Bye!
Hello.

"Surprise, I'm back."

"Oh, I decided to stay for the party."
How nice.
"Well, I have a class."
"I'll see you later, Willy."
"""That's my brother's boy."
"""I guess I heard of my own kin."""
"So I said, ""You spoke to him?"""
"He says, ""Spoke to who?"" I said, ""Ray Malcolm."""
"He said, ""Ray Malcolm?"
"""That's my brother's boy."""
Can you imagine the conversation when Ray shows up?
Want some rolls?
"Yes, ma'am."
Is this great or what?
DUD:
"This looks great, Cheryl Ann."
There you go.
I hope to hell he does show his heinie up there 'cause I got news for you.
That white trash and them two niggers...
Ow!
"That stung, Cheryl Ann."
You nearly broke my Le...
"Bonnie, pass me them pickles, will you?"
JOHN:
I never got any beans.
"Can I get some now, please?"
Mmm-hmm.
"Did you think I was going to cut you, honey?"
I wouldn't hurt you for anything in the world.
You know that.
Here.
I'm glad you didn't kill that man in the car lot.
What do you think we are?
"No, fuck all that, Dale."
It don't mean nothing.
What I'm concerned about is that we left ourselves so goddamn exposed...
But I wanted to check in first.
"- Well, I'm doing great."
Thanks for asking.
- Check in on Stefan.
"Oh, him?"
"Oh, he's..."
He's terrible.
What's the matter?
"He's just back to boring, strait-laced, off the junk."
You've successfully cured him of anything that was interesting about his personality.
- Don't forget who helped me.
- I hate myself.
"Hey, did Uncle John mention anything to you about my field trip with the teacher?"
"No, I've still been avoiding him."
Why?
What's he up to?
- I'd love it if you could find out for me.
- I gotta go.
I'm late.
Have fun with the Mystic queen.
I know I did.

Elena called.
So these are the specs for the History Department's Founder's Day float.
We're gonna be re-creating the Battle of Willow Creek.
Tyler's been nominated to head up the design.
- By who?
- By me.
I've seen your sketches.
- I'm not really into the whole...
"- You just pick your team, be creative and..."
And don't screw up.
"In that case, sir the camp is prepared to escape and evade on order through places in the wire and mines only ""A"" Team and Captain Nim know about."

"""And they sent him home happy..."""
"""One hundred percent."""
"So, the sun was shining, the earth was turning... and my daughter walked into the rest of her life with open arms."
And it finally hit me:
Maybe Cassie has it right.
Wouldn't it be something if my daughter has it right?
"Bye, sweetie, we love you!"
"Bye-bye, darling."
Who are you?
Jesus.
You okay?
Do I look okay?
"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist."
NiaII?
NiaII.
"You know, sometimes when it gets really smelly, NiaII doesn't admit it."
-Do you know what I mean?
-hold on.
Who's the first to admit their farts?
You should be proud of a smell like that.
-It was a creeper.
"-No, it wasn't."
"Man, I would admit that smell."
Let's call it.
"NiaII, NiaII you've been outed."
Zayn.
"I hate to do this, dude."
I just only need you for a bridge.
What time is it now?
You've been asleep for 1 0 minutes.
"-I'm sorry, dude."
"-No, I'II get up."
AII right.
I appreciate it.
Recording this third album has been extremely hard.
We've been waking up in the morning and going straight to the studio.
Then going to the arena  doing a show.
And then going straight back to the studio after a show.
So it's been really tough for us this time.
AII of my 1 0 minute slumber.
"We have to get "" Best Song Ever."""
"It felt like it was the next morning and you were already waking me up and I was like, ""Oh, my God."""
"One, two, three."
"Give me one time short on the ""ever."""
My bad.
-I remember that.
There was a serious conversation about kicking Zayn out of the band.
"Oh, my God."
Imagine.
NiaII would have to be the mysterious one.
I don't know.
I think if I wasn't in One Direction right now I would be working in a factory or being a fireman.
-That's quite funny.
-Yeah.
Why did you wanna be a fireman?
I don't know.
I liked the idea of saving someone.
What about the factory?
"well, that's just because me dad worked there."
would you have not considered opening your own bakery?
I was a great baker.
Fish!
Yes!
-Yeah!
-bloody hell!
Fish!
Fish!
Fish!

But that's not your problem.

I don't think so.
"I was really intimidated, but as it turns out, she's just like a regular person..."

I'll make it 400.

I don't know of any operation.
You recognise this guy?
No.
Is he American?
Don't know.
He's not in our database.
- You mind running him for me?
- Sure.
No problem.
Appreciate it.
- How long you been stationed here?
- Six months.
"- How do you like Vancouver, so far?"
- I love it.
You're with Organised Crime?
I'm the director of the OCU.
I've got a question for you.
Maybe you could help me out.
We just started an operation on a biker gang up here.
Got a long reach into the States.
Maybe you could share some intel?
You're talking about the Disciples?
A guy named Dante.
Dante Ribiso.
They're some bad boys.
I'll put together an intel package for you.
Let me see what I can find out about this guy.
- Give me a couple of days.
- Sounds good.
There she is!
- Show me what you got.
Be a dear and grab me a double skinny vanilla milkshake.
"Oh, right."
And don't forget.
With sprinkles on top.
Love sprinkles on top.
Stop!
Are you deliberately trying to sabotage me?
You know what's amazing about you people?
Nothing.
"You wouldn't know ""amazing"" if it sat up in your soup."""
This is garbage.
"In fact, that's where garbage belongs."
"Now write me an amazing hit song, or start looking for a new job."
"Because that's what I'll be doing, if you don't come up with a hit for..."
"Livi, darling."
"Oh, my little sweetie."
"Oh, little Cookie, all cooped up inside here."
We need to get you outside for a walk.
"Yes, we do."
"Looking fabulous as always, Livi."
"Spare me the soft soap, Megan."
Let's hear that new song you told me about.
"Well, um, you see..."

Julian wanted to go off and do some straight theatre and explore that.
I wanted to get hold of the animation side of it.
We'd the Moon and the 2D animation in the Boosh and I wanted to see how far you could take that.
So the guy that I work with did the Moon and animation in the Boosh.
And I met him at art school.

"You two know each other, I assume?"
"Yeah, well, kind of."
Yeah.
What does that mean?
"Ah, you mean Monsieur Chopin."
How clever.
"It's very rare to hear him play, you know."
The Duchess d'Antan is having him for a whole fortnight at her house in Angers.
I couId only wish I were a fly on the wall.
Except that they already have crowds of files down there.
I do find the provinces beastIy.
- (applause)
- Monsieur Liszt will play next.
"- Ah, George."
I read your...
- In a minute.
George!
"You'II want to sit over here, my dear."
The respectable people are over there.
- could you point out Monsieur Chopin?
- Chopin?
But he left.
Don't you know him?
He's frail as a holy wafer.
Look at those hypocrites.
They've shunned me all evening.
I'm thrilled not to be one of them any more.
Their lives are so boring.
You see?
Every single one is throbbing for him.
They know perfectly well why I ran off with him.
For his teeth.

To find the man who ordered my father and little brother murdered.
I found him.
His name is Pham Son Ti.
And I will give him to you.
When?
"One week from tonight, at the old Costeau Plantation."
Colonel Cai knows where it is.
How much do you know about this girl?
Her father and General Ti's father grew up together.
Their families were very close.
Even before he moved to Hanoi he had more than a friendly interest in Lin.
Do you trust her?
Of course.
She's my brother's wife.
"Let's see, it's 0400."
That means we'll hit the drop zone around a little after sunrise.
Everything set?
Your gear's on board with Colonel Cai's.
KIRBY:
Thank you.
Let's get aboard.
MULDOON:
You heard the man.
Stick formation.
Let's go.
- Keep your head down.
- Don't worry.
"Colonel Cai, you haven't said a word all night."
You know why?
He's never jumped before.
First one's easy.
It's the second one that's hard to get them to make.
It never occurred to me to get married.
You know I've never been in love in my life?
Is something wrong with me?
There must have been something wrong with your husband.
"Oh, he was alright."
I just didn't love him.
Love is a very unsatisfactory thing anyway.
Life is a regular battle.
There.
Chuck!
Chuck!
What's the matter?
"Chuck, he stole my money."
"Wait, I'll get him."
Chuck!
"Alright, get back."
Back on the curb.
"Watch out, let me through!"
Get out of my way!
Chuck!
Chuck!
"Oh, no..."
The man suddenly darted out in front of the truck.
I couldn't miss him.
Is he dead?
"Yes, well, I'm due at the hospital in the next thirty minutes."
"Yes, I've tried the drug out."
It's nothing short of miraculous.
You know they're going to announce it at the Medical Convention in Atlantic City.
"Oh, by the way, what's the stock selling at?"
Two dollars?
I think I'll have my broker tomorrow morning buy me about three hundred shares.
"Oh, I help women, too."
You call me if he needs anything.

- Fornicates?
Rent it.
"- Hey, Dr. Kovac."
- Hello.
I thought I might take you up on that offer for some coffee.
- If you got a minute?
- Sure.
Page me if you need me.
How many stitches?
"7 on the forehead, 5 on the cheek, 12 all together."
That's not so bad.
"Neela, this is Brad, Judy's husband."
"Hey, baby."
"- Honey, I'm so sorry."
"- Oh, come on."
It wasn't your fault.
The police told me what happened.
He never went anywhere without it.
It's missing.

Remember that promise you made to Kevin Whitfield's parents?
You want to make good on it?
What do you know about Kevin Whitfield?
Just what you told me back then.
I've been going over it.
"You know, uh, the backpack that was missing."
You thought it was connected to the killing.
Are you reading my notes?
"I, uh, I took a picture of it, and I sent it to my friends."
They did some kind of search.
"You know, like the dents and scratches on the backpack make it like a fingerprint?"
Did you know that?
[Beeping]
They looked at 5 million pictures and finally came up with the perfect match.
"One double-bacon BLT sandwich, nice and hot."
Thank you.

What's that deal with that Vogue stealing on your stories?
I heard there was a curry.
"It's Yuri, dummy, we're talking Russians, not Indians."
It's not me.
I won't work for Vogue anymore.
They didn't airbrush me properly.

I love sleeping with royalty.

Whores!
All of you.

Hammer time!
"If I was you, Harry,"
I'd fold while I still have some bus fare left.
All in.
"Turn them over, big lad."
Shame.
I was hoping to take that shirt off your back.
"This game is over for you, Detective."
MAN:
He lost it all again?
People don't gamble because they want to win.
"They gamble because, secretly, they want to lose but with you... (LAUGHS) it's not even a secret."
"That's very poetic, Freddie."
You should write it down.
I don't want someone like you to owe me this much money.
She just be drinking--
She--
Got little kids running past her with quarters and nickels.
"""Make a wish, man!"
"Make a wish."""
I'm sorry.
It's about an authoritative tone.
That's how I know that Jay-Z is not gonna be able to control Blue Ivy when she gets older.
His voice is too light.
"And first of all, Jay-Z's voice, man, it's just so fun."
"If he was outside of a haunted house, it would be hilarious."
"He'd be trying to warn people about what's going on in the haunted house, he'd be..."
"""Yo, don't go in there."
"There's a ghost in there."""
"""Jeah, eh, eh, eh."""
"¶ Jeah, gather 'round hustlers ¶"
¶ That's if you still living.
"¶ And get on down to that oh, eh, eh, HOV ¶"
"""Look."
"""Okay, you wanna go in there?"
"""You serious?"
"""Okay, you're dead."
Bye-bye.
"""Fuck you."
"Ha ha ha ha, yep."""
"""Yep!"""
"""Solange is in there."
"Be careful."""
"Blue Ivy, man."
That don't even sound like a real name.
"That sound like stripper lotion, don't it?"
"""Girl, I don't never go down the pole"
(grunting) And here's baby boy number one.
I understand you've decided to name him Stewie.
One more to go.
And here he... oh.
"Oh, dear."
"Oh, no, did Dave not make it?"
"Okay, Meg, I've cleaned your room and I did your homework."
Can I be done now?
"Oh, no, there's a lot more things"
I need you to do for me.
There are?
Like what?
"Well, now you have to watch"
An Officer and a Gentlemen with me.
And that's it?
(laughs) No.
"At the end, when Richard Gere carries Debra Winger out of the paper mill, you have to read what's on this index card."
(on TV): ♪ Love lift us up where we belong... ♪
(crying)
"That's going to be you some day, Meg."
I know it will.
I just know it will.
"Okay, Chris, I want to wear contacts, but I'm too squeamish to put them in myself, so you need to help me."
Really?
Is it that hard?
My eyes are too sensitive.
It's like they overreact or something.
Okay.
"Ah, what happened to your eye?"
!
Don't worry about it.
Just put the lens in.
-I'm sorry sister.
-It's okay now.
Why are you soaked in rain?
Will you change your clothes!
They said Migs is not in their house.
I also called Ara but he isn't there either.
Where could he be?
I don't want to think he's with Bela.
You should've told me you were coming.
I could've prepared for your birthday.
What really happened to you?
And then you'll come here drenched in the rain.
I don't know.
I was disoriented.
"I can't remember, I didn't know where I live."
That's why I went to your house.
-It's good you didn't get lost--
"-Bela, I really wanted to be with you."
"Wait, wait!"
You have to go home.
-Joy might be looking for you.
-I don't give a damn about Joy.
What if he's not with Bela?
.
And he was picked on in the streets?
And something bad happened to him that I don't know.
"Sis, sister, just go to sleep."
Do you know that's what I wanted to hear from you when I came back from Canada?
But you chose Joy.
And you got married.
I know.
But I'm not happy with her.
Spare me!
Spare me!
Get off the horse.
Move it!
These are the few we just caught?
What do they have with them?
Silk and red jade.
"Compared to those,"
I think these scums here are worth more.
They look tough.
-Take them away.
-Yes.
Hey hey hey.
Watch it.
What's on your mind?
Eh?
Nothing.
What Prince Ju-Mong has found out... don't you wish to know?
I don't place high hopes on that.
"Now, it seems no one can come up with something good."
The reason I gave him two days is because I know this expedition means a lot to him.
"For us,"
We can always leave it to next time.
"But for Prince Ju-Mong, he can't do the same."
"Compared to the acknowledgement I want from Father,"
Prince Ju-Mong's need of King Geum-Wa's acknowedgement far outweighs mine.
Looks like the scale has tipped.
What do you mean by that?
You used to treat Prince Dae-So and Ju-Mong equally.
Now it seems you're leaning closer to Prince Ju-Mong.
"What you've said, I can't deny."
How should I put it?
Get the fuck out of my way!
- Ma'am!
Ma'am!
- Let's go.
Tom James!
Tom James!
Tom James!
Thank you.
"Okay, I admit, this isn't boring."
Why make the total of electoral votes an even number?
- Insanity?
"- Listen, I know this is a long night."
You're tired and you're cold and your legs ache and you need the bathroom.
"Boy, do you need the bathroom."
That fucking guy with his fucking charm and his fucking son and his fucking wheelchair with his spine all fucked up.
My grandmother survived the Dust Bowl.
"And before she died at the age of 89, she told me a secret that she kept for almost 50 years."
The story concerns...
"Ladies and gentlemen, Tom James."
How about it?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Wow.
Do I know how to pick 'em?
Yep.
"Well, thank you so much for being here."
I know it's been a wait.
And we really do appreciate your presence.
"What a night, right?"
It's the night of nights.
"Um, you know what I want to do?"
You're home early.
Evan was my rebound guy.
But of course.
I feel in love again because he seemed so perfect.
But... he was perfect for Steven and Smiley Pete as well.
No no no no...
And Phil was my rebound of the rebound.
Bad!
You bad baby!
Uh...
That's when I decided to move to Los Angeles.
"What better city to replace perfect boyfriends, long term commitment... and heartache, with short term happiness and superficiality..."
At least it seemed like a good idea at the time.
"Well, fast forward a few years."
I forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Dale.
That's me a few years later.
Sucking face with my kinda sorta boyfriend JP.
He's a fashion photographer.
Remember that cover of Charlize in the green evening gown?
JP took that.
God I'm already name dropping...
That's so lame.
"Baby, give me your foot."
My foot?
You ever had your toe suck before?
"No, J. P..."
I...
Ok...
Delicious...
"What, no good experience?"
Bye baby.
"I know you don't know much about time,"
But for us it's a big deal.
"But you don't have to worry about time, 'cause no matter what time it is,"
I'll be here to feed you.
- Ms. Levin?
"- Yes, this is Mrs. Levin."
Hi.
I'm Shawn Gilder.
I'm a teacher here in Arizona.
I'm calling to inquire about a former student of yours.
"His name is Mikey Trenton, and he's in the fourth grade."
Mikey Trenton?
I don't remember a Trenton.
Yeah.
"He had a different last name, but he won the spelling been last year."
"Oh, my God."
You must mean Michael Kelvin.
Why do you say that?
You haven't heard about the tragedy?
"No, I haven't."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I don't know if I should say.
Please tell me.
"It was his whole family, and..."
What happened to his family?
They were murdered.
"We never found out how because the police are still looking for the killer, and--"
I'm going to the market.
You got any requests?
A six pack?
"Just kidding, Mom."
"- Good-bye, sweetie."
- Yes.
Thank God.
I'm meeting Frank Anselmo for breakfast.
"- Oh, good."
Where?
- Woerner's.
Woerner's?
- The hangout at Borough Hall?
- That's it.
"When you go to Brooklyn, you're Frank Anselmo's guest."
Don't piss up his leg.
Just get him off this infrastructure thing.
Nothing wrong with it just unaffordable right now.
Good work tonight.
Mrs. Marquand couldn't stop talking about the cover of Time.
I think she collects them.
"National ink, the mother's milk of politics."
"Did I hear right, or did we get the convention?"
It's not signed and sealed but it is delivered.
And you were the closer.
I thought I had him with the second city stuff.
Of course you did.
You know why?
It belongs here.
New York City.
This is the place.
Excuse me.
"All right, the story's on the 10:00 news."
A little slow.
A bullet took the life of an innocent 6-year-old  on his way to school during a police action.
They're all over it like a cheap suit.
It's going to stick to us like one too.
It just seems surreal.
Like maybe we weren't meant to get to the normal part.
That's exactly why we're gonna do it.
"We're gonna go out, have some fun and try to remember that we don't have to be so serious."
"Listen, when I decided to stay here and to get to know you it was so that I could do things like this."
"I could bring my girlfriend flowers, take her out on a date try to be normal."
Have you ever even been on a double date before?
"Oh, absolutely."
"Uh, '72."
Hef and the twins.
- What?
- Yeah.
Playmates.
I got Miss June.
- Are you serious?
- Mm.
Miss Sommers?
Yes.
"Hi, Pearl."
Hi.
This is my daughter Annabelle.
"Of course, Jeremy's friend."
"- Nice to see you, Miss Sommers."
- Oh.
Jenna.
This property was in my brother-in-law's family for generations.
It's one of the original structures in Mystic Falls.
Used to be one of those old-fashioned drugstore thingies.
- An apothecary?
- Yeah.
You don't say.
Sorry if it's musty.
It's a...
It's the famous line from...
I'll be right back with your order.
"Belinda, I hope you don't mind, but I'm gonna head home."
- We can just hang out another time.
"- Oh, no, don't."
"I know this is weird for you but if you just help me out, we'll get out of here quickly."
- I don't think I can...
"- Christine, please."
Marly is just...
She's looking for an excuse to fire me.
"And I really need this job, so please, please help me out."
- Ugh.
"Okay, I'll help you out."
- Thank you.
Uh-oh.
Who let the hens out?
[WOMEN LAUGHING]
"Charles, honey, what are you doing here?"
"I have my book club meeting, remember?"
"Oh, don't worry, I'll clear out."
Let you ladies do your reading and drinking.
[LAUGHING]
"Thank you, darling."
"So, what did everybody think about the book?"
- Lindsay?
"- Oh, yeah."
It was amazing.
"- You didn't read it, did you?"
- I had a rough week.
Jackson was sick and Kelsey came home crying.
"There's another Kelsey in her class and now they call my daughter ""Big Kelsey."""
Thanks!
We might have a chance at winning now!

"Dad, I was just messing around."
I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there!
You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!
"Hey, your kid is really good at this."
"Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole!"
"Just go easy on him, huh?"
You know what this means?
!
It means you're about to get slapped.
So you better shut up!
"If he wants to play ball, you should let him."
I'll do it!
I'll slap the shit outta you!
He's just a kid.
You don't tell me how to raise my son!
I'll slap it again.
"Dad, stop!"
You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself!
"There, there's another slap."
Maybe you'll think next time you act you---
"Slap it, I slap it!"
"Ow, Dad!"
"Dad, you're hurting me!"
"Shut up, Bridon!"
"Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?"
"Get outta my way, Mackey!"
"Look, since we're not gonna partner..."
... thatclearstheway for us to get together socially.
"You really don't get this, do you, Roy?"
Listen to what I'm saying.
I don't wanna have anything to do with you.
SlPOWlCZ:
"Hey, Laura."
-Hey.
KELLY:
Hey.
"-Hey, John."
-How's it going?
-Good.
Could you do me a favor?
-Sure.
-On the Garcia homicide...
... couldyougetstatements on the husband and wife?
-l thought I put three in there.
-You did.
You got three documents of spousal abuse.
A woman confesses...
... shestabbedherhusbandafter he beat her.
Why more statements?
Something isn't right.
Her lawyer's ready to plead manslaughter two.
That's the worst she'd do.
Something's missing.
I don't agree.
"Before the trial, I'll reinterview like I do on every case."
-l don't think there'll be a trial.
-Tell your boss you want to go to bat.
I think he'll deal anyway.
And you wouldn't consider this an emergency?
"Just give us 2 hours, and the notebook will be recovered by then."
Perhaps less than two hours.
Just one and a half.
"- Give me Academician Filip, please."
- Is it OK?
Filip speaking.
"Following a thorough evaluation of the situation the crew of the Adam 84 Expedition has decided, that..."
This is CWB.
This is the Central World Brain.
The connection is lost.
CWB is powerless in the matter.
"Well, what do you say?"
Where did she go now?
Eh?
Poochie!
Stupid Bernau!
Give it to him!
Are you scared?
You'll get some more tomorrow at school!
Just wait!
"What've they done to you, Adam?"
"Oh, it's just my shirt."
But they couldn't take the notebook from me.
What's so important to them about it?
Secret calculations.
It's not suitable for girls.
- Unless...
- Why are you so secretive?
Perhaps some girls could...
Adam!
Stop messing about!
"Yeah, something about dildos and then I felt..."
- The vibrating egg.
- What is that?
- A large vibrating egg.
- Yeah.
- What?
- What's that?
- Annie Hall.
"- Yes, of course."
- Devendra Banhart.
"- ""We used a large vibrating egg."""
"Look, I'm just afraid that if he gets with you and nothing happens his self-esteem could really go through the crapper, you know?"
This is Tris.
Devendra was so sick this day.
"He showed up, walked off the plane from Barcelona and he couldn't swallow."
- Look at how tense he is.
- Look at him.
He is dying.
I fanned him with a paper plate and we've been friends ever since.
That's the way great friendships are formed.
It's good at breaking down walls.
I did...
Yeah.
Ari.

"This is exciting, we got to be to be on film together."
- You ever work together?
- We met doing a play.
This is the first time we've been on-screen together.
- That's the best cigarette flip too.
It was beautiful.
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers and Jimmy was in charge.
we'd rob the airport.
it was better than Citibank.
You got a phone?
Come on!
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?
There was Jimmy and Tommy andme.
And there was Anthony Stabile.
Frankie Carbone.
Fat Andy.
Frankie the Wop andFreddyNo Nose.
who was Sally Balls' brother.
Then you had Nickey Eyes andMikeyFranzese.
nicknamed because he said everything twice.
get the papers.
not coats.
Suits are up on Thursday.
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?
You don't want furs?
I'll take them away.
I want them.
We'll hang them in the freezer with the meat.
to live any other way was nuts.
those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks were dead.
They were suckers.
They had no balls.
we just took it.
they got hit so bad they never complained again.
It was all just routine.
"Uh, can we get a picture please?"
"Uh, sure."
Princess... picture pants here she loves taking photos.
It's a wedding gift.
Especially of hot guys.
"No, I'm just kidding."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I like it.
Mm-hmm.
Um... are they ready?
"Uh, I think so just give us two seconds."
I'll go get Drew.
Do one shirtless.
- Ok.
"Hey, we ready?"
No.
What do you mean no?
Well... we're waiting on Drew.
"Ah, so typical."
Drew left no explanation with anyone.
I guess he felt he didn't need to since he never actually asked Jill to marry him in the first place.
"But as difficult and embarrassing as the day was for Jill, deep down,"
I don't think she was surprised.
You can't push a guy into marriage like that and then expect a happy outcome.
Perhaps at one point Drew did love her.
He just forgot why.
What now?
Do you want to go get some pepperoni pizza?
"Honey, I think she needs something a little bit stiffer than a pizza."
"How about a double Jack on the rocks, huh?"
"Uh, excuse me, Jill, I..."
"Ten, nine , eight, seven , six , five , four three , two"
One!
What happened over there?
Well...
"I was just thinking that, since how you're 18 and all, you can be charged as an adult now, for all felonies."
"Kid's meal, ferris wheels..."
God knows what else.
I know.
"But hey, this should turn that around."
I've invited the Boss to our party.
"""Dear Daisy,"
I'm sorry I couldn't be at your birthday party but I hope you have a wonderful day.
"Chet . """
it was swell of you to invite him.
Hello?
"Oh, hey Russ."
Is that Russ calling us to wish us a happy vacation?
"Because if it's not, he has got the wrong number."
Oh ...
Ur...
I don't know.
I'll have to check with Violet .
Vi ?
No fucking way!
Violet says no.
"Violet says "" Fuck NO !"""
I thought you said we had some down time ahead.
"No, Violet told me you would pull something like this."
"Oh, yea , no kidding."
She said you'll do that too.
Up the money and call it an easy gig!
"That's textbook, Russ!"
I'm fed up with pinnies and vests.
They can seriously interfere with your social life.
I'll deal with you in a minute when I've f--finished shaping up this sharp fingernail.
Get on out of it!
And d--do your shirt up!
You're too short for that sort of thing!
People will mistake you for a very tall man with his flies undone!
I'm sharpening it!
I'm supposed to be b--blunting it!

- C--Cover your chest!

- I prefer to show me dangler.
You wh...
You what?
And take them g--glasses off.
You look like Secret Squirrel!

"- What is that thing, any road?"
-
- It's temporary till I find a proper one.

- Wh--What is it temporarily?

- It's a cocoa tin lid.
It looks all right from a distance.
"Is that what you want the world to say of your dangler? ""All right from a distance""?"

Addons can I continue?
Addons Please answer verbally.
Addons Will I continue?
- No!
I do not ...
"Addons Do you consider the age girl in the video, Dave?"
Addons Do you think that?
Or who look for it?
Addons Can you tell us the title of the 4 times a night in watching it?
I do not remember.
"Of course not, it may then you have come to mind."
Is striking.
This is a global network.
And I have the right to see which I like.
I was not obscene.
"- Max, you look at porn, right?"
- Do not put me in this regard.
God ...
- Sure you do.
- I do not even know.
Lie!
We have all done it should not be.
All!
And who says no.
He is a liar.
"- Well, I didn't get that much."
It all kind of went sideways after lunch.
Why?
What happened?
Francine knows about Lorna and Jim.
- How'd she find that out?
- She knew.
"She asked me about it, I lied, said it was a one night thing, but she knows."
I'm gonna have to let Jim know.
Shit!
Please don't put me in this.
I promised I wouldn't say anything.
This is gonna get ugly.
What did she say?
"Is she gonna freak on him, or what?"
She just seems really depressed.
I'll handle it.
"I'll look at these later, OK?"
Do me a favour.
Will you go downstairs and make me a cold glass of lemonade?
And ask Ronnie if he can make me a sandwich from the kitchen.
- I'm gonna make Mom a sandwich.
- All right.
Is she upstairs?
Are you feeling all right?
"Sure, everything's fine."
What's wrong with you?
Maybe you want to tell me something.
What are you doing with that?
"Don't do that, Frankie."
"Jesus, don't do that."
Are you fucking Lorna?
"The lights shine on me, the one who really loves you."
I practice my lines.
How do I perform flawlessly and make your heart flutter?
"No matter how many times I've suffered defeat,"
I still won't turn back.
Because you have the smile I want to possess every time we meet.
Sometimes I doubt myself.
I blame myself for not being lucky enough.
"I'm scared I'll spoil you with too much affection, but I'd still rather believe..."
Baby.
Love is an extravagant solo show.
I'm not afraid of ridicule.
"Eventually, you'll be moved."
Love is solo.
"Oh, S - o - l - o"
"Love is a cruel solo show, up on the stage."
Your glance is overflowing with sparks.
"Love is solo, the most beautiful extravagance."
Love is a solo show.
Solo Solo.
"For you, I want to..."
Solo Solo.
Love is a solo show.
Solo Solo.
"For you, I want to..."

Love is like a battle arena.

"When I woke up, I was on the floor."
-And I don't know how it happened.
-You can't remember?
I passed out.
Just a game.
Jesus.
"Jesus, Jesus!"
Jesus God!
God!
"I don't know, and I don't understand why I can't remember."
"Doesn't matter, just do as I say."
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.
You decided to spend the night at Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.
-As his guest.
-I do remember that she was laughing.
"We'd done it before, and I know that I could not have hurt that girl."
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.
It'll be as though she never existed.
All that's left is our friendship.
-Yes?
"-Sorry, but we're not to let you through."
-I'm just going to the market.
-We'll pick up anything you want.
-Whose orders are these?
-Mr.
Hagen's.
He's coming.
I'll speak to him.
"I wanted to explain, but I had business in Carson City."
It's Michael's request for your safety.
We'll get Toxie coming out of--
Who's Toxie?
He's not doing stunts or anything.
"No, no."
"We just-- we got to have some stuff with Toxie, man."
We can't wait around.
"It's been like five hours since his call time,"
"And he's still not here yet, you know."
--[inaudible] close-up when they were coming out
"Oh, is he here now?"
I see the van.
"That's our van, right?"
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"I don't see him, though."
Let him see.
"We got our Toxie, right?"
Instill the fear of God into Toxie.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
I think it's time to-
- I'm
Not too happy with this.
I'm happy to use this guy.
It's 10 o'clock.
This is ridiculous.
"We shot with the stand-in, who was inconspicuously"
"Tito's height, when Dave, our really Toxie,"
Is at least a foot taller.
"And he normally carries both of us, which is the humor in it."
He carries Tito and Sweetie Honey.
"It's kind of funny, 'Cause Dave's a strong guy,"
And he can do that.
"Ah, there you are, sir."
I've got to find a good accountant.
Hey!
I can buy a good accountant.
I can buy 20 good accountants!
I hit the jackpot!
Captain just won the lottery!
Hey.
"Next time you call me Captain, it's because you're on my boat!"
Yes!
"Oh, my goodness!"
I'm a rich man.
Everybody leaves.
- Look at this.
Natalie.
"Mr. Monk, I'm sorry."
I didn't know where else to go.
What happened?
Are you okay?
You haven't heard?
What?
What time is it?
5:00.
One minute after.
Turn on the news.
What...
What channel?
Any channel.
A major scandal involving the Gold Rush lottery.
"As we told you this morning, there were two winners in last night's jackpot giveaway."
"Eugene Maddox, a truck driver from Rockaway Township and Leland Stottlemeyer, a highly decorated officer with the San Francisco police."
"Now, according to the rules, these two men would split the $212 million grand prize."
"Mr. Maddox, what do you do for a living?"
"No, we gotta have a Negro."
This guy right here.
"Negro, front row."
"- Mr. Nixon, sir."
- Yeah.
We-We all knowthatyou have builtyour career... on smearing people as Communists.
"And nowyou are building your campaign on the divisions in this country, stirring up hatred and turning people against each other."
Whatthe fuck's he doing?
He's making a speech!
- Cut him off.
- I can't.
This isn't Russia.
He sounds like a negro.
He's saying all these negro things!
- What's he doing?
- He sounded white when we screened him.
He doesn'tsound white now.
He sounds like Angela Davis.
When are you going to tell us whatyou really stand for?
- Puton a commercial.
- There are no commercials.
- Go to commercial!

Same as usual.
"You not working at The Vanya, anymore?"
There's been shootings in the bar.
I'm happy not to be working there.
It's way too intense.
That's Disciples turf.
What's going on over there?
There's an American crew moving in.
Trying to shove out the Disciples and grab the street game.
"- American crew, huh?"
- That's what I heard.
- See you later.
I'll buy you a drink.
- For sure.
I saw the news about the shooting in Seattle.
It's so crazy in the States with the guns and everything.
I know.
I'll talk to you later.
I wanna know if you've talked to this guy.
Is he still in town?
I'm supposed to be meeting him any time.
"I wanna know who he is, who he's working for and what his plan is."
"This is happening now, so I'm gonna talk to you later."
It's Rene.
What happened with Reardon the other night?
I don't know lt was a kind of illness
Even when he was a child?
- Was he unhappy?
- Yes
"When he died, did he know I was going to be born?"
Yes
Do you think it was my fault?
I know it wasn't
Come here
He was very happy when he heard I was pregnant lf he comes back can we ask him why he died?
"Yes, maybe"
Come with me
- Anyone here?
- Yeah
This place looks like a bomb site
What happened?
This morning the bastards took all my food
- And since you're doing nothing...
"- Yeah, OK"
- Were there many of them?
- l don't know
Have you ever seen him?
I didn't see anyone
Does he look familiar?
He looks like Toni's brother
Do you know him?
Sort of.
He's a nutter
He used to live above the dam
But I mean that was ten years ago
- Thanks

Hey Dad!
Welcome to 'Lindsay dealing with her grief through partying'.
"Not your idea, I hope."
"Well, she said she was having a few friends over after her exams, but then this happened."
Right.
I might just go see how she's doing.
Tragic.
"You've got to shut this down and kick her out, Dad."
Probably not the best idea right now.
"Yes, she's lost her Mum, but clearly it's not causing her much distress right now."
"Eugh, of all the awkward times."
Do something.
Please?
"OK, I'll have a chat to her."
Hi George!
Hope you don't mind this little post exam blow-out.
It's so cool to see all my friends.
"It might have been a good idea to ask me first, Lyndsay."
"Yeah, I know."
But once word got out
I think people just wanted to show me some love.
James:
I found the backpack.
"The dead kid's best friend, a nice young man named Liam."
He took it.
"Funny how he didn't mention that in his statement, huh?"
You stay away from my daughter.
Yeah.
Deal.
I'm heading to the best friend's house right now.
"Maybe you should, uh, just meet me there."

Let's start with de Mario.
De Mario?
Yes.
He says that he brought Mrs. Nash home at approximately 1:45 a.m.
"Now, does that check with you?"
Check.
Do you have anything further to say about this?
No.
"And he left immediately after with you in the car, right?"
Right.
What did he talk about on the way home?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing.
"Well, didn't he say anything when he dropped you off?"
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing!
"Well, he must've said something when he dropped you off, Mrs. Slocum."
"He said, ""Good night."""
"Now, look."
"De Mario has been unable to account for his time... from then until 4:00 a.m. Now, exactly what time did you get home?"
"They can't prove it, Lottie."
"Now, don't say another word until you see a lawyer."
I didn't know.
Let's have a listen.

Chopin is going to meet Madame Sand.
Franz thinks you're making a mistake.
He's in a position to caution you.
He once had his own experience with George.
"- Marie, I told you nothing happened."
- So you love to claim.
"You must listen to him, because, one way or another,"
Franz knows exactly who she is.
GEORGE:
I've always wanted to know.
"See here, darling."
Chopin has dedicated the Etudes to you.
To me?
It is a tremendous honour.
"What did you do to deserve it, I wonder?"
Marie is an angel of inspiration.
"It's good to see you, Franz."

"Oh, he loves dogs, but for the first few minutes Ed's around a dog, he-he itches and wheezes and sneezes."

It's an allergy he's got to anything with fur on it.
"Oh, gee, that's too bad."

"Look, I know that McGee thinks that AUTEC is just a military facility, but I have possible proof of an actual sighting of a USO."
That's an Unidentified Submerged Object.
Oh.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Samantha...
Ryan.
I know.
"So, what am I thinking?"
You're thinking I can't possibly know what you're thinking.
You're good.
Abby.
"No, no."
Nobody did anything to me.
I just...
I'm trying to keep it spicy with Tim.
"Honey, I didn't even know people could do this, and I've had some long layovers in Bangkok."
- Mom!
- I'm sorry.
"This is a little more than I could handle, so, I-I..."
I think I'm gonna talk to my therapist.
Do you think that he can help me?
"No, no, this is for me."
You need a priest.
(car engine approaching)
(car door closes)
HEATHER:
I got this.
I got this.
(keys jingling)
I don't got this.
I don't got this.
I don't got this.
I don't got this.
(beeping) What?
"Did you know that Victoria's Secret sold their Web site to someone called ""Net Nanny""?"
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Will you go get me a glass of water?
"I can smell Pop Tarts, so I know Tyler's in the kitchen."
"Look, I cannot keep doing this."
"If I wanted to run up and down the stairs two times a day, I'd join a gym."
You're gonna have to talk to him again at some point.
Maybe not.
"Maybe like a mama bear out in the wild,"
Dave's right.
"I mean, you know, why go through with it just to get a divorce 2 weeks later?"
- Exactly.
- I think actually she just kinda got really overwhelmed.
"Uh, she saw Brian and then freaked out and left."
- Have you talked to her?
- No one has.
"So she hasn't spoken to them, and they haven't spoken to each other."
We ought to just invite Marjorie and have a really awkward barbecue.
That'd be awesome.
"Oh, that's me."
Where's my cell phone?
"Oh, uh, ooh, uh, here."
"Um, Suzanne."
Huh.
What is she doing calling on a Sunday?
"- Well, it's probably about the launch."
- Juice box.
"Leviathan's going to be calling a lot, you know."
- Hello?
"- Hey, handsome."
Hi.
"I'm, um, in the middle of a family/friend thing."
How do you know I'm not calling you about work?
I don't.
You're right.
"Um, what's up?"
- I got some ideas I want to pitch you.
- Okay.
How about tomorrow?
How about tomorrow night?
They'll probably sound better over a glass of wine.

Okay!
- Very nice!
- Never a dull moment at the Fun Palace!
"There's something for everyone, from 8 to 80!"
"Yes, sir!"
"Something to surprise the men and shock the women, or vice-versa!"
The culprit is...
Jacques Dollon.
Jacques...
"It is not possible, this man is dead."
Where's the gold?
Over there.
Thank you.
"What do you want, Sir?"
"I would like to see Mr Nanteuil, please."
Private business.
Please follow me.
It is Mr Fandor.
Ask him to enter.
"Ah, Mr Fandor."
I did not think I would meet you so fast.
Mr Nanteuil.
Hello.
Sit down.
You're probably not ignoring the excitement caused in Paris by the murder of the Baroness de Vibray.
And the important theft committed against Princess Danidoff.
And how am I concerned?
"The little I know, I learned it by reading your articles in the press, Mr Fandor."
Can you confirm that the Baroness was ruined?
"Well, I do not violate the professional secret by saying"
yes.
She had undergone irretrievable losses.
And Jacques Dollon?
You think he's guilty?
A priori.
From what I've read in the press.
Why?
Do you have any doubts?
"Apologies, but I am in such a hurry."
Another one'll be along any mo.
"Yes, oh."
You didn't know?
"No, no, I didn't."
"Woollahra, thanks."
Um...
"What do you think you're doing, you bastard?"
!
Give those back!
Have you told the school?
Shit!
Don't let him in!
"No, I don't want my son's head pixelated all over the Sunday papers."
"Crown Street, thanks."
Where are your manners?
He'll tire of this woman.
Boys can't see straight with a hard-on.
No 15-year-old boy is going to tire of a woman shoving perfect tits in his face.
"You need to know that you have ruined his life, OK?"
And you have ruined my life.
(Slams phone down)
His English teacher.
Have you ever had sex with any of your teachers?
"No, neither did I."
You need a hand with the biros?
"When I was a student backpacking, I went to the Prado in Madrid."
Hate art.
I made a mistake of going to the National Gallery once.
Boring as.

"Oh, I've been on my feet so long, I've sprouted roots."
"Hello, angie, sorry."
"An 8-hour shift, and I got a whole 50 cents in tips."
The war's over.
I thought we were all spending money again.
How was your day?
Would have been a considerable improvement.
I got a bottle of schnapps and half a rhubarb pie.
Let's see which one makes us sick first.
"Oh, sounds lovely, but I was just about to go to bed."
"It's 8:00, grandma."
Come on.
Tell me about your crappy day.
I'm really tired.
M-maybe some other time.
Didn't mean to disturb you.
"No, you didn't disturb me."
I ju...
"no, it's fine."
I know a brush-off when I see it.
Angie...
oh.
"Ah, miss carter, miss martinelli,"
"May I introduce you to our new resident,"
Miss dorothy underwood?
"Oh, call me dottie."
Nice to meet you.
"This place is pretty swell, huh?"
Hmm.
"Seems like one big, happy family."
"No, it's a pleasure to meet you."
God damn it!
Shit!
Sorry I'm late.

This matter is now in session.

"The Estate of Ryan Larson, et al, versus Borns Technology."
"Parties are present, Your Honor."
Be seated.
Ahem.
This matter is here for a status hearing.
"I'm looking at the file, but I see very little progress."
I don't like that.
"Well, Your Honor, we've been conducting depositions"
- and taking testimony--
- No.
They've been doing depositions.
"In fact, from where I sit, you've done next to nothing since we last convened other than show up at my house uninvited."
"A thousand greetings to you, Terry, Dad,"
"Furface and Watersprite, from your loving Henry."
The main thing is he's alive and well.
Where does it say greetings to Furface and Watersprite?
Here.
He never forgets us.
Give him our love too.
"Of course, and I'll say how you help me."
"Come, let's feed you."
You need a rest after your long flight.
"But I'm not alone, really."
The Duke sent Henry away to fight the Turk.
The Turk?
But nobody came back alive!
"That's what the Duke thinks, that ghastly ugly wretch."
Ghastly?
Ugly'?
The nastiest under the sun.
He's mean to everyone.
"But he'll meet a just end, such a type always does."
But they praise him in town!
Our Duke?
Must be some mistake.
"The Count in Netolice maybe, he's a wonderful person."
"But our Duke is proud and evil, just about ripe for hell."
- Stop it!
- Don't you like our food?
Honza's used to better things - on his travels.

"Just say so, Johann."
I have to sent you to jail for one day.
Immediate execution.

"Your Honour, can you give me face?"

Miss Shui.
Why are you here?
I come to save you.
"Alright, I'll pack up first."
I just want to prove your personality.
I am right.
You are a gutless coward.
What?
"If you leave like this, you will be sinful forever."
You can't live peacefully and you'd hide up for the rest of your life.
You would be a criminal forever.
I have decided to stay.
That's why I love you.
Creep!
"Ho Foon, someone comes to visit you."
Miss Shui.
Where did you cut your hair?
"Number 9, Nathan Road."
"Cut the crap, I won't go."

Mr F?
There is no date.

Thomery: during May.
During May...
"It is rather late May, because he was assassinated on the 30th."
Farewell!
Mr F.
"For god's sake, Fantômas wants to murder me?"
"Yes, but there is no date after your initials, then Fantomas has perhaps considered that your death was not essential."
It's still frightens me.
I thought you loved the danger?
"The danger, yes, but executions, no!"
"And finally, Bank:"
May 31.
And we are at May 31.
Of course it's the Barbey-Nanteuil bank.
Their deposit safes are in danger and also their lives.
He will act before midnight.
How do we play?
"I stay behind the scenes, you come into the scene."
Fantomas?
Please...
"The people need dreams or nightmares, but not us."
It is nonetheless true we are in danger.
"Gentlemen, would you offer me hospitality until tomorrow?"
- but i wouldn't have asked him to fix it.

they cooked his food in peanut oil.

"- [chuckling] well, hey."

"i mean, typical, right?"
he's such a little wussy.
"he couldn't even make it through one night at the clink, and it wasn't 'cause he was shanked, either."
it's 'cause of a peanut allergy.
"[chuckling] i mean, what a lame-ass, right?"
- it's not funny!

"Maria FIageIIo, insured mail and financial services."
"- You're late, it's 9."
- We always open at 9.
You take life easy here.
- would you show me my office?
- Of course.
"What's the difference between ""nor-d"" and ""north""?"
A guy tries to be polite!
"I can tell right off, this guy's a nice person, you can see by his ears."
During office hours let's dress appropriately.
He means me.
This guy wants us to sweat blood.
You'II see.
- Who brought Maria here?
- I don't know.
You forgot your snack.
"I'm 35, and you still bring me snacks?"
"Wait, take a little mozzarella."
"He's a genius, right?"
And you're his partner.
Partner/ babysitter/assistant/ babysitter.

"Ms. Teeger,"
"I know this probably sounds callous, but have you ever done any acting?"
Me?
- No!
"- Well, here's my problem."
"We've got another show tomorrow night, and"
"I know it's terrible timing, but we need someone to pick the numbers."
You mean on Tv?
I think you're a natural.
"- No, I don't think so."
- Here you go.
I was just talking to his nephew on the phone.
He couldn't even believe it was really me.
Felt like felt like fats Domino.
"Mr. Monk, this is Mr. Lawrence."
He's the station manager.
He just asked me to be the new Lotto girl.
Only for one night.
We can hold a regular audition over the weekend.
What do you think?
I don't know.
What do you think?
- I think it sounds like fun.
"- I know, but here's the thing."
Tomorrow is... wednesday.
- We already made plans.
- What plans?
-I'm not really reading it.
-You just looking at it?
I'm skimming it.
-Is it helping?
"-Yeah, it's informative."
-It's good for an overview.
"-What, like a primer?"
"-Yeah, something like that."
"-Getting the basics, a light survey of popular culture."
-Are you teasing me?
-No.
Should I be reading the Journal of Medicine or the Harvard Review?
Would that be more appropriate?
-Something more scholarly?
"-No, come on, Al."
I was teasing.
"I could harass you about those porno magazines, but I didn't even bring it up."
Wha--?
Come on.
I don't care about the porno magazines.
-I just didn't know you liked Juggs.
"-Oh, God."
-Sorry I don't have enormous breasts.
"-Please, stop it."
Your breasts are fine.
Your breasts are perfect.
Really.
"Yeah, but who's had 72 lovers?"
Where did you come up with that fucking number?
I'm guessing from what you said.
"Well, I'm 16 years older than you."
That's a lifetime of fucking.
Natasha Franks.
Yeah JP shoots her all the time.
What about her?
Ok I just read this it was on CMZ.
"So ""Natasha Franks, German supermodel."
Recently has confirmed reports that she is Three months pregnant.
Sources confirm that celebrity... fashion photographer JP Gio.
Whatever his name is...
is the father.
JP is well known as a Los Angeles savant and has been linked to several Hollywood socialites.
"Stay tuned... as the story develops."""
I'm done.
I'm sorry.
I'm done dating men in this city.
So tired of being the nice girl that always get burnt.
"Wait, wait..."
I mean this guy's a jerk.
No I...
"Hey, Dale."
Hey.
Hi.
Zach.
"You look, you look fantastic."
"Oh, thanks I..."
I cut my bangs.
It suits you very much.
I knew ZACH before he was a rock star.
He was the lead singer of this cool garage band.
"Now he's got four Grammys, and he's a shoe in for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
But to me... he'll all ways be good old Zach.
"Wow, long time no see."
"Ah, this is my friend Hallie."
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Bye.
Dad!
"Serena, I thought you left."
Um...
Is everything okay?
"Not really, no."
"I heard what you said in your speech,"
"And if you want to fight for mom, then you should do it."
Ahem.
Hi.
I think you girls got some misinformation.
I will be attending Columbia in the fall.
Oh.
"Well, that's awesome."
We have an extra room in the apartment.
Maybe you wanna move in with us?
No.
I don't live with the help.
"Oh, and you wanted to see a Blair Waldorf takedown?"
"Well, cross me again,"
And you'll experience one firsthand.
Hello?
"Hey, it's Jenny."
I want to talk to you about Lily.
"Obviously, I'm not a doctor,"
"And it's kind of a long story how I know this,"
But there's something weird about her medicine.
Elliot's the perfect mix of smart and fun.
"He speaks three languages,"
"But he has a subscription to ""People"" magazine."
I could not contact her either.
"Seeing everything that is happening now,"
I'm worried about her safety!
"She should be safe, Manoj."
Is Ashwini's number?
7599... 44... 7333?
Yes!
How do you know it?
We will explain.
If we need to find Ashwini...
We need some details about her.
Since when do you know Ashwini?
Recently...
Not too long ago...
She came to see my sculptures.
We became friends.
You said Ashwini was an NRI?
Yes.
From Singapore.
She has some ancestral property near Nagercoil.
She had come to sell it.
Was she staying with you?
At first she was staying outside.
As we got closer...
She came here and stayed with me.
I was happy every single moment that I spent with her.
She loved me as well.
But everything turned up-side-down in one night.
Maybe Ashwini has gone back to Singapore.
Do you have that contact number?
"Her E-mail ID, Facebook ID, or something like that?"
No.
"For all intents and purposes, it already happened."
(INHALES) I mean...
I'm in the room.
I don't look mad or pissed.
(CLEARS THROAT)
The painting's coming out great.
Yeah.
The painting's coming out great.
You probably asked us to do it for inspiration or something.
We're all friends.
And we just need to trust that it's going to be okay.
Fuck!
What the fuck was that for?
(SIGHS) That's for kissing my girlfriend tomorrow.
"T-minus one hour, in case you were wondering."
"Please, stop counting down like it's a fucking shuttle launch."
- Sorry.
- JASPER:
"Yeah, yeah."
I told you Crab Apple was a sure thing.
He just needed a few more races.
"Let's roll half the winnings into tomorrow's bets, and I'll come pick up the rest."
Uh-huh.
"Okay, yeah."
"Um, let me just get something to write on."
I thought there wasn't a bottle in the photo.
That's because it was down here.
"What time is it, babe?"
"Finn, you okay?"
"Yeah, uh, no."
It's this part of the painting-it's unfinished.
I'm clearly about to paint it.
"If you don't understand, I'm not going to explain."
- More?
- Why not?
Your father said to give you a big sendoff.
"Rodney, will I ever see you again?"
Can I compete with those Boston girls?
What are your qualifications?
- Can't you guess?
- Seeing is believing.
I think you're 10 percent man and 90 percent talk.
You're 100 percent woman.
Two hundred and fifty percent woman.
Maybe 500.
Going to take more than money to keep me.
Know what you're doing to my temperature?
- Let's cool it off and go for a swim.
- But we didn't bring any bathing suits.
"- You all ready, Norman?"
- Yeah.
Forgot my cap.
What did you say?
"Norman, you're making me blush all over."
I'm sorry.
Let's go in swimming.
What did you whistle for?
"I saw a fellow and a girl swimming, without a stitch on."
- Where?
- They're gone now.
They got out of the water and ran into the woods.
- Naked?
- Naked.
It was Allison MacKenzie and Norman Page.
Sis!
Look!
You're right!
It's really beautiful!
"It's been a while since you have looked like this, Sis!"
Really?
Yeah!
You looked like this for a long time!
Was it really like that?
It looks lke you became her wind.
Eh?
"To that kid, your point of view is like a wind to the fog around her."
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Don't worry about it.
"More importantly, did you bring what you wrote?"
"Yeah, I did."
I am still good friends with Saho-san.
Saho-san's smoke will never vanish.
It only disappears for a little while.
"It's weird, but I really feel like I understand your stories, Hibara-san."
Thank you.
"When we talk, Saho-san's smoke sometimes vanishes."
I am happy even if I can only become Saho-san's wind every so often.
"I really don't like when the seasons change, because they start to come out."
HA HA HA!
I'm not worried about it!
What's with that weird confidence you have?
!
"Could it be that it happened again, Mizuki?"
!
Yeah!
But this time...
"My company keeps a suite here all year round, in case of emergency."
Keeps a suite here?
"Pretty big outfit, huh?"
TUBBY:
"Yeah, it's his outfit-- Rutlege Cotton Mills."
-Cotton mills?
-Yeah.
"Well, hey, Tubb, you can shack up with me here."
You don't have to rent a room.
"Well, I got my own apartment right around the corner on Park Avenue."
-Park Avenue?
-Yeah.
Where else would a Park Avenue doctor live?
-Doctor?
-Yeah.
"Why, this poor soul couldn't open a can of rations without cutting his finger."
"Doctor, huh?"
Good boy.
"What are you doing, Bissel?"
Insurance.
Door-to-door?
"No, he's chairman of the board."
Chairman?
It figures.
"Say, you guys are doing all right."
(all chattering at once)
MORGAN:
"Now, Bilk, we have to..."
"You know, Bilk, it takes a lot of angling and finagling to make a success of yourself in the world today."
"Of course, we spent three years training under you-- the master."
Master?
How'd you find out I was a master?
(MAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
She's coming with us.
Eh!
Eh!
We have to do something.
"Yes, but in due time."
How can you be so calm?
"If you would be so kind, tell me the joke about the Spanish hell."
What are you doing here?
Thinking about how to get out.
Wait!
Wait.
Get me out of here.
I have an even more important secret for Himmler.
"Here inside there is a time door, only one."
I can show you hundreds.
Traitor.
(WHISPERS) You have no idea.
"I hate to disappoint you, but the Holy Grail isn't in Montserrat."
"Our only grail is our Blessed Virgin and our custom, to kiss her."
(MAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN)
Tell him that I hope he enjoys his cyanide.
You speak German.
-I studied in Tübingen.
"Look, I know that I can't prohibit you from treading this holy ground but I can confine myself to my cell until you leave here."
Take care not to break anything.
Should we fear God's wrath?
-No.
You should fear mine.
Heil Hitler.
Fräulein Lola Mendieta.
My daughter isn't depressed.
"Well, you mentioned her father and the separation."
You think I should take her to a psychiatrist?
No.
I think we should wait and see what happens with the Ritalin.
I think that's the answer.
-Okay.
"-Let's wait two, three weeks."
All right.
And the lies she's been telling?
"That's part of it, huh?"
-Lies?
-Like saying her bed's shaking.
That stuff.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear?
-To use obscenities?
"-No, never."
Hmm.
Interesting.
Similar-
- Similar to things like her lying...
-...it's uncharacteristic for her.
-I don't understand.
She doesn't swear.
"Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil."
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.
"Well, give me an example."
Like what?
"Specifically, what did she say?"
"Specifically, Mrs. MacNeil she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddamn cunt."
Shepherd.
Might as well do it on your watch.
Grey's Anatomy Season 5 Episode 12 Sympathy for the Devil
Why do you have to live in Meredith's attic?
How am I supposed to sneak out of here with that frat party going on downstairs?
Don't you kids ever sleep?
They're cleaning the house for dr.
Shepherd's mother.
Mrs. Shepherd is coming?
- To Seattle?
- So?
"So that woman practically raised me, taught me right from wrong, and if she found out that I was..."
"With you, that we were..."
You're Meredith Grey's little sister.
You are forbidden fruit.
You are 25.
- You're a fetus.
- 24.
I skipped third grade.
I feel dirty.
10 bucks that she tanks in the first 5 minutes.
I have faith in Death.
She'll make a good impression.
She's holding that bottle of tequila like it's a life vest.
"Mer, don't listen to them."
- She's gonna love you.
- No.
Mothers don't love me.
Mothers like bright and bubbly and happy and...
Izzie.
Mothers love Izzie.
They do.
"- Oh, you're one of Stoney's boys?"
"- Uh, no."
You staff or intern?
Actually I'm a representative.
Reginald Webster of Delaware.
"Oh, fuck me."
"I'm sorry, Webster."
What can I do for you?
- I'm running late.
- I was hoping I could grab your attention for a second.
- What's the skinny?
"- Well, uh..."
"- I'm late, Mr. Webster."
- I understand a chair's opened up in the committee... and I'd like to put my name forward.
I believe you'll find me industrious and hardworking.
The Judiciary's for senior members.
Wheeling was in for five terms before we let him in.
My hands are tied.
There's nothing I can do.
"Shelly, I've been trying to reach you for five days."
- I left you 32 messages.
"- Well, leave me a 33rd."
- Where you from?
- Delaware.
"Oh, yeah, you were..."
You knocked Emory Bettis out.
Emory used to be in the Thursday night game.

Get over it!
All right look at me!
I wear Day-Glo wigs.
I dress like a Japanese cartoon character.
How can she not know who Lola is?
Come on she's dating Jackson.
She's one drumstick short of a jumbo bucket.
Now can we get back to the person with the real problem?
[Gasps] Lola's real to me.
You're scaring me.
So..?

This guy's hearing is really sharp.
But anyways...

"Just relax, ellen."
This is so dangerous!
We have no business being in an area like this!
This is a part of America we never get to see.
That`s good!
"No, that`s bad."
We can`t close our eyes to the plight of the cities.
"Kids, are you noticing all this plight?"
This will just make us appreciate what we have.

This little Jacques Dollon has talent.

How is it going in Santo Domingo?
Very well.
I just bought 2 acres of land.
I was able to extend my sugar cane plantations.

-Where are you going;
At Charley's.
Cards are pretty hot for me today.
You better not get fresh with Charley.
He can teach you.
Yeah;
"Charley said you were pretty good at cards, but I was better."
I can take Charley the best day he ever lived with you standing on his shoulders.
"Try it any time you say, colonel."
Any time at all.
I'll bet the women spoil him silly.
-Yeah.

Then there's a description of what's on the stage.
It says here...
"""Waiting room in the clinic of Dr. Reno Laroire."""
I want to talk about what happened before.
- I don't.
Why is it so important to you that I direct there?
Because you're a wonderful director.
"""Waiting room in the clinic of Dr. Reno Laroire."""
"I'm not so sure anymore, Goni."
You could still direct so many beautiful plays.
"""Waiting room in the clinic of Dr. Reno Laroire."""
"""The walls are covered with diplomas..."
"""and with anatomic sketches of the human body."
"""Anatomic drawings."""
"Anatomic drawings, not sketches."

I remember running to the door and falling on the ground.
"And thinking,"
"""Why isn't Colin here?"
"""He should be here."""
Do you know where he was?
It's not like I know her name.
Got a friend you can stay with?
No.
I'm just the girlfriend from back home.
So I left The Edison with a buddy around 1:00.
And I just passed out back at his place.
His name?
What does that matter?
So I can confirm your whereabouts.
"Hey, come on, man, you can't actually think that I would..."
That's why I need his name.
Look...
I love Miranda.
All right.
Give me her name.
She's in the business.
I...
It wouldn't feel right to give you her name until my people talk to her people.
You do know I can ask anyone of a dozen photographers who you left The Edison with.
I didn't...
I didn't cheat on Miranda.
Colin cheated on Miranda with Chelsea Sennett.

No building is impenetrable.
"Ladies and gentlemen, our pal leet brannis."
Coroner says the amalgam in his teeth is russian.
Yeah?
How did he get the scar?
His voice box was cut out.
Mm.
Probably happened during the war.
Russian rifle division...
the 478th.
"Now, you ready to have your socks knocked off?"
Leet brannis died.
"I know that, son."
I'm staring at his corpse.
Two years ago.
Guy I knew in basic ended up in the u.S. Embassy in moscow.
I had him dig into the 478th.
"Turns out, they were wiped out in '44"
"In the battle of finow, germany."
Dead don't walk.
"At least, not in my experience."
Where we at with your guy?
Check it out.
"So, uh, President Bush is in the news again."
Have you heard about this?
"No, Jay Leno."
The host of the Tonight Show.
I thought that's what I was doing.
"So, uh, my wife Mavis and I like to go shopping for old cars."
You know?
"No, no."
Like Jay Leno.
"Like, ""Hey, here are the headlines."""
"You ever--you ever notice when you eat a lot of cheese, and you--"
"How is that different from what I was doing, though?"
And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group.
I agree.
"I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not."
"Well, Kenneth, just respect their privacy."
"I promise I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger."
Sure you will.
I just-- I just love television so much.
We all do.
"Liz, they want you and Pete on the 50th floor."
"Who, Gary?"
Tell him I'll be up in half an hour.
"No, they said now."
"If they got cookies up there, grab some."
"Ooh, and get them to pay for my Samovar."
"Of course, I mean, I assume that's what we're meeting about."
"What about, uh, Ray Romano?"
Can you do Ray?
Hey.
"God, oh."
I swear.
Lance Crawford?
Mom!
"Hello, Eric."
Your father and I were just discussing... how unrealistically space travel is portrayed in Star Wars.
"It was a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."
- You either buy it or you don't.
- What a lively conversation. [Laughing]
- I'll get some sodas.
"- No, please."
Allow me.
Why don't you stay here and chat with Mr. Unrealistic Space Travel.
"Yes, I'd love to explain the practical impossibility... of the so-called light saber."
You son of a bi-
"Red alert, you guys."
Red alert!
Lance Crawford is in the building!
- I'm gettin' the hell outta here!
"- [Jackie] Wait, wait, wait."
- What if he sees us sneaking out?
"- Oh, Donna... leave one of your socks behind."
[Groans]
What?
It'll distract him.
"Nina, I thought we were so happy together."
What happened?
"Fez, right now I'm at a point in-"
"Oh, cut the crap, heartbreaker."
I want the truth!
"Okay, the truth is you're too needy."
Too needy?
"I'm sorry, but a man in his sexual prime has needs."
Betty... .
- Rodney asked me to take care of you.
- I don't need your help.
But I need yours.
Rodney was a better boy for having married you.
"When I was 6 years old, I was in love with Rodney."
"For years afterwards, I never even thought about anybody else."
"I was a kind of flashy girl, I know, but Rodney liked flashy girls so that's the way I was gonna be."
"The funny thing is, Rodney always loved me as much as I loved him."
But you taught him appearances count more than feelings!
I was wrong.
Rodney discovered it.
Let's... .
Let's keep what's left of the family together.
"A little brighter one, please."
- Did you hear about Mr. Rossi?
"- No, what?"
- He's leaving town.
- Leaving?
Not really.
They're trying to get him to be principal of a high school in Portland.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
I got it firsthand.
From Mr. Rossi?
"From Kathy, who got it from Betty, who got it from Ms. Thornton."
- I suppose that's firsthand.
- We won't be able to keep him here.
- This is kind of nice.
Can I try it on?
"- Sure, come on."
Merry Christmas.
I had a great kid.
He was gonna be a baker.
"Oh, I know, it's not much."
"[Louise Clicks Teeth, Heaves Long Sigh]"
But I set up everything for him.
"[Shouting] Now, listen!"
I've heard your garbage!
Now you listen to mine!
He hasn't heard it!
All right.
"Anyway, I set up everything for him."
"On his high school graduation night, he... he got drunk... a little bit of the old man."
"And I swear to God, he did something I never understood."
He enlisted.
Can you imagine enlisting... in a day and age like this?
"He wanted to go his own way, I guess."
"Anyway, they sent him toJapan."
They were gonna teach him this and that.
"Well, he never got toJapan!"
He only got to Okinawa!
And he got into a fight!
And he was killed in some town called Naha!
- Where is Naha!
"- Oh, come on."
"Seymour, it's all right."
"That's all over and done with now, anyway."
- He was all I had.
- Mr. Seymour.
Your son enlisted in the marines?
Yeah.
"Yeah, it was the dumb marines."
And you're a dumb person for stirring things up the first time you get around here.
So why would he disappear?
Did he have money worries?
Did he have marital problems?
Did he have money worries?
Did he have marital problems?

Huh?

Hello?
"Hi, baby."
"Yeah, everything's cool."
"Yeah, everything's real cool."
"Uh, where are you calling from?"
"Okay, what's the name of the gas station?"
Mmm-hmm.
"Ray, you already missed the turnoff."
It's about half a mile back up the highway.
Mmm-hmm.
"Uh, there's..."
"You turn right at this place called ""Cothern's Bait Shop."""
"Yeah, there's a little road there."
"Yeah, you're not far, baby."
Just about 10 minutes away.

"Yeah, I miss you."
(ENGINE STARTING)
"Is that the road, Byron?"
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
"Lila, when they get here, I want you to get them inside the house and away from the car."
"Open the door, wave at them, talk to them, just let them see everything's okay."
"Well, hello."
I didn't think you'd be here.
I thought your husband--
"Oh, yes, he's off on another one of those trips."
But why should that stop me from traveling?
"See you later, maybe?"
We had the pleasure of meeting him last summer in Lausanne.
I'd taken Merle to Switzerland.
"The trip was very beneficial, I thought."
Poor Olivia.
What was he like?
"Oh, it was indeed a rare privilege."
He is such a quaint old gentleman.
"He speaks perfect English, but I am sure he learned it from reading the classics."
[laughter]
He always referred to me as Mistress Langley.
It sounded terribly elegant but a little bit naughty.

Margo Stevens?
"OK, I think we'll do physics, please."
"You've chosen physics, and we now reveal exactly what you'll be looking for."
"You'll have ten seconds to confer as a team, and then you answer on your own."
"Remember, you've got two passes, but the one wrong answer and your team will be locked out of the hive."
"So, you've chosen physics as a topic."
You are looking for electrical components.
You've got ten seconds to confer.

"Boss,"
Baltimore PD's got a suspect in custody.
Got a 911 call about Petty Officer Adams before the sailors found him.
Came from a auto-repair shop two blocks away.
Said they found a mechanic there trying to wash blood off his hands and jacket.
Got the suspect's jacket.
"Lot of blood, boss."
Is this your jacket?
"Look, I'm being railroaded here."
What's your name?
Michael Thomas.
"You got a lawyer to call, Mr. Thomas?"
"No, I want to call someone else."
"They've got this all wrong, Leon."
"Just do what they say, Michael."
I'll take him to processing.
Your wife's kid brother?
"He's my family, too, Gibbs."
- Then you'll be recusing yourself.
- For what reason?
"He's a murder suspect, Leon."
"Those are your rules, not mine."
"I'm well aware, Gibbs, but as long as he's your suspect, I'm going, too."
"Gibbs, give us a minute."
Is that a problem?
"All right, just tell me, Michael."
Tell me you didn't do this.
"Leon, no, I was just trying to help the guy."
And you didn't know Petty Officer Adams?
"I'm the house, you're the player."
"I believe the word is ""sucker. """
Okay.
"I've got a nine up, and you've got a five and a six for 11."
Do you want a card?
I want to double down.
"KITT, that's doubling your bet and you only get one card."
You sure you wanna do that?
Is the house in the habit of advising the player?
Your money.
I believe that's 21.
"Thank you, michael."
"They call that ""beginner's luck,"" pal."
"As I understand it, the phrase is,"
"""shut up and deal. """
"Hold on to your horses, hotshot, we've got Devon on the line."
"Hello, Devon!"

"Yeah, I'm already $2 behind."
What's up?
"Uh, there's, uh, someone I want you to check out for me since you're going through Las Vegas, anyway."
"Her name is, um, Rita Wilcox."
She works at Caesars Palace.
"Okay, what are we looking for?"
I'm not sure.
She tells a provocative but fantastic story about a missing brother.
All right.
I'll see what she has to say.
"With any luck, we should be pulling in to Vegas about 10:00, 10:30 tonight."
See you later.
Right.

Kevin Grey.
"If Grey moors up the boat here at the end of the runway, in theory, he could just walk onto a plane."
- What's the flight schedule tonight?
- I'll get on it.
"Don't let me keep you, DS Chohan."
- How's Anna?

Ran into her last month at the Old Bailey.
She was on terrific form.
Tore the case apart.

Yes.

"Death is expensive, Miss stella."

I sold a whole street once.
"When I had the business, your father was still alive."
Yeah.
He used to come home and go upstairs.
I had his supper ready for him on the table.
"When he came down, I went up... and I had a little - a little snack, a little supper- nothing much."
I was always very busy.
Do you remember Mr. Goldhar?
- Yep.
- He came every day.

"Well, you were wondering ifhe was Goodman or..."
He was a very nice man...
Mr. Goldhar.
And he loved me - not in that way.
But
"- Oh, well, he - he put his arms around me."
He kissed me.
He loved me.
He laughed.
He did anything I told him to.
He came every day for breakfast.
"He was there at about, uh, 6:30, 7:00 for breakfast."
He says his wife is still sleeping.
She doesn't make him breakfast.

They have honored me with their support and their friendship.
Of course.
It took me about a week of sneaking around before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.
"But when I did, it was a real score."
I started using Sandy's place to mix the stuff.
"And even with Sandy snorting more than she mixed, I could see that this was a really good business."
"I made $12,000 in my second week."
I had a down payment on my house and things were really rolling.
All I had to do was every once in a while was tell Sandy that I loved her.
But it was perfect.
I'm tellin' ya...
"As long as I kept getting the stuff from Pittsburgh, I knew Paulie would never find out."
Within a couple of weeks it got so big...
I needed some help.
So I got Jimmy and Tommy to come in with me.
Nice...
It's fuckin' great.
-Nice...
Mr. Conway?
!
You bring your pay slips?
Four and a half months of dirt.
-lt's so good.
-l did it.
-Do you love it?
"-Oh, it's wonderful."
This we just had to have made special.
"Go ahead, sit in it, Belle."
The others you couldn't even sit in.
"Okay, you ready?"
Watch the wall with the rock.
The electricians did it special.
Come on...
"Truth or Dare, Mr. Gimp?"
"Sorry, what was that?"
- I can't hear you.
- Leave him alone.
"Shut your trap, ugly!"
Gemma.
Gemma.
"Oh, no."
This is all your fault.
Think about it.
When exactly did Felix string himself up?
The night after the party?
No.
The night before his big brother came home.
"Truth, Felix..."
Who were you afraid of?
Who made you so fucking scared that you'd rather die?
Than have him find out what happened.
"Show me with your eyes, Felix."
Show him.
"What's this about, brother?"
It was meant to be a fucking joke.
A little prank... to teach my lazy arse boyfriend a lesson
"I was drunk, Felix was willing."
A little too willing.
That's what this is about.
Isn't it?
He hanged himself!
My dad's company went down the pan a few months ago.
"Not that you'd give a toss, Justin!"
But I thought that just maybe the Hautbois family could help out.
"I sent Felix an email... very polite... wondering if, uh, he could talk to his family about refloating my dad's company."
"But we can deal with you, can't we?"
Idiots!
Bring me the wine!
Bring the wine!
Drink!
Look!
I'm Mouna Rudo I killed at Hakaw Supeitei a chief of the intruders
Mouna Rudo?
You're Mouna Rudo?
"Yes, I am"
Mouna Rudo!
Chief?
Chief?
Where is Mouna Rudo?
I couldn't get him drunk
Wake up!
Those Bununs from Kntabang Clan are hunting heads
Get up!
Let's go!
Let's get out of here!
Hurry!

"She is an attorney S. Mazerat, Sophie and she slept with him."
Counterterrorism has his record?
To call them?
-Absolutely not!
Not a word.
Tomorrow we will try and arrest Shack know that it is connected with Riffautom.
"Not a word, especially not Hervilleu."
Thomas Riffaut is ours.

See you tomorrow!
-Until tomorrow!
Do you have any plans?
Are you for dinner?
"Gilo, hold me!"

Previously on Teen Wolf
Someone's controlling him.
You promised this was only gonna be for a few weeks.
"Look, just because we're in a trailer does not mean we're trailer park trash."
Exactly.
We're worse.
We don't even have enough money to be in a trailer park.
"Don't have a meltdown, okay?"
It's port wine.
From Portugal.
Wine?
You were supposed to get decorations for the class.
Sorry.
I tried to go this morning but there was this huge line at Portuguese Party City.
- Really?
- No.
There's no Portuguese Party City.
There's no Portuguese anything.
How'd we end up with Portugal?
I was working during the sign up.
"By the time I got there, the only country left was Portugal."
There's a Portuguese family in the class and even they picked Jamaica.
"Ritchie, come on."
"We're late, we're late."
- I don't wanna be late for this thing.
- What should I wear?
We're supposed to dress like our country.
Oh.
"Well, wear anything."
Stand next to the kid dressed as Spain.
- Everyone will buy it.
- Okay.
You think they eat Raisin Bran in Portugal?
"Yes, but in Portugal, they call it..."
[PORTUGUESE ACCENT] ...Raisin Bran.
[CHRISTINE GRO ANS]
- I don't wanna do this.
"- Well, why'd you sign up for it?"
"Oh, Richard, you don't know this school."
"They've got a million events a week and you gotta volunteer and if you don't, they ostracize you."
"- Yeah, seriously, Ted."
Pretending to be someone else just to get laid... that's...
Embarrassing.
- Your Highness.
- Let's go.
Oh.
Ew.
"Marshall, take that off."
- What?
I think it looks kind of cool.
- Cool?
You look like one of those jerks who's in some lame band... and rides a motorcycle without a helmet... and has a wallet chain and neck tattoos and a drug problem.
"Not a... a big one, just, uh, enough that he deals a little bit on the side."
"And he can never, ever be true to one woman."
Finish that damn pickle and do me!
"Okay, you guys know how my mornings usually go."
- Why would we care how...
"- Usually, it's like this."
- After you.
- Oh.
Thank you.

I didn't think you were ever gonna do anything.
"As long as I've known you,"
You've been all talk and no action.
You found a rat's foot in a can of chili and never got around
To writing a letter.
I was just so mad at ms.
Rinsky!
Why are you talking about ms.
Rinsky?
"It's nothing, honey."
Everything's fine.
"Well, I love ms."
Rinsky.
She's great.
She gives us candy when we get the answers right.
Yeah.
I know you like ms.
"Rinsky, but she's not perfect."
"Don't forget, you got a ""d"" on that test."
"Yeah, I'm thinking"
That might be 'cause I only answered three questions.
How many questions were there?
45.
Brick!
She said we could have free reading time
"When we finished the test, so I finished in five minutes."
"You're lucky you got a ""d."""
I know.
Ms. Rinsky's the best.
"So Axl and Sue decided, whatever it took,"
They were gonna help aunt Edie find that time capsule...
( camera shutter clicks )
"Um, did you just take a screen grab?"
No!
Why would I take a screen grab of you?
I got the real thing.
Come on.
Okay.
Don't get lube all over your phone.
"Hike your ass up, please?"
God damn.
"Sexy, yes."
Just a little bit more.
Arch your back.
Fuck.
Damn!
Tom and Gisele floating on a 300-footer in Saint-Tropez.
"Man, that's a long-ass way from that raft we used to float on at Jim McMahon's aboveground pool."
Where you see that?
Where I see everything... 'Gram.
You follow Tom Brady?
Just so I don't look like a creep following his wife.
"Plus, he only posts pictures of him practicing and wearing them ugly-ass Uggs."
"Wait, I can't believe they let your old ass on the 'Gram, Dennis."
"Motherfucker, there's no age limit looking at fine-ass women."
Is this you with all the Pam Grier pics?
That's my Woman Crush Wednesday every day.
Because she ain't no Ashley Graham.
"And I hate to break it to you, but she ain't looking like this anymore."
"Hey, careful, boy."
That's my girl.
"And FYI, she's still fine as fuck, all right?"
- Fine...
- You should be afraid.
I can't allow you...
I don't care about the timeline.
You're taking me back now.
"Look, Sara, I'm sure there's a valid reason why Rip didn't..."
Stay out of this!
"What the hell, Rip?"
"Mr. Rory, take Ms. Lance to sleep it off."
"Not to dismiss what just happened, but we do have to find Savage, assuming that Kendra and Carter are still on his timeship."
- He could...
- Be anywhere in time and space.
"Oh, well that narrows it down a lot."
Sorry.
Was this always over here?
"No, it lives over..."
- Did you put it there?
"- Nah, man."
- Did you?
"- Dude, it's just a helmet."
- Chronometric repositioning.
- What?
"Temporal changes can, on occasion, reverberate through the timeline, physically moving an object from one place to another."
- Gideon?
"- Yes, Captain."
"Plot a course for Saint-Lô, France, 1944."
Why then?
Because that's where Kendra is.
How is that possible?
She sent us a message through time.
"Go ahead, say it."
Astonishing.
Oh.
"Why you put up ""Sold""?"
Because it is sold to another party.
"A shoe company, Axel."
"They wanted a bigger area, but--"
No.
You cannot.
Now you listen to me.
I warned you I couldn't wait.
"I'd be a fool to, particularly after that check bounced."
Like I told the church committee--
"Wait, wait."
Bounced?
What check bounced?
"That personal check for 50,000 from Somers."
"I wanted to tell you about it the day I talked to you, but she didn't want me to."
She?
Your friend from Beverly Hills.
"Axel, I know Miss Morrow's done quite a good promotion job."
At least she sure did sweep everybody around here off their feet.
"If you got something inside, say it."
Don't make up the words.
I tried to get hold of her all day.
Best I could do was a lot of messages she was tied up someplace.
"Tied up, my foot."
My wife saw her car parked at a bar down the highway not more than two hours ago.
- Where?
- Outside a motel.
The Windmill Inn.
## [loud jazz]
Lars!
Lars!
Come here quick!
I even tracked down Mrs. Klinger.
"FYI, if you want some vodka, get it now."
"And, uh... here is... a first edition of Charlotte's Web, which I believe was your favorite book from that year."
Can I see you for a moment?
Excuse us.
I can't take it anymore.
"I know you love me, I do, but I am drowning in it."
"Sweetie, I think we-"
Shh!
Who does this?
It's like...
"On our birthdays, I got you a sweater."
You had a plane skywriting for me-
"Seriously, this just-"
Shh!
And it's not just the big days.
It's every day.
Cute little notes under my pillow.
And in the refrigerator.
And in my diaphragm case.
"Oh, I-"
It is too much.
And I don't think there is a woman in the world who would disagree with me!
"God, I would."
- Excuse me?
"- Oh, but..."
I
- I'm sorry.
It's-but
"- Everything you just said sounded really, really nice."
"I mean, seriously, if I had someone doing amazing, travagant things for me every day, I"
- I think I'd just shut up.
Average?
And speed and endurance of a questionable nature.
Shoot!
"Now there's no way this specimen could complete, let alone compete in, the Iron Man competition... unless..."
Let me guess.
"Well, unless what?"
"Your boy gets a first-class, knowledgeable, certified trainer to guide him to a winning body."
"Yeah, but where do I get that?"
"I mean, a dude like that's gotta cost big bucks."
"Not a dude, T.C."
"A ""dudette."" Am I right, Barbara?"
"Modestly, yes."
The pride of Bayonne.
The top instructor at the Firmer Body in Ten Days Figure Salon.
"And in return for my services, Magnum continues to search for Roger... and then runs the Iron Man to pay his debts to you."
Deal?
You got it.
No!
And a one and a two... and a three and a four.
And a one and a two... and a three and a four.
And breathe.
And a one and a two and a breathe.
"Good morning, Barbara."
Very subtle.
You're wasting your time.
I don't want to play.
"Oh, now, Magnum."
"Now, the secret here, you see, is knees to chest."
Knees to chest.
Try it.
Now...
"I am heading for a swim, and when I get back, Barbara..."
Love you too.
Bye.
Georgie?
What's gonna happen at the appointment tomorrow?
It'll be fine.
I called Clint and I left a message.
He knows us and he loves you.
Just be totally honest and nothing bad can happen.
"That hasn't always worked, even with Clint."
Look.
I know that you were disappointed when we asked your aunt Crystal to leave.
And I know that you wish things could've turned out differently.
No.
I don't.
Not anymore.
And I-I was just on the phone with Jeffie and he remembers Crystal.
My mom...
She didn't trust her and... she said she was a bad influence on us.
Come here.
"Everything's gonna be all right, okay?"
"Amy, honey, I thought you did a great job at that meeting today."
"Well, at least it was a step."
"Now that I can get close to Matt's horses, I can start to gentle them."
Yeah?
And how do you plan on doing that?
"Hopefully, right under Matt's nose, and then I'll find homes for them."
Great.
Hey.
"It's really beautiful out there, Amy."
You wanna go for a walk?
"You should, you should."
I'll-I'll put wood on the fire and keep it going till you get back.
he's been here a million times.
"- i'm not a psychic or anything, but... i don't think she's gonna give him a tour -- not of the house, anyway."

"- hey, i still got it."
- [chuckles]
- we still got it.
"- you know, i cannot believe that dirty ho is sleeping with my man."
- [chuckles] i thought wayne was your man.

[urinating] hey!

Tiny Eyes!
Tiny Eyes!
Whoo!
"Hey, everybody, let me see."
"Yeah, back and forth."
This is old-school.
It's how you did it.
- Uh-huh.
Shore:
"- Mr. Ellis, Mr. Ellis, this is Mr. Danner."
He is the lead soprano in the Gulfhaven Glee Club.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Kind of a nerd.
- [ All groan ]
"- So, we hired him as our full-time music teacher, so we don't need you anymore."
"No, but the recital."
"N-no, but thank you."
But our jam is def.
"All right, do you have enough for the repairs?"
'Cause we got to get this baby rolling!
- Bye.
- [ Beep ]
Get what baby rolling?
Your baby. [ Laughs ] Obviously.
- Should be rolling by now.
- Jules?
"Okay, well, you told me that I should talk to Trav about being more responsible, so I did."
"And then we bought this old van, and Trav's a genius, and Scooby-Doo, and you're gonna be rich."
"Sweetie, I see that you are insanely excited about an old van and a plan from Travis that seems like the greatest idea of all time."
But it's not.
You have your mom goggles on.
"- ""Mom goggles""?"
Do not desire it.
Miss Dashwood.
Col. Brandon's lawn is perfect for kite launching.
Mind the pretty ribbons.
Imagine my surprise when Charlotte and her master appeared with Lucy.
The last person I expected to see.
She came to join in the fun.
There is no such luxury at home.
I'd not seen you for so long.
You sly thing!
It was the Dashwoods she wanted to see.
"I've heard nothing but ""Dashwood"" for I don't know how long."
What do you think of them?
My mother wrote of little else in her letters.
- Are they not as she described?
- Nothing like.
You are quite rude today.
He's to be an MP.
And he is forced to make everybody like him.
- I said nothing so irrational.
- Mr. Palmer's so droll.
Here he comes!
"Now you shall see, Charlotte."
"Hello, Mr. Willoughby!"
"You must meet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr. Palmer."
"- And our cousin, Miss Lucy Steele."
- Welcome to our party.
May I sit beside you?
I've longed to meet you.
I've heard nothing but praise for you.
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are too excessive in their compliments.
The praise came from another source.
Sam Polivy's back with a ureteral stone.
P-O-L-I-V-Y.
Abby?
Those labs back on Melinda Harrell?
- Let me check.
"- Hi, I'm Erin Harkins."
- I'm on the phone.
- You're busy.
We get it.
Can we get an approximate time orientation will begin?
Doctor?
Don't tell me you're keeping med students waiting.
- Check with Pratt.
- I'm checking with you.
- Intractable pain and hydronephrosis.
- Dr. Carter?
I cannot admit him to Eight West.
There are no beds.
"I'm Dr. Weaver, Chief of Emergency Medicine."
"I will give you a brief tour of the ambulance bay, after which our Chief Resident will give you his attention."
"Because, as you'll learn, it's his primary responsibility."
Come on.
- Sorry.
What was that?
- Demolition-site accident downtown.
- At least a dozen injuries.
- ETA?
- Now.
- I gotta call you back.
Paramedics can transport using standing field protocols-
- We've got multiples.
- Wait here.
Ha haahah!
"What's High School Musical 1 and-- dude, it's only the most popular thing with kids in our age group!"
"Yeah, where the hell have you guys been?"
Peru.
"And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there..."
Bridon Gueermo.
"Bridon Gueermo-- oh, he's such a dream!"
I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo.
"But he'd never go for me, I'm nobody."
"That's not true, Red."

Updates on Ridgeway's shooter.
Go.
Ridgeway was shot three days ago.
Ryan's had eyes on Wickes for the last week.
He wasn't the triggerman.
"Well, he could have ordered it earlier."
"McGee, e-mails?"
Wickes has contacted three people since we suggested the AUTEC connection to the SECNAV's shooting.
ZIVA:
"Bob ""Smitty"" Smith, Ronald Ostrowski, and Vice President Frank Satner."
TONY:
All haunt the Wickes Steel boardroom.
Whole lot of motive going on.
"Working to clear their backgrounds, but so far, all talks have been work-related and clean."
Look for codes.
Yeah.
And cross-reference keywords with recent e-mails.
Whoever shot Ridgeway wanted to keep him quiet for a reason.
Could be this.
Report detailing the project
Ridgeway worked on for AUTEC.
"Well, it's been redacted."
Yeah.
Can we get access?
Mm.
Won't be a cakewalk.
Leads on the AUTEC hacker?
"Whoever he is, he's good."
Hid his IP behind a wall of alternating secure servers.
We need to get in this report.
Okay.
RYAN:
What do you mean?
"There's got to be like a highway or something, right?"
"Yeah, there's got to be a highway."
What's going on up there?
Squad up
My niggas
"I see some pussy-ass niggas, so what the fuck--"
What the hell is this?
We knock these niggas out
"I see some pussy-ass niggas, so what the fuck you wanna do?"
- I'm turning around.
"- Nah, just go through, man."
"Dude, we're not driving through this basketball game."
"You know, Roldy, I really thought you were bigger than this."
"Dude, I'm not scared 'cause they're black."
I'm scared because they're scary.
And it's not like we got Gregory Hines out there.
They're not that scary.
It's my ball!
Turn around.
"Rob this motherfucker, drop his punk ass in a ditch"
"Drag this pussy nigga, slap his ass up like a bitch"
My niggas is my niggas 'cause my niggas--
- Fuck!
It won't move!
"- Shit, dude."
Shoot him dead between his lips
I see some pussy--
- That's not good.
"- Now there's no music, man."
"Shit, man."
- Motherfucker!
"Whatever you are doing, you drop it."
Governor McCallum is going to Charleston.
Then he's touring that chemical plant in Point Pleasant today.
"Now, I want you to go down there... and meet him at the airport."
You listening?
"Yeah, McCal I um at the chemical plant."
Got it.
I need to know that you're gonna be there.
"John, are you there?"
Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
I can't call in sick just because you have a bad feeling about today.
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.
They show up over the chemical plant.
"Josh gets a call from me, but it's not really me."
I'm talking about something bad happening at the chemical plant.
Then I get this message from this Indrid Cold... who's talking about a great tragedy on the Ohio River.
Guess what's on the Ohio River.
The chemical plant.
Today Governor McCallum is gonna be there.
I was on myway to interview him.
That's how I ended...
That's how I ended up here.
My God.
That's why I'm here.
He was right.
Who was right?
You saw Leek.
- He was part of the warning.
- What?
Is she wiping her tears?
"If it's evening now, Om must've changed into casuals"
Yes Ma...
Om...
Jai sends you his regards.
May he be happy
"Anyway Jags, I can't write anymore."
Any more of this and I'll cry
Take care of yourself.
My regards to everyone
"Jagadish, tell him I'll mail him his money soon"
What else did Jai write?
"Ma, the letter is over"
Are you forgetting something...?
Om... girl... wedding...?
Come on
"Son, you won't refuse me, will you?"
"Refuse what, Ma?"
I have chosen a girl for you.
What...?
No refusing
She will see you tomorrow at the club
"You will see her, won't you?"
After my life
Isn't he looking cute?
Give me that hand
"What are you upto, Ma?"
Are you here to see Shanti?
Yes
Ma ends up choosing this one for me?
I was shocked when I heard your name
You too aren't what your name suggests (Shanti:
"That's surprising, isn't it?"
Considering all the money he makes.
"I never question good fortune, Lieutenant."
All I know is that getting along with Ward Fowler is gonna be a lot easier from now on.
What about a drink?
That's amazing how she kept it from you.
Well she did.
I just found out about it.
"Yes, sir, I know."
Your accountant told me.
Oh.
"Well, good."
"Then that's it, huh?"
"Yes, sir, that's it."
"Oh, there's one more thing, sir."
Mr. Hart is in Rome.
He's gonna be back in his hotel room in a little while.
"Before I talk to him, were you really playing chess the other night?"
"Lieutenant, let's get it straight right now."
I was not with Leo Hart the other night.
"But I wasrt busy killing my wife, either."
(BUZZER SOUNDING)
"Yes, Mr. Daley?"
SID:
"Molly, would you come in for a minute?"
I need your help.
"Molly, would you please tell Lieutenant Columbo where I was on Thursday evening, the night my wife was killed?"
The truth.
"Mr. Daley was with me, Lieutenant."
We left the office together and we were together in my apartment until the next morning.
It's the truth.
"Yes, madam."
You just don't like him.
The guy...
Bugs me.
I don't know what it is.
Just look at his face.
Any other theories?
You okay?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Are you all right?
"Hey, you don't look so good."
I just need to get some water.
No one leaves their seats.
Stiles says you know how Jackson's parents died.
Maybe.
Talk.
It was a car accident.
"My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18."
"So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?"
Yep.
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report on my dad's in-box.
He keeps everything.
"Scott McCall, please report to the principal's office."
Jackson!
"I'm fine, just give me a minute."
Perfect.
Don't forget the dates.
"""Passengers arrived at the hospital doa."
The estimated time of death...
"9:26 P.M., June 14, 1995."""
Jackson's birthday is June 15th.
Very well.
Striking a superior is a court-martial offence.
Corporal Dawes says that he started it.
"So, I want to find out what really happened."
You go back under close arrest.
"Private McKendrick, about turn!"
"Private McKendrick, about turn!"
"Give me his service record, Sergeant Major."
"Yes, Sir."
"Angry man, that one."
"Some get that out of them, Sir."
Anger's good sometimes in a fighting soldier.
Properly directed.
Are you suggesting that he be given special treatment?
"On the contrary, Sergeant Major."
Let me see now.
Enlisted Montreal.
Place of birth...
Los Angeles.
"Anything else, Sir?"
College two years.
"Profession, just says ""aircraft industry"", that's all."
"Any previous military experience, Sir?"
None listed.
"Pretty vague, huh?"
I suppose when you're short of men you don't ask questions.
Ask the security boys to run a special check on him.
"Yes, Sir."
He interests me.
"Hi, there."
"No prison pallor, I see."
"What's this, Ladies Rehabilitation Society?"
Because you're kaputt.
Get this guy out of my hair so I can go.
To the kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
"Why, I'll kill you for that!"
Shut up.
"Security officer, huh?"
Always screening everybody.
"Only, who screens you?"
"Great American hero, from Cleveland, Ohio."
Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor.
When was Pearl Harbor?
Or don't you know that?
"- December 7th, '41."
-What time?
Six o'clock.
I was having dinner.
Six o'clock in Berlin.
They were having lunch in Cleveland.
"- Am I boring you, boys?"
-Go on.
"He's a Nazi, Price is."
"For all I know, his name is Preissinger or Preisshoffer."
"Oh, sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back like a good little Bundist."
"He spoke our lingo, so they sent him to spy school and fixed him up with phony dog tags."
He's lying.
He's trying to get himself off the hook.
- He said shut up.
-You heard what he said.
"Okay, Herr Preisshoffer, let's have the mailbox."
The what?
The one you took out from the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Let me show you how they did it.
- Bullying this poor lad!
-
- I saw him leading him by his ear.
-
- Ought to be ashamed!
Get this lot off me!
"Hey, Granville!"
"Get this lot off, Granville!"
He said he wanted people in the shop!
"Funny lot, women, when you look at 'em."
And I often do.
It took me all me time to calm that lot in the shop down before I could start selling.
Then I believe there were one that got away!
"Oh, God, don't say I've started slipping."
"I don't mind wearing glasses, Lord, or even a hearing aid."
"But if it's all the same to you,"
I'd like to stay young and very muscular when it comes to the acquisitive instinct!

That's tonight.
This is lunch.

Okay.

How come you're having a party on Saturday if it was two weeks ago?
"Christine was out of town, we couldn't get it together"
- and it worked out this Saturday.
- Why even have it all?
"Why not just forget it, wait till next year?"
- You blew it.
"- Yeah, I know."
"I wish we could've done it last week, but we couldn't get it together."
You should bring Cheryl.
It'll be fun.
Kind of reminds me a little of like President's Day.
It's not really the President's birthday.
It's some other day.

Right.
We're back.
Let's start at the top of the scene.
It's a total scam.
He introduced her as a model.
She's like completely bullshitting this guy 'cause he's blind.
- By the way...
- Yeah.
Thank you for coming to meet Kim.
I might've mentioned Kenny.
He's old my friend in New York.
She just moved out here from the city.
"This is his first daughter, and she calls me like Uncle Richard."
- I've known her since she was born.
- Really?
"That's fun, ""Uncle Richard."""
"Yeah, but the problem is she's an actress, a singer, talented but she wants to get her breasts enlarged, and it's gonna drive Kenny crazy..."
"I can forgive him, Elinor, and doing so, for the first time feel... free."
I am sorry for him.
"But I shall never forget how he made you suffer, nor his guilty conduct towards Eliza Williams."
- It is all very well his still loving you...
"- Mama, enough has been said."
"...but he will always be extravagant and selfish, however often he repents."
And if you had married him...
"Oh, dear!"
I should never have been happy with him.
I know.
"Elinor told me today all that I wanted to hear, and I am satisfied."
"- And that is all, Mother."
"- Well, you need plenty of occupation."
- (SLAMS)
- Tom?
(TOM) Ma'am.
I'm glad Colonel Brandon is coming tomorrow.
Ah.
Phew!
I never seen Exeter so crowded.
Not this time of year.
I got everything you wanted.
"Sack of provisions, your linen and stuff."
- Miss Marianne.
- Thank you.
"That is excellent, Tom."
That's not quite the blue I wanted.
- Never mind.
- My dear.
Old Martin talked all the way there and back.
"He can talk, can old Martin."
- His Sukey's had another baby girl.
Hey.
Keep your lens up here.
"Guys, Martin Scorsese."

t's strange going from being around your family constantly to being with these guys.
But lik e knowing that there's four of your best mates it's a great feeling to know that you're not in it by yourself.
I can't believe I'm at MSG!
I'm just a little boy from Bradford and now I'm smashing it!
And you sort of feel so proud.
You feel like your heart could burst sometimes.
AII right.
Let's give it our all.
"Come on, guys."
Come on!
n the back of your mind  there's always this bit of feeling  that you gotta kind of be ready to pick up the pieces if it stops.
And it hasn't stopped.

- Where would I get make-up?
- From Claire's.
"Later, I'll tell you a terrible secret about Charles"
"Ah yes, what secret?"
Go ask her to dance
I don't know how to dance
"Neither does she, go on"
I can't dance
I want to
"You dance terrific, like in the movies"

The Mayor wants a word.
He refused to go away
He can return tomorrow when Edward is here
He insists
I'll see him
Save a little champagne.

You let me in before.
I have new orders from Major Hayes.
"Look, T'Pol was a little rough with me during the last session."
I think she caused some nerve damage.
MACO:
You'll have to speak with the Major.
This is a Starfleet ship.
I don't have to ask Major Hayes for anything.
MACO:
"Step away, sir."
REED:
"Stand down, Corporal."
The Captain gave Hayes control of the Bridge... posted macos on every deck.
-Is he still on the surface?
-Yeah.
Retrieving him and the antimatter should be the priority.
I'd advise securing the Bridge first.
If Hayes gets wind of this... we could have a fire-fight on our hands.
"Perhaps we should approach the Major, and explain the situation."
-He seems like a reasonable man.
-That would be risky.
"If Hayes sides with the Captain, this mutiny will be over before it begins."
We'll need more people.
Who's on duty in the Armoury?
Ensign Walsh and two of my men.
"They'll side with us, but Hayes posted two MACO there."
-Take the shuttlepod back to Enterprise.
"-What about you, sir?"
You heard me.
REED:
This place is loaded.
Did you find this?
!
No.
Did you find it?

In another guy's dreams.
You still sing that song?
- Who are you?
- Rip Murdock.
Where is Johnny?
You haven't told me if you still sing that song.
"You remember it, don't you?"
Ex cuse me.
The boss said to ask you as a f avour will you sing that song when you were in the show?
"- l couldn't, not possibly."
"- As a f avour to him, he said."
"Yeah, I'd like to hear it."
"All right, but just that one."
"I'll take that table now, f riend, f or two."
"I hated every part of her, but I couldn't figure her out yet."
I wanted to see her the way Johnny had and hear that song with his ears.
Maybe she was all right and maybe Christmas comes in July.
But I didn't believe it.
- You've seen Johnny since he got back?
- Yes.
Where is he now?
I've been f rantic f or two days.
- He was f rantic f or three years.
- Was he?
In spite of the f act you testified against him.
"If you know Johnny, you know he understands. I had to testify."
- When did you see him?
- Day bef ore yesterday.
"He was to call and let me know about going to Mexico, so I could join him."
But he never called.

Time's up.
You were so close.
You found five answers.
Let's take a look on them.
"Kilmarnock, south-west of Glasgow."
"Dumfries, in southern Scotland."
"Cumbernauld, you'll know that from your tax return, I imagine."
"Airdrie, North Lanarkshire."
"Ayr - you were trying to work out what that rogue Y was, and it was Ayr, south-west of Glasgow."
So you got five answers there.
They're all places in Scotland.
They are all part of the perfect solution.
"You nearly put Aberdeen in there, that would have scuppered you."
But let's see what you could have got to get the full ten points.
Elgin.
"Now, what were you calling Elgin there?"
Igle.
Igle!
What's that Igle?
Elgin.
And Bearsden.
"Bearsden, a suburb of Glasgow."
That's what you needed to get the perfect solution.
"Nonetheless, you got five points - not half bad."
"At the end of the round, Araucarians, you're on 12,"
Lutrophiles you're leaping ahead - like the otters that you are - on 21.
We're at the final round for a place in the semifinal.
- Hey!
"- Thanks, Mater."
"Good evenin', you two."
"Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this."

But I am going to find out.

So Vinnie and Tino are cousins?
"That's right, cousins."
They have cousins in Louisiana?
"Down there, we're all cousins."
"If you got a cousin, you got a vote."

What about the convenience store?
The owner said he'd take care of it.
"All right, I'm going."
Did you come from home?
No.
Then what about the car?
You said you needed to take care of someone and took the car.
Yeah.
"Oh, so you didn't want to waste gas, left it at the office and took the bus here?"
"No, Moon Kwon, I came in a taxi."
What about the car?
I don't know.
What's wrong with you?
Where's the last place you went to?
Hospital.
I don't understand you.
Who leaves their car and takes a taxi?
"You shouldn't be taking care of anyone, you're the one who needs to be in the hospital."
Is something really growing in your brain?
"I'll get it, what hospital is it?"

"Brother, you have a very sad story."
"I swear on God, you made me cry."
You heard my story but didnt tell anything about yourself.
My name is..
Airport.
Airport?
What kind of a name is Airport?
"Brother, people laugh out helplessness as ajoke.."
..and sometimes thatjoke becomes your name.
I am production manager in the film industry.
And I pick up and drop artists to the airport.
Artist?
You mean even the heroes and the heroines?
"Yes, everyone."
From Amitabh Bachchan to Asrani.
And from Sridevi to Aruna Irani..
..I have picked up and dropped all of..
..them to the airport more than a thousand times.
But I swear I still didnt get a chance to sit in the plane.
"Buddy, please make me meet Amitbah Bachchan once."
"Brother, now you have come to me.."
..then I will get this thing done for you.
"Okay, you stay here all alone."
Dont you have any relatives?
I do.
Who says I dont?
There is a distant uncle and so called sister-in-Iaw.
Distant uncle keeps a distance from me.
And so called sister-in-Iaw never calls me.

-Have you had a chance to talk at all?
"-Well, we did meet at the hospital."
-Did anything good come out of it?
"-No, nothing."
-You didn't say anything to each other?

-We're saying things and that's all nice and sweet.
-Nice and sweet is good.
-He's misses the summer cabin.
He doesn't miss me.

-Dad loves you so very much
"-In fact, he loves you so much it almost killed him."
-I'm not getting any younger.
I want to live.
-What the hell is that?
-Is that a dating site you're showing me?
"-They're pretty handsome, don't you think?"
"-Well, they look like dad, all three of them."
"-No, I don't think so."
-They definitely do.
These two are sea captains and the third one works for the Maritime Administration.
-I must have a thing for sailors then.
-This is not happening.
"-But you know what, none of these guys have summer cabins."
-Is that the problem?
Is it the house that's the issue?
"-There you go, dad."

"- Okay, see you later."
- Good news.
I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
That is good news.
Bye.
"Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced center combat-area problem?"
Five words:
transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.
That... that's brilliant.
It's what I do.
"But wait, there's more."
I also invented two new chess pieces.
The serpent...
and the old woman.
"Okay, now I have to ask."
What do they do?
"When the serpent slithers to an opposing player's piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves."
All right.
"Unless... it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress:"
"a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent."
Elegant.
That's because it's simple.
"Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you."
And...
And what?
And a third person.
It's three-person chess.
And I feel snake eyes.
"Krause, give Mr. Murdock back the dice he had bef ore."
"I'd be delighted to have you roll f or any part, or all of the 16,000."
Let's say all of it.
- Four.
"- A difficult point, Mr. Murdock."
"What man has done, Murdock can do."
"- Please, Rip, I'm 16,000 ahead."
- Bother you?
A solid winning every now and then is the best advertising f or any casino.
- Can't we have a nightcap?
- lt's your money.
We'll have it in my office.
"If it's all the same to you, I'd like that pair f or a souvenir."
Much obliged.
"With all that money on you, I'd better see you home."
Snake eyes again.
Krause is a f ool.
My cutting him in on the profits was a mistake.
He's becoming greedy.
I'll keep these to remind me never to stretch my luck.
"A judicious principle. I gather that you've been around, as the saying is."
- East St. Louis is around enough.
"- Ah, St. Louis."
"In what business were you, may I ask?"
"I owned taxicabs, but they got sunk at Pearl Harbor."
- Then you know Al Baretto?
- You know Al?
Were you in St. Louis?
"Many times, although my headquarters were in Detroit."
I thought Al's Detroit f riends were all mobsters.
Where's Mike?
You got that completely wrong.
The person you were after was Alan Sugar.
It was obviously Alan Sugar.
Why?
"The Mayor was going to close Sugar's sweet shop down, it was all he had, he was a desperate man."
Did you not see the VHS player in Alan Sugar's shop?
Yeah.
You did?
Yeah.
"Yes, well, did you not see that the hostage tape was misspelt, yes?"
"""Kidnapp"" takes one P."
"You were closer to that than me,"
I didn't get to look at that.
"Oh, stop talking, please!"
"Hey, don't start blaming me."
"Don't start blaming me for this, O'Leary!"
Lana Del Rey was...
That's on your conscience.
"The point is, O'Leary, it couldn't have been Miley Cyrus because she told you..."
No-one ever beat Miley Cyrus at Scrabble.
"In other words, she could spell!"
We should have just questioned her normally.
"Well, all right, in retrospect, sorry, we should have questioned her normally."
Everything in Sugar's shop was misspelt.
"Oh, I see."
"I've trodden in more intelligent things than you, O'Leary!"
Sorry.
"Yeah, you're fired!"
And it'll probably cost me my job!
I hope you're happy.
You should go for mayor.
"That's actually a good idea, sir."

I'm sorry.
My regular assistant didn't make your appointment.
All I know is...
- ...you need to speak to an officer.
- Ah.
I'm Esther Potter's nephew.
She died recently.
I'm sorry.
She was a loyal customer.
"I'd like to talk to you about her accounts, her safety deposit box."
Um...
"Actually, we were under the impression Mrs. Potter had no living relatives."
She certainly was the last of the Potters.
"Her sister married my grandfather up in Syracuse, where I'm from."
I think technically that makes me a great-nephew.
Yes.
"Well, uh, the State Revenue Agency will need to see your ID before I can release any information or give access to the safe deposit box."
- I thought so.
- Yeah.
I brought copies.
"Oh, good."

"Yes, we're architects."
I will get these to the Revenue Agency.

"Oh, Irishka!"
You know he played the accordion so beautifully when he was young.
"The moment he stretched out his accordion, all women went crazy!"

All right.

When's that supposed to happen?
I don't know.
"But until then, nobody gets paid."
"Listen here, all right?"
I was hired to trap 'em.
I wasn't hired to guard 'em.
"The way I see it, now you, you got a safe."
It's probably full of money.
You signed a contract to protect your boss and your boss's property.
And that safe isn't full anymore.
It's short about $300.

Did you shake it out?
I did.
I kicked it towards Christopher Biggins.
LAUGHTER
Hoped for the best.
Awful.
"But she didn't notice, did she?"
"Well, she gave me that look."
LAUGHTER
"""You shat yourself."" She didn't say anything to me."
Did she shake hands and then push you away?
She's notorious for doing that.
"No, she chatted to everyone, and she got to me and I just got the look and she moved on."
"I think someone had warned her, ""Don't speak to him."""

isn't that a little weird?
Give it one more chance.
One date.
"And if it's still weird, we'll just give it one more chance."
"Oh, you're her father."
"But when I'm with you, I'm not thinking about Old Christine."
What-- who?
"Oh, sorry, it's just that I've known my daughter longer, so"
"I refer to you as New Christine, which makes her Old Christine."
"Well, one more date wouldn't kill me."
"So... second date wasn't so bad, was it?"
No.
"In fact, I think it was better than our first date."
Wonder what's going to happen on our third date?
"Well, I'll give you a little hint:"
If it's anything like my previous third dates... you might want to work on your home run trot.
So you're still feeling okay about everything?
"Yeah, you know, so what if it's a little weird."
"Yeah, some of my best relationships have been a little weird."
"And when it's just us, not weird at all."

I need to know that you're gonna be there.
"John, are you there?"

I can't call in sick just because you have a bad feeling about today.
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.
They show up over the chemical plant.
"Josh gets a call from me, but it's not really me."
I'm talking about something bad happening at the chemical plant.

I parked at the front as I'm a trustee - who's going to tell me off?
"I pushed this door round, and saw someone getting in to my car."
"I thought, ""They're terrific, the armouries."
"They're valet parking it for me. """

Did Mrs. Barr usually ask for a copy of the bill?
No.
But she did on this occasion.
Now Mrs. Barr's only slightly less disorganized than I am.
Why would she want a copy of the bill when she's already got the original?
"Mrs. Barr always settled the account herself, but on this occasion the gentleman did, cash."

"""No, it would be too much trouble."""
"My dad replied, ""Too much trouble is no customers."""
"The mayor, and he was the best mayor the city ever had, was my boss."
I was his deputy mayor.
His right-hand man.
Or his boy  depending on who was talking about me.
But in Brooklyn  something else was going on that would change everything.

"James Bone, a child on his way to school."
Watch your step.
"Finally, Vinnie Zapatti, cousin to Tino  a rat Detective Eddie Santos had in his pocket."
- All set?

It happened on the corner of Broadway and Marcy in North Brooklyn.

"I've written a series of books called Danger Is Everywhere, which is, uh..."
Not as good as Harry Potter.
"David, David, can I ask you a sensible question about it?"
Who's in the films of your books?
"OK, well, let's have a look and see if JK Rowling is up there."
"Yes, it's JK Rowling!"
JK Rowling was once unemployed and living on state benefits.
"But now, she's richer than the Queen."
"Who, ironically, is unemployed and living on state benefits."

"We got Clint for $15,000."

"I didn't see any character in Rawbide, only a physical figure."
WHat struck me most about Clint was His indolent way of moving.
It seemed to me Clint closely resembled a cat.
THe communication was a little rough.
"I knew ""arrivederci"" and ""buongiorno."""
"He knew ""goodbye"" and ""Hello. "" And that was it."

So it kind of came in at an interesting moment in bistory wben tbe Western was dubbed by tbe so-caIIed experts as being dead.
Leone didn't feel Himself bound to any mores of the American Western.

"Oh, yeah."

"Yeah, in the taxi here, he came on three times in ten minutes."
Yeah.
"I wonder if Ed Sheeran has a curry and goes to bed, sometimes when he wakes up in the morning, three of his farts during the night are in the top ten?"
"No matter how rich and successful, like, and he's the biggest rock star in the world, he still looks like a virgin."
"He's probably had more sex this morning than I've had in my life, but..."
"Him and the Pope are the only virgins to sell out Wembley, I think."
"He's always got a look on his face, like,"
"""I don't know how this happened either."""

"Yeah, we are."
"Little treat for you, I think you're going to enjoy."

"--And I said that Ermakov, the tram depot carpenter, ...is requesting to hold a wedding in the one-room apartment that was allocated to him"
--Why?
--Because he had already sent out the invitations
--You told me to let him go ahead --So...
I said that this doesn't fall under our authority
You said that it's not the guy's fault that the fire inspector hasn't approved the building for move-in
--So...
"In my case, I was always the lab technician."

-Sometbing like tbat.
We all sort of bung out.
"Clint didn't Hang out as much with everyone because Clint, I think, to my knowledge, was the only one married."
And He was seriously married.
Maggie was a batHing-suit model.
Gorgeous.
SHe was with Him.
"SHe was His wife, and that was that."
SHe was very quiet.
A very quiet woman.
"Clint, you know, was the star."
Even before He was the star.
Tbey'd bave directors come in wbo were also very important.
Brando was probably one of the biggest.
Brando didn't want to talk too much about it because I don't think He wanted to intellectualize.
I tbink be always looked down on acting as sort of sometbing tbat be sbouIdn't be doing as an American male.
"And really, tbe only one tbat bad anytbing in common witb Brando in tbat class was clint."
"Brando played those bongos, and Clint, of course, played piano and they were both aficionados of jazz."
"both in and out of His Universal classes, Eastwood was learning to be an artist."
He developed His skills watching and listening to His favorite performers.
From jazz soloists like Lester Young Eastwood learned the lesson of impassivity of keeping your cool while pouring out your Heart.
"""Cool"" Had also been discovered by other artists of the '50s."
"Figures like James Dean, Jack Kerouac and chet Baker made detachment seem sexy and glamorous."
"Eastwood watched, and when the time came, remembered."
I was tbere for a year and a baIf.
until tbey got smart and tbrew me out.
Witb notbing but a fine-tootbed comb.
"Baby, very sad."
THe thing at Universal only lasted a couple years and then He was out on His own.

That was when we left ‎.‎.‎.
Cuando así will we turn‎.
Someone told me you used to drive one of those tanks‎.
You heard wrong‎.
"My group was not tank‎, tank destroyer was‎."
I was commander of one of those Helkath for two years‎.
Then you have good stories to tell‎.
A good ‎.‎.‎.

And how did you get to drive trucks‎?
They degraded the service unit three weeks ago‎.

"I pity you, that's why I won't."
"Don't think I'm scared of you,"
"I'll kill you, are you scared now?"
I'm not scared.
"Miss Mu, wait, Miss Mu."
Miss Zhong.
"Of all the people, you want her help?"
Don't hurt her.
Ow... my leg hurts.
It's hard to walk with this.
"Well, it's a part of the plan."
"Dow, your leg is not lame."
I never thought you would be this stupid.
Ha ha.
"Why don't you kill me now, you lying bitch."
- Don't you dare call her that.

"Now your life depends on the weather, Che."
"Let's go, Dow."
"Let's go, Rung."
You bastards.
I don't know.
Maybe because I'm so lonely?
"Is your husband quiet, too?"
My husband?
As he walked out of the wedding hall he closed his mouth and he's been quiet ever since.
"Ah, It's cold."
Don't.
You're going to get my clothes wet.
Stop it.
My shoes are all wet.
So what!
They're not mine.
You look lonely.
I'll buy lunch today.
Whatever you want!
"But, at student cafeteria."
"They're freshmen, aren't they?"
How do you know?
Because they look tacky.
It's good!
"Back in my day, it wasn't."
"Did you go to college, too?"
Why?
Anything say that I can't?
"No, of course not."
What was your major?
What do you think?
I don't know.
Philosophy.
Huh?
It can't be!
Brat...
"Oh, this is a deathtrap right here, I swear."
"Okay, I'm just gonna leave that place."
"Oh, God, there he is."
(high-pitched static)
I knew I shouldn't have gone towards the tunnel.
"Oh, no, I'm in a fence."
"Oh, my God, what am I supposed to do?"
"(gasping) Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
He's gonna find me.
"- ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, my God."
(high-pitched static) (footsteps crunching)

"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
I don't see him. - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh!
Oh-ho!
- (high-pitched static) - What the heck?
Please don't be in here.
"Oh, my God."
I thought there was something behind me.
(laughs) (sighs) Okay.
(pulsating echo)
"Oh, no!"
No!
No!
No!
- No!
No!
No!
- (high-pitched static) (muffled scream)
A woman by the water took off her clothes and...
"You love me, don't you?"
Don't talk nonsense.
Love?
"In the chat room, yes."
Not in reality.
No.
"I love you, too."
Alright?
I love you.
Don't go.
"Love, my ass!"
Bastard.
"Are you selling out love now, too?"
You bastard.
You deserve it.
I love you.
For real.
What happened with the college student?
- He's going off to complete his army duty.
-Why?
All of a sudden?
He's running off from my husband.
That hurts.
"If the sun comes up will he come, When the wind blows he'll leave."
"When I look at you, you're ignoring me."
Please wind stop blowing.
Why are you eating everything?
Stop eating the bone.
"It's no use holding you, you just go away."
Please wind stop blowing.
I don't know
Then buy me a long line at least.
About 500 meters long.
So I can drag the line along to make phone calls.
This is so awkward.
This really is awkward.
My face's burning.
My lips are so dry.
You look Handsome.
"Hey, I showed you my picture."
I couldn't even see your face.
You're really young.
Are you sure you're married?
I told you I married when I didn't know better.
I am a young miss.
You're very beautiful.
Thank you.
"You're very handsome, too."
And so honest.
Nuts.
This is nuts!
Excuse me?
Nothing.
Just talking to myself.
This is nuts.
This coffee is strong.
"You're 21, then what year does that make you?"
Sophomore.
- Have you dated before?
"- By that, do you mean..."
- if I slept with anyone?
- Yeah.
- Really?
They were only a first pass.
You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied.
"Not to worry, I'll redo them."
"Oh, Rarity."
You don't have to do that.
They're fine.
I want them to be better that just fine.
I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
Are you sure?
"I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose."
"Oh, it's no ???."
"Really, I insist."
"Well, in that case..."
"Thank you again, Rarity."
What have I gotten myself into?
Hello?
"You wanted to see me, Rarity?"
Fluttershy!
Your new-new gown's ready.
I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it.
What do you think?
I... ...love it.
"Oh, you're just saying that."
"No, no."
I do.
It's... nice.
"""Nice""?"
Nice.
"If you don't like it, you should just tell me."
"Oh, but I do like it."
Like it or love it?
Um... both?
Too modern.
Too empty.
Too touristy.
Your knees gone yet?
- Not yet.
What are you doing here in Paris?
It's our wedding anniversary.
And you only have time just for each other?
Shut up!
Idiot.
You make my blood boil like nobody else!
Sign of a deep connection!
Once the kids have gone...
What's left of us?
Beckett says  'Do we mean love when we say love?'
What else do we mean?
That's stupid.
Oooh!
"- Oh God, Nick!"
You cannot love and hate the same person.
[laughing]
- It really hurts!
Usually in the space of 5 minutes in my experience.
I think we've earned a very good time.
People don't change.
They do.
They can get worse!
[French accent]
"Do I please you, monsieur?"
Here's the bill.
- That is quite a lot of money.
Get your coat.
If you can't trust your wife that much then go live happily by yourself.
What do you mean who?
"It's my friend, Misook."
Here check for yourself.
Hear that?
Bye!
Oh my god.
It flipped over.
"Uh, What happened?"
How old is your kid?!
- Eight!
- How old?!
First grade?
-You met him through the Internet.?
- He was closer than my husband...
I wasn't sure who my real husband was.
I'd get so confused...
You lived in a total illusion.
"Anyhow, love is an illusion!"
"You liked him so much that he felt burdened, right?"
Or Are you...maybe a perv?
Do you like to hit?
Or like to be hit?
Maybe to be bounded?
"- Um, isn't that the College guy?"
"- Uh, it is..."
Hey!
Hey!
College Student!
Are you just gonna ignore us?
Why would I ignore you?
I'm so tired I can't even see.
Why are you doing this?
Damn it!...
Damn it!...Damn it!
Damn ..
"Dalyan, I don't know how my son is."
Maybe he's dying.
I have to look into Mahir's eyes and ask for forgiveness...
Don't deprive me of this!
Don't deprive me of this!
"Thank you, my brother."
Come on.
Now stab me...
Then go to bed.
They will find me alone. as i don't want to bring any trouble to you.
"Hello, Kemal."
Why didn't you tell me that Mahir got shot?
I called you but you weren't there.
And how is he now?
"He's in the hospital, unconscious."
Who did it?
Did they arrest anyone?
No Abi.
No one got arrested.
"Ok, Ok."
Look Kibrit.
How much do you make out of rooster fights?
Is it enough?
I always find a way to make money.
"I should find a new way for you to make money, Kibrit."
You're right.
But all the ways are taken.
It's a heavy traffic.
"Harun said I had to go, but I am not going."
You... ...only thought of us...
"It is enough, my daughter..."
There is nothing left to do for your father..
We have to wait for the hearing...
"Look, my darling."
There are people who can take care of us here..
Don't think of us.
Think of yourself from now on
Your husband. ..it is not good to leave him alone.
- Go - I won't go..
What are you are going to do?
Narin..
Narin...
Narin???
"You went to Serdar, didn't you Narin??"
I know you went to Serdar!
"You won't sit at home, waiting for me!"
"What is there that you can't find here, I don't know!!!"
Good evening.
- Welcome...
- Thank you
Hello?
"Where are you, Narin?"
It is late.
I should go.
Let me drop you off.
"No, don't trouble yourself."
I can go by myself.
It is late.
It won't do to go by yourself this late.
"Go, my daughter."
No... not you.
"Okay, I'll hang up now."
This IG seems very loyal to the Law.
It seems we must think of the other scheme.
I've thought of one.
What's that?
You'll disguise goons... ...and I'll become a police officer.
Then?
And we'll kidnap Shreekant's darling daughter Radha.
It seems someone is coming.
Have the goons gone?
Take me out from here.
Please...
Just a minute.
"Sheela, someone is passing."
- Don't make noise.
Move away!
- Stop!
I said move!
- What are you doing?
Leave!
Leave me!
- What are you doing?
I will not spare him!
"- Stop, sir."
"If you'll start firing, there'll be bloodshed here."
Damodar!
Damodar!
"See, what's does."
What's written in this letter?
"Mr. Shreekan, your daughter Radha will remain... ...in my custody, until Pasha is in law's custody."
Remember!
Are you serious?
(nervously) Wait.
"No, no!"
"No, no, please, please, no!"
No... (speaks indistinctly)
"I don't know how to play, no."
(hyperventilates)
"Oh, my God."
I'm so scared.
"I don't know how it even starts yet and I'm already scared, man."
"This reminds me of ""The Hunger Games."""
"I'm gonna, like, get eaten by one of those dogs."
I don't even know where to go.
(chuckling) Where am I going?
Am I going the right way?
This kind of reminds me of my home.
"I live, like, deep in the forest."
"(singsong) Come out, come out, wherever you are."
I feel like I'm actually in the dark.
This isn't as scary as I thought.
What is that?
No.
"Okay, never mind."
I'm shaking.
(chuckles nervously)
Is that the wind?
Is that the wind that I hear?
I think that's the wind.
I don't want to go in this building.
I really don't.
- (footsteps) - There we go.
There's a page.
Sit over here.
"Stop playing around, dad."
Wait a sec Young-hoon.
Will be with you shortly.
"Thought you were hurt, look well to me."
My sincere apology for being well.
Are these even washed?
Should've never come here!
"Well, Ji-hwan says you will wash them again, for sure and told me to soak them and hang."
And those... socks need to be sewed.
I'll let you pass just for today.
Are these rags or socks?
Shit!
I guess you're a writer.
Yeah.
A novel.
"Oh, I see."
Why do you look at me like that?
Do I look that handsome to you?
"Yes, you're handsome."
Kissing my ass?
So young yet corrupted already!
Um...
Did you want to tell me something?
Have a seat.
Okay.
I consider Dal-rae like a daughter
How long have you been a couple?
It's been about three months.
You two can't be serious then.
Huh?
Are you close to Ji-hwan?
lnside
Blow him out
Okay
What happened?
Kill him
Hit him
Come out or I'll smother you to death
There's a hole
Bad， he's collapsed.
Resuscitate him
Don't be afraid.
Let me
You scare me
Trying to murder?
We're trying to help only
Come out quickly
No
Good
I'll kill you with these
Damn you!
Have patience.
Tell the sisters to come up
Let me use this to stab him dead
Don't!
I may get killed before he does
I have a way out
Trying to run?
Use the coat hanger to hook him out
Come on， open his mouth
How's it going?
How's it going?
He's got hooked
Again you taunted me!
Duty is duty!
Duty.. what must be your duty in this small town?
"Friend, this is a small town."
But many activities are carried out here!
I will explain to you when l am free.
I will leave now.
"Listen.. don""t forget your friend for the sake of your duty!"
"All the best! - see you! sir, he is chief lnspector of customs."
Diwan Dinanath.
"Mr. Dinanath, how are you, sir?"
Fine.
Thank you.
How are you?
Fine.
Thank you.
I have heard a lot about you from lG.
Thanks.
I was waiting for you only. - come.
I have to go for my duty.
And you have come from a long journey.
You must be tired.
Rest for now.
Have dinner with me in the evening.
And we will discuss the matter there.
"Thank you, sir."
I am lucky that I got the chance to have home made dinner.
Pleasure is mine.
- Thank you.
"Thank you so much. - see you tonight, Mr. Diwan!"
Bye!
Rao.
"We need gum, fast."
You can't beat a breathalyzer with gum.
You've been drinking all NlGHT.
Now it's a chase!
BASS
He upgraded the hyperdrive and the stereophonic sound system.
"We outran the space cops, and made them eat bass."
"Yes, I could feel it."
What is he called?
R2D2 your highness.
"Thank you, magic trash can."
You told me there's a bar here.
Yeah my bad.
Panaka.
"Yeah, the pizza's here."
Be right there.
I'm afraid I can't kick in.
I'll have to owe you.
"Whatever, man."
Why do you awaken me without skin?
What of our bargain?
You promised me flesh!
Raw nerves exposed to the world!
Every step is a new nightmare!
All I feel is pain!
You!
Why would they do this to me?
You want me to feel the pain?
"Yes, you want me to understand it."
So that I may show others.
Huzzah!
Excelsior!
Fine.
I feel all right.
( ferry whistle blows )
We're gonna have to get rid of the car.
We can take that ferry.
You'll have to walk a little.
"I can't, Johnny."
Come on.
"I'll help you, Gus."
I can't.
I will only hold you back.
"You gotta go alone, Johnny."
You got to.
I'll stay here.
I'll make it.
I'll send you a postcard.
( tense theme playing )
"I'm not gonna leave you like this, Gus."
Go.
"Go on, Johnny."
Run.
"Go on, run."
SUNDAY DOCUMENTARY
ROSLlNG'S WORLD
"I slept in the kids' room, or rather, the grandkids' room."
That way I won't wake Agneta.
As usual we were...
When I left Stockholm we weren't done with the presentation.
At midnight I downloaded the final version.
It's only four AM and the paper has already come.
There...
"When you hold a lecture, you need to make sure you're up on the news."
I danced on stage with all my might.
"So my bones are thick, not thin."
Scanning Zelo's leg's to the end.
Shall we get started!
Shall we get started!
Who is this?
Shall we get started on filming?
It's my turn to lip sync for the MV.
I'm looking forward to it.
Since the background is so pretty.
Anybody with that background will come out very well for sure.
- Great job.
- Great job.
Great work.
MV lip sync is over.
Great work.
None
We have to shoot again.
My face is probably bloated right now.
I slept a lot.
It was past three thirty when I checked in the car earlier.
I feel tired but it was a good all-nighter.
"- oh, Jong Up is here too."
- Hi.
He's my manager for the day.
- Bring me some water.
- Water?
Then I gotta dig up soil...
"Then hurry and dig, here."
- It's cement so you'll be done in no time.
"- I don't think I can, I'm too sleepy."
This is an elevator in Las Vegas.
"I saw the window was open, I thought that maybe..."
Jesus!
I have a request.
I have something to ask you.
A request.
A request?
Just don't ask me to take this off.
I want to paint you.
Your face.
"Don't smile at me, My knees will go weak."
"Oh, wait!"
"I can't explain why I'm doing this, but you are difficult, too."
Just once... don't be so difficult!
Say something.
Say I'm not a thug.
I'll say something.
Those guys there are thugs.
"Hey, I asked you to say something!"
Wait!
"May10, 1995."
He's never a romantic but today after some romantic time suddenly he threw his body on me.
That bastard...
Beast!
Dad?
An unwished-for thing has happened.
That day I got pregnant.
"I got so scared, I ran to him."
"Abort it, he says."
That scoundrel...
Bastard!
I'll raise it.
"Healthy, smart, good-natured."
He has a muffler round his neck and wore kurta pyjama.
Its all right.
I will search.
Did you see a person in kurta pyjama and a muffler.
No sir.
See the other side.
You dont worry.
I am asking.
Look that side.
"Sir, please wait sir."
Dad!
Are you here?
"No, I am under the train."
Come on.
"Listen, my father is has boarded the train."
"Wait madam, I am searching."
I am saying that my father is has boarded the train.
I said I am searching.
Why dont you understand?
My father is in the train.
What?
He is in the train?
Come soon.
"O rain, do not go away after dropping on the eyes."
Stay with me always just like the showers and lightning.
Why did you go away having roused the feeling of love?
If you want to come will I stop you?
Why are you standing here?
He could not catch the train.
What can you do about it?
Come on.
"How is your health, father?"
You understand?
Yes...
Let's end this.
That'll be better for both of us.
"Come on, pull yourself together."
Bravo...
Bravo...
You've convinced even me.
- Can you please leave me alone?
- Look...
For years... ...
I worked my ass off to establish this empire.
"I'll strangle you, if I lose it because of you."
I will kill you!
"- Reşat, get out!"
- Shut up!
What are we gonna do now?
Tell me what's gonna happen now?
Soon they'll find Kerim too.
- What are we gonna do when they make Kerim talk?
- Kerim won't say anything.
- He wants to leave the country.
- Come on...
- He was threatening you to confess everything.
- Not anymore.
- We talked with him last night.
He's going abroad.
- So you saw him?
"- You didn't listen to me, is that it?"
- He had called Erdoğan...
God damn Erdoğan!
What did I tell you?
Shame on you.
Shame on you.
"No, shame on you..."
For you raised that demon.
Shame on you.
How's your foot?
Is it swollen?
I see you wrapped it.
But heat won't do good if it's sprained.
Let's go see a doctor before it gets worse.
Don't be stubborn.
We can have breakfast too.
And buy you some clothes.
That's enough...
That's all we wanted to say.
It's up to you now.
Isn't she his sister?
Hoşgeldin.
- What's going on?
"- Nothing, come on inside."
It's something that can't be forgotten.
Let everyone know that.
He should never come back to town again.
- Is he talking about Kerim?
- Never mind him.
You heard me Galip Usta?
He better not come back just because his abla is here.
Or he'll have his answer from the town folks.
What's this?
What are you trying to do?
"Meryem Hanım, let's go inside."
"It's Reşat Yaşaran who is making you do this, isn't he?"
"- Kerim, are you at work?"
"No, abi..."
I've quit the job.
What's up?
"Oh, why?"
"Anyways, maybe this is the best for us."
- Listen to me now...
"- What's wrong, abi?"
Come home now...
Or don't...
As there are still many reporters here.
It's better you park your car in the auto-park near the shore.
Then walk over here and call me when you're two streets away from us.
But don't let anyone see you.
- I don't get what this is about.
- I'll take you away from here for a few days.
It was five of six years ago.
Your dad made me buy this house.
This land is valuable.
You can do anything you want here.
"You can change it completely, if you want."
Why would I change it.
What is it to me.
"This land and this house is yours, Kerim."
"No, abi."
We're just guests here.
"Besides, I don't want a house or anything."
"We'll just spend a few days here, that's all."
- Thank you.
- Anyway... ...
It's too early to talk about all this.
There it is.
Please help us!
Help us!
I don't want to die!
Stop!
"Young Master, why are you here again?"
"It will make things difficult for us, if it's said that such a thing happened on our ship."
Stop this immediately.
I had no intention of throwing them in either.
I just wanted to see someone's reaction.
What a waste.
You missed an interesting spectacle.
That's alright.
Now it's Yongmun?
What if he recognizes Gil Dong?
This is getting complicated.
Still there's not too many of them to fight.
Go Add.
Don't you feel anything?
You've been quiet.
Scared?
"Come on, Add."
Mom.
I miss you.
I want to see you at the cemetery next time.
"Hey, why did you stop?"
Did you see a ghost?
"No, I'll take Dow to her mom's cemetery."
Huh?
You're going to a cemetery?
We've just escaped from one.
And we're going to a ghost city.
Are you crazy?
The rich.
The landowners.
Now they'll be yours.
"Cows, bulls, hens, pigs - all yours."
Give me back my cow!
"You'll have to wait, my dear."
We'll give you everything in time.
You're a free woman.
A citizeness!
Here's where they buried him.
"Next morning the grave was open, the coffin empty."
Since then everyone passing by the graveyard gets in trouble.
- But people do drive past.
- But it's not him...
Didn't Pyotr go at night?
Hear that?
Hear that?
Father!
Look!
THE AVENGERS
Good Lord!
Is it true?
- Honest to God.
- He's talking through his hat.
"I didn't believe it myself at first, then looked around... and saw a coffin flying over the graves."
And beside the road - ghosts with scythes.
And not a sound... not a sound.
Stop!
Stop!
You do better today.
"But when you kick him in the belly, swing your leg harder."
- Got it?
Let them be happy...
Sorry...
You bring us tea and etc...
That's why...
Bring your tea when you come next time.
I'll brew it for you...
"Please, no money!"
Mustooo!
My brother!
How are you?
Eh?
Look what Muko brother has brought for you...
Do you remember what you did to neighbourhood's dogs and cats?
"Wasn't this Uncle Aslan's dog, Kral (King)?"
Do you remember this?
We used to hunt with this in the garden of your village house.
You were the best slingshooter.
The children of the village still have marks on their head.
All of them are your marks...
"Look, do you remember this?"
"You did this to me, remember?"
"He doesn't even look, dude..."
He is completely lost.
Unbelievable...
My brother...
My dearest brother...
Come on...
Take this.
Musto???
You see...
"He took the sling, dude."
"Keep your maniac under control, brother..."
And be quick.
"Ok, boss."
Here the connection is removed.
Let us put it in the girls room.
"Hey Anjanna, put this lantern in the girls room."
"Hey, he is escaping with the girl."
Catch him.
Is everyone safe?
Let us go from here.
We are waiting for a long time now.
We didnt see any train.
I am scared.
Is there any train now?
Why are you scared?
Not for myself.
I am feared about Shailu.
I asked in the enquiry.
"There is only one train, that too goods."
It will not stop in this station.
Still Venkat and Jagan has not came.
How can we leave them?
Venkat told us to leave with Shailu whether he comes or not.
I dont come until Venkat is here.
Here they come.
Venkat!
Is everything all right?
Do you know how scared I am?
When will the train arrive?
There is only one goods now.
Let us somehow try to catch it.
You are not coming with us.
What are you saying?
- You must be bored here.
- I'm not bored.
Sashka Belykh gave me a book of magic tricks.
I've been practising.
"Wanna see the""Flying Queen?"""
- Sure!
- That's where you are!
Snitches!
"- Who, we?"
- And your stupid flowers!
- Can't trust you with a secret!
- Who told Dynin?
- You are the snitches!
- We?
- Who else?
Who took the mirror and Shagalova to Dynin?
- They're not out there just killing for fame.
- They just wanna be famous.
- They should be in every major city.
- Every major city.
These guys are playing God.
"I mean, this whole religious twist?"
Who the hell do they think they are?
"Hell yeah, I believe in capital punishment!"
If they let me I'll pull the switch.
Get 'em all!
Kill 'em all!
"I'm all for it... because the more people they kill, the better it is for everybody"
"No, ...you don't even know!"
- Sign me up man.
- Sign me up.
- Where can I sign up?
Tell me!
What do they say?
"My friends say.. that by saying no, men become women""s slave."
ls that so? so you want to make me your slave?
- Yes.
What else did they say?
"My friends also say.. when men become fervent.. ..then they should meet the girl""s father and not the girl."
I think your friends have fallen in love with me.
And by teaching you wrong things they want to get rid of you.
And they want to form a relationship with me. seema.. how is your friend?
ls she very beautiful?
ls she young?
- Yes!
ls she capricious?
- Why?
"What""s your problem?"
I have no problem!
Filthy man!
You think about other girls!
"Yes, now I will have to think!"
Why?
"What""s the flaw in me?"
"Not flaw, injustice!"
"I want to come closer to you and you are going away! seema.. you won""t go away from me, will you?"
- No.
Your love has made my plight bad!
"Yes, seema."
"You belong to me, don""t you?"
- Yes. only you dwell in my heart.
Believe me.
"Beloved, this is true."
"Let""s love in the open. only you dwell in my heart."
Just get it out.
"If you keep squirming, maybe I'll feel sorry for you."
You've changed.
Something's different about you.
You're stronger.
Tougher.
"You're not the only one who changed, Stefan."
We all had to.
That's good to know.
There's something I have to tell you.
And it's not because I feel guilty that it happened.
It's because I feel guilty that you don't know.
I kissed Damon.
There.
All done.
What happened to him?
He was found in the woods.
An actual animal attack.
Bite marks and gashes over half his body.
Lost about 3 liters of blood.
"Well, is he going to make it?"
Nope.
At least not on his own.
What is that?
Exactly what you think it is.
Vampire blood.
You wanted to know my secret?
I cheat.
I'm a doctor and I hate when people die.
"So when I have the ability to do something about it,"
I do.
Stefan...
Is it okay living here?
"Since it is a guest room, it is kind of small."
But it's tolerable.
I'm only staying here for a little bit anyways.
We're staying here until the new house is built.
Will it be okay?
What?
I'm talking about Hae Ra.
She was the one you were meeting today. . .
How could you have parted that way.
"Well, since she was with Kyung Su Sunbae."
"Excuse me, Hae Ra."
I have something to tell you.
"It's really hard for me to say, so I hope you will listen."
I know.
I am not good enough.
Pardon?
Not good enough?
Then have mine too.
I didn't mean...
Foo... food is enough.
I'll continue.
"I have tried my best not to think about it,"
But I keep thinking of you. . .
Should I just leave?
I have a headache.
"You have a headache? then, you should take some medicine for it."
"Take your time, I will pay and leave now."
Hae Ra.
I know that I lack a lot of things.
That's why
I decided to try hard and not think of you
Say I can't stand being with a guy like him anymore.
But... you want me to say that?
Just help me this once.
I can't say it to him myself.
Mi-ryung asked me to tell you this.
She wants to break up with you.
She can't stand... being with a guy like you any longer.
He's crying.
You can hang up now.
She said you're a really good person.
She hopes you can find someone better.
"Yes, really."
Wait.
Now what?
You said it's finished!
Thank you so much.
-Your nose is bleeding.
-What?
Don't bother.
We're over
Separation Agency
"For people who are hesitant about breaking up, or for those who have trouble saying the words,"
"I will... no, we will do it for you."
Separation Agency.
I wish it would just pour rain and cool things off.
Excuse me?
Is anybody here?
Didn't she come in here just now?
Oh my god!
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
"Damn, why's it so dark?"
Is it on backwards again
Do you know what lemons called in Warangal?
What are they called?
- They are called Lemons.
That is what is called extra speech.
Pour 2 litres.
- Ok.
"My boy, where is the club for playing cards?"
Search!
There is nothing you cannot find by searching.
I did not like your face.
Did I like yours?
Am I not adjusting?
How much did it cost?
- Sixty-eight.
How much?
- Sixty-Eight.
Is it sixty-eight?
I have sixty.
Keep the change.
Ah!
He gave 8 rupees less and asking me to keep the change?!
Ah!
What a son in law!
He is making my daughters shift from place to place.
"He plays cards, has debts every where and has got us a bad name."
Grandmother!
We all know about father.
Leave the matter.
All these days she supported him.
Now you are doing that?
He left us at home with out any care and.. .. now we dont know in which club or .. ..under which tree he is playing cards.
I am here!
I'll scold him!
"Dalyan, I'm sure one of your men will have a knife."
I want it now.
What will you do?!
I want it now.
Don't waste time.
I can be thrown in solitary confinement anytime now!!
Dalyan...
Stab me!
My soul is burning when firing the trigger...
That look of yours... saying 'Don't forget me!'...
It marked my betrayal on my forehead.
Lan...
"Come on then, shoot...Shoot!"
I have no one left.
Shoot!
"C'mon, shoot!...Shoot..."
Shoot!
"Shoot, but know this Nejdet..."
"I would never betray you, lan."
"Ibo, there is no return from here, son!"
"You will never forget that i pointed a gun at you, Lan!"
"And i can't live in fear, Lan."
"Stop it, stop it...I will redeem myself to you...Please don't do this!"
Come on stand up.
Don't let your last words be begging ones.
Who saidI asked you?!
Why are you doing this?
I'm talking to youI failed...
Why are you doing this?
I'm telling you I'm not betraying you!
I will never do it!
"Hey, I'm busy."
Go and let the students practice.
"Oh Ha Ni, teach him well."
Yes.
"Now, Sunbae, you be the girl."
"Okay, girl."
The head is lifted like this.
"""What are you doing to me?"""
"""Try to forget me if you can"""
"You won't be able to forget it, right?"
I won't be able to forget it.
"Wow, this is really great!"
"Yes, I understand the timing now."
But for the kiss... when I watch movies
Do I turn to the left or right.
Or like spiderman...
Do I do it upside down?
The angle?
"No, I think kissing is about timing."
"Ah, kissing is timing."
Timing...
"Ha Ni, you are very good at kissing."
No.
"Truthfully, I don't really know about it."
What are you talking about?
"If you're at this level, you'll be able to publish a book."
Isn't she hard to understand?
"In the tennis club, the girl who follows Baek Seung Jo around."
You heard about that too?
Is that rumor true?
Yes.
There must be a fun rumor going around.
"- Oh, all right!"
You go first.
- Can I invite boys?
"You haven't got some fancy fellow we don't know about, have you?"
No.
"Honestly, Dad."
"No one says ""fella"" any more."
"This isn't the Middle Ages, you know."
Or the '70s as you call it.
"Sorry, Dad."
I must be hormonal.
Can I have a D. J?
Why would we pay for one when we've already got one in the family?
- What?
"- Oh, yes."
No way.
"Oh, I want music from this century, Dad."
"If we hire a club, we'll get a D.J. thrown in."
We are not going to hire a club.
I can get a very good rate at the community hall.
We've thrown some legendary bashes there.
We still know how to get down.
"Hey, wait, missy."
I haven't told you my news.
"Okay, just please stop snogging."
It's not normal.
- I have been offered a promotion.
"- Oh, cool."
Maybe I can get a PDA instead of a mobile now?
"Georgia, where in the world do you find the most geomagnetic thermal activity?"
"- I don't know, Dad."
- New Zealand.
Take it.
Separation Agency
Stop sighing at the ground!
Stop sighing at the sky.
I guess she doesn't want to see you.
Really?
Ask her to call me later.
Huh?
He understood.
She likes you a lot.
Don't worry.
"No, it's okay."
I'll eat dinner at home.
By myself.
I'll just go.
See you.
You're not the one who got burned.
Why are you hiding?
Leave me alone.
Why are you being so childish?
How long will you hide there?
I said leave me alone!
"Don't just yell for help, you need to help him first."
At least you can say &amp;amp;quot;l love you.&amp;amp;quot;
You're better off than me.
Su-Eun.
You know why I wanted him to propose to me?
It was all for him.
If he confessed his love and thought about marriage and such.
"Then, he could think about me once more before jumping into the fire and make him a bit more scared of the fire I thought I could change him."
That's how it started but now
I've become sort of fixated on it.
"In case she's changed her name, you can identify her with the red mole."
There's a huge grudge between us.
"Remember her."""
Are you Shu Baifeng?
Miss Mu.
"I admire your boldness, but you can't address me by my full name."
Don't you have any manners?
I can't disobey my mother.
My mother once said:
"Should I see her enemy Shu Baifeng, ...I must kill her."
Who is your mother?
Qin Hongmian.
Then it's your mess.
Leave us.
Yes.
You too.
What a resemblance!
I should have known... with your personality.
What are you talking about?
Follow me.
How do you know Yi Yang Finger?
That's my father's exclusive style.
That's the master stroke of our Tuan Family.
Hasn't your mother told you?
You stole it from my father.
Don't make up any excuse.
"Call Tuan Yu out, we must put an end to this."
Lady.
You can never marry my son.
You forgot your word.
I want to hear this from him.
He can't see you right now.
Even if just for me.
Imagine it wasn't him.
He tried to find out the truth but ran out of time.
"Now he wants me to do something, Malena."
"Pablo, that doesn't make sense."
Know what really doesn't make sense?
Trying to save a dead person's life.
You know what?
They had been locked up for 4 months.
And tortured.
But they managed to escape.
They picked up the girl and ran.
They tried to start a new life.
But that son-of-a-bitch... found them again.
He went after them and killed them.
"Pablo, are you okay?"
"No, I'm not okay."
What did you expect?
How could anyone do something like that?
You know what really gets me?
I don't know anything about them... about what they did before.
"I'd like to know who they were, Malena."
Time's up.
"I'll take the ferry back tomorrow and meet you, okay?"
"Pablo, be careful."
"Stay here, okay?"
Mommy.
Where's my mommy?
It's okay.
Your mommy's okay.
Stay here.
Don't move.
"Okay, I'll get the ham rolls."
But do me a favour.
Don't get up to mischief.
When have we ever got up to mischief?
"Okay, Rex."
See the sun?
"The first one there gets two ham rolls, okay?"
Thank you.
Shall I call a doctor?
No.
I'm all right.
I have to ask you to tell me what happened.
I went to his office to take him some papers.
He locked the door and pounced on me.
He put his hands down the front of my dress.
Then he tried to tear off my clothes.
I was so scared I couldn't even scream.
He must have been drinking again.
I have heard that Mr Fuchs has a drinking problem.
What happened after that?
He grabbed me and I finally managed to scream.
"When I heard Ricarda, I went into his office and saw he'd got hold of her."
I'm going to the police to report him.
Calm down.
We'll deal with this.
- Are you going to ignore it?
- Don't worry.
This will have consequences for Mr Fuchs.
I'll speak to him.
"Ms Limmer, how could you do this to me?"
"Ms Bosch, please..."
"Mr Fuchs, please."
You?
"- Yes, son."
You are very bold!
You looks so scared as if I'm kidnapping you.
Unmannerly girl!
Just now you said I'm a spring of the garden.
Shut up!
Santo!
Raghu!
Where have they gone?
"Don't worry, Mr. Shreekant."
We've informed all the police forces across the state and Goa.
Yes.
And we're looking for them.
"If possible, connect me to the IGs of Gujarat and Karnataka, too."
"Okay, sir."
I'll talk to them now.
Thank you.
What happened?
What happened?
I'm missing my parents.
I saw a nightmare.
Nightmares are to be forgotten once you open your eyes.
Why to trust them?
Father is so careless about me.
He didn't care to know where I am and in what condition.
But we keep him informed.
Why do you take tension?
All the police officers are same.
You've got no heart but a stone.
How do you know what living means... without parents?
You'd never feel that.
You think I killed my ex-boyfriend?
I think psychopaths are incredibly high-maintenance.
"If you care about your friend, go figure out how Alaric came into the icu on his deathbed and walked out an hour later without a scratch."
Fair enough.
I can't.
I can't.
Try harder.
Can't he just rest for one second?!
"We're doing this my way, Caroline."
"If you can't handle it, you should go."
"He's right, Caroline."
Just go.
No!
Tyler!
"Go, Caroline."
What are you doing?
"What the hell, man?"
Does it bother you?
Knock it off!
Good.
Get angry.
It's in you.
You know it is.
I said knock it off!
Your bond to Klaus is putting my daughter in danger.
"Now either you turn or I kill you right here, right now."
"You've grown into such a beautiful young woman, Bonnie."
"Please, just stop with the muffins and the compliments."
I just want to know the truth...
Why didn't you come home?
I had no magic.
"I was in a new city, and I realized"
I'm not negotiating.
And you understand that holding them indefinitely is the same thing as dropping them in the ocean?
"No, no, you leave Mystic Falls and then give me a call in a few years, and...We'll talk."
I'm going to give you another chance.
Just one more.
Let's make a reasonable deal.
Or what?
"You make one move, and I will..."
"Yes, that's right."
Crazy Stefan.
Mmm.
How's that working out for you?
Any friends left?
I just can't believe I'm actually going to see her.
Or meet her.
Sort of.
Since I don't really remember her.
You don't really talk about her.
What's to say?
"She left, never wrote, never called."
Not even when my grams died.
Can we talk about you and Damon instead?
I'm not talking about it.
He kissed me.
It's not going to happen again.
I mean...
Was it good?
It doesn't matter.
That means it was.
It's Stefan.
I told him I'd call him as soon as I got the address.
Ignore.
You want to ruin our country by selling the gold to the enemy!
"No, kaka sir! sher khan will lay down his life for his country!"
"But he won""t let this happen!"
Take the reward for your patriotism!
"John, Basheer will be at the port with the truck!"
Go and check! kaka sir!
- Yes!
We had already given the instructions.
That he should be at Aaram port with the truck!
"Pinto, you will remain a fool."
"You won""t understand anything. come on! come with me! oh God!"
"Pinto.. its not good to interfere. kaka sir, what are you talking about?"
Fool!
This gold is worth crores.
And John is no longer required.
Just think.
"You risked your life, you locked horns with Tiger singh.. ..and did this great job."
And John should get his share for doing nothing?
Now think.
"What is the need of John? oh! kaka sir, now I understood."
"We don""t need him!"
- Yes!
Tiger singh!
You are alive!
Good!
Good that you have come!
That Pinto shot John!
You are intelligent!
Use your brains!
Take advantage of this golden chance.
Become rich.
Let this launch go.
Do you think Selim could do such a thing?
- Can't we take a look at that newspaper?
- It's on its way.
What's wrong Perihan Hanım?
What do your in-laws want this early in the morning?
Hello?
My love?
What's the matter?
They say it's Reşat Yaşaran's son.
Who?
Give me a name and I'll strangle him!
They told me last night.
And it's on the newspaper this morning.
"Tell me who said that, and I'll sue that bastard."
"It's on the local newspaper, Münir."
Turaner Bey has just called me.
The news reached even him.
"Yeah, I know."
The girls fiancé has already told me.
- What?
"- He's here, he's gone crazy."
I'm trying to explain it to him.
- Damn it...
- But I'll find that man and make him pay for it.
- God damn it!
- I'm going to the prosecutor right away.
"Yes, of course."
Going to the prosecutor.
Don't get the prosecutor involved.
Don't get us deeper down.
"Don't you worry, I'll take care of it."
"Call you later, uncle."
Go to him.
Shailu!
You are still wasting time here?
Venkat is leaving the city.
- My God!
You are bleeding!
Were already in a lot of trouble.
"- What happened to you, dad?"
"This is nothing, baby."
He was very angry.
Leave that matter.
Venkat is leaving the city.
Go and stop him.
I tried to convince him to change his decision.
But he was very angry.
His anger was increasing every minute.
As a last effort I fell at his feet.
With out respecting my age he kicked me.
I hurt myself by falling on a stone.
I dont care if my body is hurt.
It will be cured in a few days.
But he hurt my heart.
He threw this ring to the ground.
Any way he is a man.
But we have to bare it.
If you go and fell at his sisters feet..
Not necessary.
"Listen to me, baby."
I am saying it is not necessary.
I dont want.. .. to fall at the feet of a person who rejected me.
"If he wants me, he will come to me."
He had a dispute with Bhadram in the past.
I'll take a shower and go out.
"Okay, as you wish."
"- Good morning, sir."
- Good morning.
"Lawyer Necati Bey called twice, sir."
Thanks.
Good morning.
"Yes, yes, I just woke up."
So how did the trial go?
"Unfortunately, we didn't get the decision we hoped for."
- What?
- The lawyer took into account the last developments.
Until Mirza Çeltik's investigation is over... ... he was released by the court pending the trial.
So is he... is he free now?
God damn it!
He can't leave the country though.
Who cares if he can't go out of the country?
Is he out there and free now or not?
Aleykum selam... aleykum selam.
What are you doing here?
And how did you get in here?
What is going on?
What do you think you are doing?
How did you get inside?
"Come, let us have a talk with you."
What are we gonna talk about?
This was for Cemre.
Barış Bey!
Get up!
Don't!
Come here.
I had made you an advance payment before the trial... ...
Tell me your name.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Trick or treat.
I give you treats and tricks.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Father Moore!
Papa!
Emily!
Emily!
"She feels so hot, Father!"
She's burning up!
Hold her down there on the straw!
Hold her!
Emily!
Doctor!
I need you here now.
Watch her vital signs.
In the beginning was the word.
And the word was with God.
"And the word was the word, and what a wonderful word it was."
Through him all things remain.
"Without him, nothing was made that has been made."
"And the 70 disciples returned again with joy, saying:"
"""Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name."""
Her heart is racing.
It's almost 180 beats a minute.
I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
Behold.
I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions... ...and over all the power of the enemy.
"And nothing shall, by any means, hurt you."
Get it off!
- That's more like it.
A shoe?
So you won't listen?
- No.
What have you done?!
You have ruined my uniform.
What will I wear to the function now?
What happened?
"Aunty, see what this crazy girl has done."
She has wet my clothes.
She threw water on me.
How can I go to the function in these clothes?
Your love and affection has spoilt....
"What happened, aunty?"
- Nothing
Don't worry.
I'll iron them out.
Renu...
Hey fatso!
Your clothes have come.
Get ready soon.
"Tut, tut!"
You shouldn't say that.
"- Yes, you're right."
What is the function about?
They'll distribute awards and deliver lectures.
Sit.
If it isn't too much of a bother could I have a cup of tea?
I'll get it.
"Dear sister Vandana,..."
Suraj has finished his Air Force training... ... and now he is an Indian Air Force pilot.
"The responsibility that you delegated to me,... ... to fulfil Suraj's father's dream,... ... has been fulfilled by me."
"Today on the bases of this truth, I've dared... ...to come and ask for your daughter's hand in marriage."
Do you know the punishment of stepping in this house?
"I've gone through many punishments, father."
And I'm ready to go through any punishment.
Then watch my last punishment.
Brother!
- No!
What are you doing?
"Stop, Jamna!"
Stop there everyone!
"No, uncle!"
Don't do that.
Think of your daughter and your prestige.
He's that goon who has brought shame to my prestige.
He snatched away my daughter from me.
I'll not spare him.
"Yes, he has snatched away your daughter."
He has...
Shoot him.
Kill him...
"But remember, first you'll have to kill your own daughter."
Radha!
Radha!
Radha is Kishan's flute.
No one could separate it.
She'll live and die with him.
What are you doing?
At least think about me.
Lowly!
Your father arrested so many criminals.
And you want him to be a criminal today?
God!
Come on.
- I see.
"Call him, call him."
Where is he?
I have a even fresh matter today.
I will call him.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
"Tanya, hi."
You didn't tell me that your grandpa is Albert Einstein.
"Shut up, okay."
My grandpa means everything to me.
"18 years ago when there was an earthquake in Indonesia.. ..my mom, dad.. - Do all scientists.. ..get their haircut in the same saloon?"
I will kill you.
Bunty.
Come on.
Grandpa.
How is my child?
"Grandpa, he's Bunty."
I am Gonsalves.
Anthony Gonsalves.
"- Hello, sir."
"Sir, what is this?"
This.
This is a time machine.
A machine that will connect us with our past.. ..and make our future better.
"A machine that will break the sound barrier.. ..and take us back, I mean to our past."
Time machine?
"Professor, they are are just film fiction."
"How can you make a time machine in reality, professor?"
"It can be made, we can make, we can make."
If we can see the past then we can also travel into the past.
After that?
- Weather report.
Who will give that report?
Gali Ganna Rao.
If we call him he can tell when it will rain.
9848032919.
This is my cell number.
Gali Ganna Rao.
This is my name.
People always misunderstand me and feel.. ..that I give them wrong information.
I only read the report given by the weather department.. ..but dont control the weather myself.
It will be good if you understand that.
Please call later.
Ok?
Catch!
"Sir, we are in trouble."
We did not still get the report which.. ..we are supposed to get by now.
- What shall we do?
Oh!
I see that you are new to the job.
You dont know about me.
Do you think that we depend fully on their report?
Now select one finger.
The pointing finger?
There will be no rain.
Go.
"Sir, there is a phone for you."
Who is that?
- A fan of yours.
This is Gali Ganna Rao speaking.
This is Gun the Gagan speaking.
Are you the person who gives the weather-related news?
"Hey girl, turn the oven off in five minutes."
Let it settle a bit as I am getting ready.
Then let us make a nice package for it.
"Yes, ma'am."
"Ebru Hanım, we've got a mail for you."
I am so excited to see Kuzey.
"But, also nervous that I will see Sami there."
"I mean, I can't go in before or after Sami."
Since we have limited time.
I will have to see his face.
"I know, he will try to talk to me when he sees me alone."
"But, I will not listen to him."
Why would I listen?
"God forbid, I don't want to give him any hopes."
"If he gets some hope and throws his ring away,"
I would feel sorry for the woman.
Ebru Hanım?
"- Who received the mails today, Hasan?"
"- I did, ma'am."
- Who brought the big yellow envelope?
"- A courier, ma'am."
"Barış, get up!"
Barış get up!
"I'm telling you to get up, Barış!"
"What did you do, huh?"
What did you do?
What's going on?
"Calm down, what did I do?"
Celebrated for the end of Ferhat case.
And getting rid of the Burak problem.
Is this how you want to get rid of him?
- What is the matter?
Bonnie...
This was a mistake.
"She has no magic, she can't help us."
"Bonnie, wait, please."
Don't go.
Talk to me.
Please?
I'll wait outside.
"Hi, Elena."
Nice lake house.
"You know, we never got a chance to officially meet, doctor...Fell."
"You're Alaric's friend, right?"
Damon Salvatore.
Saw you at the council meeting.
What are you doing here?
Strolling the halls.
I like to wave at the newborns through the window.
Sorry about your boyfriend.
Animal attack.
Brutal.
Ex-boyfriend.
And thanks.
I'm still kind of processing.
"Yeah, I'm sure."
"You know, I just thought I'd come by and tell you that it wasn't an animal attack."
And then I realized.
You signed the death certificate.
Would you rather I say he was staked like a vampire?
"Wasn't he the guy that coined the phrase ""animal attack""?"
Why do you even care?
Because Ric likes you.
"And if you're a psychopath, it would probably really suck for him."
Why are you giving Demet's letter to Kuzey?
- It will get on his nerves.
- What is it to you?
It's her who wanted me to do it.
How shameless of her to  write to him after what she did.
"Have you no shame, talking behind her back without know what really happened?"
"Isn't Demet your friend, too?"
"You're one of a kind, Cemre."
"You talk about shame, yet... ... you are here for your lover, as a married woman."
- You are really unbelievable.
- So are you.
"- Kuzey Tekinoğlu, right?"
- Yes.
Anything else?
"Well, three letters."
But I can give them to him.
You'll have to leave them here.
They will reach him once we check them.
Is that so?
Alright.
- The visiting room is upstairs.
- Thank you.
- Sami Tekinoğlu.
- You can sit.
Are we going to see him together?
- You will do as you were told.
- I was told nothing.
- Neither was I. - It's 15 minutes.
You want to see him separately?
"No, I will see my son for as long as I am allowed."
He can wait outside if he wants.
"Okay, we got it."
Law may give bail to Jackie's men.
But I want an order of Jackie's death penalty.
"Don't worry, uncle."
I've prepared such strong case against Jackie... ...that even the supreme court can't save him from the gallows.
Jackie surrendered?
- Yes.
Why?
Why?
- Because Radha told him to do so.
What?
- Because Radha is in love with him.
What?
Radha?
Which Radha?
Our Radha!
Radha takes him as her husband.
Radha has taken a promise from him to be a good citizen.
This enmity has turned into a love story.
Serious!
Serious!
Serious love story!
"And if Jackie is hanged, Radha..."
Radha... what will she do?
"I'll commit suicide, brother."
I can't live without Kishan!
"He isn't a criminal, brother."
He's made a criminal.
I've never hidden anything from you and sister-in-law.
I swear upon you... ...he never looked at me with evil intentions.
Had he wished... he could have done anything with me.
"But for the sake of my love, he embraced death."
"Save him, brother."
- Where should I put my hands?
- The waist is safest.
You're a quick learner.
"Now, tongues."
They're a health and safety issue.
The secret is to strike the right balance between yielding and giving.
"Start slowly, like a turtle, not a lizard."
Avoid washing machine syndrome.
"Sadly, this session's over."
My next client's here.
"- Hi, Georgia."
"- Hi, El."
"Thank you, Georgia."
I'll be in touch.
"You did tongues, didn't you?"
Number six.
"You did a big fat tongue sandwich, didn't you?"
"Oh, my God."
"All I know is, he was from Saliva City."
But who cares?
I'm a snogging sensation.
Wait!
Mum?
Dad?
I just want you both to know how much I really appreciate all you've done for me.
"I mean, it can't be easy since you can hardly remember being my age"
'cause it was so long ago.
Have you been inhaling fumes from the science lab?
I want to talk party details.
"Oh, Georgia."
I told you I needed to talk about something important.
"Oh, this is important!"
"I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should be there at the beach."
And who needs books when we've got speech?
And who knows what's in store for raw love?
"Life, a penny at a time."
"Oh, love, life a penny at a time."
"Love, life a penny at a time."
"Oh, love."
"[fireworks whistling, popping]"
man speaking native language:
"When I close my eyes,"
"I can see all different people in the world from town to town, from country to country."
"I can feel it, I can touch it, I can see it."
I feel like born again because of my haircut.
It's time to continue my journey.
man:
Who do you love?
Cathy:
"My silly boys, the Bobby-ells."
Okay.
What do you fear? man:
"Well, I guess..."
I'm fearless now.
"I guess my fear was that you'd get cancer, and you did."
"That you'd get it again, I mean."
And you did.
But it's over with.
So I'm fearless.

"No... no, Goddess."
It can never happen.
"Bye, Bye, Seeya!"
Is this enough for my sister-in-law's birthday?
-Sister-in-law?
-Yeah.
-Who?
-Su-eun.
Since when has my sister been your sister-in-law?
We're not even married.
You who don't even have to propose...
Su-eun told me to call her that.
You're on your period aren't you?
Should I cook seaweed soup for her birthday?
I'm good at it.
"You fry up the beef, add a dash of sesame oil, you boil it with soaked seaweed... fantastic!"
She'll like it.
What do you think?
Let's rest a bit.
"It's hard on you, isn't it?"
Of course.
You make me carry these heavy bags.
Not that!
Then what?
Don't you think you can take it easy?
- I am taking it easy now.
- You've been doing it a long time.
And worked harder than anyone.
What was that?
It means &amp;amp;quot;l love you forever.&amp;amp;quot;
Doesn't it?
Sister-in-law taught me.
"It means, &amp;amp;quot;l love you, so let me touch your breasts!&amp;amp;quot;"
Huh?
Where do I live?
"- Jaipur, aunt."
So I am speaking from Jaipur.
But your voice sounds quite clear.
"So why are you yelling, you fool."
"Aunt, father has said.. ..that we should speak louder on a trunk call."
He's a fool.
Maybe you might know better.
But he will kill me.
If he misbehaves.. ..then throw him out of the house.
"But.. aunt, won't that be a bit too much?"
- No.
He drives my mother crazy.
But isn't your mother dead?
I am talking about my mother.
Don't you and father have the same mother?
"Oh, no."
He's the servant's son.
After the servant died my mother raised him.
What?
My father is the servant's son?
That means I am a servant's grandchild.
Ask Bhikhu.
Bhikhu knows about it.
- Yes.
Bhikhu is your father's brother.
"The servant of my cruel, low-down, scoundrel neighbour.. ..is my uncle?"
"Kishen, aren't you ashamed to abuse your neighbours?"
"Why shouldn't I, aunt, why shouldn't I?"
"The mother's a witch, the daughter's a specter."
"You know, last month.. ..they pulled down my father's loincloth."
Do you know that?
I will give you the rest of the payment today.
"Oh you were hungry too, right?"
Here!
Come here!
Don't call the police.
I will kill him right here  if you call the police or the security.
I was put in jail because of him.
"Come here, come."
Lion...
Get up.
Fight me like a man.
You were doing stuff behind my back.
Why don't you hit me once?
"Slap me once, just once."
"Hit me once to wind me up, come on!"
Get up.
We are not finished yet.
Get up.
May God accept your prayers.
I first found out that Mirza Çeltik's deceased son was your boyfriend.
And then I found his grave.
Then I tracked the fresh flowers brought here everyday.
And here I am before you.
Hello Komiser.
"You know Kuzey was released today, right?"
Mirza Çeltik doesn't have many days ahead.
You are trying to close Ferhat's case.
Why would I want that?
For the same reason you come here everyday with flowers.
I am not doing anything.
I will prove it.
I will prove it.
Millwall!
Millwall!
- What the fuck's he doing here?
"- Martin, sit down, son, sweet."
- That's it.
"Do as you're told, you mug."
- Fuck off.
Bovver.
You know we're gonna have to stop meeting like this.
People are gonna start to talk.
"So, what you doing up so late, anyway, on a fucking school night?"
Shouldn't you be at home with your pals... ...all shitting at the thought of us turning you over?
"What, did you have a lover's tiff?"
"Well, what do you want, Bov?"
Fucking Yank's an undercover journo.
He's at our boozer now.
"Tommy, you gotta give him the chop."
He's got them eating out of the palm of his hand.
"What makes you think I'd want to sort that out for you, eh?"
Because the Major's there too.
Stevie Dunham's in there?
"- Oh, thanks, Pete."
- Shut up!
History student my ass.
Who the fuck are you?
"Look, I'm sorry I lied about being a history major, but that's it."
- I'm not a journalist.
"- Well, it don't look fucking good, does it?"
- Why are you keeping a record?
- It's a journal.
I've kept that my entire life.
Are you working for the Times?
Harry sent me roses.
"So where you been, pal?"
You don't return my calls.
I've been busy.
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?
"The less you see of that man, the better."
"Now, les all go into the other room and have something to eat."
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
So how are things going at Oscorp?
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.
We're about to make a breakthrough on fusion.
"How lovely, Harry."
"Your father would be so proud, rest his soul."
Thank you.
"We're actually funding one of your idols, Pete."
Otto Octavius.
I'm writing a paper on him.
You want to meet him?
You'd introduce me?
You bet.
Octavius is gonna put Oscorp on the map... ...in a way my father never even dreamed of.
"M.J., could you give me a hand?"
"She's waiting for you, pal."
What do you mean?
The way she looks at you or doesn't look at you.
However you want to look at it.
I don't have time for girls right now.
"Why, are you dead?"
I've been kind of busy.
Taking pictures of your friend?
I'll let go when I count to 3 and you hook him out 1， 2， 3
Get hold of him
Wait.
Why are you still staying here?
I want to get your first time

Don't! lf you touch me I may be sent down to hell

It's all because of you
Had you yielded to me， he wouldn't have got you involved

Shut up!
I may say it now even when I'm not drunk
We've been dating for 7 years.
We kissed and caressed
Why didn't you answer your phone?
- It's nothing.
- Are you gonna come pick us up?
Is Fatmagül all right?
- Where are you?
- I don't know...
"It says ""Dolapdere Taksim"" Do we take the turn here?"
I don't know either.
"Hold on, let me ask somebody here."
"Okay, call me right away."
- Let us forward a bit then...
"- Let's not get lost, Mukaddes."
Shut up Rahmi.
I am so tired already.
"- Damn it, what's your hurry?"
- Be careful Mukaddes!
I'll go get your brother and yenge.
Stop being stubborn.
Just eat these.
"You passed out, out of hunger."
Eat them before they get cold.
You'll feel better.
I shouldn't have known...
- How stupid I am...
"- You couldn't have known, something that didn't happen."
I've explained that non sense to you how many times now?
There was something strange that night... ... with the three of you.
"And then, that woman..."
She said she was Fatmagül Ketenci's brother's wife.
What did she come to talk with your dad about?
God...
The woman was looking for her when she was missing.
Why did you send her there?
What was she doing at your mom's house?
"What did you do to my daughter, tell me!- It's okay dear, okay..."
Mira?!...
Yaman did you take the exam?
Yaman did you take the exam?
"No, I came to you..."

"- What is all this about, Reşat Bey?"
- What do you mean sir?
Haven't you seen the local newspaper?
I am...
I am very sorry but I don't know what you're saying.
The party members have just read  your town's local news to me.
Explain to me what this rape scandal is about.
"They mention Selim's name in it, too."
You will tell me everything.
You will tell me what you did to Fatmagül.
Are you alright?
Back off!
They asked me to help the girl.
So I went to the hospital.
And I found out that the girl had an affair with Kerim.
Lies!
Don't give me bullshit!
Tell me the truth!
You just don't want to see the truth.
The real lie is what you see here.
This rape slander.
It's educational.
You'll gain skills Lindsay can only dream of.

- Hi.
Are you Peter Dyer?
"The man, the myth, the legend."

Inner Relaxation Mix?
Whatever.
You choose.
"Now, what kind of experience do you have?"
"Oh, loads."
You have to be completely honest so I can evaluate you accurately.
"Okay, I guess I practise a lot on the back of my hand."
"On average a person will have over 25,000 snogs in their lifetime."
"So close your eyes, relax, feel the magic."

- Great.
"Next, movement."
When I move my head in you go the other way.
The boy leads and the girl always fits in.
It's too much.
"Well... ...congrats on the Epstein account, Van Holden."

Fucking lucky bastard.
What the fuck.
Matt Buckner?
Is that you?
"Jesus, Matt, you look like shit."
"Hey, Buckner, do you mind?"
- You said you'd hook me up.
- What?
"When I took the fall for you at Harvard, you said you'd hook me up."
"You gotta be kidding me, man."
"They were your drugs, and you said you had more to lose..."
- ...and that you'd hook me up if-- - All right!
"Yes, I said I would hook you up."
"Jesus, Matt, I--"
I'm in a meeting right now.
Call my office.
Talk to Cindy.
She'll make an appointment for you.
"You gotta be joking me, you spineless shit."
- That you'd hook me up if-- - All right!
"Yes, I said I would--"
- What the fuck is this?
"- Oh, this?"
- It's my ticket back to Harvard.
- Give me that.
I wouldn't do that.

One Snow Maiden won't make a New Year celebration.
There.
And I say - it will.
Absolutely!
Today the Snow Maiden Will visit girls and boys.
"And she will bring them presents, And she will bring them toys."
So you are determined to see in the New Year?
Yes!
And you no longer need the old year?
"No, we don't!"
"Go ahead, see it in then."
But mind you: the little elephant will miss out on his Birthday.
How is that?
Why?
"He hasn't celebrated his Birthday this year, right?"
He hasn't.
And he won't.
Because you don't need this year any more.
But how will he do without his Birthday?
I wanted to give him ripe bananas as a Birthday present.
There won't be any ripe bananas either.
They'll stay green.
"My friends, I think we rushed events a bit."
And how!
"Why see in the next New Year, when there's still so much interesting left in this year?"
Sweet bananas and pineapples.
Oh yes.
And my Birthday.
Then the future hasn't come yet?
Not yet.
"In his things we found fishing lines, hooks and lures!"
What do you think he was going to do with all that?
I think we've all had quite enough.
I have therefore decided to expel Inochkin.
I'm done.

- That's my name.
- Comrade Dynin.
"- What ""comrade Dynin?"""
- It's not fair.
I think...
- You think too much.
- What's so horrible about what he did?
- How long have you worked here?
"- All right, this is my first year..."
- Want some fruit punch?
- But he's a swimmer!
2:12 on his back!
- Those who don't swim don't drown.
It's the other ones who drown.
You think it was easy for me to tear Inochkin from my heart like that?
"- Then bring him back, comrade Dynin!"
I'll take full responsibility!
"- All right, calm down."
- Then I'll go get him?
- Wait till I'm finished talking!
- You're all flustered about this Inochkin.
"What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack?"
"Pretty swanky, are they not?"
And Twilight!
I made this dress for you... ...and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality.
"Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it."
"Oh, and it turned out BEAUTlFUL, don't you think?"
"Ooo, and I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy."
It just sings spring!
"And Pinkie Pie, look!"
Pink!
Your favorite!
Aren't they all amazing?
Wow...
-They're...
"-Yeah, they're..."
They sure are...
-...sumth'n.
-Yes!
Something.
I love something!
Something is my favorite!
It's... nice.
But what's the matter?
Don't you like them?
They're very nice...
And we're plum grateful cause you worked so hard on them.
Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining.
She asked.
I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
That's okay.
Not a problem.
There's plenty more where that came from.
"When I was at the war front, he saved my life once  so I brought him back and treat him like my own son."
You've ruined his hunting game.
Let's go.
Now.
I'm so afraid. * sarcastically *
What?
A prince?
He is nothing but a thug!
You are unworthy of being here!
You there!
Take your hands off of him.
What have I done to deserve this?
Are you saying even the deer is first for the prince?
Why you still...!
Take him out and lock him in the storage.
Yes sir.
"Is that you, Kwon-yoo?"
Please forgive me.
I've wrong you by not teaching the lower ones.
Please forgive me.
I told you to stay away from here 'til he leaves.
What?
What are you worried about?
Don't worry.
I hear you are not reading lately.
Is it true that you your time is consumed by hunting?
I was trying to broaden my view like  others by not focusing on study alone...
Was I really asking you that?
What is the reason you keep going to the Shin family's house?
Is it because of his daughter?
Only the Shin family...
She is the first one that I like...
"Alright, woohoo!"
"Go, Rarity!"
Rarity?
You okay in there?
You haven't come out for days.
I'm never coming out!
I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again!
I used to be somepony.
I used to be respected.
I made dresses.
"Beautiful, beautiful dresses!"
But now everypony is laughing at me.
I'm nothing but a laughingstock!
"You're not a laughingstock, Rarity..."
-She kind of is.
-Shhh!
Come on out and talk to us.
Leave me alone!
I vant to be alone!
I want to wallow in... ...whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in!
Do ponies wallow in pity?
"Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in!"
I'M SO PATHETlC!
Now what do we do?
Panic?
That's your answer for everything!
"Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this."
She'll become a crazy cat lady!
She only has one cat.
Give her time.
Exile...
I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile.
"Bonnie, you're about to see your mom for the first time in 15 years."
I'm not letting anyone ruin that moment.
"Yeah, but he's going to keep at it until I pick up."
Fine.
What?
Where are you?
Bonnie and I are going to spend the night at the lake house while we wait for sheriff Forbes to give us some more addresses.
"You're kidding me, right?"
"No, Stefan, I'm not."
We need a night off from your insanity.
Klaus is getting antsy.
He knows I'm stalling him.
We need to move faster.
"Well, we're doing everything we can."
So could you maybe not call every 5 minutes?
"Sure, Elena."
Whatever you say.
How's life on the road?
- Scenic.
- How's life in Mystic Falls without any hybrids?
Boring.
For now.
"If you want any of us back, you just have to say the word."
There's no need.
I've been making friends with the town's civil servants.
"There's a deputy who's awfully chatty, but useful nonetheless."
Are you clear on what you need to do?
I've got it covered.
Can I help you?
Abby Bennett Wilson?
That's me.
Cute house.
Front side of the building Don't move
I'm five seconds away 4 seconds 3... 2...
What are you doing here?
Huh?
Are you okay?
I thought you were going to propose!
I thought you wanted a nice dinner in a fancy restaurant.
And we never play games with fires.
How could you not know that?
What?
"Hey, Lee Jin-woo..."
The movie's starting.
Shhhh.
"Hwi-chan, look at me."
Did you do your homework?
Then you better go home right away and do it.
Don't play on the computer.
"Do the homework first, okay?"
I have to stay here for a few days.
"You'll be fine on your own, right?"
You won't?
When have I ever not been alone?
"Yes, my Hwi-chan can do great on his own."
Your mom will do well too.
And I'll try to do better once I get out of here.
But you need to promise me one thing.
Show me your diary every day.
After school I went to the hospital to see Mom.
"Mom is hurt, so she has to stay there a few days."
Tomorrow I'll go to the hospital and show Mom my diary as I promised.
It's nice...
"Now Mom doesn't work late, she doesn't drink, and I can see her whenever I want."
Don't plan the plan if you can't follow through.
All that matters is taking matters into your own hands.
Soon I'll control everything.
Hey!
Hey!
My wish is your command!
Stand back everyone!
Nothing here to see!
The rest are for you Okay?
Damn you!
Landal， what are you doing?
He said...
No， he taught me to play the piano， but I failed
I'll take my leave
Lisa， he...
I forgot to say goodbye to you
Thank you.
Come and drink soup some other day
Outrageous!
I'll win her over for sure
Landal， what are you doing the whole night?
Go and see a doctor tomorrow
What're you doing?
I told you to my underpants but you're watching the landscape
Appear before me when I count up to three 1， 2， 3
Sister wants you to go down to have dinner
Your potbelly is protruding
Let me take you somewhere to reduce weight
I'm hefty
What's wrong?
"Sister, you've been beaten out of shape."
Go now
There is no beyond.
"Now, it is time to see the sun."
We won't give up our hopes.
We will see beautiful days.
"Narin, how are you sweetheart?"
I talked to the man in the Ministry.
You should have seen how he attended to me...
He will take me to the lunch soon.
Hello?
"Narin, do you hear me?"
This is under the shadow...
Let it see some sun...
Come on...
Mmmm!
Smells so good!
Right out from the oven...
"Who eats gets fat, who doesn't eat becomes sorry..."
"Doctor Bey, since you said you would leave early, I packed yours."
Thank you very much.
Enjoy.
No matter what we have done all this time He only showed some reaction to Narin.
Looks like he recognized her from the picture...
Huh!
"Come, come Duriye..."
You don't have any strength anymore.
Take a sit.
"Mom, are you ok?"
"Duriye Hanim, would you like to have a cold cherry syrup?"
Yes...
"Maybe, it will calm us down a little bit."
There is nothing to do Yasar.
"After all this time, if he only recognized Narin from a picture..."
He's panicked as well.
He'll probably say what I've already told you.
I wasn't going to answer him anyway.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
"Don't go, man."
It's okay.
I got it.
Don't talk to anybody.
"And tell the girl not to, as well."
"Thank you very much, Cemil Bey."
Much appreciated.
We're done here.
Thank God we had a connection here.
We don't have to wait anymore.
Your visa is in your pocket.
Let's go book a flight now.
So that you'll waste no time.
Every day you spend here is against you.
- Hello.
"- Good evening Meryem Hanım, how are you?"
How am I...
I am packing his stuff.
Maybe he'll need them in Istanbul.
I've spoken to a friend of mine who lives in Istanbul.
"You know, the one I mentioned before who might help Kerim out."
"- Oh, thank you."
- I explained to him the situation.
"- Of course, only the bits he must know."
- Thank you.
"Thankfully he said ""I'll help him, make him call me."""
He'll find a place for him to stay.
I'll give you his number.
"Remember, it's all in the presentation!"
"Piece by piece, snip by snip"
"Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip"
"Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed"
"Yard by yard, always stressed"
And that's the Art of the Dress!
"Oh, Opal."
These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made.
Okay.
I did exactly what each of you asked for.
Now don't hold back.
Let me know what you really think.
-Oh my!
-It's... perfect!
-It's cool!
Wow.
They're the best duds I ever did see.
It's exactly what I asked for!
"Thank you, Rarity."
Are you as happy with the as we're?
"Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy."
I'm just relieved to finally be done.
You are never gonna believe this!
You've heard of Hoity-Toity?
The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
Uh-huh.
He heard about your fashion show.
"Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him..."
"He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!"
"Whoa, Nelly!"
You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy.
You business will be boomin'!
When I saw Suraj I realised that he was your son.
Arun's son.
But when he mentioned his father's name I kept silent.
He still doesn't know that I am his mother.
Promise me that you will never tell him the truth.
He won't learn from me.
But if there is a God he'll surely learn of his real parents someday.
"Hello, mother!"
- God bless you!
Come in.
Suraj's mother has come.
Hello!
Please have a seat.
"Sit, my dear."
I'm pleased to meet you.
"Renu, fetch some tea."
"No, that won't be necessary."
Sit beside me.
It is customary to offer something to a guest.
I have come to meet you as it is customary to do so.
You are the girl's father and I am the boy's mother.
Both of us should consent to this alliance.
Times have changed.
In these times the girl and the boy decide for themselves.
The parentsjust need to give their blessings.
Our happiness lies in their happiness.
For the sake of their happiness we should set the date immediately.
It is my wish too.
She's feeling shy.
- She's a child.
"Vandana, Suraj's mother has come."
She is my sister.
He wants a lot.
"He has big demands, boss!"
He wants 1500 gm of gold.
"You don""t worry."
I have said yes on your behalf!
Fool!
Will your father bring 1500 gm of gold?
Go and bring breakfast!
Bring breakfast for 2 people!
I have come to meet you!
- I was waiting for you!
But sP is always busy!
I wish I was Tiger singh.
You would have then followed me thinking me to be a culprit.
Under this pretext I would have got.. ..the chance to meet my friend.
What do I tell you?
I had come to arrest Tiger singh!
And I myself have landed into trouble.
What trouble?
- A beautiful trouble.
Where did you find her?
- ln your city.
"I couldn""t stop looking at her when I saw her for the first time."
"When I saw her for the second time, I lost my heart."
"When I saw her for the third time, I lost my senses."
Where does she lives?
- ln my heart.
"When we were in London, you would never take.. ..any decision without consulting your friend."
And here you fell in love without informing your friend.
"Till the time I don""t fix the alliance with her parents.. ..how can I give her name to you?"
"Then give me the girl""s father""s name."
Diwan Dinanath!
"Recently, thoughts of you just fill my head."
That's what I wanted to say. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Dad!
What?
"Oh,"
Did something good happen today?
Huh?
"No, what good thing?"
"Aigoo, I wish something good happened to us."
Why? &amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;Did something happen?
"Oh, it's not that..."
I think it's going to take a long time to build the new house.
I can't get insurance on it since it's done by natural disasters.
And the company who was supposed to construct are just shrinking from their responsibility.
"Then what should we do, Dad?"
"Ah, don't worry."
"It will be resolved, but it will take some time."
"Although it might be uncomfortable, plan on staying here for a while."
Yes.
"I am sorry, Ha Ni!"
What's there for you to be sorry about?
Don't worry about me.
I am fine.
Okay.
Welcome!
-Hello!
-Hello!
"Oh, you two came?"
We didn't even open yet!
Sit!
Sit!
What are you doing here at this time?
I don't feel I'm driving.
I can't wait til next family gathering.
"Friday, 5pm., I'm sure  I'll get there on time."
Especially wishes.
"Wow, a good driver..."
I bet it's a woman.
"Damn, we spend so much  money on legal music and software."
If I was a driving examiner  I'd also give him a driving licence.
He's driving really well.
I can't wait til I can use toilet in the train.
30 MPH on the fast lane?
Great!
I can't keep up with those  new faces in politics.
"Easy, elderly lady can go."
I'm not in a hurry.
"Damn, my train is too early again!"
Cart is full but I still have  so much money in my wallet!
Vodka?
Not today.
I have to clean after my dog.
I'm driving.
"You know, I love my boss."
Are you crazy?
I'm working tomorrow.
Good that I finish full-time studies.
At least I have a job guaranteed.
I don't remember when  I last ate pork chops.
I'm sick of this sun!
I've always been interested in  tennis and cross-country.
Even when we weren't successful.
I'm sure that everything I study  will be useful on labor market
Socks and sandals?
My poor daughter!
What am I doing?
"He wants to be the king, but what is he doing?"
You mean the one who's stopping the ship is Sir Moonlight Black Hat?
"Yes, he's the one who helped both of us."
He's so cool!
So that's why he couldn't reveal his identity to me!
"This is all secret, so please do not let on that you know."
I'll be on my way now.
Wait!
Take me to him!
I don't think just anyone can meet him.
"In that case, please deliver a message for me."
"She says she respects you, Sir Moonlight Black Hat."
"You told her to not do anything, right?"
"Yes, but she said she wants to meet you."
She can't.
It won't be good to be involved with me.
We can't meet.
I really want to meet him again.
He seems like such a cool person!
"If I knew it'll be like this,"
I should have asked me for a business card!
So such a man existed?
He must be a true Joseon hero!
He disguises himself in the moonlight and rescued civilians in need!
I wish I could be like that too.
Then why don't you disguise yourself and go out in the moonlight?
How could I do that?
Why not?
You're a warrior who knows how to fight.
He's Sir Moonlight Black Hat.
"We don't know who's in it or what's in it, only that I think my dream's telling me to help kill Klaus."
What the hell are you doing?
I needed her to know about the coffin.
"And I needed you to keep her out of it, Bonnie."
"So what are you going to do, Stefan?"
Are you going to kidnap me so that I won't tell anyone?
"Don't tempt me, Elena."
"I think I know who can open the coffin, Stefan."
And I need Elena to help me find her.
Find who?
What are you talking about?
I couldn't place her face at first.
Then I realized...
"Oh, my God, Bonnie."
Who is this?
It's my mom.
Los alamitos?
"Um, too old."
Honolulu?
"Ugh, I wish."
How many of these are there?
A lot.
I asked the sheriff's office to pull up every single Abby Bennett in the country.
I know we haven't been able to really...
That things have been weird because of Jeremy.
So thank you for helping me with this.
I know you have a lot to deal with.
"There's nothing more important, Bonnie."
It's surreal.
Having to track down a woman who bailed on her own kid.
"You know you don't have to, right?"
Let Stefan obsess over opening up the coffin.
Look.
Kundan is just a friend.
I never thought about him like that.
"Mom, dad, at least don't fight tonight."
"Bunty, who would you prefer to stay with?"
- Katrina Kaif.
"Bunty, I am talking about the both of us"
I am divorcing your mother.
- That's a lie.
Actually I am divorcing him.
"- Very good, very good."
"You guys have fun, I am leaving."
Bunty.
Bunty.
Friends.
To make this celebration of a 33 year old mistake memorable.. ..I request Mr. Kundan Lal to sing a song in twin voices.
"Come, come."
Ladies and gentlemen.
I made this song for my dear friend.. ..Mala for her marriage with Kishen.
So can we change the mood now?
Clap.
"""Now you can do it like this."""
"""Take it to the left."
"Or you can do it like that."""
"""Shake it to the right all my ladies &amp;amp; my man and my men &amp;amp; my ladies."""
"""All my ladies and my man and my men and my ladies."""
"""You can do it like this."""
When my mom and dad didn't have any love story.. ..then what was the theme of the song?
"""Shake it to the right."""
Which song would suit such an unromantic couple?
How would both of them look singing together?
"""You can do it like this."
Thank you.
Standby.
Just one camera is enough to entertain us.
The outfits for today are very extreme.
"For three members, their outfits match the song."
For the other three...
Like this.
Up and down like this...
I want to do that again.
Cut!
Great work.
The end!
Great job.
"""Coffee Shop"" MV is over."
"""Coffee Shop"" is over and ""Hurricane"" is over too. our PAClFlC ToUR in 4 cities of America is over."
We're heading back to Korea tomorrow. our trip in America is now over.
I have many mixed emotions.
It was a long time in the U.S.
I'm glad everything finished well.
"""Coffee Shop"" and ""Hurricane"" music videos will come out well."
I'm looking forward to them.
Great work.
It's really over.
2 weeks have come to an end.
We're done.
"But really, the last shoot was the grand finale."
We were filming in the rain. on the rooftop.
"Which makes me feel better though, to think"
I tried my hardest up to the very end.
All or our schedules in the states are completed.
My clothes are all wet.
But I'm still very happy we're done with everything in the U.S.
Dharamdas!
"Ma""am, not Dharamdas. l told you to call me DDT."
Where is your boss?
Fine!
Fine!
"I didn""t see boss going out."
"Which culprit are you searching for, sP?"
Who will be a bigger culprit than you?
You left me alone for 2 months!
Where did you disappear?
I and sister-in-law were waiting for you since a long time.
You should have peeped in your heart!
I see!
How was your journey?
- It was beautiful! open your suitcase and tell me what have you brought for me? open the suitcase!
And take whatever you like! - ls that so?
There are many things in this too! only saris in this!
I am sure this has something for me! only two suitcases?
"We didn""t get any time for shopping, Rajesh!"
"But since when did you take custom officer""s duty?"
You are searching it thoroughly.
I thought you must have brought many things for me.
"But I didn""t find anything in this. shekhar, I will leave now."
- No!
"Have tea! sorry, shekhar!"
I am on duty!
Nowadays you are so busy with your duty!
"What do I tell you, friend? lt""s all because of Tiger singh!"
"Bye, sister-in-law. see you, shekhar. shekhar.. hadn""t we brought 4 suitcases?"
"Yes, seema!"
I gave two suitcases to kaka.
Listen!
"Yes, I'd be doing them a favor."
I'd be doing good.
Yes.
(robo speak) (robo speak)
Space 911.
"Looking at you all, I think it's pretty obvious you've never been this high before."
It is my belief that hunger will soon become a serious concern.
"With your permission, my masters..."
"Yes, a craving I have!"
For taquitos and cheese dip!
I've heard legends of a taco... ...made entirely out of Dorito.
If it exists we will find it.
"Master, sir."
I heard Yoda talking about midichlorians.
I've been wondering... ...what are midichlorians?
It's herion.
"Come on, boy."
We have located the Jedi.
We have them right where we want them.
Good.
This is almost over.
Just remember to keep all of your receipts.
This is a business trip.
Everything we do here is tax deductible.
At last.
I will show the Jedi who is truly lord of the dance. ...conference call to go over our quarterly report.
Maul?
Maul!
Snap out of it.
Are you even listening to me?
Yes.
Business trip.
Fine! kaka sir has said we have received your gold. - okay.
Mr. Ahuja!
- Yes!
"Tell Raman that the gold will be delivered tomorrow morning! okay, sir! - okay!"
What about my goods?
- You will get it here!
How is that possible? l brought your gold here.
You should deliver our opium at lstanbul!
"Ms. Yasmin, deliver their goods to lstanbul by syndicate""s boat."
"I won""t go!"
Yasmin!
You will have to go with them!
Hello.
Police. lnformer Ahuja.
"Ahuja! sorry, sir!"
"Exchange is helpless! very good news! constable Rao""s raid was successful!"
Gold and watches worth lakhs were seized!
"Were any men nabbed? - sir, five!"
Where is the group?
"Why didn""t you bring them here? very sorry, sir."
Presenting corpses is illegal. shut up!
Listen! - sir!
Where was that call from?
"- From Alibagh, sir! shift our headquarters there immediately."
"- Right, sir! very good idea, sir!"
The police should keep a tab on the culprits.
"And the culprits should keep a tab on the police. so that it""s easy for both of them."
Rao.
"- Yes, sir!"
Will you please shut up?
And get out!
Returning today Rajesh!
"If I'm to know my boundaries again, I need to have a last time."
I'm not a fool.
I'll go back behind my boundaries after that.
"Young Master, why are you following me?"
I'm not following you.
I'm just walking.
But Yongmun is all the way over there!
I don't want to go there right now.
Have you run away?
Or are you in trouble with Madam Noh?
"Well, you're higher up than her, so I guess you won't get in trouble."
Did you have an argument with her?
Madam Noh cannot argue with me.
"You know, I was always curious, but how come you're higher than Madam Noh?"
You're younger and don't do much.
Why do you order her around like that?
What is the relationship between you and Madam Noh?
Madam Noh is like a mother to me.
"Who are you anyway, Young Master?"
I've known you for over a year.
But I don't know what you do.
I don't even know your name.
"Like you said, I've run away."
But I have nowhere to go.
"I don't do much, so I won't be missed."
Why don't you teach me how I should spend the day?
"If so, I'll tell you my name."
"First, my surname is Yi."
Young Master Yi?
I'm hungry.
Shall we go eat something?
"Great idea, Young Master Yi!"
"I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater challenge for me."
AB:
What year would you like?
CA:
1824.
AB:
"1824, OK."
AB:
And what month?
CA:
June.
AB:
June what?
CA:
Sixth.
AB:
Was that a Sunday?
CA:
It was.
AB:
And it was cloudy.
(Laughter)
"Good, thank you very much."
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.
There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.
"Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy?"
"OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are."
"You have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?"
"OK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator."
"But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me,"
"- I left it in the hotel room. oh, you left it there?"
This is the point!
None
"I found out from my fan cafe, that they thought these were arm warmers."
"But guys, these aren't arm warmers."
I just put this mask on my wrist.
(Simple-minded)l didn't want to lose it.
I lose things pretty often...
So I try to always hang my belongings on my body.
- My camera - Did you shut the door?
of course you did.
Hi.
It's been 3 days in America.
- What are we filming today?
- We're filming for the MV.
"I want to live in a house like this one day. &amp;lt;""Coffee Shop"" MV First main character Dae Hyun&amp;gt;"
I'll have a wife and kids.
My wife will be cooking breakfast and I'll be playing with the kids.
"We'll eat delicious food together, and take a walk with our two puppies."
I'm glad the background looks nice.
At least I won't look tacky.
The place for my MV is the best.
The weather is fantastic.
How do I look?
It's me over flowers.
I can't really smell well because I'm sick.
But real flowers do smell good.
Do I get to rest now?
I was worried because I didn't get good sleep.
But the weather's so good it's very healing.
I'm done.
I took some pictures since I came to America.
Come to the front door.
"Yes, I entered from the chimney, I'll exit from the door."
Let's do it.
Great.
Aleykum selam.
How is it going?
- (?) Kuzey Bey.
- Hands off.
Don't pounce at me like hound.
I'll tell you something though.
There's a security vulnerability on that building.
Looks like some people broke the cameras in the yard.
Especially the walls surrounding the guest mansion.
"Don't be so stingy, man."
Spend some money to get those fixed.
- Kuzey Bey.
"- Telling you, people could walk right into the mansions."
- Salamun aleyküm.
"- Aleykum selam, bro."
Mission accomplished?
"Great, let's go then."
Your people got worried mad about you.
They kept calling me.
"- Nah, they are used to it."
"- Well, I don't know."
"They gave me headaches, asking me where you went off to after the trial."
"Why does everyone who can't reach you, call me?"
I don't know if I am a phone operator or a missing person office.
"You are my accomplice, what else do you want to be?"
"- Always, bro."
Don't worry.
- Thanks.
From here it looks very small.
"But when you're in front of the statue, I hear you only see the body because it's too big."
That building there is where the 911 terror took place.
So they're rebuilding a new structure there.
"Come to think of it, what's that on the very top? on top of that building there's something like a fork-crane."
The person operating that - must be so scared.
- He must be very scared.
He must have more than one life or something.
I'm sad.
We're heading back to Korea the day after tomorrow.
I wanted to tour more before leaving.
None
New photographer.
He takes out his right hand from his pocket.
"Look that way, looks at the sky, hand on the hat..."
"His hand's up, and back down."
He's walking suavely
He puts his hands in his pockets.
Looking this way.
Don't laugh.
He's laughing. oh no.
He couldn't help but laugh.
"Honestly, it's really embarrassing."
"For both the doer and the watcher, it's embarrassing."
Nice.
I'm done.
We're out in NY right now.
How early did we get ready?
It's 11 AM right now.
"To film at 11 AM,"
You have to start getting ready at 7 AM.
Which means Young Jae and Dae Hyun
Absolutely.
"What do you mean by ""work"", Keung?"
You won't understand!
I'm doing it for love!
Tell me.
I've became a different person ever since I met her.
I've do whatever she ask me to.
She wanted me to find a job.
I found a job.
I've ask her to marry me and she promised!
"Unbelievable, isn't it?"
"You just love her big tits, don't you?"
You jealous?
"Hell, I'm jealous!"
"In the past, I would have boasted myself so much... not anymore!"
I've something for you...
Organic Contribute Form
What?
It's out of your mind?
Read it first!
Ms Lee gave it to me the other day.
She looked at me in my eyes and said...
"""Keung, for guys like you who are in this killing business..."""
"""...life may mean nothing."""
"""But by completing this form..."""
"""...you'll be able to do society some good."""
"""You'll be saving someone's life even after you're dead."""
"""By doing this, you'll make your life worth living."""
This Ms Lee whom Keung's talking about is a social worker.
God knows what she sees in Keung that made her love him.
It's just fuckingly incredible!
"Here she is, doing her endless research!"
"Ohh there is bazaar today, I forgot!"
If we enter we can't get out.
You go down on the right!
On the right from here!
"You come also, if you want."
"- No, I will wait in the car, you go!"
Don't hurry !
Good afternoon!
I wanted to move my registration
First let me find your registration here.
"You know how devoted I am sister. but really, i can' t endure Kenan's trouble anymore..."
"What can I say, you're right.- I gave him many opportunities, you know it.. but it's a must to break up."
He lost me.
Don't feel yourself guilty.
It's his choice..
I wrote a letter and send it to him.I told him everything was needed...
Did he ask me when he got into trouble?
Yaman was also angry with this.
"""How can you do this when the guy is in jail?"""
Do you talk with Yaman?
He calls sometimes to ask about you.
I wish you stayed with Yaman aunt!
You wouldn't be apart and your life would be better too.
My life can't be better.
My condemnation is until death.
I will be at ease when I close my eyes.
"Sister, who is Turunc Nadir?"
What? &amp;gt; Turunc Nadir
O don't know...
Who is it?
I heard uncle Hasan and Kenan fighting once.
Kenan threatened uncle Hasan with him.
That's the slight catch.
The job's in New Zealand.
- What?
"- Look, I know it's a big deal and I don't have to decide anything yet."
I really want to discuss it with all the family.
It's a bit of a shock for us all but your dad's not going to do anything we're not happy with.
"Oh, Dad, you should totally go."
What an opportunity.
Yes.
One less parent to deal with.
If Dad goes to New Zealand I can easily get around Mum and have my dream party.
"Now, I just need a plan to show Robbie I'm a natural born snogger."
"So, I've figured out what I've got that Slaggy Lindsay doesn't."
Hair on the back of your legs?
- The Angus advantage.
- What?
Get in!
"Inside, now!"
You will wait for the judge to sentence you.
The prison warden is coming now.
Whoever tries to escape will end up in solitary confinement.
"Don't you know that, Nazif Kara?"
"Why did you try to escape, old man?"
Running to your wife &amp;amp; daughter?!
Tsk Tsk Tsk...
Sit down now!
What happened Kibarim?
I don't know.
"I went out, they pointed the gun at me and caught me."
Who is the rat that told them?
Nejdet wasn't waiting for you outside?
That idiot!
-That's impossible!
-How come?
That's the surveillance panel.
It can detect even a little bird.
Then how did the elephant enter?
We will investigate it later.
Later isn't enough.
Another similar accident will...
"Anyhow, you should hurry and finish rebuilding Zora."
I can't take it anymore!
"Doctor Hura, so you don't mind getting wild animals killed?"
"If I didn't invent animal robots, more wild animals would have been killed by humans!"
Help!
"Wow, Zora moved."
Help!
Help!
My gosh.
I can't do anything now.
It's beyond curbs.
Atom is the only one who can take care of this situation.
"Pura, not ready yet?"
It's evening already.
"Pura, do you understand?"
"I don't want Doctor Ochanomizu to worry, so I'm going to go tell him what happened and come back."
So please wait here for a moment.
I'll soon be back.
"You are late, Atom."
Sorry?
So Doctor Ochanomizu already went out with Doctor Hura to find me?
This is great.
Where would Doctor Ochanomizu be?
"Ah, that's..."
All I fucking cared about... ...was my reputation amongst the firms of England.
"I mean, you've heard all the stories about Millwall, yeah?"
"Last match I went to was Millwall, West Ham."
We're talking a good 10 years ago.
"I mean, we'd been waiting for this match all year."
At Millwall.
Yeah.
Stepping into their ground.
Completely outnumbered.
We were fucking wired from the start.
"Now, Tommy Hatcher... ...he was their main man back then."
He used to bring his 12-year-old boy to the grounds.
Tommy Jr.
"Always banging on how he brought his kid up, you know, to be like a little pit bull."
"Well, we lost that match."
Three-nil.
And those Millwall cunts started laughing at us.
And I just fucking snapped.
"I mean, I couldn't let it lie, you know?"
"So I assembled all our troops, and we hunted them down."
I saw that little lad go down.
Tommy!
No!
And I saw his skull get crushed under the boots of the GSE.
I never went to another match after that.
And I left the Major behind.
And that's when I met your sister.
She was my angel.
She really saved me.
Showed me a new life.
Helped me forget all this bollocks.
And she swore... ...she'd leave me if I ever returned to it.
So plus 5.
"5h plus 5, and that is choice C."
"And if you try it out with these points, it should all work."
"OK, next problem."
Let me see.
I think this cutting and pasting works out well.
I think I have time for at least two more.
"OK, let me clear this."
Clear this one right here.
Let me paste it in.
"OK, it says, some ordered pairs for a linear function of x are given in the table below."
It's kind of like the last one.
Which of the following equations was used to generate the table above?
Well we could do the same thing we did the last time.
"We could say OK, this is going to have some relation."
You know y is equal to mx plus b.
It's going to be a line and this is the slope y-intercept form.
And they tell us it's the linear function.
So that's why we can immediately say that's going to be a line.
There's no x squared or anything like that.
So a good place to start is just with the slope.
So slope is equal to change in y over change in x.
So let's see.
"When x goes from 1 to 3, what does y go for."
It goes from 1 to 7.
So change in x is equal to 3 minus 1 or just 2.
And what's change in y?
7 minus 1.
"So that is equal to 6 over-- oh, no."
Sorry.
Change in x was 3 minus 1.
Sorry about that.
"Come on, boy! boy:"
Woman! woman:
[chuckles] Woman!
"Oh, this is gonna be a long day, as most are. boy:"
[groans] woman:
He's always a bundle of joy when he wakes up.
"Come on, come get in the shower, get the day going."
"We got things to do, places to go. boy:"
Yeah. woman:
"People to see, futures to make."
[lighthearted music]
man:
I had a major heart operation.
I'm very thankful to the beautiful staff.
No job is too big or--or too small.
"And even down to a few minutes ago, just wiping my bum, because I had my first-- first poop... [chuckling]"
in about a week or so.
"So one of them came to the rescue and said,"
"""Listen, would you like me to trim that up for you, sir?"""
"So I said, ""Yes."""
"And a very--very, um, courageous young lady in my case,"
"I think, did the job."
"And just, uh, all in a day's work."
[chiming faintly]
"I'm very, very grateful for these people that have treated me like..."
Just treated me so well.
In a short--short while...
"I-I will be on the road to recovery, and I'll be out there again doing crazy things and enjoying life."
[overlapping chatter]
man:
"56, 56...57."
61 Rupees.
"Peter, tell us about yourself."
Do you have a girlfriend?
Well...
I don't really know.
"Well, shouldn't you know?"
"I mean, who would know?"
Leave him alone.
Maybe is a secret love.
Love should never be a secret.
If you keep something as complicated as love stored up inside... ...gonna make you sick.
I finally got lucky in love.
We both did.
But is hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.
"I met him on the college steps, and I knew it wasn't going to be easy."
"He was studying science, and I was studying English literature."
Thas right.
I was trying to explain the theory of relativity.
And Rosie was trying to explain T.S. Eliot.
I still don't understand what he was talking about.
"Yes, you do."
I'm serious.
T.S. Eliot is more complicated than advanced science.
"But if you want to get a woman to fall in love with you, feed her poetry."
Poetry.
Never fails.
A tall and slender maiden All alone upon a prairie...
Brightest green were all her garments...
And her hair was like the sunshine...
Day by day he gazed upon her...
Rent!
Where is my money?!
"I won""t marry!"
"I won""t marry!"
"Try to understand my helplessness, seema."
Love demands sacrifice.
"Love that doesn""t give sacrifice, that love is not true."
Even I am in anguish!
"But I am compelled to smile. seema, this is want destiny wants."
Forgive me.
"""ls this the reward of my love?"""
"""No, seema."
"Fate is testing me."""
"""Friend has asked for the sacrifice of love."""
"""But why are you making me the victim of this friendship, shekhar!"""
"""What""s my fault?"""
"""I am helpless, seema. l have given my promise."""
"""Now even if God told me, still I can""t break my promise."""
"""Who are you to take decision of my destiny?"""
"""lf you are helpless then I too am helpless!"""
"""But I can""t kill my love like this!"""
"""I won""t marry!"
"I won""t marry!"" cheater!"
Betrayer!
How dare you play this dirty prank!
Rajesh!
You were flirting with that girl and now you gave her to me!
"No, Rajesh!"
And you thought that I will marry her.. ..and shoulder your responsibility?
ls this called friendship?
Rajesh!
I can even lay down my life for your friendship!
This is what even I thought!
But now.. now I just want to ask you.. ..why did you thrust that girl on me!
"Oh, Gary McDonough."
His mother just died when he was in Florida.
He retired from GM and he was down there.
They're all pretty much retired.
"Caroline, she married a real nice guy"
He started off as a mechanic for the school district of the county just south of
Travers City.
He was running it years and years ago.
He was the head guy running the - he knew stuff.
He knew engines.
Nice guy.
So that worked out.
But now they spend their summers over there someplace.
They get back here once in a while.
They have something in Florida.
So the whole bunch is pretty good.
Sally's got this...
Nice girl.
She could ice skate.
She was a good ice skater.
Did the fancy stuff.
We skated out one time
I think it was [?] and Gary and myself.
February.
"And like one of them two week old ice, where it froze yay thick."
We went out after school and it was cold.
Where?
Out in the - just ice skating out towards Grey's Reef
The harbor?
Towards [?].
"And we got out there and - beautiful, just"
"like shotguns going off, when the ice cracks, when it's freezing, you know."
How long has he been here?
You won't believe this but 16 years...
You can find people like him in these kind of hospitals all around Turkey.
Nobody asks about them or visits them...
You can't find their family or relatives if you try to search for them.
"If somebody doesn't take him out of here, he will spend his whole life here."
They get along very well.
Mustafa...
How are you?
It is time for the medication...
Duriye Hanim!
Did you see him?
"Yes, I did Yasar."
Look...
I know that you can't bear your brother's situation.
"In my opinion, he is fighting his conscience and trying to come to terms with what he has done."
And you should let him do it.
"And Yasar, you know this, too."
My brother will not come back to us as long as Narin doesn't come.
That's all I know.
"Yes, Seher..."
What?
My Mom?
Duriye...
What happened Duriye?
"Father, she suddenly fell down."
Seher found her.
"When I heard Seher screaming, I immediately came here Aslan Bey."
It seems to me that her blood pressure went up...
"My Duriye, what will I do without you?"
"Look, don't you play a trick on me!"
Don't...
"ln my eyes, you are greatness"
"I'm here, I'm here with you"
Don't stay... don't stay with me...fight!
I'm not leaving you!
I'll be waiting for you in the next life
I see nothing but you!
I'll never be further from you than this!
Antony!
Queen Cleopatra!
Come out
Yield yourself to me!
Open this door!
ls she alive?
I don't know
Get the battering ram!
Caesar...
"So, Antony has gone to join Caesar"
"No, he's here with me"
Take the riches of Egypt Then let me die properly
I have no desire for you to die
"I've conquered a great country, a great Queen"
It's my wish that you accompany me to Rome
So you can walk me behind your chariots...you Egyptian prize?
Octavius' trophy?
"That would do, yes"
"I answer to no earthly superior, much less a mortal like yourself"
I am a goddess!
I am immortal!
"Ah yes, the Daughter of lsis"
You and I are very much alike
"Compelled to follow our own natures, fulfill our destinies"
"But I have won, Cleopatra And you will come to Rome!"
It's our first experience.
I couldn't do anything because I was frozen.
I'm sure Jong Up can do well though.
Jong Up is Americanized.
"lndeed, when this fancy background and"
Jong Up's slick dancing skills...
That was awesome.
I'm enjoying Las Vegas very much.
Filming is fun too.
But my bangs...
I'm gold from head to toe.
"Honestly, it was something I'd wanted to try some time."
I'm honored to have gotten my chance so early.
It's very very nice.
I wanted to visit because of the glamorous scenery.
I'm more excited than usual because we're shooting a MV here.
"More than tension, I'm having so much fun."
There's no time to be tense.
I'm your fan.
Please give me an autograph.
- There was no time to be nervous.
- Can I have an autograph please?
I think those sunglasses suit Bang Yong Guk more for sure.
I'll show you a real performance.
It's about 6 AM right now.
"More so than being very tired, no lies, it's so much fun."
I always feel I'm lacking.
lf I say I'd like to try again
We're good to go for a re-shoot but I still feel like it's lacking.
But that still feels lacking.
I'm not satisfied because it seems the same.
"Alright, all finished. okay"
Eh?
Three... five times...
They are giving you ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy).
Very gently...
You should have seen the electric shocks that I was given...
You couldn't stand it even while watching.
This is nothing...
For seven years...
I was given electric shock.
They fried us with electricity in Diyarbakir prison.
I smelled the burning of my own flesh.
"They made us into human kabobs, Mustafa..."
And then what?
Don't you be afraid.
You don't die from electricity.
You die from loneliness.
You die if you are not loved...
"How did you get the rich Mustafa, eh?"
"Do you get a good tip, eh?"
Serve him well...
This is a whale family...
"Let's stay away from this piece of shit, Mustafa..."
"Yesterday, I was looking at old pictures..."
"Look what I found, Asil."
Look what Mustafa did.
"The world will never see another man like Musto, dude..."
I pushed him around the garden in his wheelchair for about an hour.
"Now, he is yours."
I'll go and check the tea house.
Sahan...
"Shame on you; put it back into your pocket, brother..."
You give it to the poor...
You still have four legions loyal to you
Four legions
Have you given up hope
Perhaps I have
Caesar once stopped a whole army with only two legions
I'm not Caesar!
"I am not a god, I am not a king"
I'm a man
I'm just a man who reached for too big a prize!
Where is he now?
Octavius has taken Pelusium
That quickly
Give these to Rufio
Have him deliver them to Octavius
But these are the emblems of your office!
Send them to him with this letter
I am offering my abdication if he'll spare Caesarian... and let him sit on the throne of Egypt
"But why, Your Majesty?"
Has it really come to this?
There is no other recourse
We must buy time
Go now!
Down
Out of my way!
Stop it!
What?
What?
Why did you stop...
"Welcome, welcome Aphrodite!"
Welcome to Bacchus's beach!
Octavius has reached Ashkelon
Ashkelon is weeks away from Alexandria
Today we came to another airport.
We'll finish filming and enjoy our time in NYC.
NY fans are coming too.
NY style is supposed to be absolutely cool.
So we tried to be casual
Not to seem over-conscious.
This is NY.
It's unbelievable that I'm walking the streets of New York.
I can't believe it.
I received a business card.
He says he's a rapper in America.
He gave me a business card.
We finished off with a wonderful scene of America.
I was sitting over there and people started talking to me.
I couldn't understand them.
"We're in Manhattan, New York."
"The sun is shining, buildings are beautiful."
"I just really love this free, peaceful atmosphere."
"Most of all, the sunlight is the best here."
We wrapped my MV filming in NY well too. other members will film too.
I'm going to enjoy my free time.
I'm in NY.
"Wow, it's so great."
All the passersby's are awesome too.
The reason why filming is fun is not only because we show our new looks
But also because we come to new places.
It's awesome.
The sun just went down.
Boo hoo.
It really is America.
None
There are yellow taxies passing by.
Are you all sure?
"I'll book it if you promise never to chant ""Bahamas"" again."
Okayt
"All right, thank you."
It's done
"Block of rooms, garden view."
"Wait a second, garden view?"
That's the opposite of ocean view
"Hey, foxy lady want to come back to my garden view room"
I asked for the garden
The nose from### the ocean keep me up at night
So what the noise from my foxy lady if I had an ocean view room
"Stacey, any chance the national's media picked up on this story with the media"
I gotta go.
"The mayor pulled an ""Uncle Louie"" last night."
Nothing national but did you see the headline in the post
His honor was on her.
Very clever
"Jason's### really killing us, sorry Mike"
Doesn't matter.
It's under control.
I got Jason coming over### here right now
Jason is coming up here?
Damn I hate this tie
Carter
Great tie
"Listen, Jason, about this story in the morning paper"
"I thought it was great, by the way"
You didn't think it was too wordy?
Why are you so hard on yourself?
You're so talented...
Fellas
Didn't I ever go out with you?
When did you?
When did you ever take me out?
Should I remind you?
On our honeymoon.
"And I thought we'll go to Kashmir, Kulu Manali."
But where did you take me?
- Hubli.
And only because you were getting someone's bungalow free of cost.
"Kishen, you never cared about my feelings."
"Taking me for a movie, dinner, picnic was a farfetched thing."
You never uttered a romantic word to me.
"It takes two to tango, Mala."
You hated me before the marriage and also after.
I don't try to keep myself busy with the restaurant business for no reason.
I didn't go shopping without any reason.
"Kishen, if I am a shopaholic today then you're the reason for it."
"Because I tried to find happiness.. ..in these jewellery, clothes and shoes."
But now I have realised.. ..that I will never be able to find that happiness in all this.
"You found that out after spending 9, 35, 33, 315?"
"No, after wasting 12, 054 days and 23 1/2 hours of my life."
Dad.
Mom.
Mom.
Dad.
Mom.
I will never let you two separate.
Never.
I know I am going to do a crazy thing.
But there's no other way to stop this divorce.
"To change their present, I will have to change their past."
Professor.
Come on we have to study!
This is pampers for you to wear after you're done showering due to all the disasters you do at night when you're asleep
"What's happening, Sameh?"
They use this brush to clean the horses
Shut up
Let's get this over with
See your smart brother
Raise your arms!
What?
Your armpits!
Go head
Shut up
Ok
No this is clean
I swear it's clean
Shut up
Okay
No no!
Daaadd
"Guys, isn't this what you wanted?"
Wanted?
You didn't see what he did to us
"Like I told you before, we have to cope with it till the condition stabilises"
And when is that?
He sold everything and withdrew the money
That's Alzheimer's
The patient acts in confusion and then stabilises
Hopefully he'll stabilise and tell you where the money is
Did he even have Alzheimer's in the first place?
"What about the medication we use to give him, Mr.Karim?"
Did you forget?
Screw all this
That's the equation -- this is the line that ... of
"solutions to 2x-y=0 my first row, first equation."
"So typically, maybe, x equal a half, y equal one will"
work.
And sure enough it does.
"Okay, that's the first one."
Now
the second one is not going to go through the origin.
It's
always important.
Do we go through the origin or not?
"In this case, yes, because there's a zero over there."
"In this case we don't go through the origin, because if x and y are"
"zero, we don't get three."
"So, let me again say suppose y is"
"zero, what x do we actually get?"
"If y is zero, then I get x is minus"
three.
"So if y is zero, I go along minus three."
So there's
one point on this second line.
"Now let me say, well, suppose x is"
minus one -- just to take another x.
"If x is minus one, then this is a"
"one and I think y should be a one, because if x is minus one,"
then I think y should be a one and we'll get that point.
Is that right?
"If x is minus one, that's a one."
"If y is a one, that's"
a two and the one and the two make three and that point's
on the equation.
Okay.
Editorial staff.
"So those would, those would be my two concerns."
Yeah.
That's a good a good point a good tip.
And the opportunity to review is a good way to learn also.
Absolute.
As an author.
Absolutely.
So Yeah.
Yeah so.
Great.
Is there any parting thoughts or tips that you want to offer to the class?
"No, I think we've covered [laugh]"
Great.
"You're questions are so, you're questions are so good that you've covered everything that I might want to say."
"Thank you so much for, for taking the time to speak with us Gary."
You're very welcome.

I can't wait til Złotopolscy (boring soap opera)  comes back.
Or Big Brother.
In the morning I'd like to see  more people in public transport.
I understand that you have  different political views.
I respect that.
There should be more billboards  in the city centre.
Wow!
Those roads are great!
That's fantastic.
"I'm gonna get a lovely frame on that,"
'cause Nina's got a frame like that.
[laughs]
"That's really cool, Jack."
Thank you.
"Now, you should be very proud of yourself, Jack, considering you almost got chucked out of school."
"You was lucky there, weren't you?"
"Yeah, you've matured, actually-- actually, in the last year or so quite good into a real proper lad, a real gentleman and a nice boy."

man speaking native language:
Who do you love a lot? boy speaking native language:
My dad... because he brings me fruit.
"He cooks my lunch, makes me breakfast."
"He prepares everything, all the food we eat."
He cares more about me than his work.
The thing I love the most is my laptop.
"In Wikipedia, there are stories, history, math, science, religion."
It has everything.
It is a giant library.
[birds chirping]
man:
I love being me.
I love life.
It's all such fun. man speaking native language:
"Myself, I'd have to say... woman speaking native language:"
Placing my feet in wet sand.
It has to be wet. woman:
"Grass, dirt... dirty river smell."
"Mm, the smell of a campfire that gets stuck in your hair. man:"
Coated chicken baked in the oven with seasonings. man:
"I won""t get anything in this deal. kaka sir!"
Where will you run?
Beg! lmplore!
"But I won""t spare you!"
"Tiger singh, please let me go!"
Forgive me!
You will surely die!
I have to settle old scores with you! scores with me?
"Yes, you!"
20 years ago the man who was the in-charge of Goga lighthouse.. ..his soul is still waiting for revenge!
But what is your connection with this?
"Won""t a son take the revenge of his father""s death?"
"Why, scoundrel?"
"Tiger singh, forgive me!"
"Don""t kill me!"
"For God""s sake, forgive me!"
"Today even God can""t save you!"
"Go and drown! come, shekhar! sP, my mission is over."
And I surrender myself.
"I was waiting for this day only, shekhar!"
I have found out about your helplessness.
But you have committed a grave mistake.. ..by taking law in your hands.
I wish you had told me this before.
But I will try.. that the law is lenient with you.
"Taking into consideration the police""s recommendation.. ..for taking law in your hands, you receive.. ..7 years imprisonment term. only you dwell in my heart."
Believe me.
"Beloved, this is true."
"Let""s love in the open."
ln my heart..
My name is David Wolfe.
"I was born near New York city in America, currently residing in Ontario Canada."
"I am a renegade nutritionist, I am renegade superfoodist and infopreneur, but above all of that"
"OK, so that means that P and Q are equidistant from this"
"line, so that means that this distance is equal to this distance."
"When they say P and Q are symmetric around AB, you can almost pretend like AB's a mirror right here, and P and Q are the mirror images of each other."
Good enough.
And then it also says points Q and R are symmetric around line CD.
So we also know that this distance is equal to this distance.
Good enough.
What is the length of PR?
This is fascinating.
So let's say that this length right here-- let me do it in yellow-- this length is x.
Then what is this green length going to be?
This green length right here is going to be 4 minus x.
How did I know it was 4 minus x?
"Well, this distance up here is 4."
So this is x.
This is 4 minus x.
"Well, then this distance right here is also going to be 4 minus x."
"And if this yellow distance is x, then we also know that this distance is x."
"So the distance from P to R is going to be the sum of all of these, right? x plus x plus 4 minus x plus 4 minus x."
And I think you see where this is going.
It's x plus x plus 4 minus x plus 4 minus x.
"These x's all cancel out, right?"
2x minus 2x.
And we're just left with 8.
And that's our answer.
B.
And you could've tried it out.
"You could have assumed Q was right in the middle, and it would have worked out the same, but you know for sure that the answer is 8."
Next problem.
Image clear.
Invert.
I don't know if I'll have time for this.
We didn't know that so we both came here wearing hats.
We look too much alike.
This is the hat Dae Hyun was planning on wearing.
But he took it off and now he's getting his hair styled.
The concept has us meeting altogether in New York
"After wandering around in L.A., San Francisco"
And in Washington D.C.
There's a scene where Dae Hyun and I pass by each other.
Since you're wearing a hat it'll be better for you to sit down.
Dae Hyun can walk.
I'd only seen that in my dreams.
How cool is that.
That's the Statue of Liberty.
I can see the Statue of Liberty in the distance from here
It's so amazing.
It's the most exciting and cool thing I've seen in the U.S. thus far.
"It's huge even from here, how big would it be from up close?"
I was so surprised.
I wasn't expecting to see it from here.
I'm seeing it for the first time.
I'm seeing it from afar.
"Wow, I'm really in NY."
Cut!
The atmosphere in the background helps a lot.
It matches the song very well.
So it's very empowering.
"Today, the concept for my outfit and hair is an intern at the Brooklyn Newspaper."
It seems very different from the Brooklyn I'd seen in movies.
I really want to go to where the statue of liberty is at.
I think we might go. or I just have to go there.
"Please put an ice cream cone here, with CG."
"Finally, I got to see the Statue of Liberty."

DR. JAMES GRlME:
"This is such an inspiring story, because it shows how mathematicians can save lives."
We're talking about one of the most famous cipher machines of all time.
It's a code machine called the Enigma machine used by Nazi
"Germany in World War II to send secret, coded messages."
And we've got one over here.
This is not a copy.
This is not a replica.
This is an original Enigma machine actually used in World War Il.
This was made in 1936.
It's an army Enigma machine.
Let's see how it works.
So this belongs to a man called Simon Singh.
He's an author.
He writes popular science books.
And he lends it to the University of
"Cambridge, where I work."
"This was found in a French field, I was told, by an"
American cryptographer after the war.
And he took it home.
So I guess he took it home as his souvenir.
"Yoink, that's mine."
The guy who found it died about 12 years ago.
"And when he died, that's when Simon"
Singh bought the machine.
We're going to send a message.
"Now, we were talking about what to send before, so we send Numberphile."
Let's turn this into Enigma code.
So I'm going to type in N to begin with.
"And if you can see there, the letter Y lights up."
"It pissed me off when she did that, and she does it on purpose"
"She knows it, she's always copying me, it pisses me off!"
"Same thing, later she enters my office, she opens my drawer, she takes my pen"
"No ""thank you"", no ""excuse me"", nothing!"
"Jean, are you listening to me?"
Of course I'm listening
"No, you're not looking at me!"
Well I'm sorry but I listen with my ears.
It seems strange but...
Very funny...
"By the way, I should probably clean them, cause it seems like I'm only hearing stupidities"
Strange huh?
I won't tell you anything anymore!
"Oh no Alex, I love your stories so much..."
Really?
So...
"The day after, the day after..."
"Oh, Loulou, I gotta pee"
"Oh, no, Alex, it's only been half an hour since we left"
"Oh, I need to pee, I must pee, I have to pee"
Have you ever thought about wearing a diaper before travelling?
"But, Loulou, I was careful this morning"
"I didnt' have any coffee, orange juice or water, nothing, so that I wouldn't need to pee"
Well what are you peeing then?
"Oh, Loulou, can't you stop at a gas station with restrooms?"
"No no no, I'm doing what I can, at the edge of the road, it will be fine"
"No, Loulou, I want real restrooms!"
What next?
"No, here it's fine, come on"
"No, baby, I'm gonna catch a disease"
"It'll be fine here, Alex"
Disease?
I love... cleaning something that's really dirty so you can see the result. man:
I actually love my refrigerator.
It's such a cool thing.
It remains at one corner.
It keeps its mouth shut.

"I love the word ""mamihlapinatapai."""
"It's from the Yaghan language, which is now a dead language."
"But it was spoken in Tierra del Fuego, the very southernmost point of South America."
"I've never heard the word said properly, so I could be pronouncing it wrong."
But the meaning is quite beautiful.
"It means that moment or feeling when two people both want to initiate something, but neither wants to be the one to start it."
"It can be perhaps two tribal leaders both wanting to make peace, but neither wanting to be the one to begin it."
Or it could be two people at a party wanting to approach each other and neither quite brave enough to make the first move.

3 minus 1.
So it's 6 over 2.
"When x changes by 2-- that's this 2, change in x-- y changes by 6."
That's change in y.
So the slope is 3.
So the equation of our line is going to be y is equal to 3x plus some y-intercept.
And now we could substitute some points in.
Let's substitute this one.
"This 1, 1 seems easy."
So y is equal to 1 when x is equal to 1.
So we get 1 is equal to 3 plus b.
Subtract 3 from both sides of this equation and we get what?
"1 minus 3 is minus 2 is equal to-- obviously, this disappears, 3 minus 3."
So b is equal to minus 2.
"So the equation of our line, we have a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of minus 2."
The equation is going to be y is equal to 3x plus b.
Well b is minus 2.
So minus 2.
And that is choice C. 32.
The equation of line I is 6x plus 5y equals 3.
And equation of line q is 5x minus 6y is equal to 0.
Which of the statements about the two lines are true?
"OK, let's see."
They have the same y intercept.
They're parallel.
They have the same x-intercept.
Lines I and q are perpendicular.
Well I'll tell you how you can identify perpendicular lines.
They have the negative inverse of each other's slope.
But I don't know if that's going to come into play yet.
I always find it easier to look at these lines in kind of the slope y-intercept form.
So let's do that.
They cancel out.
Then you have bi times minus bi.
So that's minus b squared i squared.
These cancel out.
So you're left with a minus bi over a squared minus b squared i squared.
We know what i squared is. i squared is equal to negative 1.
You square both sides of that and you get i squared is equal to negative 1.
"So if we multiply, this becomes a negative 1."
"Every zero - this one, this one, this one and this one - that's sandwiched between them is significant."
Are these guys significant?
It's to the right.
Is there a decimal point?
There is.
1-2.
Every single one of them is significant - 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10.
10 total.
Wow!
Let's look at this long guy.
OK?
"Again, break it down."
"The 5, the 9 and the 6 we know are significant."
Which means that any zeros sandwiched between them are also significant.
The zeros coming to the left of significant numbers are never significant.
We don't have to worry about them.
There are zeros coming to the right.
Is there a decimal point in the number?
There is.
So the zeros to the right are significant because of the decimal point.
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 - total significant figures here.
"8 - 9 significant, sandwiched zeros also, 1-2-3 to the right."
They are significant because there's a decimal point at the end.
6 total here.
Europe on average uses
about half as much as Americans use and England is a really low water user.
They use about 40 gallons per person per day.
"So, now this cup, this is another continent."
It's representing 22 gallons per person per day.
Any guesses? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Asia. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Yeah.
Asia.
Yup.
"Now, we have another continent."
This is 12 gallons per person per
day.
Any guesses?
It's Africa.
"And the last one, this is one of the lowest water-using"
countries in the entire world.
It's representing 1.3 gallons of water per person per day.
Any guesses? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; A country? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
It's a country.
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rome. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
You're close.
Yes.
It's Gambia.
So it's one of the lowest water users in the world.
"So, we just wanted to start with, you know, how much water we do use."
"In the United States, we have a lot--we have a lot of water and we use a lot and so we're excited to talk about some better ways to use that water. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:"
"Thanks, Laura."
OK.
"So just picking-up off that theme, a few more questions for you."
"Anybody want to have a guess at what the recommended amount of water per person is recommended for basic sanitation and health needs, per person?"
"Charles, you should know this one. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WARREN:"
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:

"Someone should summon the spirit animals... or call the police,"
I guess that would work better in this situation.
"-Oh guys,"
I was just checking my iBoo app and whatever's causing this it's coming from upstairs.

"-Okay, guys, what should we do?"
Should we go upstairs or call the cops?

Hey interwebs.
"It's Thursday September 17, 2009 and a viewer informs me as of September 15th,"
I have been on YouTube for 3 years.
3 Mo-Fricken' years.
And a lot's changed since 3 years ago.
I'm no longer that person.
"A lot of people will say, ""Man, yeah time flies."""
No... 3 years ago feels like an entire lifetime away.
I was a completely different person then.
I would personally say a worse person.
A person I wouldn't be friends with right now.
"And back then I was just some douchebag witha camera, and now..."
Well I just get paid to be a douchebag with a camera.
And the conversation over the years has given me a lot of insight.
Even you stupid fuckers with your stupid comments.
"Like ""first""..."
Which shows me that even if  you're the first to the show it doesn't necessarily mean you're the winner.
Sometimes it just means you're an asshole.
But change is all around us.
"I mean, given time, a lot of things can change."
Peoples' perception of those things change with it.
"I mean, look at Lindsay Lohan."
She was adorable.
Then she was hot.
Then she was crazy.
Then she was kinda crazy hot.
Now she just looks like a coked out whore.
So still kinda hot.
Lindsay Lohan is kind of my dirty secret.
"If I was single, I would possibly  have sex with Lindsay Lohan."
"Right now some of you are judging me, but I would have sex with Lindsay Lohan for the same reason that I love skydiving."
But Edie is not prepared for how difficult teaching Nathan will be.
"OK, where were you?"
The most basic school work is a chore for Nathan and a challenge for his mother.
Nine times six is 54?
Do I put it under here?
Do you remember what to do next?
You put it under here?
"OK, what do you put?"
5-4.
Nope.
5-4.
5-4.
I don't know that.
"OK, I'm trying to remind you."
"By early summer, Nathan's frustration has turned to anger."
"He is kicking doors, hitting his brother."
He loses control.
And that part is what's frightening.
His family is becoming increasingly fearful that Nathan's plummeting self esteem might cause him to hurt himself or others.
Sometimes I can't stop crying.
"And, like, I'm just in my bed with my head down."
I just get sad.
"A little while ago, like last year, I was like, I could just kill myself."
I tried to run away.
I just felt like no one really wanted me to be there.
"Nathan's mom, desperate to do something to improve her son's self image, begins to look outside Bear Creek for help."
An hour down the road are the offices of pediatrician Mel Levine whose specialty is finding out what's going on with kids
like Nathan.
Dr. Levine tests for strengths and weaknesses.
"You know, for kids, success is like a vitamin."
And it's a real vitamin deficiency to grow up success deprived.
Let's just compare it to the original.
100 plus 20 plus 160 is equal to-- what's 50 times 8?
That's 400 plus 30 plus 10F.
What is this?
"2, 50 times 8."
"Right, that's 400."
"OK, this is 120 plus a 160 is 280."
"280 is equal to 430-- this is a good example-- plus 10F, I just realized."
Subtract 430 from both sides.
So what's 430 minus 280?
It's 150.
So it's minus 150 is equal to 10F.
So F is equal to minus 15 Newtons in the counterclockwise direction.
"So F is minus 15 Newtons in the counterclockwise direction, or it means that it is 15 Newtons."
"We assumed that it was in the counterclockwise direction, but when we did the math, we got a minus number."
[SNEEZE]
Excuse me.
I apologize if I blew out your speakers with that sneeze.
"But anyway, we assume it was going in the counterclockwise direction, but when we did the math, we got a negative number, so that means it's actually operating in the clockwise direction at 15 Newtons at a distance of 10 from the moment arm."
"Hopefully, that one was less confusing than the last one."
"So let me do another problem, and these actually used to confuse me when I first learned about moments, but in some ways, they're the most useful ones."
So let's say that I have some type of table.
I'll draw it in wood.
It's a wood table.
That's my table.
"And I have a leg here, I have a leg here."
Let's say that the center of mass of the top of the table is here.
It's at the center.
And let's say that it has a weight.
It has a weight going down.
What's a reasonable weight?
Let's say 20 Newtons.
It has a weight of 20 Newtons.
"I could compare the process of  goal-setting with a matrioshka: one goal in another, and so they go on; there are many of them, they accumulate."
"And paradoxically in contrast with  this Russian doll, there is not always reduction of size, they could be of the same size."
But they are inserted in one another  and overflow from each other.
The second very important thing:  museum process and museum activity are more important then the final result.
"We don't seek this result  but we go forward to it, always by making goal-setting."
"And finally, the most important resource for museum activity which is not always estimated and used  is cooperation."
"It is a valuable resource  which needs much openness and, believe me, really less money."
So my appeal to the community:
Let's become more complex!

-Soft taco.
-[Elmo voice]:
Soft taco.
With sour cream and a Pepsi.
"-I want a chalupa, with no lettuce or tomato."

No lettuce or tomato
And I need a number nine again with no sour cream.
"-Yeah, well, that's not a bad Elmo impression."
"Yeah, the video's funny, it's a decent prank I admit it."
"The video's now at over a 100,000 views and it's gaining fast."
"But you know, my question is, what the f--k is Elmo doing at Taco Bell?"
"I always just assumed that Elmo was on a strict diet of, you know, sunshine and unicorn meat."
"But no, he apparently eats the sh--ty Mexican food that even real Mexicans don't even eat."
"Now if you listen closely at the end of the video, you can actually hear the cashier laughing."
-Elmo needs lemonade.
-Lemonade?
"-Yes, ma'am."
-[laughs]
-Let's be honest.
The cashier finds it funny.
She's probably high too.
You know this is probably the best thing to happen to a Taco Bell worker since that f--king chihuahua died.
"Yeah, I do have one criticism though."
"You know, Elmo's a Muppet and it would've been ten times funnier if another Muppet had answered back like,"
"""Uh, this is Kermit the Frog here and you need to take your punk-ass back to Burger King."""
"Or, if Liza Minnelli worked there and was suddenly like,"
-Balls to you!
-But I didn't order any balls.
"Well, you're getting 'em."
But you know what probably did order balls?

"Rather, it is intended to highlight a social reality."

This is a lived reality that most men never personally experience nor are aware of.
SPEAKER 35:
"Additionally, women are often blamed for the violence committed against them."
"She should have worn a longer skirt, or she shouldn't have drunk that much are victim-blaming phrases."

So two years ago today
"February 11, 2006 my partner, Juan Montealegre died in Miami"
"For those who were listening to Yeast Radio at the time will recall the entire ordeal and the memorial service is on Yeast Radio in complete unedited form if you go to somewhere around February 15th or 14th, 2006 the funeral was on February 14th, 2006"
"I want to show you something, though which is the point of this video"
"This is Juan's death certificate now I've crossed out the parts that I don't want to show because they are, you know, irrelevant, relatives, Social Security, that kind of thing and I've highlighted things I want to show you"
"Now, keep in mind that first of all, if you've listened to Yeast Radio you'll know that I was"
Juan's sole caretaker when he was sick and I had to deal care of all matters of significance and I was his partner and we were planning to come here to Chicago on Feburary 1st 2006 and he died shortly after that
"Needless to say, he was unable to come up here"
I say that just as evidence of our partnership together.
Plus we had already had a business - started a business together - a hair salon
So here is what I want to show you.
And that is curve fitting.
I am Francesc Alted.
I work for
"Continuum Analytics. and during my tutorial, I would like to introduce you to to Numexpr and Cython, as libraries that can help you to accelerate operations with NumPy."
Can everyone hear me well?
All I wanna say Girl I wanna say

"August 4th, we were chilling at the house Said I'm done, I told you to get out"
Didn't mean a word that I said Cause I was hoping you would come back
Cause I tried and tried And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I'm hurt And I tried to fight and I cried to God
"Ooh, please let it just work And I'm going crazy with you"
"You got me so confused Cause you walked away, and I walked away"
And we should've stayed baby

"To tell the truth I've thinking bout you lately I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you"
"Christmas day, you said you had a ring But you changed your mind"
Too caught up in the streets Boy your truth is hard to believe
Why are you really scared of me
Cause I tried and tried And I cried and cried

And you never put in your work And I'm going crazy with you

"Frank, let's go, please."
"Everybody's looking at me to make the quintessential Italian dish, so, yeah, I'm feeling the pressure."
I'm feeling that I need to bring it.
What have you got for us?
"Clam, artichoke, and blood orange."
"Pancetta, basil, toasted fennel seeds, and guajillo pepper."
I knew you guys were gonna be looking at me
"'cause I'm Italian, so I wanted to do something different and hopefully impress you."
"Well, it worked. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Bravo."
Good job.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Thank you so much.
Look at the texture in that.
"That's what I loven risotto, you know, being able &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to stir&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and find all the little goodies&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- hiddenn there.
- Yes.
"Um, Frank, you ain't playing around, dude."
"That's pretty good. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Thanks, guys.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Frankie!"
[Applause]
"&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Frank, the light bulb's on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Right?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"- That's it, baby. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Here we go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"All right, David, please."
"I need to start making a name for myself in this kitchen, or else I'm gonna go by the wayside, and I can't have that happen."
"In the veal stock risotto, I put portobellos and some oyster mushrooms, gooseberry-roasted poblano, and some scallops. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Making risotto and&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; using veal stock at the same time is a very dangerous game."
You nailed it.
Thank you.
Really good job.
This is one of the best things that I've tasted in a long time.
- Oh.
"Oh, my gosh."
- It's delicious.
"The poblano, the cook on the rice is perfect. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The layering of flavors.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- Well done.
"- Oh, my God."
"They're gonna be talking about it, and I'm sure some of them are using it,"
'cause why else would it be on there?
"Now, Daily Microfoliant by Dermalogica."
"I've used this since it's come out, so for years and years and years and so has my husband."
"It is, like, our top favorite product."
It is good for men and women.
It is a daily product you can use.
"Hence the name, Daily Microfoliant."
"And, who uses it?"
"Dun dun dun dun, Oprah."
"That's right, Oprah, another queen here."
She uses it and you can see it's a little white rice powder and you mix it with water and--every day.
It's a very very very gentle gentle gentle daily exfoliant.
"So that's the Dermalogica, and, in makeup, what I have--"
I have Glo and I have the La Bella Donna.
"Now, the Glo Pressed Base is Hoda's favorite from The Today Show."
She loves herself Pressed Base.
This is the Honey Dark I have in my hand.
"Glo is great because there's Pressed Base, there's Loose, they have Satin, they have"
"Barely Beige, like a sheer type coverage, so a lot of options in Glo for you."
"La Bella Donna, one of my favorites, of course-- pretty much all these are my favorites-- is Bella Foundation."
"I use it on a daily basis, and they also have compact and loose, and Alicia Silverstone loves La Bella Donna."
"She loves the Brow Kit, which I will tell you about the Brow kit over and over and over because you get four colors in one compact, and this is the one for brunettes, so we pick your--you know your hair color."
Just pick the Brow Kit that matches and you're set.
Your colors are already picked out for you; it's like a no-brainer here.
"So, La Bella Donna, ooh, pretty four colors, I love it."
Love it.
"Now, last but not least, so you're using all of these products and you're like, yeah,"
I use these products.
"I do my skin care regime, I have the Fabulous Make Kit, makeup,"
I use it all.
I'm good.
It spent most of its time in Algiers. ...and recently turned up and it went to Switzerland.
Now we have it.
It's a major discovery.
It's a unique piece.
"There is no other cast of it in bronze."""
The buste comes with its original wooden case which is covered with masonic symbols.
"It's on sale for 680,000 euro."
"Other gems at this year's Tefaf are paintings by El Greco, Auguste Renoir and Frans Hals."
This Rembrandt is the most expensive piece on exhibit.
The asking price is 35 million euro.
New York-based art dealer Richard Feigen says the global art market... ...remains buoyant as a result of continuing financial uncertainty.
"""There is a lot of liquidity, a lot of money out looking for art... ...and less and less art to buy with it."
"I think that reflects that art has effectively been monetized... ...and now seems to be regarded as an asset class, a place of refuge."
"People don't like the dollar, they don't like the euro, they don't like sterling."""
Security at the Tefaf art fair has been stepped up considerably this year.
"Last year, on the final day of the art fair, one visitor walked away with two pieces of jewelry... ...worth 860.000 euro."
Without paying.

Hello everyone and welcome to another edition of Inside Leathernecks
I'm your host Nick Spinozzi today we are with
WlU Men's Golf Head Coach Mel Blasi.
Mel thanks for joing us today.
[Mel Blasi]
Thanks for having me.
Coach why don't you start by telling me a little bit about yourself.
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well I'm a..a..46 years old
I guess maybe you don't want to know that but I have a family a young family here in town a wife and 3 children.
I've been coaching here at the university for 13 years and I'm also a graduate of Western illinois 1987.
[Nick Spinozzi]
This is your 13th year coaching 12th or 13th?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Maybe there's even more magic here than we know about.
"Now, I have continued to discover  that there's little things in, anandamide, for example,  the bliss chemical is present in chocolate."
"The love chemicals,  phenethylamines that are damaged by heat, but entirely present  in raw chocolate."
There's at least seven of them  in raw chocolate.
"And those are the feelings of love, happiness and fulfillment that chocolate gives us."
It's from a chemistry that's in the plant.
This is the book.
"And if you recall the book,"
"I do want to mention that when I got to chapter 16, there was a most amazing citing that occured for me  when I was in Amsterdam many years ago."
(Laughter)
[You] can guess what happens there.
"""Oompa-Loompas!""  everyone said it at once."
"""Oompa-Loompas!"
"Imported direct from Loompaland,"" said Mr Wonka proudly."
"""There's no such place,"" said Mrs Salt."
"""Excuse me, dear lady, but..""  ""Mr Wonka,"" cried Mrs Salt,"
"""I am a teacher of geography."""
"""Then you'll know all about it,"" said Mr Wonka."
"""And oh, what a terrible country it is!"
Nothing but thick jungles infested by the most dangerous beasts in the entire world -- hornswogglersand snozzwangers  and those terrible wicked whangdoodles.
A whangdoodle would eat  ten Oompa-Loompas for breakfast and come galloping back for a second helping.
"When I went out there, I found the little  Oompa-Loompas living in tree houses."
They had to live in tree houses  to escape from the whangdoodles and the hornswogglers  and the snozzwangers.
They were practically starving to death.
"And they were living on green caterpillars,  and the caterpillars tasted revolting, and the Oompa-Loompas spent every moment  of their days climbing through the treetops"
looking for anything to mix with the caterpillars to make them taste better.
The one food that they longed for  more than any other was the cacao bean.
(Laughter)
But they couldn't get it.
An Oompa-Loompa was lucky  if he found 3 or 4 cacao beans a year.
"But oh, how they craved them."
Listen to this:
I was just upstairs talking with Win Phippen and he told me I could find you down here.
I am over here talking to him about his new USDA grant so I thought I would just ask you a couple of questions if you have a couple of minutes.
William Bailey:
Certainly do.
And welcome to our Ag Mech Lab.
Beth Seaton:
"Yeah, I've never been in here before."
It smells like an Ag Mech Lab.
Tell me a little bit about what a grant like Win Phippen's means for your department.
"It's a wonderful opportunity for Win, for the"
"School of Agriculture, and for our students."
It means a lot because it puts us on the cutting-edge on a lot of the research that is going on in plant breeding.
"And, more importantly, it gives students an opportunity to work with Win, who will teach them plant- breeding techniques, and they will apply what they learn in class under his supervision."
Beth Seaton:
"He seems really exicted about his program, and when I'm talking to him about it"
[Text on screen:
"Beth Seaton, Director, WlU Office of Sponsored Projects] you can just see the enthusiasm come out."
I've talked with a lot of other ag faculty from your department in my role as the director of sponsored projects.
"You have a lot of faculty member who are involved in not only in teaching in the classroom, but also heavily involved in research projects."
William Bailey:
We certainly do.
And it is that blend of
[Text on screen:
"Dr. William Baily, Director, WlU School of Agriculture] research and teaching, which, I think, is real hallmark of the School of Agriculture here at Western. because the faculty members are doing their scientific research, bringing it into the classroom themselves."
They are the teachers and they are the researchers.
"For example, here in the Ag Mech Lab, the students put on the Ag Mech Show, under the guidance of our ag mech instructor."
Beth Seaton:
And that is every February?
William Bailey:
Every February.
But it's student run.
It's the

I knew he was like that.
What is this?
His fan club must be in havoc.
The response today was really good.
All the messages were full of compliments.
Of course!
They complimented that the style was good.
As the model is good.
"But, when did you learn the drums?"
You were really good.
Did you see Won Kang Hwi's photo?
It's no joke!
That's right.
I felt he was gay.
Yes.
What is this?
What is this?
"But, did the two of them really do it?"
"All the things mentioned so far are the private affairs of our singer. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;U Entertainment has done our best to protect the privacy of Won Kang Hwi.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;However, judging that it could arouse social criticism,"

Dietrich stated on a note on her Facebook wall:
"""If reporting a rape only got me to the point that I'm not allowed to talk about it, then I regret it."
"I regret reporting it."""
"But, one good thing that has come out of this is that Savannah recently opened her Facebook page to the public, allowing hundreds of random friend requests from people offering financial support and petitions in her cause."
"And with her Facebook page and Twitter account,"
"Savannah Dietrich gets to control what people see of her, for once."
"It's ironic that technology, which helped humiliate her previously, is now allowing her to put her best foot forward."
"The judge behind the ruling is named Judge Deana ""Dee"" McDonald."
The defense attorneys for her rapists are
Chris Klein and David Mejia.
Oh!
"And her rapists, the boys who decided to violate this girl and spread that violation throughout her highschool, potentially ruining her youth, their names are Will Frey and uh I'll spell this for you if you want to write it down, that's Will, like Will, and then Frey."
F. R. E. Y.
"And the other rapist is Austin Zehnder, that's Z.E.H.N.D.E.R."
Please do not share this information or let anyone know that there are two rapists in Kentucky named Will Frey and Austin Zehnder.
Because Judge Deana McDonald doesn't want you to.
Nor do their lawyers David Mejia and Chris Klein.
"That's David Majia and Chris Klein, uh, Will Frey"
Austin Zehnder
Austin Zehnder and Will Frey
Perfect!
Now of course there are two sides to every story.
"For example, Will Frey and Austin Zehnder ""allegedly"" raped Savannah Dietrich."
Oh!
Wait.
Sorry.
No.
"They plead guilty, so yeah, they definitely raped her."
"The thing is it's important that we protect the identities of Will Frey and Austin Zehnder, because, like, this could look really bad for Will Frey and Austin Zehnder."
"Like, real bad."
Cuz they're rapists.
It's insane to me that a court system would allow a victim of sexual assault to be silenced.
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child

I reached - after Nubba &amp;amp; upper Egypt -
All over Egypt
Because in every Inch in Egypt they have Folklore
"They also have their own songs ,their own culture"
"Fortunatly,our all cultures are audible"
We have 1 million kinds of singing every person in Nubba sings in his own way
They sing in every dialect they have (el-Fonn) the oven
The first upper Egyptian poem
""" I found my Grandma before the oven"
She was looking after its flame
She caught a sight of me
"She asked:""what's the wrong with you, son?"""
Why I see concern killing you?
Why I see sadness inside your eyes full long times
And your voice...
Is missing!
"I said:"" O mommy my body is ailing"
And my heart is moaning loudly
If my scream comes out
Will makes farms forget its green color!
Then I crouched
I crouched beside her as usual
And told her everything inside my heart
I asked her many questions
The answer
The answer

But my conscious grandma understood my words
"Then she told me ""O son"

Cherbel:
"""No, definitely not, She said accept yourself from where ever you were from """
"Nijad I want to ask you, When Lady Gaga said accept yourself even if you were Lebanese"
How did you get this message ?
"Nijad: "" That Lady Gaga doesn't care about Lebanon, and she's too arrogant """
"Nijad: "" And for me, she's not even a Lady, She's a cheap copy from Lady Madonna """
"Monsters, Do you accept this ?"
"Little Monsters: "" definitely not ! """
"Who else understood this message ? "" That Lebanon has a lower level than her, that's I what I understood """
About all of the things she said about being Lebanese..
let's read some of Lady Gaga's song lyrics
For example :
Judas !
"Rachael: "" First of all, she didn'ttake Judas, as the person !"
"It was a symbol of betrayal """
"Rachael: "" She said that Judas is the demon I cling to, but Jesus is my virtue """
"Nadim How you view Gaga's songs, that a lot of people think it's Infringement on the Religions ?"
"Nadim: "" I accept it with open mind, and I'm from the same religion she's talking about """
"Nadim: "" I do my researches, and if there was something wrong, I won't change my thoughts for that """
"Nadim: "" I know how my religion is """
"Lady Gaga Insalted Christianity because of Judas, and Alejandro's Music Video When she's wearing a nun"
What do feel about that ?
"Nadim:"" Alejandro's music video, made a Confusion to all the people, and that was the point """
"Making a confusion, to be famous at the expense of religions ?"
"Nadim: "" She was already famous, she was on top, she didn't need that !"
"Rachael, how did You feel about Lady Gaga insulting religions ?"
"Rachael: "" She didn't !"
"Everything she does, she thinks about it, and studies it beofre """
"Rachael: "" She doesn't get the idea and let's just do it """
That's hazelnut and walnuts.

"Congratulations. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The cranberries,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the nuts, the gooseberries,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; already just unheard of in a risotto."
That is a disaster.

"I'm looking at my dish, the plating and everything was fantastic."
"My dish came out exactly how I wanted, and I feel very confident."
"What we have here is some morel mushrooms, some portobello mushrooms."
"Used some veal stock, a sauvignon blanc."
Did you wash the mushrooms?
I didn't wash them out completely.
"If they're not rinsed super well, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;especially the morels,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;it's like a dirt sponge,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and you taste that,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and it's just gritty.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It's just really bad.
Don't grab a morel. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Why do you tell me&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what to avoid?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I'm here to eat the dish or should I eat selectively?
As you wish.
[Utensils clatter]
A little too sandy for me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Big mistake.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Guys, some basic stuff &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;like feeding us sand&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and things like that,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; not good."
I screwed up.
But I hope that they're able to see through that and still see my culinary greatness.

"By adding all streets surrounding the square , the area becomes at most 130,000 square meters which will fit at most 516,000 persons i.e., about four protesters for each meter square based on the international standards"
Protesters against Morsi were gathered in additional square which is the perimiter of the presidential house (AL-ETEHADYA)
"Thousands were around the perimeter that was around 1.4 Km and width of 45 m which means total area about 63,000 meter square"
"And another protest at the north the presidential house with an area of 9000 meter square which means total protests area around the presidential house is 72,000 meter square that fits at most 288,000 protesters hence, the total number of protesters in the largest two squares is alittle more than 800,000 protesters i.e., less than a million protester over a total area of about 200,000 meter square"
which is 60% of the area of ALHARAM in Makkah (One of the largest gathering squares in the world)
"As the area of Alharam based on the Saudi government is 356,000 meter square fits about 1.25 million based on the official Saudi government release"
Investigators said some other cities had protests against President Morsi but the main protests were in Altahrir and Alethadya in Cairo
Cairo has one fifth of the total Egypt population
With another mathematical equation
less than a million from one fifth of Cairo population were out to protest against President Morsi
"And if the same density were there in the rest of the Egyptian cities we will reach to the same result, that about 4 millions at most participated in the 6-30 protests"

"Apatite is a group of phosphate minerals with high concentrations of OH−, F−, Cl− or ions, respectively, in the crystal."
Apatite is characteristic of biological systems. It is one of a few minerals produced and used by biological micro-environmental systems. It hardness defines 5 on the Mohs scale. Hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel and bone mineral.
"Much bone material is in a relatively rare form of apatite. In this form most of the OH groups are absent, and there are many carbonate and acid phosphate substitutions."

Battle of Guam (1944)
"The Second Battle of Guam (July 21 — August 10, 1944) was the capture of Guam by the United States from Japanese control. Guam was a U.S. territory (in the Mariana Islands). The battle was during the Pacific campaign of World War II."
Background.
Guam is the largest island of the Marianas. It is 30 miles (48 km) long and 9 miles (14 km) wide. It had been a United States island since its capture from Spain in 1898.
"It was captured by the Japanese on December 10, 1941. This was after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. It was not as fortified as the other Mariana Islands, such as Saipan."
The Allied plan for the invasion of the Marianas was for heavy bombing by planes and then bombing by battleships.
"Guam was chosen as a target because it was big enough to be a base for the next attacks on the Philippines, Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands. The harbor at Apra could take the largest ships. The two airfields were big enough for B-29 Superfortress bombers."
"The invasion of Saipan was planned for June 15, 1944, with landings on Guam planned for June 18."
A large Japanese carrier attack and heavy fighting in Saipan led to the invasion of Guam being delayed for a month.
Battle.
"Guam is surrounded by reefs, cliffs, and heavy waves. This makes Guam hard to attack."
"On July 21, the Americans landed on both sides on the western side of Guam. The 3rd Marine Division landed at 08:28. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed to the south. Japanese artillery sank 20 Landing Ships. The Americans had many dead and wounded."
By 09:00 men and tanks were on both beaches. The 77th Infantry Division had to walk through the shallow water. Japanese guns fired at them.
"By nightfall the Americans controlled the beachs about 2,000 meters deep. Japanese attacks were made throughout the first few days."
"Lieutenant General Takeshi Takashina was killed on July 28, and Lieutenant General Hideyoshi Obata took over the command of the defenders."
Supply was very difficult for the Americans in the first days of the battle.
"The attacks against the American beaches, as well as the violent fighting, had tired out the Japanese. At the start of August they were running out of food and ammunition and had only a few tanks left."
Obata moved to the mountainous central and northern part of the island. He could not get any more supplies or get new troops because of American control of the sea and air around Guam.

"In 1993, the French government privatized Banque Nationale de Paris."
"In early 1999, Paribas agreed to a 15-billion (USD $17-billion) buyout offer from Société Générale. Not wanting to be left behind, however, rival Banque Nationale de Paris made a hostile USD $21-billion counter-offer for Paribas, and an unimaginable, separate USD 19.6-billion offer for Societe Generale (SocGen). BNP’s three-way merger proposal would have created the world's largest bank."

Wi-Fi deauthentication attack
"A Wi-Fi deauthenticatoon attack is a kind of denial of service attack that can be used in certain wireless networks. In a Wi-Fi network, devices such as computers communicate with a wireless access point. To get an iP address, each devices needs to be authenticated, so the access point knows the device. In this context, there also is a frame (or a command) that tells a device that it is no longer authenticated. As the protocol does not require these frames to be encrypted, an attacker can simply send such a command to deconnect a device. The attacker only needs to know the MAC address of the victim. This address is sent unencrypted with each frame."

Therefore, both University College and King's pre-date the University of London, which initially served solely as an examining body for the constituent colleges."
"In 1858 the University expanded its role by offering the University of London International Programmes to candidates outside the colleges, the first of its kind in the country. A new headquarters at 6 Burlington Gardens, providing the university with exam halls and offices, was built to accommodate the new role."

He named Charles his heir on 10 December 1758 before leaving Madrid to stay at Villaviciosa de Odón where he died on 10 August 1759. Charles was thus proclaimed the King of Spain under the name of Charles III and adicated as King of Naples as he could not join the three kingdoms of Spain, Naples and Sicily."

"Mozart's opera La clemenza di Tito was commissioned by the Estates of Bohemia as part of the festivities that accompanied the coronation of Maria Luisa and her husband Leopold as king and queen of Bohemia in Prague on 6 September 1791. In musical circles, Maria Luisa is famous for her putative denigration of Mozart's opera as ""German rubbish"" (""una porcheria tedesca""), however no claim that she made this remark pre-dates the publication in 1871 of Alfred Meissner's ""Rococo-Bilder: nach Aufzeichnungen meines Grossvaters"", a collection of stories about cultural and political life in Prague in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries."

It was caused by an increased budget for the players and a security requirement In November 2015 they were fined €40,000 and had 6 points deducted. This was due to their failure to adhere to the league's stadium requirements. The same year they were relegated."
Now Austria Salzburg is playing in the Regionalliga Salzburg (3rd level).
Tim Hunt
"I guess, he's a big help out in your garden."
Right.
He likes to dig around a little bit.
"His mother comes in and says, why did you let him play in the dirt,"
I guess he's enjoying himself.
That's right.
"It's healthy,"
why not.
Yeah.
"He was eating the dirt,"
I wouldn't worry about it.
No.
It won't hurt them.
"I was a big dirt eater, supposedly, when I was a child"
and I turned out okay
"so, don't worry about it."
Just let him enjoy himself
"So you think that you want to move away from the big city, uh?"
"Well, that's what I've always,"
I was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people.
Yeah.
So you're just the opposite from me.
"You want to go back to that, uh,"
"After we got married we moved, ended up moving to the Houston area."
Yeah.
Yeah.
So are you from Texas?
Yeah.
You are.
"So it's not, you know,"
that's true
"Houston, in itself, is a pretty tough place."
"those those are,"
"we'd, I've done one,"
I helped somebody do one of those before.
"Those are, those are, you know,"
you can buy them in kits
but we didn't do that way.
"But it's,"
No
I designed it from scratch and did it  did a pretty good job.
Yeah.
Those are nice.
"They're pretty forgiving, you know."
You can always tear stuff out and redo it.
"It's a,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"That's not near, like building a house or anything"
"but,"
"Yeah,"
those are nice.
"Especially when you get done, you've got something, you know."
"I don't know,"
I like them.
You just sit down on on the deck and do whatever. Have  a barbecue
Yeah.
"I  I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, uh, a backrest and all that stuff."
"or,"
"I,"
"Yeah,"
that sounds nice.
"All done by yourself, huh?"
I had  a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes
"and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on."
Yeah.
"It seems to be catching on, uh, slowly but surely, I guess"
Yeah.
"And, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat."
I sat and watched him.
You know the Barney?
"You know the little, I don't know if you know the little character Barney."
Uh-huh.
"They had one, uh, on that kind of, type of thing"
"and how children can, can do that"
and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water
and it's really caught on
and he's only four
and he's really caught on.
Uh-huh.
"Wow,"
that's cute.
"That's neat,"
yeah.
"When you,"
And keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing.
He's really caught on
so that's really neat
"Well, when you start early, I guess,"
Hi.
How are you doing?
"What,"
I couldn't hear you?
"I said, how are you doing?"
I'm doing fine.
"I'm, uh, just editing a spreadsheet right now."
"and she'd gotten all new underwear,"
"and I was like, Laura.  How did you get all this stuff?"
"imitates a woman's ""Well, I just got paid."""
"And, and I was like, oh."
"Had some money in her pocket, yeah."
It was there.
It was burning.
It had to be spent.
"You know, and I'm like"
and she said everything was on sale.
"Oh, oh, that's good,"
at least it was on sale
"That's good honey,"
I'm glad you bought it on sale
What else can you say?
That's right.
I do recommend the for savings bit.
"They, uh, they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt."
Yeah.
"I think,"
Yeah.
You don't notice it.
I think that's probably a really good idea.
"You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone."
Huh-uh.
"Yeah,"
"so, uh, until you really need it"
"and then you realize, you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"see I was,"
"when I had, when I was living alone and I had my own house and things, uh, I put one, I was paid twice a month,"
"Uh, probably four or five days."
Uh-huh.
"Well, that is great."
"Well, I hope the weather stays real good for them. And, and, uh, that you have a good visit and everything."
"Well, thank you"
Thanks.
And I hope your garden does good.
Yeah.
And the same to you.
"And, so. Okay."
"Well, it was really nice talking to you."
A pleasure.
"And, uh, good luck in your, this venture."
"It is, uh, like I said,"
it has been real interesting.
So I hope you enjoy it as much as I have been enjoying it
I am sure I will.
"In, in fact, if I had not been preparing for this, the out of town visitors, I probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days."
"Yeah,"
I forget to.
"The day goes by,"
and I forget to make a call usually.
"Well, I am glad you have broken the ice with me because now, I will, I will start doing it"
"Great,"
great.
Okay.
Okay.
"Well, thanks, Jean."
Uh. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
"Okay,"
"is, uh, that a sport you like to participate in?"
"They aren't testifying really in their own words,"
Right.
"Yeah,"
"I can remember, uh, friends of Daddy ..."
There we go.
Okay.
"Well, uh, what do you think about taxes,"
do you think we're paying too much?
Yes and no.
"Income tax, no."
"I, uh, I look at it this way, uh, you've got to pay for the privilege of living here."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, being a, uh, a rec vehicle owner,"
"well, in fact, I live in a motor home."
I'm a what they call a full timer
"and, uh, it burns gas like crazy."
I only get seven miles to the gallon.
I really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes
"and they call it, uh, uh,"
"what's the word they use,"
"anyway, a, a luxury tax."
Yeah.
"They add it on on to tires and gasoline, cigarettes, liquor."
It doesn't bother me any because I've quit drinking
and I quit smoking.
"So, that doesn't bother me"
but I don't think it's fair.
Yeah.
"It's too, um, um, it's attacking just certain people."
How true.
Even with the gasoline tax.
Yeah.
"and that, that's true, uh, uh, you know,"
"the, the water was murky,"
and I would hate to think about catching fish or anything there
Huh-uh.
"huh-uh,"
no
I wouldn't want to eat them.
"No,"
"So,"
"no,"
no.
Yeah.
You went to Galveston.
"Uh, I have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water"
Uh-huh.
"the, uh, what is it, the Flagship?"
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Is it still there?
It sure is.
I like that place.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It most certainly is, so, uh, so that, it, it was, it was certain things that were enjoyable about it,"
"but, uh, I don't, I think it's lost a lot of it's appeal since then, because of all the oil spills that they have had,"
"and, uh, it always smelled the entire time we were there."
"It was,"
"I didn't realize that had happened, for some reason."
Yeah.
"We went swimming one time, in the whole week that, we were there,"
"and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool, because the water was so awful,"
"and,"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and I guess you are.
Uh-huh.
That we dress in the jeans
"and then there's kind of the, the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"But there's not much,"
middle of the road.
It's nice that there's not a requirement for it.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Sometimes I think there should be.
Some of these women around here look like they came off of Harry Hines.
"Oh, yeah,"
right
"Yeah,"
I guess you see those once in a while.
"And you know the, they have the no shorts deal,"
"and some of these mini skirts, you know, are worse than shorts ever thought about being."
Sure.
"But, uh, You know, that's, I guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code."
Yeah.
"That's right,"
that's right.
"I guess they're, the, isn't there a dress code, something about spaghetti straps,"
I'm not even sure what they are.
Supposedly and backless things
"Oh, backless,"
all right.
and that was almost twenty years ago
Uh-huh.
"It isn't,"
"sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time, in, uh,"
"that would have been about, uh, twenty years too"
"uh, uh, just last year"
"and, uh, the case I heard was a criminal case"
"and it seemed it really, trivial."
It involved two bicycles.
We didn't do the sentencing.
The judge did.
Huh.
So
How interesting.
"we, we rendered a verdict"
and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing.
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh
And that was here in Wisconsin.
"So I, I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it,"
"I'm Nevin from Sunnyvale, California."
"Hi,"
"this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis, Minnesota."
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Good.
"Uh, I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it."
Yep.
"Uh, I'm ready whenever you are."
Okay
"So, uh, what are your, what are your thoughts on the subject there?"
"Well I definitely think, like decisions have to be unanimous."
Really.
Yeah.
What have you been to lately?
"Um, let's see."
"Well, uh, this is almost, sort of funny."
"I was just um,"
"friend and I went to see OUT FOR JUSTICE which is Steven Segal, because, uh, we're both big karate fans."
Yeah.
"Oh, yeah."
So we wanted to see what this is like.
"And, uh, impressed with actually."
Is that right?
"Yeah,"
"I wasn't, I mean, I've seen his other movies,"
and I just think he's pretty good.
Yeah.
"But, uh, this movie,"
I'm convinced now he can act.
Uh-huh.
How's his karate?
"Oh, his, his, his karate is pretty good."
I think in this one it wasn't so good.
"I generally, um,"
"movies like that scare me, though."
"I'd be just fine without them, because, you know, kids come running out wanting to beat each other up."
"Well, well they do,"
they get
Fighting.
"I remember when we used to go to see, well I remember when GRAND PRIX came out when I was a kid, and some other movies like that."
We wanted to jump in the cars and race.
Right.
And I suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it.
"and, and he really,"
"I don't know,"
"he, he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway."
But he but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this
"I'm like, oh, come on."
Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is.
Yeah.
"He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, uh, uh, with the kinds of problems that he had."
And to make it believable.
Yes.
"I mean I was, I was believing it,"
I don't know about any body else
"but I was, it was great."
"Well, I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them."
He did great.
"Well it's just, uh, been delightful talking with you."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
you take care up there
"and, uh, let's hear it for the summertime."
"Absolutely,"
"I'm ready for it,"
but they're predicting some more snow for our direction.
"No,"
oh no.
"Oh well, take care."
Take care now.
"Bye, bye."
"Bye, bye."
Where do you get most of your news?
"I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour,"
and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends.
"Uh, it seems to me, from what I've been able to find out."
"Yeah,"
good.
That's considered a pretty good program.
"It's nice and small, which means, you know, if you don't get the class this semester, then you've got to wait or three or four you know, anywhere from two to four semesters to get,  it again."
Huh
"But, uh, it's worth it once you get it."
"Well, yes,"
that's good.
"And probably a good, uh, student teacher ratio and things."
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah
Most the class are pretty small.
Good.
That works out real well.
"Well, I, I was wondering what, if you all were to get a pet, like if you were to move into an apartment"
"or a house somewhere, what would you get?"
"Uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy."
Uh-huh.
"I, I, I'm partial towards the larger dogs."
Uh-huh.
"Um, our last, we've, we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, had a hamster or two,"
"and they, they got,  to be a lot of fun."
A hamster.
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, it's amazing how much character,"
Okay.
Your family have reunions on a regular basis?
"Probably, once every five years."
"Yeah,"
do you?
"Yes,"
that is great.
"Yeah,"
it's fun.
"And then there's a new one that started out that I've caught a couple of times called GOOD AND EVIL, I think."
"Oh, I heard they just canceled that."
"Oh, really?"
I read in today's paper they just canceled that show.
It is a real different one.
"It's, uh, it's, it's different."
I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.
"But,"
"Have you seen the show, it's, it's new this year, called HOME FRONT?"
"No,"
I haven't watched that.
"Oh, it's, it's really good."
"It's, uh, I think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven"
Uh-huh.
and it's set in post World War Two times
and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through.
It's really interesting.
"Oh, yeah."
It's kind of like a a nighttime soap opera type thing.
Sounds neat.
"It is, it's a good, it's really well written."
Yeah.
"Is that on, what what station?"
"Uh, I don't even know, to tell you the truth"
"Oh, okay."
What other shows do you like?
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I don't, I don't think that,"
"well, when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending until the bill comes in."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then all of a sudden you look at the bill
"and you go, Oh my gosh,"
I spent this much.
"But now, the fact that you still have two cards,"
"are you, do you use them, more judiciously?"
"Yeah,"
we pretty much use them for emergency type things like transmission fell out on our car
Yeah.
and that paid for a new transmission
Uh-huh.
"um, and, and things like that."
"Um, and we try not to use them for incidental type things, like, you know, gas and stuff like that."
Purchases.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh
"Clothing, sales."
Yeah.
Sales I find are a pain.
Yeah.
"I've, I've gotten, I've gotten a lot more away from, from credit cards,"
and I pay by check a lot more now.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Well, it sounds good, you know."
"Like I said, it sounds like you're, you've really got it under control."
"I, I admire you for having, having that mind set for not, not even getting, you know, past the thirty days,"
"but, I mean, my mother and her sisters are always saying, uh, to my cousins and I, my female cousins,  you girls are so lucky because quote, unquote, you have all these choices, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"you went to school,"
"Right,"
uh-huh.
"you can do this,"
"you can do that,"
Uh-huh.
we couldn't do that then.
"And my cousins and I go, well why couldn't you"
"Yeah,"
"that's, that's why I say I feel, I feel really lucky right now, because I'm not married and because I don't have children."
"I'm out of school,"
"I'm twenty-three,"
"I can do anything I want to do, anything."
Uh-huh.
"And so, I mean even some days I'm looking for another job now,"
"but, and I get so depressed because, not because I can't find a job, but because I can't figure out what I want to do."
"And that's normal,"
"I mean,  I think that's the world today."
"And yeah,"
and I
"and I'm lucky though, because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee, I don't know what to do."
"I have so  you know,"
Right
that's
"not a lot of people,"
Yeah.
but it's depressing too.
"That's how, I mean,  What, I'm right now."
"What do you, what do you that you're,"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
All right.
Happy home repairing.
Okay.
You too
Bye-Bye.
Bye-Bye.
"Hi,"
what do you do with your credit cards?
Oh
"Well, my husband and I have gotten into some, some problems with credit cards."
We don't handle them very well
"We, we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more."
"Oh, jeez."
"They, they're, they're really bad for us."
"Um, matter of fact, we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa,"
and we pretty much keep those maxed out.
"Oh, I was going to say that, that sounds like, like pretty many."
"But I see what you meant,"
you had them for each of the individual stores.
"Yeah,"
"we had I had probably twenty credit cards for,"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"I had, I had an American Express, American Express Gold, an Optima, all the different department stores, um, two Visas, two MasterCards"
"Oh, gee."
"I mean, I had,"
"any time anybody would, you know, send me an application, you know, preapproved or whatever, I went, I took it,"
and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble.
"Oh, sure."
"Um, because, see, the more credit cards you have, the more people offer them to you."
"Uh-huh,"
"Yeah,"
"unfortunately it's starting to really, you know, look at people's habits and  where they are at particular points of the day."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, the, the crime level there, of course, is quite a bit, quite a bit, uh, more pronounced, uh"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, yeah."
"I guess,"
"I mean,"
"I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis,"
"I'm not real sure. Uh,"
"Yeah,"
"it helps to know your neighbors, you know."
"They give you,"
"you're supposed to make lists of, uh, cars."
"Like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development. If I see a car that's unfamiliar, we, we have a list"
"is that what you, you did in your program? Where you have a list of license plates?"
Pretty much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I was, I was basically, involved in that, in the organization of it."
Uh-huh.
And then I left right in the middle of it.
"I'm not sure  where we went from there,"
"Oh, uh-huh."
"but,"
Yeah. Well.
"Yeah,"
"that, that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings, noticing people who look suspicious uh, activities like that, sure."
Uh-huh.
I know.
Sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one.
Uh-huh.
"We, we do that sometimes."
"I, I guess I'm, I'm not into real heavy stuff."
L A LAW is about the heaviest thing I watch.
"I, I'll, mostly I'm into it for relaxation,"
Yeah.
so I like things like GOLDEN GIRLS or CHEERS
"or, uh, Monday night is real good with me, you know, MAJOR DAD and, and, uh, NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, and, uh,"
"oh, what's that one with Burt Reynolds?"
"That type of show is what we what, uh, we watch."
Uh-huh.
"We generally just stay on one channel all, for all of Monday night, just to watch those."
"Just some of the times they're continued,"
but mostly they're just little vignettes.
A new one we found we really like is that DINOSAURS.
Have you seen that?
Huh-uh.
"That is, it's, it's really funny."
"They use like animated,"
"it's not like a cartoon,"
"but it's like dummies and things, that are used,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it's really, um,"
and robots probably.
"But there's always a, a moral to each story."
And what night is it on?
"Well, we watched it,"
"the times we've seen it, it's been like on or, excuse me, Friday night."
"Uh, but it's,"
we've only seen it a couple of times.
"I might start using the answering machine more, because it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings."
"Oh, it's great,"
I mean.
"Well, you know, in fact, I've been missing calls from the T I switchboard,"
"because I, I always have it on you know,"
Right.
"and I'll get that, that message that says, uh, to, uh, um, you know, uh, end this call, press three"
Sure.
"and I assumed I, you know, it was from the switchboard."
You know
"Yeah,"
you're probably right.
Yeah
"it is, because one day I listened, you know, and it was you know,"
"but, um, I, I just got totally disgusted,"
"and then, you know, people asking for, for money for everything, you know,"
"I mean.  Exactly,"
I understand.
"I mean, I,"
it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriffs associations
"and,"
"and, you know, the policeman's associations."
"I know,"
they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival or circus
"Oh, I used to do that."
"and,"
"Yeah,"
"I used to do that,"
"I'd send, or three kids to the movies or something"
Right.
There's always a
"and I, my, my pat answer now is, well, you just called me the other night,"
Uh-huh.
"Uh, but in Orlando, before I moved up, we had a real problem with it."
"Uh, we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks."
"Oh, no."
"And one of the things that I, I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation  down there."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, because they were just,"
"it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because  everybody went to work, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"and then the houses were left unguarded, uh,"
"but yeah,"
"I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it,"
"that's a good way to, to work it, with a neighborhood  watch."
Yeah.
"Well, you know, uh, also I've heard that, uh, the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home.  Like on the weekends."
"Oh, is that right?"
"A high percentage of, uh, free time,"
"I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is, uh, spent doing yard work outdoors."
Oh.
"So they wait while you're out, outdoors."
They know the house is unlocked
"and then they just slip in. Slip in, slip out, you know."
That's amazing.
They know exactly what they're going for.
Yeah.
"So, I've heard that's really on the rise as far as  uh, you know, a new type of crime."
"Uh,"
"Yeah,"
it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter.
Yeah
"Really, you know."
"Unfortunately, yes."
I'm jealous.
"and the other is actually a I B M P C compatible,"
"it's a three eighty-six,"
"I guess it's twenty-five,"
"yeah,"
three eight six twenty-five C maybe
"I don't know,"
no we don't have the
we decided not to get the which is actually another loaner one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing
"and,"
What kind of consulting do you do?
"Um, well, I actually do some work, working at M I T and at NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington,"
Uh-huh.
and then I worked for Dragon Systems for a while.
What kind of work do you do when you're consulting?
"Um, well, it depends,"
"it's very different in the different places,"
"but,"
Is it programming related?
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Program related, research related,"
"and I work in the speech field,"
"and I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech,"
Uh-huh.
"and I do that type of stuff typically for other people,"
"and we, like here we use the P C to do that."
Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that.
Word processing.
"Well, more, uh,"
"do you know Latek? Word text processing,"
No I'm not familiar with that.
uh-huh.
"And the more you use them, the more they send them to you."
"But each of these had an annual fee also, right."
Exactly.
"The American Express was probably the worst, um, because with the Gold card,"
I can't remember how much it was because I didn't even have it very long before I gave it up
Uh-huh.
"but I know the Green card was like thirty-five, five dollars a year."
"Yeah,"
forty five.
"Right, uh,"
"I,"
"Which was a lot,"
"because I mean, you had to pay it in full every month."
"Exactly, you know,"
"I, that's it,"
"I really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards,"
"so I sent back all of mine, except the ones that were free."
Uh-huh.
"And, um, then, then I also limited it to one of each, one MasterCard and one Visa,"
"and here, most of the stores will accept those,"
and actually I then got a Discover card since they pay you back.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I had a Discover,"
"and that was one of the ones in the group that I ended up, um, closing."
"Um, it really wasn't my choice, though."
"I mean, I ended up having, I ended up actually losing my credit cards."
Oh.

"Dave Smith Motors is a car dealership in Kellogg, Idaho, that attracts customers from all over the country. The dealership has a reputation for being the ""World’s Largest Ram Dealer""."
"Dave Smith Motors started in October 1965 in Wallace, Idaho. He purchased the small Chevrolet dealership from Mort Keane. At that time, the Chevrolets were sold mainly to miners, loggers, smelter workers and local businessmen in northern Idaho’s Silver Valley. Five years later, he moved the dealership to Kellogg, Idaho. Today Dave Smith Motors carries Chrysler, General Motors, and Nissan products, according to the Dave Smith website,(Dave Smith.com)."
"Idaho’s Silver Valley was founded in the 1800s silver boom and is one of the richest silver mining regions in the world. The community is located along Interstate 90 in northern Idaho’s Shoshone County. The valley thrived for decades as one of the nation’s greatest mining regions. Then, in 1981, the Bunker Hill mine in Kellogg closed. Over 2,000 jobs left with the mine sending the area into an economic downturn. The region also lost a lot of jobs in the timber industry. The population of the valley plummeted and car dealerships were losing the battle to stay in business. Dave Smith nearly lost the dealership."
As other dealerships were going out of business in the valley Dave Smith bought up nine other new car dealerships and sold all the brands under one roof. He also cut prices in an attempt to make up in volume what was lost in mark-ups. At any given time the dealership has more new vehicles on lots in town than the population of Kellogg.
Dave Smith Motors was one of the first car dealerships to take advantage of the Internet.
"In the late 1990s when many dealerships saw the Internet as a threat, Dave Smith embraced the Internet and used it as a tool to increase sales. Since the beginning of the list, Dave Smith Motors has ranked high on Ward’s Auto e-Dealer 100 list. Dave Smith Motors uses the Internet to reach beyond the geographic confines of their remote location in Kellogg, Idaho."
"The Internet changed the playing field for dealerships because Chrysler Corporation (now Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) allocates more cars to dealerships that sell more, a policy that rewards dealers who are able to boost their sales. Despite the concerns of competing dealerships Chrysler continued to ship even more vehicles to Dave Smith Motors, and assured other dealers that they could increase sales by improved customer service and referrals. The other dealerships were not pleased. In 1998 twenty-five Chrysler dealerships in five states threatened to boycott Chrysler Corporation if they did not reduce the number of cars they allocated to Dave Smith Motors. The Federal Trade Commission considered their boycott illegal and the group settled the charges before the boycott began."
"Dave Smith Motors is one of the largest employers in Shoshone County, and the largest private company in Kellogg."

It connects Queen Charlotte Sound with Johnstone Strait and Discovery Passage and via them to the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound. It forms part of the Inside Passage from Washington to Alaska. The term Queen Charlotte Strait is also used to refer to the general region and its many communities, notably of the Kwakwaka'wakw peoples. Despite its name, Queen Charlotte Strait does not lie between Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands) and the mainland; that body of water is named Hecate Strait."
"According to the BCGNIS, the northern boundary of Queen Charlotte Strait is defined as a line running Cape Sutil, at the north end of Vancouver Island, to Cape Caution on the mainland. The southern end of Queen Charlotte Strait is described as ""several narrow channels north and east of Malcolm Island""."

= = = He Zhen (artist) = = =
"He Zhen, also known as Zhou Cheng, Chang Qing, Xue Yu (1541 – 1606) was a Chinese artist during the Ming Dynasty, who specialised in carving personal seals. Along with his teacher Wen Peng, he was one of the first seal-engravers to use soapstone as a medium for his work."
"He Zhen was from Wuyuan County, but spent much of his time in Nanjing. He had a wide-ranging influence, and founded the Huizhou (Xingyuang) or Wan (Anhui) school of seal-carving."
"He's work aspired to an antique, ancient appearance, and he was known to chip or otherwise artificially weather his seals to create the impression of age. He created this effect by exploiting natural fracture lines in the stone, or by emphasising the knife-marks made whilst incising the inscription. His calligraphy attempted to echo that of the Han Dynasty, and he used the simplicity of that script to ameliorate the elaborate stylistic flourishes of the popular Yuan-style calligraphy that had previously been used for Ming-era seals."

= = = Smila = = =
Smila ( ) is a city located on Dnieper Upland near the Tyasmyn River. It is a district center of Cherkasy Oblast of Ukraine.
Settlements Ploske and Irdynivka are subordinated to Smila city council.
"Smila serves as the administrative center of Smila Raion (district), but is designated as a City of regional significance and does not belong to the raion."
"Climate in the city is moderate continental. Winters are soft with frequent thaws. Summers are warm, sometimes with little rain. Periods of temperatures higher than +10 endure up to 170 days. Annual precipitation level is 450–520 mm. Dnieper tributary Tyasmyn River flows through the city."
"Smila and its neighbourhood have been settled since the ancient times. Archeologists discovered a number of ruins of ancient settlements and numerous mounds located in different parts of Smila and near the city. Two biggest ancient settlements and 44 mounds were first researched during 1879–1883 years by O. O. Bobrynsky, grandson of Smila owner, Count Olexiy Olexiyovich Bobrynsky. These findings belong partly to the Stone Age and partly to the Bronze age."
Official foundation date of Smila is 1542. Grand Duchy of Lithuania documents tell us that settlement Yatzkove-Tyasmyno was founded on a hamlet place in 1542. The modern name of the city has been known since the first half of the 17th century.
"City’s name is connected with a local legend first recorded by Count L. O. Bobrynsky: ""An unknown girl led warriors through a heavy swamp showing a route to the enemy. The battle was very bloody. They killed a lot of enemies there but they couldn’t save the brave girl. They buried her near Tyasmyn and called her Smila. Then warriors honoured her in the city’s name."""
"After the Union of Lublin in July 1569, it was a settlement of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth."
During 1648 — 1667  this squadron town belonged to Chyhyryn Regiment. In 1654 Russian tsar gave Pereyaslav colonel Pavlo Teteria possession of the town. During 1658-1659 Danylo Vyhovsky changed Teterya as the owner.
"Chudniv treaty of 1660 renewed Polish power on this land. Smila became an ownership of Stanislav Koniecpolski as part of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Constant wars between Ukrainian Cossacks, Polish owners, Tatars, Turks, Russians and Swedes led to demolition of Smila. (More The Ruin)"
"Further owners of Smila, princes Lubomirski built a wooden castle with arbor and palisade around the whole city in 1742."
"During 1730s-1760s parts of the population of Smila took part in Haidamaka movement. In 1787 prince Xaveriy Lubomirski sold lands around Smila to Russian prince Potyomkin. Six years later Smila became a property of Potyomkin’s nephew, Count Alexander Samoylov. Two years later population of Smila was 1747 people with 50 crafters, 9 shoemakers, 6 weavers, 8 tailors. Others were peasants."
After second Partition of Poland Smela was a township which subordinated to Cherkassy county of Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire. In 1838 was built here.
City since 1926.
During the World War II it was occupied by Nazi German troops since August 1941 until January 1944.

= = = Mitzi Hoag = = =
"Margaret Myrtle ""Mitzi"" Hoag (September 25, 1932 – February 26, 2019) was an American actress. Over the course of her career, she appeared in more than 73 different TV shows and movies. Notable among these are recurring roles in ""We'll Get By"", ""Bonanza"", ""Here Come the Brides"", and ""The Partridge Family""."
"Hoag was raised in North Olmsted, Ohio, near Cleveland, where she was born. Her father, John C. Hoag, was a supervisor for the A&P store chain. She graduated from John Marshall High School in 1949. A straight-A student and head majorette of the marching band, she appeared in numerous high school stage productions, already using the nickname ""Mitzi"". After high school, Hoag attended Shimer College, then located in Mount Carroll, Illinois, completing her degree in two years under the radically flexible University of Chicago curriculum of Robert Maynard Hutchins. She chose Shimer for its small classes and the opportunity for horseback riding. Because Shimer was then closely affiliated with the University of Chicago, she is sometimes reported as having graduated from there."
"When Hoag graduated from Shimer at age 19 in 1952, she was one of the first five Shimer students to receive the bachelor's degree. She was the only woman in the graduating class. She earned a bachelor of arts in general education, and became a certified teacher, but her experiences with drama at Shimer turned her towards an acting career. After leaving Shimer, Hoag studied drama at the graduate level at Case Western Reserve University for two years."
"In the mid-1950s, Hoag moved to New York, where she continued her study of acting with Herbert Berghof. She was cast in multiple off-Broadway shows, but these were all cancelled due to funding problems. Finally, she starred in the title role of the 1958 off-Broadway hit ""Heloise"", an adaptation by James Forsyth of the story of Heloise and Abelard. The play, which won considerable critical acclaim, was produced primarily by erstwhile actors and staffers of Case Western's Eldred Theatre."
"Hoag subsequently went to Hollywood, on her mother's advice. There she married Stephen Wolfson, who had a bit part in ""Heloise"", and later became a teacher. They had a daughter together, but subsequently divorced."
"In Hollywood, Hoag at first worked as a stage actress. She parlayed a successful stage performance as Annie Sullivan in ""The Miracle Worker"" into screen roles, starting with a role in the movie ""Tammy and the Doctor"", and continuing with numerous TV appearances."
"In the late 1960s, Hoag had a recurring role in ""Here Come the Brides"" in the late 1960s. In addition, from 1966 to 1972, she appeared frequently in the TV show ""Bonanza"" as Alice Brenner. In 1976, she appeared in the drama ""Family"" as Clara Briault. During this period, she also appeared in several movies, including ""Play It as It Lays"", ""Pieces of Dreams"", and ""Devil's Angels""."
"She also played Natalie Green's adoptive mother on ""The Facts of Life"", a role she played through all 9 seasons."
"Hoag's first and only starring role in a TV series came in 1975, when she appeared as the mother Liz Platt in the CBS sitcom ""We'll Get By"", starring opposite Paul Sorvino. A family sitcom, the show was created by Alan Alda, and modeled after his own domestic life. The show ran to twelve episodes, filmed in front of a live studio audience. Originally scheduled for September 1974, the show did not air until March 1975, in a time slot facing ""Chico and the Man"", one of NBC's most popular programs. It was not renewed."

"Construction of the Air Station was undertaken in 1936 with funds provided by the Federal Public Works Administration. The M.H. Golden Co. was the contractor. The area had to be dredged from the bay and filled and brought up to grade level. Long piles were driven in the soil at the building sites for stabilization. The contract called for one hangar with lean-to, a mess hall, a barracks building, two aprons, a runway to the field, and a small wooden seaplane ramp. During and prior to this time a Coast Guard Air Detachment was maintained on Lindbergh Field in one-half of a commercial hangar. This detachment was led by Elmer F. Stone after May 21, 1935. Stone is one of Coast Guard Aviation's most colorful figures."
"In April 1937, the Air Station was commissioned. The first commanding officer was LT S.C. Linholm, who later became Commander of Eleventh Coast Guard District. There had, however, been an Air Patrol Detachment active in San Diego between 1934 and 1937. At the time this was the only Coast Guard air base in California."
"Coast Guard Air Station San Diego saw no radical changes as a result of the declaration of war in 1941. The unit continued to watch and report the activities of fishing boats in the area, to provide assistance in cases of distress, and to provide transportation by air for other government departments. Air Sea Rescue operations were given primary focus from October 1943 on. Between January 1 and December 1, 1944, a total of 124 aircraft went down in waters covered by this unit. Of the 201 pilots and crewmen involved, 137 were saved, 59 were killed outright by mid-air collisions or impact with the water, two are missing, and three who might have been saved were lost because of improper equipment or the failure to locate them promptly."
"In June 1972 a major rebuilding plan was proposed. On January 26, 1983, a ceremony was held signaling the completion of the project."
"In April 1997, the Port of San Diego began a master plan for San Diego International Airport. The goal of the plan is to provide incremental, cost-effective improvements to SDIA to meet the region's near-term demand for air service while a long-term regional air transportation strategy is developed in collaboration with the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) and other transportation agencies."

He won four Grand Slam doubles titles in the 1930s. Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1973."
"His father, Bartholomew Mako (), graduated from the Budapest Academy of Fine Arts in 1914. He started to work as a draftsman for his mentor Viktor Madarász. He was an avid soccer player himself. He fought in World War I. After the war, he left Hungary with his wife, Georgina Elizabeth Farkas Mako () and only son, traveling first to Italy, then stopping for three years in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before settling in Los Angeles, California. There he created works for public places like churches, libraries and post offices. Gene attended to the Glendale High School and the University of Southern California although he was offered a Hungarian University Scholarship in the meantime. He quit before graduation."
"In 1934 he won the NCAA championships in singles and the doubles (with Phillip Caslin) while playing for the University of Southern California where he lettered at USC for three years (1934-36-37). He also won the boys' singles event at the U.S. National Championships in 1932 and 1934 and the boys' doubles in 1932, 1933 and 1934."
"Mako was especially successful as a doubles player with his partner and friend Don Budge. They competed in seven Grand Slam finals, four of which they won."
"In 1936 Gene Mako and Alice Marble won the finals at the US Mixed Doubles Championships against Sarah Palfrey and Don Budge (6:3 and 6:2). They won the Newport Casino Invitational Tournament three consecutive times, from 1936 to 1938."
"From 1935 to 1938 Mako was a member of the United States Davis Cup team and played in eight ties. The US team won the Davis Cup in 1937, defeating the United Kingdom in the final at Wimbledon, and again in 1938 in the final against Australia at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia. As a Davis Cup player he compiled a record of six wins and three losses."
"Mako was in the U.S. Top Ten in 1937 and 1938 (reaching as high as No. 3), and was ranked World No. 8 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph in 1938. That year he reached the U.S. final at Forest Hills versus his double partner, Don Budge, who was in pursuit of the first Grand Slam. Unseeded, Mako reached his only major singles final on victories over sixth-seed Frank Kovacs and the third and first foreign seeds, Franjo Punčec and John Bromwich."
"In 1939 he was suspended and banned from playing for breaching the amateur rules. He and Don Budge allegedly accepted a sum of 20A£ for an exhibition match in Australia, which was against amateurism. Afterwards he continued to play tennis at that time during the Second World War while serving in the Navy. He also played professional basketball while stationed in Norfolk, Virginia."
In 1973 Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. In 1999 he was elected to the University of Southern California (USC) Athletic Hall of Fame.
"He possessed strong serve and powerful smashes but due to several injuries in his career, he had to give up his power game. He preferred a volleying style, which he perfected with quickness, good angle selection and pacing paired with strategy."
"Apart from being a sportsman, Mako composed music in his early 20s. He's the author of two songs, namely ""Lovely as Spring"" and ""What Did You Dream Last Night?"". He also starred in the 1938 musical ""Happy Landing"" and the 1941 war comedy ""Caught in the Draft"", although he remained uncredited in both movies. Mako married actress Laura Mae Church in Manhattan in 1941. A month later, World War II broke out, and he joined the United States Navy. After this, he worked in a broadcasting studio. After his retirement, he designed tennis courts. His wife worked as an interior designer. He was involved in wrestling and was hired as a coach at the California Institute of Technology while also coaching the basketball team. He owned Gene Mako Galleries in Los Angeles, California. He also published a book about his father titled ""Bartholomew Mako: A Hungarian Master, 1890-1970"". In the final decade of his life, he taught art to up-and-coming artists.

= = = Printer's sample stamp = = =
"A printer's sample stamp is a label produced by a printer resembling a stamp, but with no postal or other validity. Often it will include the name of the printer and demonstrate their printing capabilities. The stamps are not intended for use and are therefore to be distinguished from test stamps, though both test stamps and printer's sample stamps are dummy stamps in the broadest sense of that term."
"The R.M. Phillips Collection at the British Postal Museum and Archive contains a number of sample stamps produced by De La Rue before 1900, bearing their name and demonstrating their printing abilities for the British Post Office."
"Waterlow & Sons produced many small sheetlets of sample stamps in the same design as genuine stamps produced for their customers, but with the colours changed and overprinted diagonally ""Waterlow & Sons Ltd. Specimen"". The stamps in these sheetlets were also punched with a small hole in the corner to prevent their postal or revenue use and the sheetlets were displayed at the 1910 Brussels Exhibition. Clive Akerman comments in ""The Presentation of Revenue Stamps: Taxes and Duties in South America"", that the stamps were produced from obsolete dies."
"The ""Prince Consort Essay"" was a printer's sample stamp created in 1851 as an example of the surface printed stamps that Henry Archer proposed to print and perforate under contract with the British government at a lower price than the current printing firm of Perkins Bacon. The Prince Consort stamps were provided by the artist Robert Edward Branston, from an engraving executed by Samuel William Reynolds."
"Although commonly known as an essay, the stamp was not really an essay as it was never intended that a postage stamp be produced based on the design, nor was it an un-adopted design. It is more accurately described as a printer's sample stamp."
"The concept has been used worldwide with modern sample stamps from printers in Switzerland and the Netherlands, amongst other countries, commonly seen in philatelic circles."

"Dr. Shrinker was a segment during the first season of the ABC network's ""The Krofft Supershow"" in 1976."
"Dr. Shrinker (Jay Robinson) is a mad scientist who creates a shrink ray that can miniaturise anything. Three young adults — Brad Fulton (Ted Eccles), B.J. Masterson (Susan Lawrence) and her brother Gordie Masterson (Jeff MacKay) — crash land their airplane on an island. As they make their way to the only house on the island, they meet Dr. Shrinker and his assistant, Hugo (Billy Barty). Dr. Shrinker, in an effort to prove that his shrinking ray works, shrinks the three people down to tall. The remainder of the series was different efforts by the 'Shrinkies' to return to normal size, while Dr. Shrinker and Hugo want to catch the trio so that they will have physical proof that the ray works for whatever world power wants to buy it. Dr. Shrinker also implied that he would give the unnamed buyer the Shrinkies as a free bonus. However, in one episode, Dr. Shrinker's plan was to sell the shrink ray to the highest bidder, and the second highest bidder would receive the Shrinkies."
"Each episode was basically the same. As Dr. Shrinker himself said in one episode...""I chase the Shrinkies. I catch the Shrinkies. The Shrinkies escape. It's a vicious cycle, and it's driving me mad!"""
"The concept was very likely inspired by the 1940 film ""Dr. Cyclops"" in which a scientist working in the South American jungle uses his radiation experiments to shrink a group of fellow scientists to prevent them from discovering his secret work."

"In the UK, a Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) (previously known as Pupil Re-integration Unit by some Local Education Authorities) is an alternative education provision which is specifically organised to provide education for children who aren't able to attend school and may not otherwise receive suitable education. This could be because they have a short- or long-term illness, have been excluded, or are a new starter waiting for a mainstream school place."
Each LEA has a duty under section 19 of the Education Act 1996 to provide suitable education for children of compulsory school age who cannot attend school. Placing pupils in PRUs is just one of the ways in which local authorities can ensure that they can comply with this duty. PRUs are a mixture of public units and privately managed companies.
"There are currently over 421 PRUs in England. Between 2002 and 2003, 17,523 pupils attended PRUs at some point. Although PRUs do not have to provide a full National Curriculum, they should offer a basic curriculum which includes English, mathematics, the sciences, PSHE and ICT."
"A PRU is treated the same as any other type of school, subject to the same inspections from Ofsted. Since September 2010, some PRUs are referred to as ""Short Stay Schools"", although the government still broadly refer to them as PRUs or Alternative Provision (APs)."

"Man Without a Name () is a 1932 German drama film directed by Gustav Ucicky and starring Werner Krauss, Helene Thimig and Mathias Wieman. It premiered on 1 July 1932. It was based on a novel by Honoré de Balzac. A separate French-language version "" Un homme sans nom"" was also produced."
"Alexander Pushkin used his great-grandfather Abram Gannibal as the model for Ibrahim, the lead character in his unfinished novel ""The Moor of Peter the Great"". After leaving school in 1817, Pushkin met Abram's last surviving son, Peter. He met Peter again in 1825, after writing in his diary about wanting to ""get from him some memoirs about my great-grandfather."" He seemed to use his own experiences, along with Gannibal's to create the plot for ""The Moor of Peter the Great"". A stage version of the work was written by Carlyle Brown and premiered at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival's 13th Southern Writers' Project in March 2001."
"Abram Gannibal is a protagonist of the Soviet comedy movie ""How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor"", although the film's plot has almost nothing to do with Gannibal's real biography. The film is partly based on Pushkin's ""Moor of Peter the Great""."
"There are several portraits thought to depict Gannibal, which include a painting of the Battle of Lesnaya by Pierre-Denis Martin the Younger. The young boy present in Martin’s painting is argued to be Gannibal, because of the young boy’s role as valet to Peter during military campaigns and Gannibal’s possible connection to the artist while in France. A portrait by Adriaan Schoonebeeck is also believed to portray Gannibal during his time with Peter the Great. In Schoonebeeck’s portrait of Peter the Great, the young servant boy directly behind Peter is thought to be Gannibal. Although there are a variety of portraits that claim to contain Gannibal, there is little evidence to suggest the claims are accurate."
"In the Lesnaya painting, the young boy is dressed in traditional slave attire, which Gannibal did not wear due to his status under Peter the Great."

He announced his retirement after being unable to get a contract renewal with South China in Hong Kong First Division League after the 2006–07 season. He was considered to be one of the best strikers in Hong Kong."
"Au made his debut in Hong Kong First Division League for Tin Tin on 20 December 1988, against Happy Valley. He was 17 years old at the time and the final result of the match 0–2."
"Au was the leading goal scorer of the Hong Kong team, but retired from international football after an exhibition match with Manchester United on 23 July 2005."
"On the pitch, Au was recognised easily by his hairstyle – he sports peroxide-blond streaks in his locks. He wore the number 7 jersey for South China and was the captain of the team."
"He is also remembered by his famous ""cross passing during 1-on-1"" in the final of 2002 Carlsberg Cup against Honduras. In the match, he received a pass from his teammate, and got a goal opportunity. However, he passed the ball back and did not shoot. Further jokes on this were developed after this incident."
"Being a veteran striker, Au is valued for his international experience and his strong aerial ability. The 6' tall striker remains one of the best headers in the League."
"In the 2005–06 season, his good performance throughout the season could not prevent South China from finishing 7th in the league, with 2 points below the relegation line. He scored 8 league goals that season (4th among all players, 1st among Hong Kong players). Two years after retiring, he chose to return and play for Eastern, one of his former clubs."
"In the summer of 2007, after being offered a new contract with a salary cut by South China, he decided to retire. He claimed that the entire squad received new contracts with increments, but he was the only one with a salary cut. He thought the club was being unfair to him, who contributed for many years, even when the team performed so poor for several seasons."
"After his retirement announcement, he was approached by Star Publishing and with the help of a professional writer, published his biography titled, ""Lun . Football Biography"" (倫．球傳)."

He also participated in the anti-austerity protests of 1977 which resulted in his arrest.

"Ustad Abdul Karim Khan (Devanagari: अब्दुल करीम ख़ान, Persian: <bdi> </bdi>) (11 November 1872 – 27 October 1937), was an Indian classical singer and, along with his cousin Abdul Wahid Khan, the founder of the Kirana gharana."
"Abdul Karim Khan was born on 11 November 1872 in Kairana town in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh into a family with music tradition which traced its roots to musician brothers Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula. His father, Kale Khan, was the grandson of Ghulam Ali. Abdul Karim Khan received training from his uncle Abdullah Khan and father Kale Khan. He also received guidance from another uncle, Nanhe Khan. Abdul Karim Khan was musically influenced by Ustad Rahmat Khan of Gwalior gharana. Apart from vocals and sarangi, he also learned Veena (Been), Sitar and Tabla."
"According to a story, he was initially a sarangi player, but decided to switch to vocals because of low status of sarangi players. In his early years, he used to sing with his brother Abdul Haq. They appeared before Murtaza Khan of the ""Maula Bakhsh Khandan"" to appear before the Maharaja (king) and were influenced by Murtaza's style. The king of Baroda State was impressed by this singing duo and made them the court musicians. This is where he met Tarabai Mane, who was the daughter of Sardar Maruti Rao Mane, a member of the royal family. When they decided to get married, they were ousted from Baroda. The couple settled down in Bombay. In 1922, Tarabai Mane left Abdul Karim Khan, which apparently had a major impact on his music – making it pensive and meditative. Karim Khan's first wife, Gafooran, was the sister of another Kirana master Abdul Wahid Khan, who was also his cousin."
"""One of the most melodious classical musicians we have had, Abdul Karim Khan's music always created a sublime atmosphere. The soothing quality of his specially cultivated voice, and his repose style of singing were such that the singer as well as his listeners forgot themselves in a sort of 'trance'."""
"Abdul Karim Khan was invited to the Mysore court where he met famous Carnatic music masters who also influenced his music. In particular the singing of his sargam was a direct influence of Carnatic practice. He became a frequent visitor to Mysore Palace which conferred on him the title ""Sangeet Ratna"". On the way to Mysore he used to stay with his brother in Dharwad where he taught his most famous disciple Sawai Gandharva. In 1900, for eight months he taught Kesarbai Kerkar, who would go on to be one of the 20th century's most renowned vocalists. In 1913, he founded the Arya Sangeet Vidyalaya in Poona to teach music students. He finally settled down in Miraj till his death in 1937 when returning from a concert tour of the South. Every year in August commemorative music concerts are held in Miraj in his honour."
The innovations he brought to his vocal style distinguishes Kirana style from others. The slow melodic development of the raga in Vilambit laya (slow tempo) was the most characteristic aspect of his music. He worked hard to maintain his voice to be sweet and melodious which shaped his music. The thumri style he developed is also quite different from the 'Poorab ang' or 'Punjabi ang'. His thumri progresses in a leisurely slow pace with ample abandonment. He was also the first Hindustani musician to seriously study the Carnatic system and probably the first to be invited to sing all over the South. He has even recorded a Thyagaraja Krithi. He was also influenced by Rehmat Khan of the Gwalior gharana and adopted the direct style of presentation.
"""Although frail-looking, Khan Saheb maintained excellent health through regular exercises, disciplined habits, and frugal living. His photographs show him as a tall, slim person dressed immaculately in a black 'achkan', a cane in hand, a typical moustache and a red gold-bordered turban, and most striking of all, his dreamy eyes."""

Frederick Charles Lincoln (5 May 1892 – 16 September 1960) was an American ornithologist.
"During World War II, the plant was fully occupied building 0-4-0 and 0-6-0 saddle tanks for industrial use, although they did manufacture four PC class 4-6-2s for the Iraqi State Railways in 1940 (one of which was lost at sea ""en route""). In 1943, ninety Austerity 0-6-0ST locomotives were built for the War Department."
"In 1944, the Vulcan Foundry, which had been formed by Robert Stephenson and Charles Tayleur in 1830, acquired a substantial stock holding, and they became part of the English Electric Company. The bulk of the output was for export or industrial use, including fifty South African Class 19D 4-8-2s, Indian YB, YL and WM classes, and ten M class 4-6-2s for the Tasmanian Government Railways. Domestic mainline locomotives included thirty five Class L1 2-6-4T for the Eastern Region of British Railways and 100 9400 class 0-6-0 pannier tanks for the Western Region."
"The last steam locomotives to be built were a conventional 0-6-0T in 1958 and a six-coupled fireless locomotive in 1959. The Forth Street works were closed in 1960 and the Darlington Works, continuing with diesel and electric locomotives became ""English Electric Company Darlington Works"" in 1962."
"The office block and one workshop of Stephenson's Forth Street Works in South St Newcastle upon Tyne have been restored by The Robert Stephenson Trust. The Trust lost its lease to these buildings in February 2009 following purchase of the whole Robert Stephenson & Co and Hawthorn Leslie locomotive works sites for redevelopment as the ""Stephenson Quarter"". The restored block and several other buildings are protected by Listed Building status but future public access is uncertain."
"Commencing in 2013 the site of both the Robert Stephenson and the Hawthorn works started to be redeveloped as the Stephenson Quarter. The landlord fronting this operation was initially Silverlink Developers. As part of their commitment to the area's heritage they have been hosting a once monthly opening of the South Street buildings housing a music, food and drink festival branded as the Boiler Shop Steamer."

"Alim-ud-Din (Urdu: علیم الدین‎; 15 December 1930 – 12 July 2012) was a Pakistani cricketer who played 25 Tests for Pakistan between 1954 and 1962. His name is sometimes rendered Alimuddin. A fast-scoring, right-handed opening batsman and occasional right-arm leg break bowler, he was the youngest player ever to appear in first-class cricket, aged 12 years and 73 days. In international cricket, he scored 1,091 runs at the average of 25.37, including two centuries and seven fifties. In 1954, he was a member of the Pakistani squad which toured England and recorded Pakistan's first Test match win. Former Pakistani captain Mushtaq Mohammad said about him that he was ""a thorough gentleman as well as a great cricketer for Pakistan""."
"During his career Alim-ud-Din played 140 first-class matches and scored 7,275 runs, with the average of 32.77, including 14 centuries and 38 fifties; he also took 40 wickets. Critics considered him to be an excellent fielder. He made his debut for Rajasthan aged only 12 years 73 days, becoming the youngest player to have played first-class cricket. In 1942–43, he played his maiden match in the Ranji Trophy, scoring 13 and 27 runs in his two innings. His highest score in first-class cricket was 142, against Worcestershire in 1954. Domestically, Alim-ud-Din represented Sindh, Rajasthan, Karachi, Bahawalpur and Gujarat, and became the first Pakistani batsman to face a ball bowled by an international bowler on Pakistani soil, in a match between the Sindh and West Indians in 1948. During Pakistan's 1954 tour of England, Alim-ud-Din scored more than 700 runs, including two centuries in the first two matches. He was most successful during 1961–62, scoring 1,020 runs in 12 matches at an average of 51.00. In the same season he captained Karachi, leading the team to victories in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and Ayub Zonal Trophy. His final season in first-class cricket was 1967–68."
"Alim-ud-Din played 25 Test matches for Pakistan during his career and scored 1,091 runs in international cricket at the average of 25.37. He made two centuries and seven fifties. Cricket critics believed that he possessed a sound technique. In Test matches, Alim-ud-Din established an effective opening partnership with Hanif Mohammad."
"Alim-ud-Din started his international career against England in June 1954, at the Lord's Cricket Ground, in a match in which he scored 19 runs. In the fourth Test of the same series Pakistan beat England by 24 runs, recording their first Test win over them to become the first team to defeat England during their maiden tour. Alim-ud-Din managed to score 10 runs in the match. In 1954–55, he played, against India, in Pakistan's first home Tests, finishing the series as the leading run scorer with 332; he made three fifties and in the fifth match scored 103 not out at the National Stadium, Karachi, his first international century. He was the first batsman ever to make an international century on the Ground."
"Alim-ud-Din also toured West Indies as a part of Pakistan cricket team in 1957–58. He was not successful in the series and his highest score remained 41 runs which he made in the fourth Test at the Bourda, Georgetown, Guyana. In 1962, under the captaincy of Javed Burki, Pakistan visited England where they played a five Test match series. In the fifth Test at Headingley, a low scoring match for Pakistan, Alim-ud-Din's scores of 50 and 60 made him the team's highest scorer of the match. In the fifth Test of the home series against England in 1962, he scored his career best 109 runs at the National Stadium. He played his last match against England in Trent Bridge, Nottingham in 1962."
Former West Indian all-rounder Collie Smith was his only wicket in international cricket.
"He is variously known as ""Alim-ud-Din"" and ""Alimuddin"", with ""Wisden"" using the former in earlier editions and the latter in his obituary."
"Alim-ud-Din was born in Ajmer, a city in British India, on 15 December 1930. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, he moved to Karachi along with his family. He lived in London and never married, instead providing for his family. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) had given him an opportunity to work at London Heathrow Airport. Two of his brothers, Salimuddin and Azimuddin, both also played first-class cricket. His nephew, James Uddin, the son of Salimuddin, is also a cricketer and currently plays semi-professional cricket in England."
"In later life, his pension was suspended after doubts over his actual birth date. The pension was restored after intervention from the Pakistani President."
"On 12 July 2012, Alim-ud-Din died in Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, London. He suffered from heart and lung diseases. He also had kidney failure and was on dialysis. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) released a press statement expressing sorrow and conveying condolences to Alim-ud-Din's family."

"Born and raised in Nagoa, Salcete, Goa (at the time part of Portuguese India), D'Souza's father emigrated to Karachi, Pakistan, at the time of independence in 1947, where D'Souza attended St Patrick's High School. His brothers, Vincent D'Souza and Joseph D'Souza, also played first-class cricket."
"D'Souza toured England in 1962, heading the batting averages (53) as he remained not out in five of his six innings.

"The Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company is a Class III short-line railroad, formed in 1977 to operate several branch lines of the former Penn Central Railroad in both Maryland and Delaware, United States. These branches were omitted from the system plan for Conrail in 1976 and would have been discontinued without state subsidies. As an alternative to the higher cost of subsidizing Conrail as operator of the branch lines, the Maryland and Delaware governments selected the Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company (MDDE) to serve as the designated operator."
"The railroad did not own any of the track it uses until 2000 when it acquired a line between Frankford, Delaware and Snow Hill, Maryland, from the Snow Hill Shippers Association. Today, the railroad operates on 120 miles of track and runs out of a restored station in Federalsburg, Maryland. The new engine house in Massey, MD, was opened in the fall of 2019."
"MDDE incorporated in the State of Maryland on June 20, 1977 as a closely held, small railroad company. At that time, the states of Maryland and Delaware were paying subsidies to Conrail for branch lines, still owned by Penn Central, serving rural communities."
"The Maryland Department of Transportation selected MDDE to operate three of the rural branch lines in August 1977. These included the current Northern and Seaford Lines, and the discontinued branch between Clayton, Delaware and Easton, Maryland. Maryland purchased the two branches served by the MDDE Northern and Seaford Lines."
Snow Hill Shippers Association purchased the branch currently known as the Snow Hill Line in 1982 and hired MDDE to serve as operator. MDDE became owner of the branch in 2000.
"MDDE was awarded a five-year contract by Delaware in 1994 to operate a branch between Ellendale, Delaware and Milton, Delaware, and another branch between Georgetown, Delaware and Lewes, Delaware. These branches were part of the former Queen Anne's Railroad, which began providing rail service between Queenstown, Maryland and Lewes, Delaware in 1894, and extended its track to Love Point, Maryland in 1902. MDDE did not seek renewal of the Delaware contract and operation of the two lines was returned to the previous contractor, Delaware Coast Line Railroad, in 1999."
The 5-year operating contract with the Maryland Department of Transportation for the North Line and Seaford Line became effective in 2008. Two 5-year renewal options allow the contract to be extended until 2023.
"After years of using part of the Snow Hill branch for tank car storage, active rail service was restored in June 2019 to the Tysons Foods facility."

Home games are held at Manuel Iguina Coliseum, which the team shares with the Capitanes de Arecibo men's volleyball team."
"The team has won seven BSN Championships (1959, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2016 and 2018) and has had a total 16 finals appearances, being a runner-up 9 times (1932, 1946, 1948, 1961, 1966, 1992, 2007, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017). Capitanes is the only team to participate in all editions of the FIBA Americas League, having entered the final four twice (finishing 2nd in 2010 and 3rd in 2013)."
"In 1946, coached by Wilfredo Franco, Tingo Díaz, Piro Méndez and for a pre-Olympic tournament, the Capitanes emerged. A group of young athletes, mostly from Arecibo, like: Manuel Gilberto (Petaca) Iguina, Quicón Iguina, Abdiel de la Rosa, Alberto Renta, Joaquín Balaguer, Armando Villamil, y Pipe Beníquez showed themselves to be a part of it and dominated the sport in Puerto Rico, finishing in second place."
"On August 19, 1959, the Capitanes won their first basketball championship against the Rio Piedras Cardinals at the Rodríguez Olmo Stadium in Arecibo. They were coached by Lou Rossinni, and the heroes of that series were Jaime Frontera, Francisco Pancho Padilla, Felipito Colón, Bill MacCadney, José (Fufi) Santori Coll, Moisés Navedo, José Rodríguez Gómez, Eddie Martínez, José Vázquez, José Aponte, Angel Morales, Jaime Miranda, Joe Phillip Padilla hijo, Ramón Siraguza, Enrique Miranda, and Sitín García.

"The Capitanes in 2002 wrote another page in the history of their city and the BSN when the so-called ""kids"" broke the predictions of the media and basketball analysts by taking a semi-final series to Game 7 with young talents Giovanni Jiménez, Rick Apodaca, Buster Figueroa, Pachy Cruz and David Cortes; and veterans Félix Javier Perez, Javier Rolón and Oscar Chiaramello."
"In 2005, general manager Regino Babilonia hired Carlos Mario Rivera as head coach and the Captains again won the BSN Championship (4-0) over the Bayamón Cowboys."
"In 2007, with David Rosario at the command of the Captain Ship, and the fiery players Rafael “Pachy” Cruz, Ángel “Buster” Figueroa, David Cortes, Carlos Payano and Marcus Fizer as reinforcement, the Capitanes returned to the BSN Finals. In a historic, sold-out Game 7 at the Jose Miguel Agrelot Coliseum, where 75% of the attendees were from Captain Correa City, the Arecibo Captains came back from a 20-point fourth-quarter deficit to force an overtime. In a hard-fought and emotional series of plays and calls, the Captains came up just short of another championship."
"During the 2008 season, the Capitanes advanced again to the finals against the Carolina Giants. The series went to seven games, with both teams winning three games at home. Arecibo won the seventh game, 99-94, for the third championship in the franchise's history. Ángel Figueroa was selected the Finals' Most Valuable Player."
"It was forty-six years since the Captains succeeded in that first championship. That was on August 19, 1959. They came short in 1966 when they lost in overtime against Ponce and in a seventh game finals held at the court of Manuel Carrasquillo Herpen Country Club. In 1992 the attorney Hiram Ruiz saw the Lions come from behind in the series to thwart another major celebration in Arecibo."
"In 2005, there were doubts. However, unlike the team of 1959, the 2005 edition played with many ups and downs during the regular season and also in the ""round robin"", for example beating the best in the league but losing to last-placed teams. The reason for not dominating as expected was the failure of the team's ""Refuerzo"" (reinforcement player), former rebounding leader and prolific scorer, center Nick Davis, who did not meet the team and fan's expectations, as well as his following replacements until the arrival of Richard Lugo."
"In the ""round robin"" the Captains won five and lost as many games. The team was torn between changing Dickey Simpkins or staying with the player that looked more like a fifth man with the added reinforcement that was hurt."
"With all that were chosen as a finalist in the analyzes that the Cowboys favored above all others for having excelled in the second stage of the tournament. Unlike the 1959 champion who went undefeated, these Captains had to earn their stripes."
The Captains got a breaks with the elimination of Ponce. The Lions were the best team that could match-up with the Captains and successfully handle the full-court press.
"The Captains then faced a remodeled Santurce, with former Nigerian NBA player Olumide Oyedeji. The series became complicated and unpredictable."

O'Shea followed Skinner and returned to his alma mater once again after Skinner accepted the Boston College job in 1997. He remained on the staff until 2001, when he landed his first head coaching gig at Ohio, just a year after the Eagles won both the Big East regular season and tournament titles, finishing with a 27–5 record and earning three-seed in the NCAA Tournament."
"In his first season in charge of the Bobcats, O'Shea guided the team to a 17–11 record, including wins overDePaul and North Carolina. A year later, O'Shea and Ohio posted a 14–16 record, with the season highlighted by a victory over Virginia."
"Following the 2002–03 season, forward Brandon Hunter became the first Bobcat selected in the NBA Draft since 1995 when the Boston Celtics selected him in the second round. A year later, after losing Hunter, sixth-man Sonny Johnson and three-point shooter Steve Esterkamp, the 2003–04 Bobcats slipped to a 10–20 record, but bounced back in 2004–05, posting a 21–11 record en route to the NCAA Tournament."
"The 2004–05 Bobcats captured significant non-conference victories against San Francisco, Butler and Detroit, then won 11 of their last 15 contests down the stretch. O'Shea won the MAC Tournament but their run ended in the first round of the NCAA Tournament against Florida, falling 67–62, overcoming a 20-point second-half deficit, but coming up just short."
"With expectations high in 2005–06, O'Shea and Ohio compiled 19 victories before falling to eventual league champion Kent State in the MAC Tournament semifinals. The Bobcats registered victories at Marist, Rhode Island and Toledo, against Akron and Samford at home, and took 18th-ranked Kentucky to the wire in Cincinnati, Ohio."
"From 2003 until O'Shea's departure in 2008, Ohio would have five-straight winning seasons with at least 19 wins each season. O'Shea was 120–95 in eight seasons in charge."
"O'Shea returned to his New England roots when he signed an eight-year contract to take over the head coaching duties at Bryant as the school transitioned to a full Division I member of the Northeast Conference. The Bulldogs broke through in the Bulldogs' first season of full Division I eligibility in 2012-13, winning 19 games and hosting a game in the College Basketball Invitational."
"Bryant went 16-15 the following season with an NEC semifinal appearance, but the Bulldogs failed to make the NEC Tournament in two of O'Shea's final three seasons at the helm, including an injury-plagued 2017-18 campaign in which Bryant's four leading scorers made a total of four starts together, all in the month of November."
"On February 12, 2018, O'Shea announced his retirement from Bryant, effectively at the end of the 2017–18 season."
"On 8 December 1944 Lewis Nichols wrote a generally favorable review of the show, although he observed: ""Markova and Dolin also have a couple of numbers, one to Stravinsky music, which probably is not the best they ever have done."""
"Stravinsky himself later observed: """"Scènes de Ballet"" is a period piece, a portrait of Broadway in the last years of the War. It is featherweight and sugared—my sweet tooth was not yet carious, then—but I will not deprecate it, not even the second Pantomime, and all of it is at least well made."""

"Pavol Horov Gymnasium () is an upper secondary school located in the city of Michalovce in Kosice Region, Slovakia. Established in 1922, it is the oldest Slovak Gymnasium east of the Mátra-Slanec Area and is one of two main providers of secondary school education in Michalovce, along with ""Gymnázium na ulici Ľudovíta Štúra""."
"Before the Czechoslovak declaration of independence on 28 October 1918, the area of surrounding the city of Michalovce was a part of the former Hungarian County of Kosice (). At that time, there was only three secondary schools in the entire county, all of which was purely Hungarian, located in the then cultural centers of Kosice, Presov and Uzhgorod."
"After becoming independent, patriotic sentiment ran high and Slovaks sensed immediately the need to establish a Slovak high school in the area, in order to provide higher education in Slovak language for the populace in eastern Slovakia. At first the choice stood between three sites in the Zemplin region, which were the cities of Humenne, Trebisov and Michalovce. Due to its ability to provide sufficient funds and staffing, Michalovce soon became the obvious choice for the construction of the new school."
"The new school was finished in 1922 and in the period 1922 - 1938 the school bore the name ""Czechoslovak state gymnasium."" At the stage, the education was conducted in a way that emphasized the idea of the single Czechoslovak nation, and the language taught was the ""českoslovenčina"", or Czechoslovak language.The School's administrators constantly struggled with finding teachers with sufficient qualifications, teaching post was often filled with engineers, and often the school was dependent on the assistance of local school teachers."
"In 1931, the school marked its first graduating class, of the 22 students, 18 managed to graduate. Seven years later the school was markedly affected by the First Vienna Award, which saw the departure of all Czech professors along with their families from Michalovce. These were highly skilled academics which undoubtedly contributed to the high reputation of the school."
"Following the Munich treaty in November 1938, the Name of the school was changed to ""Slovak real high school"" (). In connection with the events of Munich, the beginning of the 1938-39 school year the school was occupied by the army (mobilization). Teaching was suspended from 24 September 1938 to 10 October 1938. After the First Vienna Award the new students came from schools from the Hungarian territories, (mainly Uzhhorod)."
"After Slovak students started moving to nearby Sobrance and the number of classes was reduced from 19 to 16 by April 1939, teaching in at the school year was interrupted again. When Hungarian troops invaded Slovakia on March 23, 1939 and the subsequent Slovak–Hungarian War, Slovak troops occupied the school and returned Slovak language to the curriculum. This education highlighted growing Slovak national consciousness and nationalism. At this time the Head teacher was also the government commissioner of Michalovce and later the leader of the Hlinka Youth (Slovak paramilitary scout movement, modeled after the Hitler Youth). In school year 1939/40 that organization counted 118 of the schools students. Two years later the count was 590 boys and girls. In 1944 it was 694 students out of a total 875. Influenced in part by the ideas of Slovak nationalist Andrej Hlinka, Catholicism became an important part of the school year, the year began with worship of Veni Sancte Spiritus, a school celebration, ending a solemn Te Deum. During the closing phase of World War II, the school became a military hospital for the Wehrmacht, and after November 1944, for the Red Army."
"The school education programme consists of 8 semesters (4 years), divided into two parts of two years each. Each part includes subjects such as General education, Foreign languages (usually Russian, French, German and English), Physical Education, Informatics and Science/technology."

"From Mandaluyong City, Buncio is the son of Gregorio ""Yoyong"" Buncio, a motorcycle racer, mechanic, and modifier. His mother is Mylene Buncio. He has four other siblings, namely Lourdes, Shara, Jacquelyn, and Barny."
"Buncio's father gave him the name ""Maico"" from a European motorcycle brand. At the age of three, he had started to learn riding motorcycles before bicycles. His training began early under the mentoring of his experienced father."
Buncio started his motocross competition career at the age of eight. He won first place in the 1996 FBO Motorcross Series 50cc category for ten years old and below held at the TRAKSNIJAK Race Track in Tagaytay City.
"At the age of 14, Buncio represented the Philippines in Perris, California at the FMF Memorial Day Motorcross Races, winning first place in the Mini Class 85cc for the 14 years old and below category."
"Buncio took up Bachelor of Science in Commerce, Major in Entrepreneurship at the University of Santo Tomas. Buncio was a consistent honor student since elementary and studied in OB Montessori until high school. He also finished his computer New Media Design Course from Phoenix One Knowledge Solutions in Makati on his latter years."
"Buncio was the sole representative of the Philippines in the 2004 Yamaha ASEAN Cup held at Shah Alam, Malaysia, where he raced against competitors from Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia. He won the fourth overall title for the country despite having to start from the back of the grid and having to race against five representing riders each from the other competing countries. This feat earned him the title Rookie of the Year from the organizers of said event."
Yamaha rider Buncio dominated the underbone racing 150 cc category for four years since 2006 before placing second to Suzuki rider Johnlery Enriquez in the 2010 event sponsored by Motorcycle Taipei Research Team and PAGCOR Sports.
"Buncio also broke records at the 3.2-kilometer Batangas Racing Circuit with a lap time of one minute, 49 seconds (400cc Superbike category) and two minutes, seven seconds (Underbone category)."
"2007 was the ""most memorable"" for Buncio when, at the age of 19, he broke the winning streak of ten-time Rider of the Year, Jolet Jao in the 2007 Shell Advance Superbikes Series. Buncio held the Superbike National Champion title for the next three years."
He also finished a race in the AMA Superbike 600cc class in Laguna Seca U.S.A. on September 2008.
"In 2009, Buncio was chosen as the endorser for Accel Sports Sporteum Philippines Inc."
Buncio was also awarded the Golden Wheel Awards Driver of the Year in 2010 and 2011.

While passing a semi-straight right hand sweeper on the speedway, Buncio's Suzuki GSX-R 600 motorbike slid and crashed into the run-off section. He was thrown off his bike and landed on an unfinished barrier in the race track. Buncio crashed onto a protruding steel rod of the barrier, which punctured his internal organs, fatally damaging his kidney and liver."
Buncio was thrown off some 100 meters from his bike and was impaled on a protruding reed bar in an unfinished barrier on the Clark Speedway Circuit. He was rushed to a nearby hospital in Mabalacat and transferred to the UST Hospital in the wee hours of 15 May and was pronounced dead at 3:57 PM on the same day due to massive internal bleeding. The father of the late superbike champion Maico Buncio raised questions over the first aid procedure done on the rider during his fatal crash at the Clark Speedway Circuit.
"He said that the Aeromed's medical response team pulled the victim's body from the steel bar. This, he said, might have caused his son's death. The bar punctured his body and damaged his kidney and liver. Instead of cutting the steel bar to free Maico, the AeroMed emergency staffers decided to pull the young motorcycle champion free from his entanglement. This, they learned later, caused massive internal damage to Maico's organs and prompted him to scream in pain."
"Dr. Reynante Mirano, chief of St. Luke’s Hospital Emergency Medicine, said that instead of pulling Buncio’s body from the protruding metal, the medics should have cut the steel bar."
"Maico Buncio left a memorable quote to his fellow riders ""Never stop riding, because I didn't."""
Buncio's wake was held in the Loyola Memorial Chapels in Makati City and he was laid to rest in the Loyola Memorial Park in Marikina City on 21 May 2011. A motorcade organized by his fellow riders marked his funeral procession.

"Maurizio Bianchi (born 4 December 1955 in Pomponesco in the Province of Mantua) is an Italian pioneer of industrial music, originating from Milan."
"Bianchi was inspired by the music of Tangerine Dream, Conrad Schnitzler and Throbbing Gristle. He wrote about music for Italian magazines before beginning to release his own cassettes under the name of Sacher-Pelz in August 1979. He released four cassettes as Sacher-Pelz before switching to his own name or simply ""MB"" in 1980."
"Bianchi corresponded with many of the key players in the industrial music and noise music scenes including Merzbow, GX Jupitter-Larsen, SPK, Nigel Ayers of Nocturnal Emissions and William Bennett of Whitehouse. After this exchange of letters and music, his first LPs were released in 1981."
"""Symphony For A Genocide"" was released on Nigel Ayers' Sterile Records label after Bianchi had sent Ayers the money to press it. Each track on the LP was named after a Nazi extermination camp. The cover featured photographs of the Auschwitz Orchestra, a group of concentration camp prisoners who were forced to play classical music as people were herded into the gas chambers. The back cover included the text ""The moral of this work: the past punishment is the inevitable blindness of the present""."
"On 31 August 2006, Kilbane signed a three-year deal with Wigan Athletic for an estimated fee of £2 million. On 15 April 2007, he scored his first goal for Wigan Athletic with a powerful header in the 3–3 draw against Tottenham Hotspur. This was his first goal at club level since October 2004. He then scored his second goal for Wigan with a looping header over Robert Green's head from Ryan Taylor's cross as Wigan went on to beat West Ham 1–0. Kilbane played most of his second season in the unfamiliar left back role, but still managed to win Wiganer.net's Player of The Season Award."
"With limited first team opportunities at Wigan due to the emergence of Maynor Figueroa and with his contract set to expire in the summer, Kilbane transferred to Hull City on 15 January 2009 for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of £500,000, signing a two-and-a-half-year deal with the Yorkshire club. He scored his first goal for the club against Burnley on 10 April 2010."
"On 1 January 2011, as the transfer window reopened, Kilbane joined Football League One side Huddersfield Town on loan until the end of the season, mainly as a replacement for the injured Damien Johnson. He made his debut the same day in the 2–2 draw against Carlisle United at Brunton Park. He scored his first goal for the club in the 4–2 win over Walsall at the Bescot Stadium on 15 January 2011. After signing for Huddersfield, he helped the team to a club record 26 league games unbeaten, before their eventual 3–0 defeat in the playoff final to Peterborough."
"On 2 August 2011, Kilbane joined Derby County on a six-month loan deal from Hull. Kilbane played 10 times for Derby, scoring one goal in a 3–0 win against Doncaster Rovers on 20 August 2011, however Kilbane's loan was cut short on 29 November 2011 due to a back injury."
"On 2 July 2012 Kilbane joined Coventry City on an initial one-year deal. On his debut against Dagenham & Redbridge in the League Cup on 14 August 2012., he scored a late winner from the penalty spot. On 16 August 2012, Kilbane was named captain for the 2012–13 Coventry City's season. He made his final professional appearance as a substitute in a 2–1 defeat at Brentford on 24 October 2012 before announcing his immediate retirement on 8 December 2012."
"While still a youth player at Preston, Kilbane was called up to the England u-18 squad but declined as he had always wished to represent Ireland. Kilbane qualified for the Republic of Ireland team as both his parents are Irish, and he made his international debut against Iceland on 6 September 1997. He was chosen as part of Mick McCarthy's squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea. The team did relatively well at the tournament, progressing to the knockout stage. They lost to Spain in a penalty shootout when Iker Casillas saved Kilbane and David Connolly's penalties."
"Kilbane scored his first international goal in nearly four years with a magnificent strike against the Czech Republic on 11 October 2006. He scored his 8th international goal on 7 September 2010 against Andorra, the first competitive goal for the Republic of Ireland at the new Aviva Stadium."
"Kilbane won his 100th cap against Montenegro on 14 November 2009. As of 4 June 2011, Kilbane played his 66th consecutive competitive international game (a run stretching back to 1999); only England's Billy Wright has achieved a longer unbroken run in competitive international football. Kilbane was only four games away from equalling Wright's record of 70 consecutive competitive international starts. However this incredible run ended after he was not selected for Ireland's crunch UEFA Euro 2012 qualification tie against Slovakia due to a back injury."
Kilbane obtained a degree in Professional Sports Writing and Broadcasting at Staffordshire University. Kilbane was enlisted by RTÉ Sport for their squad of pundits ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.

"He represented the Republic of Ireland from 1999 to 2006 at international level, earning 49 caps and scoring 5 goals. He was included in their squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup."
"Since ending his football career he has worked in the media, including with the BBC, Setanta Sports, Talksport, BT Sport and RTÉ."
Initially rejected by Arsenal for being 'too small' he went to West Ham United where he moved up the ranks of the academy but did not play for the first team. He joined Football Conference side Farnborough Town during the 1992–93 season and made twenty-one appearances.
"In order to gain first team football, he joined South Coast side Bournemouth in January 1995. He played a total of 104 games, scoring 18 goals whilst at Dean Court, and also became captain."
"In the summer of 1997, Holland joined Ipswich Town for a fee of £800,000. He again became team captain and"
"captained the club into the Premier League by winning the First Division play-offs in 2000. He captained the club to a fifth-place finish and qualification for the UEFA Cup in their first season in the Premier League in 2001. Though Ipswich were relegated in 2002 he stayed with the club after he turned down a £4 million move to Aston Villa. His spell at Ipswich is remembered for the consistency he showed, after playing 223 consecutive games and only missing one league match (due to international duty) in the six years he was at Portman Road."
"After Ipswich failed to win promotion in 2003, Holland moved back to the Premier League by joining Charlton Athletic on a four-year contract for an initial £750,000 fee, which later rose to £900,000. Again with this move he assumed the captain's armband and was ever-present in his first season for the club. One of the longest-serving Charlton players, he claimed more than half the entire vote for the 2007–08 Fans' Player of the Year. His final match came in a 2–2 draw with Cardiff on 21 April 2009, and the club released him after relegation to League One at the end of the season."
"In July 2009, Holland trained with Colchester United following his release from Charlton in order to keep himself fit."
"Although born in England, Holland qualified to play for the Republic of Ireland through his grandmother who hailed from County Monaghan. He made his international debut on 9 October 1999 in an away Euro 2000 qualifier against Macedonia, playing the last five minutes as a substitute for Mark Kennedy. His first goal came on his fifth cap, the equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Portugal on 7 October 2000 in qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Holland captained the side in three internationals, the first on his 28th cap, a 2–0 friendly defeat to Scotland."
"He went with the Republic of Ireland to the 2002 World Cup scoring the equaliser against Cameroon in their opening game. Ireland were eliminated from this tournament in a Second Round penalty shoot-out against Spain, with Holland among those who missed. Following Ireland's failure to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, he announced his retirement from international football on 5 February 2006 having made 49 appearances and scoring five goals.

"The Port of Salem is a shallow-draft port in the vicinity of the Salem River Cut-Off on the Salem River in Salem, New Jersey in the United States about east of the Delaware River and about from the Atlantic Ocean. It was re-designated a port of entry in 1984 and became a foreign trade zone (FTZ) in 1987. Transloading operations include the handling of a variety of bulk cargo, notably of construction aggregate, break bulk cargo, and containers for clothing, fishing apparel, agricultural produce, and other consumer goods, and has at times involved lighterage. It is operated under the auspices of the South Jersey Port Corporation."
"The Delaware River estuary was the territory of the Lenape. European settlement of the region around today's Salem began in 1638 when the colony of New Sweden was established and the Salem River was called Varkens Kill or Hogg Creek. Tradition holds that ethnic Finns settled inland from Finns Point in 1638. In 1641, a group from the New Haven Colony settled around Varkens Kill. In 1655, it was re-claimed by New Netherland and in 1664 it became part of the Province of New Jersey. In 1675, a land patent was given to John Fenwick, who founded the town. Originally, Salem's wharves were located along Fenwick Creek and Salem Creek, and received calls from Philadelphia, Boston and the Caribbean. During the American Revolutionary War, it was occupied by the British to prevent supplies from reaching American troops. Steamer service between Salem and Philadelphia began in 1825. The Salem Railroad opened in 1863."
"The Salem River Cut-off, which bypasses a large bend in the river at the port, was authorized in 1925. For much of the 20th century, the waterfront along the Salem River Cut-off and Fenwick Creek was dominated by industries centered around glass manufacturing, food processing, and mineral/oil storage. From 1905 to 1978, H. J. Heinz Company operated a large processing plant along Fenwick Creek. Mannington Mills, Anchor Glass, and AluChem are located proximate to the port, as well as the South Jersey Farmers Exchange in nearby Woodstown."
Salem was originally designated a port of entry in 1682 by royal commission of the British Crown.
"The City of Salem established a municipal port authority in 1982. In 1984, the port resumed international shipping operations and the United States Customs Service granted it status as a ""water port of entry"", the first such designation made since the 1930s. It is now a port of entry in United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) District 21, which is headquartered in Newark and covers New Jersey."
"Along with Millville Municipal Airport, portions of the port have been part of foreign trade zone #142 since 1987. Subzones associated with FTZ142 are located at the Port of Paulsboro and other locations in South Jersey."
"The Delaware and Salem rivers are tidal. The Delaware River Main Channel has been maintained at a depth of . Dredging to a depth of was completed in 2017. Reach C, which includes the entrance to the Salem Port, was completed in 2010. The shipping channel of the Salem River is much shallower, making the city a shallow draft port, which prohibits use by Handymax class ships. The Salem River and Cut-Off were first channelized in 1925 to a depth of . The river is entered though Salem Cove about from the Atlantic Ocean at the entrance of the Delaware Bay. The channel travels along the southeast side of the cove for and continues another to the Cut-Off and to the head of navigation at the first bridge crossing (Route 49)."
"The Delaware River is served by various range lights. Reedy Island is approximately southwest of the mouth of the Salem River. Reedy Island Front Light works in conjunction with the Reedy Island Range Rear Light for navigation of the Salem reach of the river. The Finns Point Range Light upstream of the Salem River was deactivated in 1950. From the Delaware River, entrance to the port is guided by the Salem River Range Lights, the Salem River Directional Light (), and 11 other lighted navigational aids."
"The city and county of Salem have a long history of glass manufacturing, along with the site of the first successful glass production facility in North America. Adjacent to the port is the oldest manufacturing facility for glass containers in the United States, established in 1863 and long known as Anchor Glass, once owned by Anchor Hocking and now part of the Ardagh Group."
"The rail line serving the port is called the Glass House Running Track and is an extension of the Salem Branch. On the verge of abandonment by Conrail, the southern section of the route from Swedesboro to Salem was purchased by the county in 1983 and is leased to Southern Railroad of New Jersey (SRNJ). Long neglected, it is in poor condition and travel speeds are very slow. The line is undergoing upgrades to the rail bed, trackage, a trestle at Oldman's Creek, and other work. At Swedesboro, SRNJ interchanges with Conrail Shared Assets Operations to reach Pavonia Yard, the regional rail center."
"Route 45 and Route 49 provide access to Interstate 295, the New Jersey Turnpike and the nearby Delaware Memorial Bridge. In 2005, the Route 49 bascule bridge built in 1927 over the Salem River was replaced with a fixed bridge that can be converted to a vertical lift bridge and has been dedicated the ""Veteran’s of Salem County Memorial Bridge""."
"The Salem Municipal Port Authority was established in 1982 with the intention to revitalize and coordinate shipping in the port district. In 2005, the Salem City Industrial District Brownfield Development Area was created to spur re-use of brownfields, including numerous properties within and adjacent to the port district, which is located along the southern banks of the river between the Salem River Cut-Off and the Route 49 bridge just outside the downtown area. It encompasses several terminal and wharf facilities for barges and container ships for bulk and break bulk cargo, and shipping containers."
"In 2006, the municipal port authority described the typical container ship making use of the port as carrying 150 containers and taking approximately 12 hours to unload and reload. The ""Bermuda Islander"", a Dutch-flagged container ship, calls regularly at Salem."

= = = Cotton Factory = = =
"Cotton Factory is an historic industrial complex formerly known as The Imperial Cotton Company Limited in the industrial north end of Hamilton, Canada. The complex has been renamed the Cotton Factory and is repurposed for small manufacturing and office space for creative professionals."
"The five buildings on the site were built in 1900 and stand today in their original structures. It is one of the few historic complexes built in the late 19th to early 20th century that remain today in Hamilton, Ontario."
"The growth of Hamilton's economic landscape during the late 19th and early 20th century is accredited to textile production, the city's second largest industry, second only to the steel mills. The men responsible for this city's economic expansion are the ""5 Johns"" of Hamilton (John Morison Gibson, John Moodie, John Sutherland, John Dickenson and John Patterson). The men opened the ""Catract Power Company"" in 1896 which brought cheap electricity to the city. They were Hamilton's major landowners in the region, both of which brought manufactures and entrepreneurs from all over North America."
"The general manager of the company was Charles T. Crantham, pioneer of the cotton duck industry in Canada and responsible for the creation of the Imperial Cotton Company Ltd. From Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Grantham was the bookkeeper for a cotton duck mill in 1883 to fix the company's books. Four years after his employment, he resigned to open a rival company in Hamilton, Ontario; bringing with him many workers and experts. Grantham had the help of John Patterson of the ""5 Johns"" to fund his cotton mill venture and build the cotton mill on the land that he owned. It was also decided that his brother Edmond Patterson would be the architect. By, 1900, the Imperial Cotton Company"" ""was born and looked after by James M. Young, the first President, who was the son of John Young, an original investor with the Dundas Cotton Company (1860–1891) and a now distant relative of Bob Young, the current owner of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats."
"The Imperial Cotton Company at 270 Sherman was the second largest cotton mill in the city and attracted customers from the around the world. Orders were taken from using the telegraphic system and codebook that can be found in Hamilton's Public Library to date. The Imperial Cotton codebook helped workers simplify orders and organize classes of cotton. The company manufactures heavy grades of cotton duck, used for making vessel sails, mechanical belting and hose, railway car roofing, binder canvasses, tarpaulins, tents, awnings, filters and cotton paper dryers. The products of the company are sold mainly to manufacturers, cutters-up, railways, implement and paper makers."
"The Cotton Factory has always been a ""people first"" kind of place. The Imperial Cotton Company produced a quarterly newsletter called, ""The Fabricator"", to bring news to the staff about group insurance plans, a cafeteria unit that seated 165 people, upgrades of new technology such as electric refrigerators and a newly purchased lunchroom piano by the Entertainment Committee. News among the staff members are also featured in the Fabricator, highlighting marriages, births, and deaths and recounted vacation stories by the mill employees."
"Fateh became a casualty of Bangladesh's complex and shifting political landscape towards the end of his career. As he was closely identified with Bangladesh's initial, Liberation War era administration Fateh was not favoured by the military-backed regimes which followed it. Contemporary historians have characterised his Ambassadorial assignment to Algeria as a premature transfer and a virtual exile in a diplomatic post which was a relative back-water. One commentator voicing the widely held belief that Fateh was ""a victim of conspiracy hatched against him by anti-liberation forces."
"Retiring in 1982, he lived with his wife Mahfuza Fateh in Dhaka for ten years before they settled in London to be near their sons."
Fateh died in London of natural causes at 0745 on 4 December 2010.
"A Sufi, he once cited a few of the axioms according to which he led his life: ""Do not speak anything that you do not yourself know to be true."" ""Speak in the spirit of offering, without the need to draw attention to yourself."" ""You should stand up when it matters."""
"Fateh was buried with Bangladesh State Honours at Hendon Cemetery, London on 7 December 2010"
"The Bangladesh Government was represented by His Excellency the Bangladesh High Commissioner Professor Mohammad Sayeedur Rahman Khan Khan who delivered a homily which spoke of the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's devastation at the news of Ambassador Fateh's death, conveyed the condolences of Foreign Minister Dipu Moni and spoke of the highest standard of public service that Mr. Fateh's conduct and career represented. In consideration of the esteem of the Bangladesh government and its people for Ambassador Fateh, the High Commissioner had personally brought the flag of Bangladesh to be draped over the coffin so that Mr. Fateh could briefly lie in state before his interring.

Kenton Road is a main road in the London Borough of Harrow and the London Borough of Brent. It lies in the areas of Harrow and Kenton.
"Its eastern end is the border of Kenton in Middlesex and Kingsbury (in NW9) in London. Kenton Road is the A4006, apart from a short stretch west of Northwick Park roundabout, which is a small part of the A404. The road east of the Kenton Methodist Church originally followed the route of what is now Woodgrange Avenue and was a continuation of Kenton Lane before being upgraded, re-positioned and renamed in the early 20th century as an eastward extension of the original Kenton Road."
"On the north side of the road, almost opposite Kenton station is the Traveller's Rest pub. Approximately further along the A4006, also on the north side of the road, at the junction with St Leonard's Avenue, is the parish church of St Mary-the-Virgin, Kenton, built in 1935-1936 by the architect Harold Gibbons and a local firm of builders, Melsom & Rosier. Approximately further on, on the south side of the Kenton Road is All Saints Catholic Church, built in 1963. About another further on is the Greek Orthodox Church of St Panteleimon. Originally a mission church of the Church of England parish, it was acquired in recent years by the Greek community, which has replaced it with a traditional Greek Basilica complete with bronze dome (2011)."
"As late as 1935 there was a busy blacksmith's forge in Kenton Lane, from the junction with Kenton Road (the junction at that time called 'Brockhurst Corner'). On Saturdays the children of the neighbourhood could be seen clustered round the always-open door, watching the sparks fly as the blacksmith hammered out the red-hot horse shoes on his anvil."
= = = Raeburn Van Buren = = =
"Raeburn Van Buren (January 12, 1891 – December 29, 1987) was an American magazine and comic strip illustrator best known for his work on the syndicated ""Abbie an' Slats"". He was familiarly known in the professional comics community as Ray Van Buren."
"Born in Pueblo, Colorado, Van Buren, a distant relative of US President Martin Van Buren, grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. At the ""Kansas City Star"", he learned cartooning from comic strip artist Harry Wood. In 1913, Van Buren moved to New York, where he illustrated for ""Puck"", ""Life"" and ""The Saturday Evening Post""."
"Van Buren served in the old Seventh Regiment (107th Infantry) of the 27th New York Empire Division in World War I. He was art editor of the division's magazine, ""Gas Attack"". An artistry and illustrative flair were evident in his cartoons, and ""The New York Times"" compared his artwork in the magazine with that of the famous British illustrator Bruce Bairnsfather."
"After military service, he drew cartoons for ""The Saturday Evening Post"", ""The New Yorker"" and ""Esquire"". As a freelance illustrator, he contributed to numerous magazines, including ""Collier's"", ""Redbook"" and ""McCall's"". He was a founder of the National Society of Magazine Illustrators."
"He began drawing ""Abbie an' Slats"" in 1937. The strip followed the experiences of a rural spinster raising her young cousin, a streetwise urban child. It was the idea of Al Capp, who intended to start a second strip to build upon the success of his popular ""Li'l Abner"". Instead of drawing it himself, Capp recruited Van Buren. Initially, Van Buren turned him down, but he was soon lured by the prospect of steady work, as he had just had his first and only child with his wife, Fern. The strip was carried in 400 newspapers but did not equal the popularity of ""Li'l Abner"". Capp abandoned the strip in 1945, turning the writing chores over to his brother, Elliot Caplin. Van Buren stayed on the strip, and it ended with his retirement in 1971."
"Van Buren lived in Great Neck, Long Island. When he died in 1987 at North Shore Community Hospital in Manhasset, Long Island, after suffering an injury in a fall, he was 96 years old."
"In 1984, When Van Buren sent a gift to ""Dear Abby"" columnist Abigail Van Buren (Pauline Phillips), she wrote back on November 30, 1984, thanking him and commenting on the name similarity:"
"With the Gold Key Award, he was honored in 1979 as a member of the National Cartoonists Society Hall of Fame. In 1958, he was named ""Cartoonist of the Year"" by the Quaker City Lodge of the B'nai B'rith in ceremonies at Philadelphia Pa. Previous winners were Al Capp, Milton Caniff, and George Wunder."
"Van Buren's wartime experiences are chronicled in the book ""Duty, Honor, Privilege: New York's Silk Stocking Regiment the Breaking of the Hindenburg Line"" by his grandnephew Stephen L. Harris. Beginning with ""Abbie an' Slats and Becky"" (Saalfield, 1940), his comic strip was collected in several books."

"The airfield has its beginnings as a military airport established in the borough of Rakowice in 1912, one of the most modern and largest in Poland at the time. It was built for the needs of the Austro-Hungarian Empire along with an army garrison. In 1917 the airfield became one of the stopovers in the first European air mail service linking Vienna with Kiev and Odessa.

"In 2003, Cabinet approved the promulgation of the Air Navigation (Amendment) Regulations 2003. Cabinet based its decision on a submission by the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation, Josefa Vosanibola, who said that new regulations were needed to cater for changes in the aviation industry. “The aviation industry has gone through rapid changes in the last few years to respond to the needs of the market,” Mr Vosanibola said. He said the services that were normally provided by a state authority had been divided up among various corporations to bring about efficiency in the industry. The Minister said this division of responsibilities among profit making corporations required government to enact appropriate legislation to ensure that the safety of civil aviation was not compromised by commercial considerations. “The amendments also cover operational, safety and health issues arising from the acquisition of larger aircraft by Air Pacific,” he said. These included the manning of emergency doors on twin deck aircraft, and the need to ensure that the crew on these aircraft had adequate rest. Mr Vosanibola said the amended Regulations also return to CAAFI (Civil Aviation Authority of the Fiji Islands) some regulatory powers that were inadvertently passed on to Airports Fiji Limited by the Civil Aviation Reform Act, 1999. A total of 49 Regulations were amended to comply with safety standards and recommended practices introduced by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). These included Certification of Service Providers; Regulatory Functions; Airworthiness of Aircraft; Licensing; and Flight Operations and Rules of the Air. A transition period of six months from the date of promulgation was provided to allow stakeholders to comply with the amended Regulations."

= = = Thomas Devin = = =
"Thomas Casimer Devin (December 10, 1822 – April 4, 1878) was a United States Army officer and general. He commanded Union cavalry during the American Civil War and during the Indian Wars."
"Born in New York City to Irish parents. Devin was a house painter and partner in a paint and varnish company with his brother John for much of his early life, while also serving as a lieutenant colonel in the New York State Militia."
"After the start of the Civil War, Devin formed his militia cavalry company into ""Captain Devin's Independent Company"" and served as its captain. Late that year, he became Colonel of the 6th New York Volunteer Cavalry, nicknamed the ""2nd Ira Harris Guards"", which he would lead for the next year."
"The regiment's first important service was in the Maryland Campaign of 1862. At the Battle of Antietam, one of its squadrons was involved in the first attacks of the day. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, Devin inherited command of David McMurtrie Gregg's cavalry brigade, when the latter took charge of the brigade of George Dashiell Bayard, who had been killed by Confederate artillery fire. At the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863, his small brigade was the only cavalry not detached for Brig. Gen. George Stoneman's raid and he successfully led three Union Corps on the stealthy flanking march that preceded the battle. The men of the brigade repeatedly distinguished themselves in the heavy fighting of the battle. They suffered almost 200 casualties in the battle, higher losses than Union cavalry units had seen prior to that time. Devin also led his brigade in the Battle of Brandy Station (June 9, 1863), and took command of Brig. Gen. John Buford's division while Buford commanded the entire right wing of the two-pronged attack on Confederate cavalry. While observing the skirmish line early in the fighting, Devin had his horse shot out from under him."
"At the Battle of Gettysburg, Devin's brigade served in Brig. Gen. John Buford's cavalry division that began the battle on July 1, 1863. Devin had become a favorite of Buford's and his rugged leadership style lent him the nickname ""Buford's Hard Hitter,"" while his own men like to refer to him as ""Uncle Tommy."" As the Confederate attacks began, Devin's brigade was screening the northwest and northern road approaches to Gettysburg, and successfully delayed the arrival of Jubal A. Early's division. Friendly fire from Union artillery on Cemetery Hill caused most of his brigade to withdraw into the town of Gettysburg and they later skirmished with the Confederates as they entered the town. The two brigades of Buford's cavalry division present on the field on July 1 and 2 were withdrawn from the battlefield by Cavalry Corps commander Alfred Pleasonton on the afternoon of July 2."
"After Gettysburg, Devin continued to command a brigade and sometimes a division in the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. In the spring of 1864, he participated in the raid on Richmond by Judson Kilpatrick's cavalry. In August he accompanied the Cavalry Corps to the Shenandoah Valley, where they fought under Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan during the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Devin was wounded once during the war, a wound in the foot on August 16, 1864, at the fighting at Guard Hill, Virginia or Crooked Run, Virginia. When Wesley Merritt became the Cavalry Corps commander, Devin inherited command of his division. On November 19, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Devin brigadier general of volunteers for his part in the Battle of Cedar Creek, to rank from October 19, 1864. The President submitted the nomination on December 12, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed it on February 14, 1865."
"Devin was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 15, 1866. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Devin for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866. President Johnson also appointed Devin brevet colonel in the regular army for Fisher's Hill, to rank from March 2, 1867. On March 26, 1867, President Johnson nominated Devin for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general in the regular army for Sayler's Creek, to rank from March 2, 1867, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on April 5, 1867."
"Devin obtained a commission in the Regular Army after the Civil War under the provisions of the Army Act of 1866. This Act required that the officer ranks of the new infantry and cavalry regiments be filled by a certain percentage of officers from the Volunteer regiments raised during the Civil War. Ending the war as a Brigadier General and Brevet Major General, Devin became a Lieutenant Colonel and was assigned to the 8th U.S. Cavalry. Initially serving with part of the regiment in New Mexico, Devin assumed command of the Subdistrict of Prescott in Arizona in late 1867. He died of stomach cancer and exposure, on sick leave from active duty, as Colonel of the 3rd U.S. Cavalry. Devin was initially interred in Calvary Cemetery on Long Island, but upon his wife's death in 1897, both were interred in West Point Cemetery, West Point, New York, very near his old friend and commander John Buford."
"On June 30, 1878, the United States Army established a temporary camp in southeastern Montana Territory during the building of the Fort Keogh-Deadwood Telegraph Line. The post was named ""Camp Devin."" It served as a base for part of the 9th U.S. Infantry until being abandoned later that year."
"Devin was portrayed by David Carpenter in the 1993 film ""Gettysburg"", based on Michael Shaara's novel, ""The Killer Angels""."

= = = Alberto J. Mora = = =
Alberto J. Mora (born 1951) is a former General Counsel of the Navy. He led an effort within the Defense Department to oppose the legal theories of John Yoo and to try to end the use of torture at Guantanamo Bay.
"Mora is featured in two documentaries: the 2008 Academy Award-winning ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" and ""Torturing Democracy""."
"Mora was born in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in Cuba. His father, a medical doctor and professor, is Cuban, and his mother's parents are from Hungary, which they fled in advance of active Hungarian-German cooperation in 1941. Mora's family fled Cuba after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 when Mora was eight years old. Mora's family relocated to Jackson, Mississippi, where Mora lived until leaving for college. He received a B.A., with honors, from Swarthmore College in 1974."
"From 1975 to 1978 he worked for the U.S. State Department as a foreign service officer at the U.S. embassy in Lisbon, Portugal. He left to enter law school at the University of Miami School of Law, where he received his J.D. in 1981. He worked in litigation at a number of firms, until returning to government work. From 1989 to 1993, he served in the administration of the President George H.W. Bush as general counsel to the United States Information Agency. He was later appointed three times by President Bill Clinton to the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees the Voice of America and other U.S. information services. He also worked as an Of Counsel attorney with the prominent law firm of Greenberg Traurig, at their Washington office, focusing on matters of international law."
"Mora speaks Spanish, French, and Portuguese. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations."
"In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Mora as the General Counsel of the Navy, the most senior civilian lawyer for the Navy, after a recommendation by former U.S. Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci, who is friends with Mora."
"Mora was in the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, when it was struck by the Boeing 757 of American Airlines Flight 77. Mora said that it ""felt jarring, like a large safe had been dropped overhead."""
"Mora retired from the Federal Government in January 2006. He became the chief counsel for Wal-Mart's international division and later served as general counsel and secretary of Mars, Inc."
"In December 2002, Mora received word from David Brant, director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), that NCIS agents at the naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba had learned that detainees being held there were being subjected to ""physical abuse and degrading treatment"" by members of the Joint Task Force 170 (JTF-170), and that authorization for this treatment had come from ""a 'high level' in Washington"". Mora reports that he was ""disturbed"" and felt he had to learn more."
Thiocyanic acid is a chemical compound with the formula HSCN which exists as a tautomer with isothiocyanic acid (HNCS). The iso- form tends to dominate with the material being about 95% isothiocyanic acid in the vapor phase.
"It is a weak acid, bordering on strong, with a p""K"" of 1.1 at 20 °C and extrapolated to zero ionic strength."
HSCN is predicted to have a triple bond between carbon and nitrogen. It has been observed spectroscopically but has not been isolated as a pure substance.
"The salts and esters of thiocyanic acid are known as thiocyanates. The salts are composed of the thiocyanate ion (SCN) and a suitable metal cation (e.g., potassium thiocyanate, KSCN). The esters of thiocyanic acid have the general structure R–SCN."
= = = Ypiranga Clube = = =
"Ypiranga Clube, or Ypiranga as they are usually called, is a Brazilian football team from Macapá in Amapá, founded on May 15, 1963."
"Home stadium is the Zerão stadium, capacity 5,000. They play in blue and black striped shirts, black shorts and black socks."
"The club was founded on May 15, 1963, by the initiative of the father Vitório Galliani, vicar of Igreja Nossa Senhora da Conceição, who lead young members of Juventude Oratoriana do Trem (JOT), a movement connected to Vitório Galliani's church. Under influence of Vitório Galliani, it was established that the club's official colors would be black and blue, the same colors of Italy's Internazionale, club supported by the father. Guaracy Freitas was elected as the club's first president."
"In 1963, the club joined Federação Amapaense de Desportos. In 1964, Ypiranga disputed its first competition, the Second Division of the Amapaense Amateur Football Championship, and managed by Francisco Sales de Lima (nicknamed ""Chicão""), the club won the competition, after defeating Independente 6–3 in the final, at Augusto Antunes Stadium. The champion team was composed of the following players: Manguinha, Lindoval, Barata, Guaracy and Suzico, Adauto and Ary, Peninha, Artur, Narciso and Almeida. The reservers: Elcio, Horácio, Otílio, Gadelha, Lery, Trombone, Tônati, Sabá Balieiro, and Joaquim Neto."
"In 1976, Ypiranga won its first state championship, after the club and Santana drew 0–0 at Estádio Municipal Glicério de Souza Marques. The champion players were Emanuel, Buiuna, Damasceno, Waldir and Pitéo, Duranil and Dival, Ananízio, Tadeu, Jason and Dilermano, and the reserves were Odival, Paulo César, Bolinha, Orlandino, João Oliveira, Padeirinho Dewson and Nena. In 1986, after a poor campaign, Ypiranga was relegated to the Second Division of Campeonato Amapaense. However, the team won the second division in 1987, returning to the first division in 1988."
"In 1991, under the administration of the chairman Luiz Góes, Ypiranga became a professional team. In 1992, Ypiranga reached its first professional competition title, after winning the state championship. The players of that team were Maurício, Zé Preta, Ponga, Cid and Neirivaldo, Edgar, Edvaldo and Serginho, Tiaguinho, Miranda and Jorginho Macapá, managed by Dadá Maravilha, who had won the 1970 World Cup as a player."
"Ypiranga's home stadium is Estádio Milton Corrêa, usually known as Zerão, inaugurated in 1990, with a maximum capacity of 5,000 people. It is famous for having its halfway line positioned exactly over the Equator."
"Ypiranga's logo is uncommon, because it features a church's tower. This church's tower is located at Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Conceição, which is a church located in Trem neighborhood. The club's nickname, Clube da Torre, is also a reference to the church's tower, and means ""Tower Club"" in English. Ypiranga's mascot is a creature very similar to Warner Brothers' Taz, but wearing the club's shirt, a club's themed Baseball cap and black leather jeans."
= = = Shakespeare Santa Cruz = = =
"Shakespeare Santa Cruz was an annual professional theatre festival in Santa Cruz, California, which ran from 1981 to 2013. After losing the financial support of the University of California, Santa Cruz, the company was relaunched through crowdfunding as Santa Cruz Shakespeare."
"Shakespeare Santa Cruz was founded in 1981 and performed annually on the campus of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Plays by Shakespeare and other great dramatists were performed indoors on the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage and outdoors in the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen. Bringing in professional actors, directors and designers from throughout the country, the Company's season ran from July to early September and presented three or four plays that ran concurrently in repertory six days a week (no performance on Mondays). With a mission to “cultivate the imagination, wit, daring, and vision that the greatest playwrights demand of artists and audiences alike,"" SSC sought to present a festival of theatre which showcased contemporary approaches to directing, designing and acting. Attendance grew from 7,716 people in 1982 to 31,013 in 1992. Since its founding, the company's artistic directors have been Audrey Stanley (1982–86), Michael Edwards (1987–92), Danny Scheie (1993–95), Risa Brainin, Paul Whitworth (1996–2007), and Marco Barricelli (2008–2013). Some of the rising theatre stars who have worked at SSC are: David Aaron Baker, Bryan Cranston, Maria Dizzia, Dan Donohue, Caitlin FitzGerald, Richard Gunn, Peter Jacobson, Carrie Preston, Reg Rogers, and Michael Stuhlbarg."
"In 1997, Artistic Director Paul Whitworth introduced the SSC annual Winter Holiday season. In keeping with the tradition of Shakespeare Santa Cruz’s fresh take on the classics, the holiday shows were original musicals written for SSC by playwright Kate Hawley with music composed by Gregg Coffin, Craig Bohmler and Adam Wernick. A fusion of the traditions of the British pantomime and the American musical, ""Cinderella"", ""Gretel and Hansel"", ""The Princess and the Pea"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" were based on traditional fairy tales and appeal to audiences of all ages. The winter season performed in November and December."
"In addition to the summer repertory season and the holiday show, Shakespeare Santa Cruz had two performance programs which sought to engage student actors with Shakespearean and other classical texts---the summer Fringe show and the Shakespeare to Go program. The Fringe show was an opportunity for the summer Company's acting interns to perform their own production in the Glen two nights each summer. Past productions included ""Lysistrata"", ""The Antipodes"", ""Fools in the Forest"", and ""The Mock-Tempest"". Shakespeare to Go was an educational engagement program—and recipient of National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) funding—featuring University of California Santa Cruz Theater Arts students who toured local schools in the spring performing one-hour versions of one of the full-length plays to be featured in the summer repertory season. Additionally, Shakespeare to Go presented a limited number of free public performances."
"The festival was responsible for supporting itself, but had recently run deficits which were paid by the University of California. In 2008, with California's budget crisis having resulted in reduced funding, the university could no longer afford to cover these debts. An agreement was reached that if the theater could raise $300,000, it could continue operation. Within 10 days of the agreement's announcement, over $400,000 was raised. Claiming continuing financial problems, however, the UCSC Arts Division dean announced several years later that Shakespeare Santa Cruz would end after its 2013 holiday production."
"Following this announcement, the theater company began a campaign to raise money to become an independent company. By February 2014, they raised over $1 million (USD) through crowdfunding to continue on without the financial support of the university. In March 2014, the new company changed its name to Santa Cruz Shakespeare."

He is the first Governor of Kerala to be appointed by the Narendra Modi Government."
"Sathasivam was born to Palaniswamy and Natchiammal in Kadappanallur near Bhavani in Erode district. He graduated from Government Law College Chennai after completing his BA degree Ayya Nadar Janaki Ammal College, Sivakasi."
"Sathasivam enrolled as an advocate on 25 July 1973 at Madras. He was then appointed to the post of Additional Government Pleader, and later as the Special Government Pleader in the Madras High Court. He was appointed a permanent judge of the Madras High Court on 8 January 1996, and transferred to the Punjab and Haryana High Court on 20 April 2007. He was elevated to the post of Judge of Supreme Court on 21 August 2007. During his tenure as Chief Justice, he was the Chairman of the General Council of the Gujarat National Law University. He succeeded Sheila Dikshit as the Governor of Kerala in August 2014."
"Justice Sathasivam authored several path-breaking judgments including the Reliance Gas Judgment (May 2010) where he observed that ""in a national democracy like ours, the national assets belong to the people"" and ""the government owns such assets for the purposes of developing them in the interests of the people""."
"He also delivered the verdict in the controversial triple-murder case of Stains and upheld the conviction of Dara Singh. On 19 April 2010, he delivered the judgement in the Jessica Lal murder case of 29 April 1999. Along with Justice B. S.

"The 2013–14 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team represented Wichita State University in the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. They played their home games at Charles Koch Arena, which had a capacity of 10,506. They were in their 69th season as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference. They were led by seventh-year head coach Gregg Marshall. They were the last team to finish the regular season and enter the NCAA Tournament unbeaten until Kentucky did it the next year."
"The 2013–14 season was arguably the best season in Wichita State's 108-year basketball history. After defeating Missouri State on March 1, 2014, Wichita State became the first men's Division I team ever to finish the regular season 31–0 (Kentucky matched it the next year) , the first team to finish 18–0 in conference play in the Missouri Valley Conference since the 1985–86 Bradley Braves, as well as the first to finish the regular season undefeated since Saint Joseph's in 2003–04. The team's 35–0 start was the best men's Division I start ever (before Kentucky started 38-0 the next year), beating the 1990–91 UNLV Runnin' Rebels who began the season 34–0 and the best Missouri Valley Conference start ever, beating the 1978–79 Indiana State Sycamores, who went 33–0 to start the season. They spent most of the season in the top 10 of both major polls, rising as high as #2 in late February. They continued their run by winning their first MVC tournament title since 1987, and were ranked second in both final major media polls, the highest final national ranking in school history. Though some analysts noted that Wichita State's schedule was relatively easy compared to previous teams that finished the regular season primarily because none of their opponents throughout the season were ranked when they played them, as well as only beating one opponent that was ranked at any point in the season (Saint Louis, who also had a lack of quality wins)."
"They entered the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament undefeated at 34–0. The Shockers beat Cal Poly, 64–37 for their NCAA-record 42–game winning streak to start a season. Two days later, and playing their 5th and final straight game at St. Louis' Scottrade Center, Fred VanVleet's three-point attempt at the end-of-game buzzer against Kentucky bounced harmlessly off the rim, and so went their attempt to become the first men's team in 38 years to win the title undefeated."
"In the 2012–13 college basketball season, the Wichita State University Shockers, under sixth-year head coach Gregg Marshall, finished the season 30–9 and 12–6 in Missouri Valley play to finish in second place. They advanced to the championship game of the Missouri Valley Tournament where they lost to Creighton. They received an at-large bid to the 2013 NCAA Tournament, receiving a 9 seed in the West Region, where they defeated 8 seed Pittsburgh and 1 seed Gonzaga to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. In the West Region semifinals they defeated 13 seed La Salle and 2 seed Ohio State in the regional finals to be crowned West Region Champions and advance to the Final Four for the second time in school history and first time since 1965. In the Final Four, they lost to eventual-champion Louisville, 72–68. Wichita State was ranked #4 in the final Coach's Poll of the 2012-13 season."

""The Peace and Rhythm Suite"" is a side-long suite consisting of two long, spacy compositions that predate the ambient house scene by nearly two decades yet sound entirely of a piece with that style. Long, droning, sustained chords on a variety of wind and reed instruments float above Muhammad's percussion, which ebbs and flows in a free, almost arrhythmic way through most of the piece.

Prior to Wizkid's subliminal tweets, Banky W pacified fans by assuring them that nothing was amiss. Furthermore, it was reported that troubles within E.M.E started as early as the E.M.E All Stars concert in 2012. It was also reported that money was at the centre of the controversy. On 30 April 2013, ""Nigerian Entertainment Today"" reported that Wizkid and E.M.E reunited after contract negotiations.

After a thorough investigation, the newspaper concluded Wizkid impregnated then-undergraduate student Sola Ogudugu. When the story broke out, close friends and associates of Wizkid didn't confirm the story due to DNA results that were pending at the time. Wizkid broke his silence on the story in several interviews. In an interview with a ""Nigerian Entertainment Today"" editor, he denied having a child. In another interview conducted in Ogudu-GRA, Lagos, he said he really doesn't want to find himself in that peculiar situation. In December 2012, Wizkid denied the baby scandal during an interview with Nonye Ben-Nwankwo of ""The Punch"".

"Tyrolit is an Austrian company that develops, manufactures and markets abrasive products as well as concrete sawing and drilling equipment. With 26 production locations on 5 continents, the TYROLIT group belongs to the world’s largest producers of bonded abrasives. The company is based in Schwaz, Tyrol, Austria. TYROLIT, a registered trademark, was named after the mineral Tyrolite, first described in 1845 in Tyrol."
"Tyrolit was co-founded on the 13th of February 1919 by Daniel Swarovski to manufacture grinding wheels for the production of Swarovski-Crystals. During World War I, the Swarovski Group was cut off from supplies of grinding wheels and was forced to develop and produce its own grinding wheels. After the war, it was decided to commercialize this activity and to start a separate company: Tyrolit was born."
"In 1950, the company relocated from the Swarovski Headquarters in Wattens to a new location in Schwaz. One of the largest drivers of growth of the company was the market launch of the glass fibre reinforced cut-off and grinding wheel SECUR in 1952. The glass fibre reinforcement greatly improved the security of the tools against centrifugal breakage."
In 1991 Tyrolit acquired the US company Diamond Products and the Swiss company Hydrostress. These acquisitions added significant presence in the market for concrete drilling and sawing systems.
"Further major acquisitions took place in 2004 with the purchasing of the Czech company Carborundum Electrite, in 2009 with the purchasing of the US company Radiac and in 2014 with the purchasing of the South African company Grinding Techniques."
The Tyrolit Group is organized in four divisions:
The Tyrolit Group operates under the following brands:

= = = Bye Bye Blues (film) = = =
Bye Bye Blues is a 1989 Canadian film. It was written and directed by Anne Wheeler and produced by Alberta Motion Picture Development Corporation with the assistance of Allarcom Limited.
"During World War II, Daisy Cooper (Rebecca Jenkins) returns home to her small Alberta town after she and her soldier husband, Teddy (Michael Ontkean), are split by the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong. While waiting for the war to end and to learn if Teddy is alive or dead, she joins a swing band as a singer to provide for her family, performing with them in many community halls. Daisy and her children initially live with her husband's parents, but later rent a house for themselves, as Daisy chafes under her in-laws' scrutiny. Daisy struggles to balance societal expectations of fealty and commitment to her children, while also struggling to financially support herself and her children by travelling and performing with the band. A trombonist in the band has a secret past and a not so secret yearning. Daisy struggles with an impossible choice as she hears that Teddy is returning home."
"Her husband's sister, a somewhat similar free spirit, befriends an Australian airman in Alberta to train in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan."
"The cast also includes Luke Reilly, Leslie Yeo, Kate Reid, Wayne Robson, Robyn Stevan, and Stuart Margolin."
"The film was nominated for twelve Genie Awards at the 11th Genie Awards in 1990, and won three: Best Actress (Jenkins), Best Supporting Actress (Stevan), and Best Original Song (""When I Sing"" by Bill Henderson)."
"Springwater School in Starland County, Alberta, Canada was used as a set."
"There are a number of buildings in Alberta's Ghost Town - Rowley, Alberta."
This town's buildings were refaced and looks like a Hollywood movie set - hence its nickname Rowleywood.
"For several years ""Bye Bye Blues"" could not be exhibited on television or theatrically (and could not be issued on DVD or made available digitally) because nobody could determine who held the copyright.

= = = Dean Kiely = = =
Dean Laurence Kiely (born 10 October 1970) is a former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He is the goalkeeping coach at Premier League club Crystal Palace. He won eleven caps for the Republic of Ireland as a player. Kiely has previously worked as the goalkeeping coach at West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City.
"Born in Salford, Lancashire, Kiely trained with the West Bromwich Albion youth system as a schoolboy before being accepted into the FA School of Excellence at Lilleshall. After Albion he progressed through the Coventry City youth system as a trainee before signing a professional contract on 30 October 1987. He went to Ipswich Town on loan in November 1989 but failed to make any league appearances. Kiely joined York City on loan on 9 March 1990 before joining permanently in May, when he was given his first chance at regular first-team football. He made 210 league appearances for them between 1990 and 1996, and played in their 3–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in the League Cup."
"Following a trial with Plymouth Argyle, Kiely signed for Bury on 15 August 1996 for a tribunal-decided fee of £125,000. He spent three seasons at Bury, making 137 league appearances in the process. He was instrumental in Bury winning the Second Division title in the 1996–97 season, most notably with an 88th-minute penalty save in the penultimate game of the season from Watford's Tommy Mooney. Bury requiring a point to guarantee a second automatic promotion in as many seasons had Kiely to thank after he kept the scoreline at 0–0 in a memorable day at Vicarage Road."
"Kiely moved to Charlton Athletic for a fee of £1 million on 26 May 1999 and made his debut on 7 August against Barnsley. He was Charlton's regular keeper from 1999 to 2005, and was popular with the club's fans as well as having a majestic ""shut out"" rate. Having been signed from a lower-division club he was seen as an example of Alan Curbishley's ability to spot talent in unheralded players. Kiely made a point-blank save from Birmingham City player Christophe Dugarry in a game at St Andrew's on 3 November 2003; Charlton went on to win the game 2–1 and Kiely later named the save as the favourite one of his career. He also saved a penalty from Crystal Palace's Andy Johnson to help secure a 1-0 win in December 2004."
"He signed for Portsmouth for an undisclosed fee on 25 January 2006, and played a large part in their escape from relegation that same season. His Pompey debut was in the FA Cup against Liverpool at Fratton Park in a 2–1 defeat. After David James signed for Portsmouth on 11 August, he voiced his frustration at having to compete with a top goalkeeper for the No. 1 spot, and with Jamie Ashdown also on their books, he opted to leave Portsmouth in the autumn."
He signed for Championship club Luton Town on a one-month loan
"on 23 November 2006, making his debut in the 2–1 away defeat at Southampton on 25 November. He then joined Championship side West Bromwich Albion on 30 January 2007, signing a one-and-a-half-year contract, as a replacement for Russell Hoult. Kiely made his Albion debut in a 2–1 win over Plymouth Argyle the following day."
"Kiely reached the milestone of 700 senior career appearances on 1 September 2007, and recorded a clean sheet as Albion beat Barnsley 2–0. He signed a new deal with West Brom in January 2008, which would expire in June 2009. Kiely's clean sheet in the 3–0 home win against Plymouth Argyle on 1 March 2008 saw him named in the Championship Team of the Week.<ref name=""Team Of The Week (03/03/2008)""></ref> Later that month however, he was the subject of criticism and booing from his team's own fans during Albion's 4–3 victory over Colchester United, but retained his starting place. He nonetheless kept 18 clean sheets in all competitions to win the Championship Golden Glove award, while Albion won promotion to the Premier League as champions and reached the FA Cup semi-final. Since then, Kiely had to play second fiddle to England international Scott Carson. In spite of that, he was awarded a one-year extension at the club as a 'reward' from boss Tony Mowbray for his professionalism. And following an injury to Carson in training, Kiely was handed his first Premier League start against Wigan Athletic on 9 May 2009, producing some fine saves as the Baggies won 3–1 to keep their survival hopes alive, earning praise from Mowbray in the process. Mowbray was also quick to hail Kiely's professionalism throughout the season in handling his situation with dignity. That performance ensured that he kept his place for the club's final two games of the season, although he was unable to prevent relegation following a 2–0 defeat at the hands of Liverpool. On 24 May 2009 he kept a clean sheet in the club's final game against Blackburn Rovers as the match finished in a 0–0 stalemate."
"Since relegation to the Championship Kiely has once again had to be content playing second fiddle to Carson, who was named the new club captain by new manager Roberto Di Matteo, but on 8 December 2009 he made his first Championship appearance of the season as a replacement, coming on for the sent-off Carson and saving a penalty (though Peter Whittingham scored from the rebound) in a 2–0 home defeat to Cardiff City. He went on to play a run of three games while Carson sat through a suspension following his headbutting of Cardiff striker Michael Chopra, against QPR (2–2), Peterborough United (2–0), and Scunthorpe United (3–1). Kiely had also been performing the duties of goalkeeping coach following the retirement of former trainer Joe Corrigan, and in April 2010 was officially named goalkeeping coach of the club. On 18 April 2010, Kiely made his fifth appearance of the season as a half-time substitute for the injured Carson in a 2–0 home win over Middlesbrough. He retired as a player at the end of the 2010–11 season after West Brom opted against extending his contract, however he remained at the club as a coach. In January 2015, upon the appointment of new West Bromwich Albion manager, Tony Pulis, Kiely was released by the club. In March 2015, he was appointed Norwich City's goalkeeping coach."
"In September 2017, Kiely was appointed the goalkeeping coach at Championship club Preston North End."
"In January 2018, Kiely joined Premier League club Crystal Palace as goalkeeping coach."
"Kiely played for England at under-15 (13 caps), under-16 (13 caps) and under-18 (four caps in 1988) levels. He made one appearance for Republic of Ireland B, starting in a 4–3 win over League of Ireland XI on 9 February 1999, in which he was substituted for Nick Colgan. He went on to represent the Republic of Ireland at full international level, earning his first cap as a substitute in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying play-off against Turkey in November 1999. He retired from international football in February 2003, but in April 2008 Ireland's assistant manager Liam Brady suggested that Kiely could make a return to the squad. The rumours were then confirmed when he returned to the Ireland squad in Giovanni Trapattoni's first squad as manager in May 2008. He won his first cap in five years when he appeared in the Republic's 1–1 draw with Serbia that month, playing the full 90 minutes. On 28 May 2009, he walked out of the Ireland squad after Trapattoni informed him that he would be replacing Shay Given with Keiren Westwood for the second half of the friendly International against Nigeria at Craven Cottage on 29 May. He was capped 11 times by the Republic of Ireland, last appearing in 2008."
