"I mean, if I said anything to you."
About what?
"Me me me mention yo , something in the newsletter."
Wa wondered if you  were gonna do anything.
"So, I said no, I'd mentioned it to you and talked about it."

"I've got a temperature, by the way."
Mum?
"Are you going to sit there and read the paper, or do nothing?"
I'm reading the paper!
I wanted my cup of tea and I'm tired!
"Well you gonna, oh I've gotta bring a cup of tea in for you, have I now?"
I think his name's actually written out.
I'm not sure
It's like trying to unite the churches.
Yeah.
It looks like somebody Plus Plusky Oh yeah.
No.
Oh well.
It's signed by s .
Oh no sorry..
That can't possibly say .
Well it says Leslie  at the top.
But there's something else underneath.
I mean is that
but is that a Greenpeace central office thing or is it erm
A local group.
a local group?
East Herts.
"But does it, Pat  does it  doesn't he?"
for Herts yeah.
He still does it now.
How do you know?
that have got so involved in that.
Yeah.
And and Bob  did it  here in Bishop's Stortford but I don't know whether he's still  I think he still does it because he was very committed.
But I I just  Pat was doing it for Bishop's Stortford on or thereabouts because he sent me all the details about the whale walk .
Cos I I gave his name to this guy organizing the one world week.
And he hadn't had any joy out of Greenpeace.
Can I borrow that a minute?
What this?
Yeah
The problem we've got with Greenpeace they might not have so much in the way of merchandise and they just have the stickers and
There's the   leaflets.
No I wouldn't sell Bright.
I'd buy someone first.
Make sure someone was interested in  .
I'd buy Deane  and swap Bright in exchange for Deane.
No matter how bad he doesn't like it  he's well and truly gutted.
Er so him for Deane and
Yeah but Deane won't be available till the end of the season.
There's no way Sheffield United
Er I dunno.
just stoking the price up I think.
"Cos it's not old Bassett now, this is what it's all about."
to get the odd draw you need the odd goal and er it's not gonna come from any other people than er
"Oh yeah, Deane."
Deane.
But Deane didn't score today.
It was Beazley apparently.
Beazley.
Beazley.
Er I might see if I could pick up that  Sheffield United guy Jamie Hoyland.
He's quite good.
"As you say the main problem is, as you say is are you going to change your whole  team, game"
Yeah.
I don't know.
I think they'll do it slowly but  not this slowly.
I mean I th I think we should have bought someone along with er Gabbiadini to play with him.
could just bring him and expect  stuff.
Mm could you get
"I think he's gonna have to raid the bottom divisions again, you know."
What sort of bottom divisions?
he's probably got his eye on .
I mean that Coleman was a very good buy wasn't he?
Yeah?
"I mean everyone knows she fancies him, but like, she's been getting really flirty!"
"So, like, we've got this thing about her, anyway, she was com and she was talking to Fiona today and she was stood next to me, and like  in a way, I was laughing at her  but I felt so sorry for her cos she really, really stunk!"
"And like  I wouldn't sa , she's not the sort of person who you'd think  oh you know  I mean like"
Oh you smell!
"yeah like, not being nasty but Hannah   to look at her you think  you'd think, oh you know she might sort of bit  bit pongy!"
Mm.
"And like, Lisa  's like, you know  so"
"Yeah she's like, really clean cut isn't she?"
She's like anyone isn't she?
"She's like us  sort of thing, you know?"
"I mean, here's me saying  smelly bum, you know !"
"Even, even, even no, but even more"
Radiation!
"than that, I mean  I mean, I'm not being nasty but I mean  look at our  hairdo's!"
"I mean we're not exactly , well I'm so worried about  you know"
Yeah.
how I look just at this second or anything!
"Yeah, but she does doesn't she?"
"I know, but like she says, she's  hair and everything isn't she?"
And all her make up  and she got  and she's really pretty really
Yeah.

She is actually.
Pete said she  Pete said he'd give her one!
"And I said, oh God I wouldn't!"
And I to also admitted to him that I
"Have yo , have yo"
female.

No.
"Oh yes, I did!"
Yes.
Forget about it Nick!
Did you hear that ?
Did you hear what he said?
"Oh well, basically  well"
Mm!

Er
Shut up!
What ?
Do what?
Do what?
"Oh well, nothing of interest."
"Erm, no  yo I've, er I've asked him at the parents' evening what he expected us to do for economics, right?"
And yo you're never gonna guess what he wants us to do for our final bit of course work?
We have got to go and stand outside Marks and Spencers  and ask questionnaires  and we've gotta do the same in Wimbourne.
Ridiculous or what!
I think it's crap!
I think it's pathetic!
Er here!
Er here !
I think it's ridiculous!
We're never gonna get that done are we?
Are you gonna go and stand outside Marks and Spencers and get arrested?
For asking surveys?
Oh God!
I think it might be worthwhile actually so the school can come and bail us out!
Urgh!
God it's ridiculous!
I mean  will be arrested for kerb crawling!
"I mean, you can't do that sort of thing, surely!"
"Oh well, I think it's ridiculous!"
"As you can tell, I said, Andy's been drinking  I think."
Well you can write save money across the top then
"Well I, I wrote actually that article for the the Herald and Post that has appeared in Harlow but not here."
A  whole load of tips  like that.
Oh.
"Now every week I open Herald and Post and think oh it's gonna be in there, it's gonna be in there but it never is."
It's only appeared in Harlow and she told me it would get in the Bishop's Stortford one but it hasn't so far.
It's a bit annoying really.
Who does all the schools?
As to recycling.
They must be checked.
What about asking Caroline?
School.
Well I mean somebody who knows the teachers or
Yes.
That's gonna be a difficult one cos they don't always want

Really?
That night we were gonna play Tottenham
Oh well.
in the league.
Oh sorry.
Perhaps we can play Tottenham when they haven't got er Gary Lineker in  their games any more.
Yeah.
You start hitting periods like this and you think  oh no.
You think every team  you start worrying about almost every side don't you?
Yeah.
Oh we always worry about every side cos Crystal Palace  always hate the  bad sides.
Cos usually we do well against the Man United and as soon as we start  losing against them we start getting worried.
They outplayed us last season at fairground didn't they?
Liverpool
What do you mean  at Liverpool?
What did Liverpool do to them then?
Well we lost  no we beat them two one
Yeah.
I remember that.
Most surprising result of that season.
Not really.

"Oh,a do you?"
"boring, then we looked to see what's on the other side, but  for some reason she was talking  don't they?"
Or time until they
Do you watch er Noel Edmonds?
"you see  coming off the  th there's a straight bit  erm, but she was very friendly with this woman's mother"
Mm.
but the daughter still keeps in touch with her.
"She's just written to her to say that she's on This is Your Life on the  third or fourth of March, whatever it is"
Oh!
"and her son-in-law is an actor but Mrs  doesn't know who he is, what his name is"
Oh!
so to speak  so she's written and told her whereabouts she's sitting  and everything so
That girl is daft

December.

Tenth of December.

He won't mind will he?
"You'll have all re you'd know where it is, won't you, by then?"
Well I know where it is I just don't know how to get there.

God you know you are lucky  wouldn't you?
"The irony of it is this is that he  has done a lot, he gave ten thousand"
Yeah.
"pounds, is it, not to the leukaemia was it or w was it?"
Think it was cancer  childhood cancer or something.
She's gonna be there tonight  I thought well I always could just   well I think I might come over if you've gotta be there.
Oh!
She isn't bringing the boyfriend is she?
"She's not, she"
No she wouldn't would she?
She wouldn't!
No.
Oh perhaps she's gonna try and
She might want to stay I don't know.
"sort of you know, sort of get peace with you again  Ooh!"
Without anything   almost wished she hadn't of come
Oh!
We went down this  park cos we wanted to
Yeah.
and when we walked in she's got her brother and her boyfriend.
Oh!
"And they always go on a Wednesday, they never go on a Thursday."
Oh!
I mean that's why we went on a Thursday and they'd changed their   as a chap that seems very strange to me!
Yeah.
Because she knows we go once every you know  every other Thursday at least.
Perhaps she was frightened that  she'd gotta
Yeah
see you on your own.
Says she's coming over so what's
Oh!
you never know!
Ooh you ha wait and see  Is Graham at work today?
"No, but, well it Tuesday is his day off but he's got late till eleven this morning."

"so she didn't want me to put sixty four down, but that's cheating"
Mm.
cos if you know the age you're supposed to put the age down
Mm.
cos some people'll tell you and some people won't.
"So I put sixty four down so  well I didn't put sixty four, I put thirty plus thirty four"
"Yeah, sixty four."
so that made sixty four.
"So she jumped up, grabbed the pencil and everything, she got a screwdriver first,I thought she were gonna stab me with screwdriver  and she were looking for a pencil"
erm but luckily she's rubbed it out with thingy so
You're putting it back in.
I'm putting it back in.
.
So there.
"Now it's back again, it says thirty plus thirty four."
She wanted me to put twenty one!
Bloody hell.
"I says get lost, I says that's cheating."
I'm sixteen I am.

"Forty seven, I'm not that old."
It's a good job I put forty two then innit?

And I got her a box of Black Magic so  that's her birthday present sorted out  so she can eat and drink then can't she!
"Well she don't want ornaments and things like that, does she at her age?"
They got so many!

"come home and I thought well I'll drop that, I'll stay and go up the ladder  and I was gonna do painting  you got him  Hey up!!"
So I jumped right away.

Then I thought what on earth did he say!
And then I just never understood a word of what he said.
Well I can never understand him.
No I can't.
I thought what ever's he on about!
I can.
If we ought to had him mate  they'd have thought he'd come from
Well
another planet!
I can't never understand him.
No I must admit I can't.
"We have this French woman come in  she comes quite often Mrs   and  she said  I'd like to make an appointme appointment on the  she said the eleventh, and I thought   I said  pardon?"
And she said it again and I thought well i it didn't sound  like eleven  eleven   I don't know what it sounded like really and I just went  so that'll be Wednesday the eleventh?
"And I thought  if she says yes, I've got the date right !"
Yeah.
And did you get it right?
"Yeah  that's embarrassing, you feel an idiot don't you!"

Wow West Brom.
"See West Brom, really a first division team."
They shouldn't be in the third division.
the figures is irrelevant isn't it?
Yeah.
The figures are irrelevant.
"Tradition that is, West Brom."
Just tradition.
They're getting bigger
Even if they went out the league they'd get that number.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've been a West Brom supporter
They wouldn't be able to afford to keep the ground on would they?
all my life.
What?
They wouldn't be able to afford to keep the ground on if they went out
Well I mean it shows you what marvellous West Brom were.
When West Brom got lost four nil to Woking  wasn't it Paulie?
"The next round they had West Brom supporters supporting, came down from"
Yeah.
Birmingham to support Woking in the next round.
Yeah.
It's pretty good isn't it?
But that's all much of a muchness isn't it?
Nothing over four.
No.
was right.
We er we would have played  Tottenham on the night of the Q P R game.
"That's the sort of, kinda thing that,the two things that you  ."
You couldn't do anything!

Sure I went to  the Arts and everything and stuff.
Oh!

A few years ago.
It's not that.
"Yes, but mum, I couldn't just go back and do like every show!"
I'm not saying that.
They go around.
They're using the arts.
They use the arts.
They use their arts.
"And they use  Bangor, little fair of Bangor."
Aha.

It's the Harberton
"The Harberton The Ulster Operatic  use  th erm  no, but I mean, I a , because I wasn't a member it was like one show was okay, and the pantomime as well."
"But I mean, you really have to be, like, a member before like  if you were starting to like, want to do all the shows  they'd want you"
"No, but I mean , no one ever really does all the shows."
I know.
"But say,ma , maybe  if you did the pantomime and then the next one coming up  I mean  er er  er,th , I think they'd actually ask you  like, your membership money."
What's the  what do you actually do this for?
"No, it's a, as I enjoyed it."
You can take .
Well  something other than just to talk about  other than just the normal run of road things.
You know  I do this.
How much did that cost ?
"He just, he just"
"I do , you put it in the big shop didn't you?"
"I put it in, okay"
", over er  the pub at the end."
"You put it in, you don't go onto, you don't pay ."
"Well we got so Phillips on the, on the sheet  and er  they're all    ."

So Mericlean sent it away  with his P forty five to have it changed  and they said they couldn't accept it  that they'd have to re-apply or something.
And I mean it was an official thing from the tax
Yeah.

"They wrote , they wrote back  and Carole showed me the letter and said that this isn't  this is"
Not sufficient evidence or something.

"And erm they had their opening, big opening night Thursday so  he was, he was  out, he was up at half past four that morning so I thought well  we might as well go."
So I rang mum at four o'clock.

not particularly my cup of tea but mum enjoyed them and they got everybody going and  and then we had a good game of bingo.
We had a sherry when we went in and erm  bottle of champers on the table and balloons and
Ooh.
Tell you what she's living it up more now than she did before!
"Well, you have to make something."
"But they've got, we've got a new club here called The Beacon."
Erm right.

And anyway
"we now, we've, we've also got to progress on site layout and things haven't we?"
Yes.
And get in  er  the cones and signs.
Yeah I've had  er
"we, we, you've got    we've got to wait till tomorrow haven't we?"
"That's right, yeah."
Yeah.
"Now as regards signs I've spoke to numerous, oh  school holidays I've got  erm"
when the schools are off.
Right.
I spoke to the Education Department on Friday.
Erm  as regards a caravan I spoke to this bloke  Frank
No he's gone bust.
Well he hasn't gone bust but they don't hire them any more
Oh right.
but I did try him.
Er no Gwyllam  at Gwyneth County Council
Gwyllam   oh no I'm thinking of Peter .
erm  he didn't think they had any bilingual signs and they didn't have  they weren't using their Portakabins so they scrapped them all last year  sold them off.
Mm.
But he did give me somebody to ring about caravans
Mm.
but then later on in the day he rung back and said he had found some  bilingual signs but all he's got were about four foot square  er with census point ahead.
He hasn't got things like stop  census.
Stop if required  or  slow census point which is the ones we use.
It might be worth asking erm  Mel
Yeah.
about that.
You see for a start we need to decide to we need it.
"me, but it's five pound eighty for a two hour session."
Well you've got to think about going to Northampton.
Yeah.
You're talking about half hour there and back drive.
So that
Yeah.
two hours is now three.
Yeah.
Plus your petrol money to get there.
"Yeah, yeah."
That's right.
Do you want me to fetch a pillow?
"No, you're alright love."
There's plenty of cushions
"No, you're alright."
"And erm  so you see you're, you're throwing money to get money which is, which is a bit stupid."
That's right.
pointless .
But then I erm  she phoned me yesterday and she said to me have you had any  professional  lifting erm  lessons at all.
I said no.
None whatsoever.
"So she said oh, that's alright, I've got it all in me head what, what I've got with you."
So I do believe in me soul that she's working for me.
Mm.
Mm.
"But she's offered me a relief post as I say, where I go round and help but she don't know how many hours it will be."
Mm.
"But I think I've got to get in and I've got to think well this next six months  erm I've gotta work hard to get in  regardless of whether I go  voluntary or whether I go to a hospital and learn it at me own you know, expense."
Yeah.
I think I've got to put something in to get something out.
I've never been a person that gets something for nothing.
For nothing.
gas and electric's expensive now isn't it?
I know.
"And I keep thinking to myself well something will come along, something'll happen, but  I I think what it is  there is no jobs round here at the moment."
I think what it is is that I feel  if I go into something for the sake of going into it to earn money  I shall be absolutely bored with me life.
I f I shall feel as if we've been from here  cos when I was first married we lived up round the next road.
"And I shall feel as if I've got up, been round the world"
Yeah.
"and come back to, to where I were twenty six year ago and"
Mm.
Yeah.
I don't want that.
I've got to
No.
have a purpose to go out to work.
Mm.
I mean most people go out to work to earn money.
Mm.
Yeah.

"But now she's left and she's had a baby  and I carried on  because he wanted it, the the new landlord wanted me to  to stop on and help out."
Oh my giddy aunt.

Tell him he's not a daddy!
Yes !
"ring  , could you tell Scott that er  that erm  oh God, I don't know!"

Tell him he doesn't have to go to confession with Helena!

Ooh I wonder what that could be about ?
"Er, like this morning at break  I walked, I walked straight past Peter  right  and er  come up to me and he goes  that's not very nice is it?"

"And she's going, why not?"

"I was saying, oh yeah  erm Shrimpy like, we, me and Scott were playing snooker  and I, I came in to see if like, either of  you, anyone else wanted to play doubles  and like,Swimp , Shrimpy was just sat by himself in the middle of the floor, cross-legged just sat there like a little pixie or something!"
"Well, no not a little"
And I just went
six foot three pixie !
"Right, so a six foot three pixie, never mind!"
But like  he was just sat there!
"And I went over, I goes you alright?"
"He goes, yes!"
Oh sorry!
Please forgive me!
"I goes, do you wanna go, go and play snooker?"
"So he goes, yeah alright then."
"Oh come on you can be on my side  cos it was obvious, like, he was just sort of sat there."
Mm.
"And erm  and then like, he went back in after we'd finished playing and me and Scott carried on playing for a bit  and then erm  what was he going?"
"Oh yeah, he told me afterwards right, that he, the only reason he was angry was because Friday night reminded him of the time in his past or something!"
"And Pete reminded him of, him of the person that he hated and all this!"
"And I was thinking  Shrimpy, you're stupid!"
Get a life !
You sure!
Oh !
"And then, cos I thought boy!"
So what did he do?
Oh yes.
But  though it was rather dangerous.
"After all in my, you know my er  people working on the rails book?"
The one
Yes.
.
"It says, you must never try to steer ru steer round a bu barrier poles."
That's right.
"And they're trying to take away as many er  possible erm, mainly one barrier er  railway gates as possible."
Well I didn't know they were trying to get rid of those.
Especially on busy main roads.
But some of the crossings around this area didn't have any barriers at all
Ah ah.
and  they just had the flashing lights.
Well it's like wo ones at Meading Ro Meadow Road.
That's right.
They're only wooden ones.
"Ah well tha no Meadow Road's got the old gates but  at Natherton there were some that didn't have any  barriers at all, they were just flashing lights."
"Now, do you remember  now let's think whether you were born."
When the Lockington railway disaster happened  that was just a few miles from here.
At Manchester?
"No, Lockington."
Ah.
"And that was where er, a train came off the railways when it hit a van  on"
Oh.

Oh.
"I, I, I know, I'd, I have never heard  never heard."

"A fare ticket, yes a ticket."

"And that's how you spell fare for that F A R E, alright, okay?"
Yes

Rabbit
"Yes, it's, it is the same sort of family as a rabbit a hare."

"H A I R and that is the hair that's on your head, I've got long hair, dark hair."
"Now what about, what's the next word?"
Scare

"Scare, now put that in a sentence"

Yeah.
No I might er  might decide to do something about it if I get the inspiration.
I'm just getting  now because erm  erm  I've been for an aud not an audition .
Wrong word.
I've been for an interview with Mencap.
Oh aye?
"And erm  I didn't get the actual job I went for but they put me on the, on the relief register so that I go round to different people's homes or different big hospitals  and different Mencap homes  relieving people when they're on holiday or  if they're short of staff or something like that."
So
Yeah.
"erm  so er  I'm waiting to hear, so that I'm getting irritable at the minute cos  A the money is going and B  being out of work, being here all day."
It's sending me crackers.
I'm used to working day and night.
I mean it's very hard to do neither.
husband  he wants some beans.
Who does?
Him.
Li li whatever for!
He said cos I used to keep the house tidy  he said I've been the in the army June an he said I can  I can run a household  he said but we and then working the shifts I do  he said and go up the horses and that  he said I just don't get time to do it!
"He said well you know I, I iron mostly, most of the ironing, I said yeah I know you do."
Whatever does she do then?
"Well   well he said  when he's not there she comes home  she cooks them an evening meal  but she's she she's  she's got a p , he said she's gotta give some time to Harriet, that's not fair"
Yeah.
"if she don't, I said well that's true  I said you can't  and we're not gonna neglect, which they don't."
Yeah.
And then he said er  by the time she's  sorted out  and washed up
Yeah.
"and I thought, she don't wash up, she"
Yeah.
leaves it for me!
Yeah.
"Erm  it's tha then getting towards  and she's gone down and done the horses he sh he said it's then getting to Harriet's bed time so she baths her all  sorts her out  and he said  well she does work hard, he said and by the end of that she  she won't be able to do anything else!"
No .
Well I said I can understand that
Pardon?
"I   I said well I suppose it's  I do  and he said but you work hard June, I said I know but  I said kno I said what I do, I can only have hour out there and an hour inside."
Yeah.
"And I said I can sort of keep on top of mine, but I said  I am up early."
Yeah.
He said well Trish isn't.
I said well I get up early.
Mm.
If I'm doing like my jobs.
Yeah.
"I said I'm, most morning I said  sort of every other morning I'm ironing here at half five"
Yeah.
I said because if I don't I can't pick up all this.
Yeah.
"Cor he said, I wouldn't wanna iron that time of the morning!"
Yeah.
you know?
"And I'm just gonna say  you know, I think it would  be better if Scott didn't rush in like that, you know?"
"I can understand why he did it, to be quite honest."
"Yeah but you say to her  that they're always on about how s Shrimpy can't do anything for himself, and it's between Emma, it's not between  it was al even Scott said to me at the beginning oh it's not between me, it's nothing to do with me, it's between Emma and Scott."
Emma and Shrimpy.
Emma and Shrimpy then.
"And erm  he's been, then he rushes ahead full storm  don't he?"
Mm.
"He shouldn't have done that really, he was a bit naughty."
"He,sh she ought to learn to sh she's, they was all on about how Shrimpy can't stick up for himself, and then flaming  Emma does exactly the same but worse cos she gets Scott to do it for her."
"She's gonna have to one of these, I'm not being funny but she can't stick up for herself, that girl can't."
"It's about time she had the courage to do it, herself if she's in a strop."
"There's no point getting Scott, cos what's gonna happen when she finishes with Scott?"
She really
Oh
As you've probably gathered.
oh I need your love babe
What's this?
yes I know it's true  erm
Where's the tape?
hold me love me hold me love me  you
What was this af what was it after?
What's just been on?

What
a Week this is   love me  ain't got nothing but love babe
"It's not on here, eight da oh yeah it is."
eight days a week
"And I Love Her no I mean I Feel Fine, Ticket to Ride and Yesterday, oh yes!"
I like them.
Help I need somebody  that's on side B.
Yeah she was erm  well  necessarily  cos  that day  Blue was working on the other team as well so he had his erm  break at different time.
Yeah.
"And I er  she comes storming out of the canteen  swearing  not at anybody in particular, just at herself really!"
"And then she's seen me, oh what time does Blue finish?"
I said whenever he  about half past three  so erm  so then she come down  Geoff said you gotta finish half past three Blue  my God!.
Oh.
And he did as well.
What you mean?
Well like sometimes I'll say to him everybody gonna finish about four  you know
Yeah.
"what happens, then his  she stands there, you bloody  by four  but I mean he finished when I said he was gonna finish  for a change I should think."
I didn't know Julia hadn't been in for a long while.
"No, what's the matter with her?"
"She'd erm  was erm  getting a pie out the oven  and cos some of the juice went on the floor, she wiped it up thinking she'd wiped it up properly and she didn't, she slipped, she's broken  a couple of bones in her foot."
Cor!
No I
ain't seen for ooh
She hasn't been there for about a month.
That's it then .
I suppose she must have her foot in plaster.
"Mm  and old Bob down the road, Bob , he hasn't been in for about the same sort of time  this'll be his fourth week won't it?"
Well I see him walking about the other day!
He's hurt his hand.
Oh.
"Come home from work on the Saturday and assume he went shopping or something, apparently he hurt his hand.."
Has he?
Yeah  Mr  said have you seen  do it?
"I said, no I haven't."
Well I seen her at  even the other day.
Yeah.
I think it might have been Saturday  possibly.
By Saturday normally I see him.
Yeah.
I suppose so.
"It's all the fashion, innit?"
Yeah.
Rather be spivvy.
on the back of his  it's just so sad.
"cut as well, innit?"
I know.
"My brother, oh, it's sad."
"My brother's got this mate at school, called Victor."
"He's got a pair of shearing scissors and he's been doing like, this boy's African, so he's got, you know, Afro hair, which you can do curly-wurly signs on the back of him, it looks pretty neat."
"But Ryan decided that he'd have his head shaved at the back of his head, so he got this boy to write his name on."
"It shows you how thick this boy is, he wrote on his name, he spelt it  R I E N ."
Rien.
"and this is really sad, and he told me mum that he'd been to a hairdressers and done it."
"Oh, did he?"
Yeah.
How did you know it was his friend done it?
"Cos of Nat cos Natalie, she's a right little squealer, she is."
"I don't, Natalie's Samantha's sister."
"Erm, she, she at school with Ryan,"
I don't suppose the hairdresser
in the same year.
"Well, my brother had a smack, cos Natalie tells her what Ryan's been up cos she's a bit like that, erm, likes to sort of erm, squeal, you know."
"She said, have you seen Ryan's hair."
"I said, yeah, and she went ah, she went, Victor did that."
I went  what ?
"I went, is this this well hard bloke from Brixton, cos Ryan keeps going on about it, like we I said, is he do, I said, oh, we went to Oxford Street today, and he went, is that anywhere near Brixton?"
"I went  I don't think so, Ryan, and he went, ah, cos I wanna go up there, it's well hard up there."
"I thought, why he's saying that, and then I looked, and Victor comes through now, and he went, yeah, I wan he goes, I wanna go up London and get some clothes, get some really stylish stuff up London, I was like, yeah, Ryan."
"I said, you only get a bigger selection, that's about it."
"He said, no you don't."
Is everyone okay about that?
book
Er
where you where you
Which one?
"On on your  chapter six and nine, do you know what chapter nine ?"
Er.
"Not off the top of my head, I can't remember."
Was that was that  theory?
Was it that?
"I can't remember what the  off the top of my head, no."
"chapter six is,."
"Right, er"
as questions lead to  shouting and then crawling back to his   Then a little bit about language and an experiment that they did .
"Right, sounds like there's a bit on topics in there so it might be worth having a look at anyway."

Mr Tommy  Inverness.
Can I ask firstly Mr  when you were born?
August  the sixth nineteen twenty nine.
Now was this in Tormore?
In Tormore House er by Lochassynt.
In Sutherland ?
In Sutherland.
That's correct.
And how long were you in fact  there?
Well up until the time I would be about eight years old  when my father decided there was a change in the estate then and it was off to Argyllshire Dalmally that Sir Douglas  and Lady  as she was then decided to go and wanted my father to come with him.
But him being from up there and my mother also and their people were still alive which was my grandparents on both sides they were very reluctant to sort of go.
But when a job came he he would be wanting a diff different  shooting ground in in Argyllshire comparison to the hard rocks of Sutherland.
Mm.
Mm.
"This government says ooh we can't afford that, no, it's a  it's a gimmick!"
The Yank says we will!
Bingo!
"And look, this used to be"
We could of held them to ransom!
one of the best education systems in the world!
And I mean
"I know, it isn't now!"
won't be here now  well you could  sliding right
I know!
down the scale!
Mm.
We're terrible!
We're way behind

"There was, there was a programme on Channel Four there to I was watching  before I picked my book up  and  they had Conservative  Labour bloke and the independent er  Liberals  and these were supposedly  they have on on er Channel Four a a programme called Week in Politics  anyway  this night, this, tonight they were doing a  a fu , they had a floating audience, supposedly a floating audience"
"You mean, they were under water?"
"flo ,fa floating vo er voters"
Oh!
"er  until, until the end  and they had a poll of er  who  who has been persuaded to vote  for  the three la , you know, what had they done to"
Oh they had to  to say who they supported and
"vote for the three, that's right  and there was one  one put their hand up for  he persuaded them that Ne , Neil Kinnock would be a good leader, that was it  er  so one put their hand up for him  one put their hand up for Major  and she had the cheek to say"
that that is only because I'm a Conservative!
"And it was supposed to be , if the audience was supposed to be voting"
and I mean  but the  quite  the majority of them  er  put their hands up for  Paddy Ashdown.
Yeah  he's a very persuasive   character
Oh !
how high she could kick !
` The old chair-cover in the corner split when he saw her .
` The urn would have sung but she said she had a cold ; she could not sing unless she boiled .
` In the window was an old quill pen .
There was nothing remarkable about her except that she had been dipped too deeply into the ink .
But she was very proud of that . '
"`` If the urn will not sing , '' said she , `` outside the door hangs a nightingale in a cage who will sing . '' '"
"`` I do n't think it 's proper , '' said the kettle , `` that such a foreign bird should be heard . '' '"
"`` Oh , let us have some acting , '' said everyone ."
`` Do let us ! ''
` Suddenly the door opened and the maid came in .
Everyone was quite quiet .
There was not a sound .
"But each pot knew what he might have done , and how grand he was ."
` The maid took the matches and lit the fire with them .
"How they spluttered and flamed , to be sure !"
"`` Now everyone can see , '' they thought , `` that we are the grandest !"
How we sparkle !
What a light - '' ` But here they were burnt out . '
` That was a delightful story ! '
said the sultana . '
I quite feel myself in the kitchen with the matches .
"Yes , now you shall marry our daughter . '"
"` Yes , indeed , ' said the sultan , ` you shall marry our daughter on Monday . '"
And they treated the young man as one of the family .
"The wedding was arranged , and the night before the whole town was illuminated ."
"Biscuits and gingerbreads were thrown among the people , the street boys stood on tiptoe crying hurrahs and whistling through their fingers ."
It was all splendid .
"` Now I must also give them a treat , ' thought the merchant 's son ."
"And so he bought rockets , crackers , and all the kinds of fireworks you can think of , put them in his trunk , and flew up with them into the air ."
"Whirr-r-r , how they fizzed and blazed !"
"`` Let us go around to the Point , '' she said ."
`` Have you matches ?
No ?
"Emily , get some ."
We must light a bonfire at least .
And bring Father 's glass . ''
"`` It is not a fit night for you to be out , '' said Alan anxiously ."
`` You are sheltered here -- you do n't feel it -- but it 's a fearful storm down there . ''
`` I am not afraid of the storm .
It will not hurt me .
Let us hurry .
It is growing dark already . ''
In silence they breasted their way to the shore and around the headland .
"Arriving opposite Philip 's Point , a lull in the sleet permitted them to see the sunken schooner and the clinging figure ."
Lynde waved her hand to him and they saw him wave back .
"`` It wo n't be necessary to light a fire now that he has seen us , '' said Lynde ."
`` Nothing can be done with village help till morning and that man can never cling there so long .
"He will freeze to death , for it is growing colder every minute ."
His only chance is to swim ashore if he can swim .
The danger will be when he comes near shore ; the undertow of the backwater on the quicksand will sweep him away and in his probably exhausted condition he may not be able to make head against it . ''
"`` He knows that , doubtless , and that is why he has n't attempted to swim ashore before this , '' said Alan ."
`` But I 'll meet him in the backwater and drag him in . ''
"`` You -- you 'll risk your own life , '' cried Lynde ."
"`` There is a little risk certainly , but I do n't think there is a great one ."
"Anyhow , the attempt must be made , '' said Alan quietly ."
Suddenly Lynde 's composure forsook her .
She wrung her hands .
"`` I ca n't let you do it , '' she cried wildly ."
`` You might be drowned -- there 's every risk .
You do n't know the force of that backwater .
"Alan , Alan , do n't think of it . ''"
She caught his arm in her white wet hands and looked into his face with passionate pleading .
"And I love you , Eve . ''"
Mollie lowered her eyes and the long fringe of her lashes lay in a burnished semi-circle on her cheek .
"`` I think , '' she said slowly , `` that it must have been very delightful in Eden ."
"But we are not really there , you know -- we are only playing that we are ."
And it is time for me to go back .
I must get the breakfast -- that sounds too prosaic for paradise . ''
Murray bent still closer .
"`` Before we remember that we are only playing at paradise , will you kiss me , dear Eve ? ''"
"`` You are very audacious , '' said Mollie coldly ."
"`` We are in Eden yet , '' he urged ."
`` That makes all the difference . ''
"`` Well , '' said Mollie ."
And Murray kissed her .
They had passed back over the fern path and were in the pasture before either spoke again .
"Then Murray said , `` We have left Eden behind -- but we can always return there when we will ."
"And although we were only playing at paradise , I was not playing at love ."
"I meant all I said , Mollie . ''"
`` Have you meant it often ? ''
asked Mollie significantly .
"`` I never meant it -- or even played at it -- before , '' he answered ."
`` I did -- at one time -- contemplate the possibility of playing at it .
But that was long ago -- as long ago as last night .
"I am glad to the core of my soul that I decided against it before I met you , dear Eve ."
I have the letter of decision in my coat pocket this moment .
I mean to mail it this afternoon . '' ''
"` Curiosity knows no gender , ' '' quoted Mollie ."
"`` Then , to satisfy your curiosity , I must bore you with some personal history ."
"My parents died when I was a little chap , and my uncle brought me up ."
"He has been immensely good to me , but he is a bit of a tyrant ."
Recently he picked out a wife for me -- the daughter of an old sweetheart of his .
I have never even seen her .
But she has arrived in town on a visit to some relatives there .
I am the daughter of a criminal and I am no fit wife for Alan Douglas .
"No , Alan , do n't plead , please ."
I wo n't think differently -- I never can . ''
There was a ring of finality in her tone that struck dismay to Alan 's heart .
"He prepared to entreat and argue , but before he could utter a word , the boughs behind them parted and Captain Anthony stepped down from the bank ."
"`` I 've been listening , '' he announced coolly , `` and I think it high time I took a share in the conversation ."
"You seem to have run up against a snag , Mr. Douglas ."
You say Frank Harmon is dead .
That 's good riddance if it 's true .
Is it true ? ''
`` His brother declares it is . ''
"`` Well , then , I 'll help you all I can ."
"I like you , Mr. Douglas , and I happen to be fond of Lynde , too -- though you may n't believe it ."
I 'm fond of her for her mother 's sake and I 'd like to see her happy .
I did n't want to give her to Harmon that time three years ago but I could n't help myself .
"He had the upper hand , curse him ."
"It was n't for my own sake , though -- it was for my wife 's ."
"However , that 's all over and done with and I 'll do the best I can to atone for it ."
"So you wo n't marry your minister because your father was not a good man , Lynde ?"
"Well , I do n't suppose he was a very good man -- a man who makes his wife 's life a hell , even in a refined way , is n't exactly a saint , to my way of thinking ."
"But that 's the worst that could be said of him and it does n't entail any indelible disgrace on his family , I suppose ."
"I am not your father , Lynde . ''"
`` Not my father ? ''
Lynde echoed the words blankly .
`` No .
Your father was your mother 's first husband .
She never told you of him .
"When I said he made her life a hell , I said the truth , no more , no less ."
"I had loved your mother ever since I was a boy , Lynde ."
But she was far above me in station and I never dreamed it was possible to win her love .
She married James Ashley .
"He was a gentleman , so called -- and he did n't kick or beat her ."
"Here Michael , encouraged by his success , breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected ."
"Nana knew that kind of breathing , and she tried to drag herself out of Liza 's clutches ."
But Liza was dense .
"` No more of it , Nana , ' she said sternly , pulling her out of the room . '"
"I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party , and then , oh , wo n't master whip you , just . '"
"She tied the unhappy dog up again , but do you think Nana ceased to bark ?"
Bring master and missus home from the party !
"Why , that was just what she wanted ."
Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe ?
"Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings , and Nana , seeing that no help would come from her , strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it ."
"In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven , her most expressive way of making a communication ."
"Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery , and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street ."
But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains ; and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes .
We now return to the nursery .
"` It 's all right , ' John announced , emerging from his hiding-place . '"
"I say , Peter , can you really fly ? '"
"Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew round the room , taking the mantelpiece on the way ."
` How topping ! '
said John and Michael .
` How sweet ! '
cried Wendy .
"` Yes , I 'm sweet , oh , I am sweet ! '"
"said Peter , forgetting his manners again ."
"It looked delightfully easy , and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds , but they always went down instead of up . '"
"I say , how do you do it ? '"
"asked John , rubbing his knee ."
He was quite a practical boy .
"` You just think lovely wonderful thoughts , ' Peter explained , ` and they lift you up in the air . '"
He showed them again .
"` You 're so nippy at it , ' John said ; ` could n't you do it very slowly once ? '"
Peter did it both slowly and quickly .
"` I 've got it now , Wendy ! '"
"`` First ship that ever I lost , '' said Captain Smollett ."
"I was dead tired , as you may fancy ; and when I got to sleep , which was not till after a great deal of tossing , I slept like a log of wood ."
The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices .
`` Flag of truce ! ''
"I heard someone say ; and then , immediately after , with a cry of surprise , `` Silver himself ! ''"
"And at that , up I jumped , and rubbing my eyes , ran to a loophole in the wall ."
"20 Silver 's Embassy SURE enough , there were two men just outside the stockade , one of them waving a white cloth , the other , no less a person than Silver himself , standing placidly by ."
"It was still quite early , and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in -- a chill that pierced into the marrow ."
"The sky was bright and cloudless overhead , and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun ."
"But where Silver stood with his lieutenant , all was still in shadow , and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass ."
The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island .
"It was plainly a damp , feverish , unhealthy spot ."
"`` Keep indoors , men , '' said the captain ."
`` Ten to one this is a trick . ''
Then he hailed the buccaneer .
`` Who goes ?
"Stand , or we fire . ''"
"`` Flag of truce , '' cried Silver ."
"The captain was in the porch , keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot , should any be intended ."
"He turned and spoke to us , `` Doctor 's watch on the lookout ."
"Dr. Livesey take the north side , if you please ; Jim , the east ; Gray , west ."
"The watch below , all hands to load muskets ."
"Lively , men , and careful . ''"
And then he turned again to the mutineers .
`` And what do you want with your flag of truce ? ''
he cried .
This time it was the other man who replied .
"`` Cap'n Silver , sir , to come on board and make terms , '' he shouted ."
`` Cap'n Silver !
Do n't know him .
Who 's he ? ''
cried the captain .
There was some strange passion in her voice that Alan did not quite understand -- a bitterness and a revolt which he took to be against the circumstances that hedged her in .
`` Is not some other life possible for you if your present life does not content you ? ''
he said gently .
"`` But it does content me , '' said Lynde imperiously ."
"`` I want no other -- I wish this life to go on forever -- forever , do you understand ?"
"If I were sure that it would -- if I were sure that no change would ever come to me , I would be perfectly content ."
It is the fear that a change will come that makes me wretched .
Oh ! ''
She shuddered and put her hands over her eyes .
Alan thought she must mean that when her father died she would be alone in the world .
He wanted to comfort her -- reassure her -- but he did not know how .
"One evening when he went to Four Winds he found the door open and , seeing the Captain in the living room , he stepped in unannounced ."
"Captain Anthony was sitting by the table , his head in his hands ; at Alan 's entrance he turned upon him a haggard face , blackened by a furious scowl beneath which blazed eyes full of malevolence ."
`` What do you want here ? ''
"he said , following up the demand with a string of vile oaths ."
"Before Alan could summon his scattered wits , Lynde glided in with a white , appealing face ."
"Wordlessly she grasped Alan 's arm , drew him out , and shut the door ."
"`` Oh , I 've been watching for you , '' she said breathlessly ."
`` I was afraid you might come tonight -- but I missed you . ''
`` But your father ? ''
said Alan in amazement .
`` How have I angered him ? ''
`` Hush .
Come into the garden .
I will explain there . ''
He followed her into the little enclosure where the red and white roses were now in full blow .
"`` Father is n't angry with you , '' said Lynde in a low shamed voice ."
`` It 's just -- he takes strange moods sometimes .
Then he seems to hate us all -- even me -- and he is like that for days .
He seems to suspect and dread everybody as if they were plotting against him .
You -- perhaps you think he has been drinking ?
"No , that is not the trouble ."
"Sailors do n't always use the choicest language , and parrots are very imitative birds . ''"
"`` So I should think , '' said poor Anne , the remembrance of her errand quelling her resentment ."
"She could n't afford to snub Mr. Harrison under the circumstances , that was certain ."
"When you had just sold a man 's Jersey cow offhand , without his knowledge or consent you must not mind if his parrot repeated uncomplimentary things ."
"Nevertheless , the `` redheaded snippet '' was not quite so meek as she might otherwise have been ."
"`` I 've come to confess something to you , Mr. Harrison , '' she said resolutely ."
`` It 's ... it 's about ... that Jersey cow . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison nervously , `` has she gone and broken into my oats again ?"
"Well , never mind ... never mind if she has ."
"It 's no difference ... none at all , I ... I was too hasty yesterday , that 's a fact ."
Never mind if she has . ''
"`` Oh , if it were only that , '' sighed Anne ."
`` But it 's ten times worse .
"I do n't ... '' `` Bless my soul , do you mean to say she 's got into my wheat ? ''"
`` No ... no ... not the wheat .
But ... '' `` Then it 's the cabbages !
"She 's broken into my cabbages that I was raising for Exhibition , hey ? ''"
"`` It 's NOT the cabbages , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'll tell you everything ... that is what I came for -- but please do n't interrupt me .
It makes me so nervous .
"Just let me tell my story and do n't say anything till I get through -- and then no doubt you 'll say plenty , '' Anne concluded , but in thought only ."
"`` I wo n't say another word , '' said Mr. Harrison , and he did n't ."
"But Ginger was not bound by any contract of silence and kept ejaculating , `` Redheaded snippet '' at intervals until Anne felt quite wild ."
`` I shut my Jersey cow up in our pen yesterday .
This morning I went to Carmody and when I came back I saw a Jersey cow in your oats .
Diana and I chased her out and you ca n't imagine what a hard time we had .
I was so dreadfully wet and tired and vexed -- and Mr. Shearer came by that very minute and offered to buy the cow .
I sold her to him on the spot for twenty dollars .
It was wrong of me .
"I should have waited and consulted Marilla , of course ."
But I 'm dreadfully given to doing things without thinking -- everybody who knows me will tell you that .
Mr. Shearer took the cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train . ''
He shall down .
Mum ! ''
And he bent over his oars .
"They pulled a long way up the river , turned the tail of an island , and came softly down a narrow channel next the opposite bank ."
Then Hugh held water in midstream .
"`` I must land you here among the willows , '' he said ."
"`` Here is no path but willow swamps and quagmires , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Master Shelton , '' replied Hugh , `` I dare not take ye nearer down , for your own sake now ."
"He watcheth me the ferry , lying on his bow ."
"All that go by and owe Sir Daniel goodwill , he shooteth down like rabbits ."
I heard him swear it by the rood .
"An I had not known you of old days -- ay , and from so high upward -- I would ` a ' let you go on ; but for old days ' remembrance , and because ye had this toy with you that 's not fit for wounds or warfare , I did risk my two poor ears to have you over whole ."
"Content you ; I can no more , on my salvation ! ''"
"Hugh was still speaking , lying on his oars , when there came a great shout from among the willows on the island , and sounds followed as of a strong man breasting roughly through the wood ."
`` A murrain ! ''
cried Hugh .
`` He was on the upper island all the while ! ''
He pulled straight for shore .
"`` Threat me with your bow , good Dick ; threat me with it plain , '' he added ."
"`` I have tried to save your skins , save you mine ! ''"
The boat ran into a tough thicket of willows with a crash .
"Matcham , pale , but steady and alert , at a sign from Dick , ran along the thwarts and leaped ashore ; Dick , taking the horse by the bridle , sought to follow , but what with the animal 's bulk , and what with the closeness of the thicket , both stuck fast ."
"The horse neighed and trampled ; and the boat , which was swinging in an eddy , came on and off and pitched with violence ."
"`` It may not be , Hugh ; here is no landing , '' cried Dick ; but he still struggled valiantly with the obstinate thicket and the startled animal ."
"A tall man appeared upon the shore of the island , a long-bow in his hand ."
"Dick saw him for an instant , with the corner of his eye , bending the bow with a great effort , his face crimson with hurry ."
`` Who goes ? ''
he shouted .
"`` Hugh , who goes ? '' ''"
"'T is Master Shelton , John , '' replied the ferryman ."
"`` Stand , Dick Shelton ! ''"
bawled the man upon the island .
"`` Why , what can you do ? ''"
asked Madge forlornly .
Miss Susan squared her shoulders and looked amused .
`` You 'll see .
I know old John Ellis better than he knows himself .
He is the most contrary man the Lord ever made .
I went to school with him .
"I learned how to manage him then , and I have n't forgotten how ."
I 'm going straight up to interview him . ''
`` Are you sure that will do any good ? ''
said Madge doubtfully .
"`` If you go to him and take Burton 's and my part , wo n't it only make him worse ? ''"
"`` Madge , dear , '' said Miss Susan , busily twisting her scanty , iron-grey hair up into a hard little knob at the back of her head before Madge 's glass , `` you just wait ."
"I 'm not young , and I 'm not pretty , and I 'm not in love , but I 've more gumption than you and Burton have or ever will have ."
You keep your eyes open and see if you can learn something .
You 'll need it if you go up to live with old John Ellis . ''
"Burton had returned to the turnip field , but old John Ellis was taking his ease with a rampant political newspaper on the cool verandah of his house ."
"Looking up from a bitter editorial to chuckle over a cutting sarcasm contained therein , he saw a tall , angular figure coming up the lane with aggressiveness written large in every fold and flutter of shawl and skirt ."
"`` Old Susan Oliver , as sure as a gun , '' said old John with another chuckle ."
`` She looks mad clean through .
I suppose she 's coming here to blow me up for refusing to let Burton take that girl of hers .
"She 's been angling and scheming for it for years , but she will find who she has to deal with ."
"Come on , Miss Susan . ''"
John Ellis laid down his paper and stood up with a sarcastic smile .
Miss Susan reached the steps and skimmed undauntedly up them .
She did indeed look angry and disturbed .
Without any preliminary greeting she burst out into a tirade that simply took away her complacent foe 's breath .
"`` Look here , John Ellis , I want to know what this means ."
"I 've discovered that that young upstart of a son of yours , who ought to be in short trousers yet , has been courting my niece , Madge Oliver , all summer ."
He has had the impudence to tell me that he wants to marry her .
"I wo n't have it , I tell you , and you can tell your son so ."
Marry my niece indeed !
`` And then Susan gave up .
` We can not save him !
"Oh , if your father was here -- look at him , the poor little fellow !"
I know not what to do . '
`` I looked at Jims and I thought he was dying .
"Susan was holding him up in his crib to give him a better chance for breath , but it did n't seem as if he could breathe at all ."
"My little war-baby , with his dear ways and sweet roguish face , was choking to death before my very eyes , and I could n't help him ."
I threw down the hot poultice I had ready in despair .
Of what use was it ?
"Jims was dying , and it was my fault -- I had n't been careful enough !"
`` Just then -- at eleven o'clock at night -- the door bell rang .
Such a ring -- it pealed all over the house above the roar of the storm .
Susan could n't go -- she dared not lay Jims down -- so I rushed downstairs .
In the hall I paused just a minute -- I was suddenly overcome by an absurd dread .
I thought of a weird story Gertrude had told me once .
An aunt of hers was alone in a house one night with her sick husband .
She heard a knock at the door .
"And when she went and opened it there was nothing there -- nothing that could be seen , at least ."
"But when she opened the door a deadly cold wind blew in and seemed to sweep past her right up the stairs , although it was a calm , warm summer night outside ."
Immediately she heard a cry .
She ran upstairs -- and her husband was dead .
"And she always believed , so Gertrude said , that when she opened that door she let Death in ."
`` It was so ridiculous of me to feel so frightened .
"But I was distracted and worn out , and I simply felt for a moment that I dared not open the door -- that death was waiting outside ."
Then I remembered that I had no time to waste -- must not be so foolish -- I sprang forward and opened the door .
`` Certainly a cold wind did blow in and filled the hall with a whirl of snow .
"But there on the threshold stood a form of flesh and blood -- Mary Vance , coated from head to foot with snow -- and she brought Life , not Death , with her , though I did n't know that then ."
I just stared at her . '' '
"I have n't been turned out , ' grinned Mary , as she stepped in and shut the door . '"
I came up to Carter Flagg 's two days ago and I 've been stormed-stayed there ever since .
"But old Abbie Flagg got on my nerves at last , and tonight I just made up my mind to come up here ."
"I thought I could wade this far , but I can tell you it was as much as a bargain ."
`` A bell ! ''
"said Dick , sitting up ."
"`` Can we be , then , so near to Holywood ? ''"
"A little after , the bell clanged again , but this time somewhat nearer hand ; and from that time forth , and still drawing nearer and nearer , it continued to sound brokenly abroad in the silence of the morning ."
"`` Nay , what should this betoken ? ''"
"said Dick , who was now broad awake ."
"`` It is some one walking , '' returned Matcham , and `` the bell tolleth ever as he moves . ''"
"`` I see that well , '' said Dick ."
`` But wherefore ?
What maketh he in Tunstall Woods ?
"Jack , '' he added , `` laugh at me an ye will , but I like not the hollow sound of it . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , with a shiver , `` it hath a doleful note ."
"An the day were not come '' -- But just then the bell , quickening its pace , began to ring thick and hurried , and then it gave a single hammering jangle , and was silent for a space ."
"`` It is as though the bearer had run for a pater-noster while , and then leaped the river , '' Dick observed ."
"`` And now beginneth he again to pace soberly forward , '' added Matcham ."
"`` Nay , '' returned Dick -- `` nay , not so soberly , Jack ."
'T is a man that walketh you right speedily .
"'T is a man in some fear of his life , or about some hurried business ."
See ye not how swift the beating draweth near ? ''
"`` It is now close by , '' said Matcham ."
"They were now on the edge of the pit ; and as the pit itself was on a certain eminence , they commanded a view over the greater proportion of the clearing , up to the thick woods that closed it in ."
"The daylight , which was very clear and grey , showed them a riband of white footpath wandering among the gorse ."
"It passed some hundred yards from the pit , and ran the whole length of the clearing , east and west ."
"By the line of its course , Dick judged it should lead more or less directly to the Moat House ."
"Upon this path , stepping forth from the margin of the wood , a white figure now appeared ."
"It paused a little , and seemed to look about ; and then , at a slow pace , and bent almost double , it began to draw near across the heath ."
At every step the bell clanked .
"Face , it had none ; a white hood , not even pierced with eye-holes , veiled the head ; and as the creature moved , it seemed to feel its way with the tapping of a stick ."
"Fear fell upon the lads , as cold as death ."
`` A leper ! ''
"said Dick , hoarsely ."
"`` His touch is death , '' said Matcham ."
"said I. `` Your money too , '' says Alan , with a groan ."
`` Ye shouldnae have given it me .
I 'm daft when I get to the cartes . ''
`` Hoot-toot !
hoot-toot ! ''
said Cluny .
`` It was all daffing ; it 's all nonsense .
"Of course you 'll have your money back again , and the double of it , if ye 'll make so free with me ."
It would be a singular thing for me to keep it .
It 's not to be supposed that I would be any hindrance to gentlemen in your situation ; that would be a singular thing ! ''
"cries he , and began to pull gold out of his pocket with a mighty red face ."
"Alan said nothing , only looked on the ground ."
"`` Will you step to the door with me , sir ? ''"
"said I. Cluny said he would be very glad , and followed me readily enough , but he looked flustered and put out ."
"`` And now , sir , '' says I , `` I must first acknowledge your generosity . ''"
`` Nonsensical nonsense ! ''
cries Cluny .
`` Where 's the generosity ?
"This is just a most unfortunate affair ; but what would ye have me do -- boxed up in this bee-skep of a cage of mine -- but just set my friends to the cartes , when I can get them ?"
"And if they lose , of course , it 's not to be supposed -- '' And here he came to a pause ."
"`` Yes , '' said I , `` if they lose , you give them back their money ; and if they win , they carry away yours in their pouches !"
"I have said before that I grant your generosity ; but to me , sir , it 's a very painful thing to be placed in this position . ''"
"There was a little silence , in which Cluny seemed always as if he was about to speak , but said nothing ."
All the time he grew redder and redder in the face .
"`` I am a young man , '' said I , `` and I ask your advice ."
Advise me as you would your son .
"My friend fairly lost his money , after having fairly gained a far greater sum of yours ; can I accept it back again ?"
Would that be the right part for me to play ?
"Whatever I do , you can see for yourself it must be hard upon a man of any pride . ''"
"`` It 's rather hard on me , too , Mr. Balfour , '' said Cluny , `` and ye give me very much the look of a man that has entrapped poor people to their hurt ."
"I wouldnae have my friends come to any house of mine to accept affronts ; no , '' he cried , with a sudden heat of anger , `` nor yet to give them ! ''"
"`` And so you see , sir , '' said I , `` there is something to be said upon my side ; and this gambling is a very poor employ for gentlefolks ."
"`` Redheaded snippet , '' quoted Ginger in a tone of profound contempt ."
"At this point Mr. Harrison arose and , with an expression that would have struck terror into any bird but a parrot , carried Ginger 's cage into an adjoining room and shut the door ."
"Ginger shrieked , swore , and otherwise conducted himself in keeping with his reputation , but finding himself left alone , relapsed into sulky silence ."
"`` Excuse me and go on , '' said Mr. Harrison , sitting down again ."
`` My brother the sailor never taught that bird any manners . ''
`` I went home and after tea I went out to the milking pen .
"Mr. Harrison , '' ... Anne leaned forward , clasping her hands with her old childish gesture , while her big gray eyes gazed imploringly into Mr. Harrison 's embarrassed face ... `` I found my cow still shut up in the pen ."
It was YOUR cow I had sold to Mr. Shearer . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison , in blank amazement at this unlooked-for conclusion ."
`` What a VERY extraordinary thing ! ''
"`` Oh , it is n't in the least extraordinary that I should be getting myself and other people into scrapes , '' said Anne mournfully ."
`` I 'm noted for that .
You might suppose I 'd have grown out of it by this time ... I 'll be seventeen next March ... but it seems that I have n't .
"Mr. Harrison , is it too much to hope that you 'll forgive me ?"
"I 'm afraid it 's too late to get your cow back , but here is the money for her ... or you can have mine in exchange if you 'd rather ."
She 's a very good cow .
And I ca n't express how sorry I am for it all . ''
"`` Tut , tut , '' said Mr. Harrison briskly , `` do n't say another word about it , miss ."
It 's of no consequence ... no consequence whatever .
Accidents will happen .
"I 'm too hasty myself sometimes , miss ... far too hasty ."
But I ca n't help speaking out just what I think and folks must take me as they find me .
"If that cow had been in my cabbages now ... but never mind , she was n't , so it 's all right ."
"I think I 'd rather have your cow in exchange , since you want to be rid of her . ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'm so glad you are not vexed .
I was afraid you would be . ''
"`` And I suppose you were scared to death to come here and tell me , after the fuss I made yesterday , hey ?"
"But you must n't mind me , I 'm a terrible outspoken old fellow , that 's all ... awful apt to tell the truth , no matter if it is a bit plain . ''"
"`` So is Mrs. Lynde , '' said Anne , before she could prevent herself ."
`` Who ?
Mrs. Lynde ?
"When a mate brings a slip on his cable -- one as knows me , I mean -- it wo n't be in the same world with old John ."
"There was some that was feared of Pew , and some that was feared of Flint ; but Flint his own self was feared of me ."
"Feared he was , and proud ."
"They was the roughest crew afloat , was Flint 's ; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them ."
"Well now , I tell you , I 'm not a boasting man , and you seen yourself how easy I keep company , but when I was quartermaster , LAMBS was n't the word for Flint 's old buccaneers ."
"Ah , you may be sure of yourself in old John 's ship . ''"
"`` Well , I tell you now , '' replied the lad , `` I did n't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you , John ; but there 's my hand on it now . ''"
"`` And a brave lad you were , and smart too , '' answered Silver , shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook , `` and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on . ''"
By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms .
"By a `` gentleman of fortune '' they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate , and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands -- perhaps of the last one left aboard ."
"But on this point I was soon to be relieved , for Silver giving a little whistle , a third man strolled up and sat down by the party ."
"`` Dick 's square , '' said Silver ."
"`` Oh , I know 'd Dick was square , '' returned the voice of the coxswain , Israel Hands ."
"`` He 's no fool , is Dick . ''"
And he turned his quid and spat .
"`` But look here , '' he went on , `` here 's what I want to know , Barbecue : how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat ?"
"I 've had a ` most enough o ' Cap'n Smollett ; he 's hazed me long enough , by thunder !"
"I want to go into that cabin , I do ."
"I want their pickles and wines , and that . ''"
"`` Israel , '' said Silver , `` your head ai n't much account , nor ever was ."
"But you 're able to hear , I reckon ; leastways , your ears is big enough ."
"Now , here 's what I say : you 'll berth forward , and you 'll live hard , and you 'll speak soft , and you 'll keep sober till I give the word ; and you may lay to that , my son . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't say no , do I ? ''"
growled the coxswain .
"`` What I say is , when ?"
That 's what I say . ''
`` When !
By the powers ! ''
cried Silver .
"`` Well now , if you want to know , I 'll tell you when ."
"The last moment I can manage , and that 's when ."
"Here 's a first-rate seaman , Cap'n Smollett , sails the blessed ship for us ."
"To put it with brutal frankness , there never was a cockier boy ."
But for the moment Wendy was shocked .
"` You conceit , ' she exclaimed , with frightful sarcasm ; ` of course I did nothing ! '"
"` You did a little , ' Peter said carelessly , and continued to dance . '"
A little ! '
she replied with hauteur ; ` if I am no use I can at least withdraw ' ; and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets .
"To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away , and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot ."
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` do n't withdraw ."
"I ca n't help crowing , Wendy , when I 'm pleased with myself . '"
"Still she would not look up , though she was listening eagerly ."
"` Wendy , ' he continued , in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist , ` Wendy , one girl is more use than twenty boys . '"
"Now Wendy was every inch a woman , though there were not very many inches , and she peeped out of the bedclothes ."
"` Do you really think so , Peter ? '"
"` Yes , I do . ' '"
"I think it 's perfectly sweet of you , ' she declared , ` and I 'll get up again ' ; and she sat with him on the side of the bed ."
"She also said she would give him a kiss if he liked , but Peter did not know what she meant , and he held out his hand expectantly ."
` Surely you know what a kiss is ? '
"she asked , aghast . '"
"I shall know when you give it to me , ' he replied stiffly ; and not to hurt his feelings she gave him a thimble ."
"` Now , ' said he , ` shall I give you a kiss ? '"
"and she replied with a slight primness , ` If you please . '"
"She made herself rather cheap by inclining her face toward him , but he merely dropped an acorn button into her hand ; so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before , and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain round her neck ."
"It was lucky that she did put it on that chain , for it was afterwards to save her life ."
"When people in our set are introduced , it is customary for them to ask each other 's age , and so Wendy , who always liked to do the correct thing , asked Peter how old he was ."
"It was not really a happy question to ask him ; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar , when what you want to be asked is Kings of England . '"
"I do n't know , ' he replied uneasily , ` but I am quite young . '"
"He really knew nothing about it ; he had merely suspicions , but he said at a venture , ` Wendy , I ran away the day I was born . '"
"Wendy was quite surprised , but interested ; and she indicated in the charming drawing-room manner , by a touch on her night-gown , that he could sit nearer her ."
"` It was because I heard father and mother , ' he explained in a low voice , ` talking about what I was to be when I became a man . '"
He was extraordinarily agitated now . '
"I do n't want ever to be a man , ' he said with passion . '"
I want always to be a little boy and to have fun .
"`` Whoever it was had better tell , and not wait to be found out , '' said Demi , looking as if an awful misfortune had befallen the family ."
"`` I know you think it 's me , '' broke out Nat , red and excited ."
"`` You are the only one who knew where it was , '' said Franz ."
`` I ca n't help it I did n't take it .
I tell you I did n't I did n't ! ''
"cried Nat , in a desperate sort of way ."
"`` Gently , gently , my son !"
What is all this noise about ? ''
and Mr. Bhaer walked in among them .
"Tommy repeated the story of his loss , and , as he listened , Mr. Bhaer 's face grew graver and graver ; for , with all their faults and follies , the lads till now had been honest ."
"`` Take your seats , '' he said ; and , when all were in their places , he added slowly , as his eye went from face to face with a grieved look , that was harder to bear than a storm of words , `` Now , boys , I shall ask each one of you a single question , and I want an honest answer ."
"I am not going to try to frighten , bribe , or surprise the truth out of you , for every one of you have got a conscience , and know what it is for ."
"Now is the time to undo the wrong done to Tommy , and set yourselves right before us all ."
I can forgive the yielding to sudden temptation much easier than I can deceit .
"Do n't add a lie to the theft , but confess frankly , and we will all try to help you make us forget and forgive . ''"
"He paused a moment , and one might have heard a pin drop , the room was so still ; then slowly and impressively he put the question to each one , receiving the same answer in varying tones from all ."
There is really nothing at all but scenery . ''
"`` Out of your world perhaps , Susan -- but not out of mine , '' said Anne with a faint smile ."
"`` I do not quite understand you , Mrs. Doctor , dear , but of course I am not well educated ."
"But if Dr. Blythe buys the Morgan place he will make no mistake , and that you may tie to ."
"They have water in it , and the pantries and closets are beautiful , and there is not another such cellar in P. E. Island , so I have been told ."
"Why , the cellar here , Mrs. Doctor , dear , has been a heart-break to me , as well you know . ''"
"`` Oh , go away , Susan , go away , '' said Anne forlornly ."
`` Cellars and pantries and closets do n't make a HOME .
Why do n't you weep with those who weep ? ''
"`` Well , I never was much hand for weeping , Mrs. Doctor , dear ."
I would rather fall to and cheer people up than weep with them .
"Now , do not you cry and spoil your pretty eyes ."
"This house is very well and has served your turn , but it is high time you had a better . ''"
Susan 's point of view seemed to be that of most people .
Leslie was the only one who sympathised understandingly with Anne .
"She had a good cry , too , when she heard the news ."
She always looks as if she 'd just been starched and ironed .
"Well , poor Marilla is going to have her hands full this winter and no mistake ."
"Still , I do n't see that she could do anything less than take them , under the circumstances , and she 'll have Anne to help her ."
"Anne 's tickled to death over the whole business , and she has a real knacky way with children , I must say ."
"Dear me , it does n't seem a day since poor Matthew brought Anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of Marilla bringing up a child ."
And now she has adopted twins .
You 're never safe from being surprised till you 're dead . ''
The fat pony jogged over the bridge in Lynde 's Hollow and along the Green Gables lane .
Marilla 's face was rather grim .
It was ten miles from East Grafton and Davy Keith seemed to be possessed with a passion for perpetual motion .
"It was beyond Marilla 's power to make him sit still and she had been in an agony the whole way lest he fall over the back of the wagon and break his neck , or tumble over the dashboard under the pony 's heels ."
In despair she finally threatened to whip him soundly when she got him home .
"Whereupon Davy climbed into her lap , regardless of the reins , flung his chubby arms about her neck and gave her a bear-like hug ."
"`` I do n't believe you mean it , '' he said , smacking her wrinkled cheek affectionately ."
`` You do n't LOOK like a lady who 'd whip a little boy just 'cause he could n't keep still .
Did n't you find it awful hard to keep still when you was only 's old as me ? ''
"`` No , I always kept still when I was told , '' said Marilla , trying to speak sternly , albeit she felt her heart waxing soft within her under Davy 's impulsive caresses ."
"`` Well , I s ` pose that was 'cause you was a girl , '' said Davy , squirming back to his place after another hug ."
"`` You WAS a girl once , I s ` pose , though it 's awful funny to think of it ."
Dora can sit still ... but there ai n't much fun in it I do n't think .
Seems to me it must be slow to be a girl .
"Here , Dora , let me liven you up a bit . ''"
Davy 's method of `` livening up '' was to grasp Dora 's curls in his fingers and give them a tug .
Dora shrieked and then cried .
`` How can you be such a naughty boy and your poor mother just laid in her grave this very day ? ''
demanded Marilla despairingly .
"`` But she was glad to die , '' said Davy confidentially ."
"`` I know , 'cause she told me so ."
She was awful tired of being sick .
We 'd a long talk the night before she died .
She told me you was going to take me and Dora for the winter and I was to be a good boy .
"I 'm going to be good , but ca n't you be good running round just as well as sitting still ?"
`` Course I do .
But you ca n't be a gemplum till you grow up . ''
"`` Oh , indeed you can , '' Anne hastened to say , thinking she saw a chance to sow good seed betimes ."
`` You can begin to be a gentleman when you are a little boy .
And gentlemen NEVER snatch things from ladies ... or forget to say thank you ... or pull anybody 's hair . ''
"`` They do n't have much fun , that 's a fact , '' said Davy frankly ."
`` I guess I 'll wait till I 'm grown up to be one . ''
"Marilla , with a resigned air , had cut another piece of cake for Dora ."
She did not feel able to cope with Davy just then .
"It had been a hard day for her , what with the funeral and the long drive ."
At that moment she looked forward to the future with a pessimism that would have done credit to Eliza Andrews herself .
"The twins were not noticeably alike , although both were fair ."
Dora had long sleek curls that never got out of order .
Davy had a crop of fuzzy little yellow ringlets all over his round head .
Dora 's hazel eyes were gentle and mild ; Davy 's were as roguish and dancing as an elf 's .
"Dora 's nose was straight , Davy 's a positive snub ; Dora had a `` prunes and prisms '' mouth , Davy 's was all smiles ; and besides , he had a dimple in one cheek and none in the other , which gave him a dear , comical , lopsided look when he laughed ."
Mirth and mischief lurked in every corner of his little face .
"`` They 'd better go to bed , '' said Marilla , who thought it was the easiest way to dispose of them ."
`` Dora will sleep with me and you can put Davy in the west gable .
"You 're not afraid to sleep alone , are you , Davy ? ''"
"`` No ; but I ai n't going to bed for ever so long yet , '' said Davy comfortably ."
"`` Oh , yes , you are . ''"
"That was all the much-tried Marilla said , but something in her tone squelched even Davy ."
He trotted obediently upstairs with Anne .
"`` When I 'm grown up the very first thing I 'm going to do is stay up ALL night just to see what it would be like , '' he told her confidentially ."
In after years Marilla never thought of that first week of the twins ' sojourn at Green Gables without a shiver .
Not that it really was so much worse than the weeks that followed it ; but it seemed so by reason of its novelty .
"There was seldom a waking minute of any day when Davy was not in mischief or devising it ; but his first notable exploit occurred two days after his arrival , on Sunday morning ... a fine , warm day , as hazy and mild as September ."
Anne dressed him for church while Marilla attended to Dora .
Davy at first objected strongly to having his face washed .
`` Marilla washed it yesterday ... and Mrs. Wiggins scoured me with hard soap the day of the funeral .
That 's enough for one week .
`` I 'm going straight to Lorenzo White 's . ''
"`` But he lives on the White Sands road and it 's quite a distance out of our way , '' protested Diana ."
`` Gilbert and Fred will canvass him . ''
"`` They are not going around until next Saturday and it will be too late by then , '' said Anne firmly ."
`` The novelty will be worn off .
Lorenzo White is dreadfully mean but he will subscribe to ANYTHING just now .
"We must n't let such a golden opportunity slip , Diana . ''"
The result justified Anne 's foresight .
"Mr. White met them in the yard , beaming like the sun upon an Easter day ."
When Anne asked for a subscription he agreed enthusiastically .
"`` Certain , certain ."
Just put me down for a dollar more than the highest subscription you 've got . ''
"`` That will be five dollars ... Mr. Daniel Blair put down four , '' said Anne , half afraid ."
But Lorenzo did not flinch .
`` Five it is ... and here 's the money on the spot .
"Now , I want you to come into the house ."
There 's something in there worth seeing ... something very few people have seen as yet .
Just come in and pass YOUR opinion . ''
`` What will we say if the baby is n't pretty ? ''
whispered Diana in trepidation as they followed the excited Lorenzo into the house .
"`` Oh , there will certainly be something else nice to say about it , '' said Anne easily ."
`` There always is about a baby . ''
"The baby WAS pretty , however , and Mr. White felt that he got his five dollars ' worth of the girls ' honest delight over the plump little newcomer ."
"But that was the first , last , and only time that Lorenzo White ever subscribed to anything ."
"Anne , tired as she was , made one more effort for the public weal that night , slipping over the fields to interview Mr. Harrison , who was as usual smoking his pipe on the veranda with Ginger beside him ."
"Strickly speaking he was on the Carmody road ; but Jane and Gertie , who were not acquainted with him save by doubtful report , had nervously begged Anne to canvass him ."
"Mr. Harrison , however , flatly refused to subscribe a cent , and all Anne 's wiles were in vain ."
"`` But I thought you approved of our society , Mr. Harrison , '' she mourned ."
"`` So I do ... so I do ... but my approval does n't go as deep as my pocket , Anne . ''"
"`` A few more experiences such as I have had today would make me as much of a pessimist as Miss Eliza Andrews , '' Anne told her reflection in the east gable mirror at bedtime ."
VII The Pointing of Duty Anne leaned back in her chair one mild October evening and sighed .
"She was sitting at a table covered with text books and exercises , but the closely written sheets of paper before her had no apparent connection with studies or school work ."
"When she reached the yard at Green Gables Mrs. Lynde 's loud , decided tones floated out through the open kitchen window ."
"`` Mrs. Lynde has come up to give me good advice about tomorrow , '' thought Anne with a grimace , `` but I do n't believe I 'll go in ."
"Her advice is much like pepper , I think ... excellent in small quantities but rather scorching in her doses ."
I 'll run over and have a chat with Mr. Harrison instead . ''
This was not the first time Anne had run over and chatted with Mr. Harrison since the notable affair of the Jersey cow .
"She had been there several evenings and Mr. Harrison and she were very good friends , although there were times and seasons when Anne found the outspokenness on which he prided himself rather trying ."
"Ginger still continued to regard her with suspicion , and never failed to greet her sarcastically as `` redheaded snippet . ''"
"Mr. Harrison had tried vainly to break him of the habit by jumping excitedly up whenever he saw Anne coming and exclaiming , `` Bless my soul , here 's that pretty little girl again , '' or something equally flattering ."
But Ginger saw through the scheme and scorned it .
Anne was never to know how many compliments Mr. Harrison paid her behind her back .
He certainly never paid her any to her face .
"`` Well , I suppose you 've been back in the woods laying in a supply of switches for tomorrow ? ''"
was his greeting as Anne came up the veranda steps .
"`` No , indeed , '' said Anne indignantly ."
She was an excellent target for teasing because she always took things so seriously .
"`` I shall never have a switch in my school , Mr. Harrison ."
"Of course , I shall have to have a pointer , but I shall use it for pointing ONLY . ''"
`` So you mean to strap them instead ?
"Well , I do n't know but you 're right ."
"A switch stings more at the time but the strap smarts longer , that 's a fact . ''"
`` I shall not use anything of the sort .
I 'm not going to whip my pupils . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison in genuine astonishment , `` how do you lay out to keep order then ? ''"
"`` I shall govern by affection , Mr. Harrison . ''"
"`` It wo n't do , '' said Mr. Harrison , `` wo n't do at all , Anne ."
` Spare the rod and spoil the child . '
When I went to school the master whipped me regular every day because he said if I was n't in mischief just then I was plotting it . ''
"`` Methods have changed since your schooldays , Mr. Harrison . ''"
`` But human nature has n't .
"Mark my words , you 'll never manage the young fry unless you keep a rod in pickle for them ."
The thing is impossible . ''
"`` Well , I 'm going to try my way first , '' said Anne , who had a fairly strong will of her own and was apt to cling very tenaciously to her theories ."
That pie was a strong argument for Isaac .
I thought a man who had to live on such cookery did indeed need a wife and might be pardoned for taking desperate measures to get one .
I was dreadfully tired of broiling on the roof anyhow .
But it was the thunderstorm that decided me .
"When I saw it coming up , black and quick , from the northwest , I gave in at once ."
I had endured a good deal and was prepared to endure more ; but I had paid ten dollars for my hat and I was not going to have it ruined by a thunderstorm .
I called to Isaac and out he came .
"`` If you will let us down and promise to dispose of that dog before I come here I will marry you , Isaac , '' I said , `` but I 'll make you sorry for it afterwards , though . ''"
"`` I 'll take the risk of that , Anne , '' he said ; `` and , of course , I 'll sell the dog ."
I wo n't need him when I have you . ''
"Isaac meant to be complimentary , though you might n't have thought so if you had seen the face of that dog ."
"Isaac ordered Julius Caesar away and put up the ladder , and turned his back , real considerately , while we climbed down ."
We had to go in his house and stay till the shower was over .
I did n't forget the object of our call and I produced our subscription list at once .
`` How much have you got ? ''
asked Isaac .
"`` Seventy dollars and we want a hundred and fifty , '' I said ."
"`` You may put me down for the remaining eighty , then , '' said Isaac calmly ."
"The Applebys are never mean where money is concerned , I must say ."
"Isaac offered to drive us home when it cleared up , but I said `` No . ''"
I wanted to settle Melissa before she got a chance to talk .
"On the way home I said to her : `` I hope you wo n't mention this to anyone , Melissa ."
"I do n't mind marrying Isaac , but I do n't want people to know how it came about . ''"
"`` Oh , I wo n't say anything about it , '' said Melissa , laughing a little disagreeably ."
"`` Because , '' I said , to clinch the matter , looking significantly at her front hair as I said it , `` I have something to tell , too . ''"
Melissa will hold her tongue .
"By the Rule of Contrary `` Look here , Burton , '' said old John Ellis in an ominous tone of voice , `` I want to know if what that old busybody of a Mary Keane came here today gossiping about is true ."
"If it is -- well , I 've something to say about the matter !"
Have you been courting that niece of Susan Oliver 's all summer on the sly ? ''
"Burton Ellis 's handsome , boyish face flushed darkly crimson to the roots of his curly black hair ."
Something in the father 's tone roused anger and rebellion in the son .
"He straightened himself up from the turnip row he was hoeing , looked his father squarely in the face , and said quietly , `` Not on the sly , sir , I never do things that way ."
He was so bright and nice-mannered everybody liked him .
"Him and Anne were a fine-looking couple , Nora May ."
Not but what they had their shortcomings .
Anne 's nose was a mite too long and Gil had a crooked mouth .
"Besides , they was both pretty proud and sperrited and high-strung ."
But they thought an awful lot of each other .
It made me feel young again to see 'em .
"Anne was n't a mossel vain , but nights she expected Gil she 'd prink for hours afore her glass , fixing her hair this way and that , and trying on all her good clothes to see which become her most ."
I used to love her for it .
And I used to love to see the way Gil 's face would light up when she came into a room or place where he was .
"Amanda Perkins , she says to me once , `` Anne Douglas and Gil Martin are most terrible struck on each other . ''"
And she said it in a tone that indicated that it was a dreadful disgraceful and unbecoming state of affairs .
Amanda had a disappointment once and it soured her .
"I immediately responded , `` Yes , they are most terrible struck on each other , '' and I said it in a tone that indicated I thought it a most beautiful and lovely thing that they should be so ."
And so it was .
"You 're rather too young to be thinking of such things , Nora May , but you 'll remember my words when the time comes ."
"Another nephew of mine , James Ebenezer Lawson -- he calls himself James E. back there in town , and I do n't blame him , for I never could stand Ebenezer for a name myself ; but that 's neither here nor there ."
"Well , he said their love was idyllic , I ai n't very sure what that means ."
I looked it up in the dictionary after James Ebenezer left -- I would n't display my ignorance afore him -- but I ca n't say that I was much the wiser for it .
"Anyway , it meant something real nice ; I was sure of that by the way James Ebenezer spoke and the wistful look in his eyes ."
"James Ebenezer is n't married ; he was to have been , and she died a month afore the wedding day ."
He was never the same man again .
"Well , to get back to Gilbert and Anne ."
When Anne 's school year ended in June she resigned and went home to get ready to be married .
"The wedding was to be in September , and I promised Anne faithful I 'd go over to Montrose in August for two weeks and help her to get her quilts ready ."
Anne thought that nobody could quilt like me .
"I was as tickled as a girl at the thought of visiting with Anne for two weeks , but I never went ; things happened before August ."
I do n't know rightly how the trouble began .
Other folks -- jealous folks -- made mischief .
Anne was thirty miles away and Gilbert could n't see her every day to keep matters clear and fair .
"Besides , as I 've said , they were both proud and high-sperrited ."
The upshot of it was they had a terrible quarrel and the engagement was broken .
"The Queen ordered him to kneel , and then said that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his heart ."
"Then they all gathered round Peter to hear what was the wish of his heart , but for a long time he hesitated , not being certain what it was himself ."
"`` If I chose to go back to mother , '' he asked at last , `` could you give me that wish ? ''"
"Now this question vexed them , for were he to return to his mother they should lose his music , so the Queen tilted her nose contemptuously and said , `` Pooh , ask for a much bigger wish than that . ''"
`` Is that quite a little wish ? ''
he inquired .
"`` As little as this , '' the Queen answered , putting her hands near each other ."
`` What size is a big wish ? ''
he asked .
She measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length .
"Then Peter reflected and said , `` Well , then , I think I shall have two little wishes instead of one big one . ''"
"Of course , the fairies had to agree , though his cleverness rather shocked them , and he said that his first wish was to go to his mother , but with the right to return to the Gardens if he found her disappointing ."
His second wish he would hold in reserve .
"They tried to dissuade him , and even put obstacles in the way ."
"`` I can give you the power to fly to her house , '' the Queen said , `` but I ca n't open the door for you . ''"
"`` The window I flew out at will be open , '' Peter said confidently ."
`` Mother always keeps it open in the hope that I may fly back .
`` How do you know ? ''
"they asked , quite surprised , and , really , Peter could not explain how he knew ."
"`` I just do know , '' he said ."
"So as he persisted in his wish , they had to grant it ."
"The way they gave him power to fly was this : They all tickled him on the shoulder , and soon he felt a funny itching in that part and then up he rose higher and higher and flew away out of the Gardens and over the house-tops ."
"It was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his old home he skimmed away over St. Paul 's to the Crystal Palace and back by the river and Regent 's Park , and by the time he reached his mother 's window he had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird ."
"The window was wide open , just as he knew it would be , and in he fluttered , and there was his mother lying asleep ."
Peter alighted softly on the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had a good look at her .
"She lay with her head on her hand , and the hollow in the pillow was like a nest lined with her brown wavy hair ."
"He remembered , though he had long forgotten it , that she always gave her hair a holiday at night ."
How sweet the frills of her night-gown were .
He was very glad she was such a pretty mother .
"But she looked sad , and he knew why she looked sad ."
"One of her arms moved as if it wanted to go round something , and he knew what it wanted to go round ."
"`` Oh , mother , '' said Peter to himself , `` if you just knew who is sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed . ''"
"`` No , it was Laddie , '' said Ernest , refusing to take any credit at all ."
"We hurried home and arrived at Uncle Richard 's about ten , just as they were going to bed ."
"When Uncle Richard heard what had happened , he turned very pale , and murmured , `` Thank God ! ''"
"Aunt Kate got me out of my wet clothes as quickly as possible , put me away to bed in hot blankets and dosed me with ginger tea ."
I slept like a top and felt none the worse for my experience the next morning .
At the breakfast table Uncle Richard scarcely spoke .
"But , just as we finished , he said abruptly to Ernest , `` I 'm not going to sell Laddie ."
"You and the dog saved Ned 's life between you , and no dog who helped do that is ever going to be sold by me ."
Henceforth he belongs to you .
I give him to you for your very own . ''
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson ! ''"
"said Ernest , with shining eyes ."
I never saw a boy look so happy .
"As for Laddie , who was sitting beside him with his shaggy head on Ernest 's knee , I really believe the dog understood , too ."
The look in his eyes was almost human .
Uncle Richard leaned over and patted him .
`` Good dog ! ''
he said .
`` Good dog ! ''
"At Five O'Clock in the Morning Fate , in the guise of Mrs. Emory dropping a milk-can on the platform under his open window , awakened Murray that morning ."
"Had not Mrs. Emory dropped that can , he would have slumbered peacefully until his usual hour for rising -- a late one , be it admitted , for of all the boarders at Sweetbriar Cottage Murray was the most irregular in his habits ."
"`` When a young man , '' Mrs. Emory was wont to remark sagely and a trifle severely , `` prowls about that pond half of the night , a-chasing of things what he calls ` moonlight effecks , ' it ai n't to be wondered at that he 's sleepy in the morning ."
"And it ai n't the convenientest thing , nuther and noways , to keep the breakfast table set till the farm folks are thinking of dinner ."
"But them artist men are not like other people , say what you will , and allowance has to be made for them ."
And I must say that I likes him real well and approves of him every other way . ''
"If Murray had slept late that morning -- well , he shudders yet over that `` if . ''"
"But aforesaid Fate saw to it that he woke when the hour of destiny and the milk-can struck , and having awakened he found he could not go to sleep again ."
It suddenly occurred to him that he had never seen a sunrise on the pond .
Doubtless it would be very lovely down there in those dewy meadows at such a primitive hour ; he decided to get up and see what the world looked like in the young daylight .
He scowled at a letter lying on his dressing table and thrust it into his pocket that it might be out of sight .
He had written it the night before and the writing of it was going to cost him several things -- a prospective million among others .
So it is hardly to be wondered at if the sight of it did not reconcile him to the joys of early rising .
"As for washing dishes , Mr. Harrison never made any pretence of doing it unless a rainy Sunday came ."
"Then he went to work and washed them all at once in the rainwater hogshead , and left them to drain dry ."
"Again , Mr. Harrison was `` close . ''"
When he was asked to subscribe to the Rev. Mr. Allan 's salary he said he 'd wait and see how many dollars ' worth of good he got out of his preaching first ... he did n't believe in buying a pig in a poke .
"And when Mrs. Lynde went to ask for a contribution to missions ... and incidentally to see the inside of the house ... he told her there were more heathens among the old woman gossips in Avonlea than anywhere else he knew of , and he 'd cheerfully contribute to a mission for Christianizing them if she 'd undertake it ."
"Mrs. Rachel got herself away and said it was a mercy poor Mrs. Robert Bell was safe in her grave , for it would have broken her heart to see the state of her house in which she used to take so much pride ."
"`` Why , she scrubbed the kitchen floor every second day , '' Mrs. Lynde told Marilla Cuthbert indignantly , `` and if you could see it now !"
I had to hold up my skirts as I walked across it . ''
"Finally , Mr. Harrison kept a parrot called Ginger ."
Nobody in Avonlea had ever kept a parrot before ; consequently that proceeding was considered barely respectable .
And such a parrot !
"If you took John Henry Carter 's word for it , never was such an unholy bird ."
It swore terribly .
Mrs. Carter would have taken John Henry away at once if she had been sure she could get another place for him .
"Besides , Ginger had bitten a piece right out of the back of John Henry 's neck one day when he had stooped down too near the cage ."
Mrs. Carter showed everybody the mark when the luckless John Henry went home on Sundays .
"All these things flashed through Anne 's mind as Mr. Harrison stood , quite speechless with wrath apparently , before her ."
"In his most amiable mood Mr. Harrison could not have been considered a handsome man ; he was short and fat and bald ; and now , with his round face purple with rage and his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head , Anne thought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen ."
All at once Mr. Harrison found his voice .
"`` I 'm not going to put up with this , '' he spluttered , `` not a day longer , do you hear , miss ."
"Bless my soul , this is the third time , miss ... the third time !"
"Patience has ceased to be a virtue , miss ."
"I warned your aunt the last time not to let it occur again ... and she 's let it ... she 's done it ... what does she mean by it , that is what I want to know ."
"That is what I 'm here about , miss . ''"
`` Will you explain what the trouble is ? ''
"asked Anne , in her most dignified manner ."
She had been practicing it considerably of late to have it in good working order when school began ; but it had no apparent effect on the irate J. A. Harrison .
"`` Trouble , is it ?"
"Bless my soul , trouble enough , I should think ."
"The trouble is , miss , that I found that Jersey cow of your aunt 's in my oats again , not half an hour ago ."
"The third time , mark you ."
I found her in last Tuesday and I found her in yesterday .
Susan wandered by with a hoe in her hand and her second best bonnet on her head .
`` I have just finished reading a piece in the Enterprise which told of a couple being married in an aeroplane .
"Do you think it would be legal , doctor dear ? ''"
she inquired anxiously .
"`` I think so , '' said the doctor gravely ."
"`` Well , '' said Susan dubiously , `` it seems to me that a wedding is too solemn for anything so giddy as an aeroplane ."
But nothing is the same as it used to be .
"Well , it is half an hour yet before prayer-meeting time , so I am going around to the kitchen garden to have a little evening hate with the weeds ."
But all the time I am strafing them I will be thinking about this new worry in the Trentino .
"I do not like this Austrian caper , Mrs. Dr. dear . ''"
"`` Nor I , '' said Mrs. Blythe ruefully ."
`` All the forenoon I preserved rhubarb with my hands and waited for the war news with my soul .
When it came I shrivelled .
"Well , I suppose I must go and get ready for the prayer-meeting , too . ''"
"Every village has its own little unwritten history , handed down from lip to lip through the generations , of tragic , comic , and dramatic events ."
"They are told at weddings and festivals , and rehearsed around winter firesides ."
And in these oral annals of Glen St. Mary the tale of the union prayer-meeting held that night in the Methodist Church was destined to fill an imperishable place .
The union prayer-meeting was Mr. Arnold 's idea .
"The county battalion , which had been training all winter in Charlottetown , was to leave shortly for overseas ."
"The Four Winds Harbour boys belonging to it from the Glen and over-harbour and Harbour Head and Upper Glen were all home on their last leave , and Mr. Arnold thought , properly enough , that it would be a fitting thing to hold a union prayer-meeting for them before they went away ."
"Mr. Meredith having agreed , the meeting was announced to be held in the Methodist Church ."
"Glen prayer-meetings were not apt to be too well attended , but on this particular evening the Methodist Church was crowded ."
Everybody who could go was there .
Even Miss Cornelia came -- and it was the first time in her life that Miss Cornelia had ever set foot inside a Methodist Church .
It took no less than a world conflict to bring that about .
"`` I used to hate Methodists , '' said Miss Cornelia calmly , when her husband expressed surprise over her going , `` but I do n't hate them now ."
There is no sense in hating Methodists when there is a Kaiser or a Hindenburg in the world . ''
So Miss Cornelia went .
Norman Douglas and his wife went too .
"And Whiskers-on-the-moon strutted up the aisle to a front pew , as if he fully realized what a distinction he conferred upon the building ."
"People were somewhat surprised that he should be there , since he usually avoided all assemblages connected in any way with the war ."
"But Mr. Meredith had said that he hoped his session would be well represented , and Mr. Pryor had evidently taken the request to heart ."
"So they both shouted till they were hoarse , yet nothing answered but the frogs in full chorus ."
"`` There is another tall tree over there , perhaps that 's the one , '' said Nan , whose heart sunk within her , though she still spoke bravely ."
`` I do n't think I can go any more ; my boots are so heavy I ca n't pull 'em ; '' and Robby sat down on a stone quite worn out .
`` Then we must stay here all night .
"I do n't care much , if snakes do n't come . ''"
`` I 'm frightened of snakes .
I ca n't stay all night .
"Oh , dear !"
"I do n't like to be lost , '' and Rob puckered up his face to cry , when suddenly a thought occurred to him , and he said , in a tone of perfect confidence , `` Marmar will come and find me she always does ; I ai n't afraid now . ''"
`` She wo n't know where we are . ''
"`` She did n't know I was shut up in the ice-house , but she found me ."
"I know she 'll come , '' returned Robby , so trustfully , that Nan felt relieved , and sat down by him , saying , with a remorseful sigh , `` I wish we had n't run away . ''"
"`` You made me ; but I do n't mind much Marmar will love me just the same , '' answered Rob , clinging to his sheet-anchor when all other hope was gone ."
`` I 'm so hungry .
"Let 's eat our berries , '' proposed Nan , after a pause , during which Rob began to nod ."
"`` So am I , but I ca n't eat mine , 'cause I told Marmar I 'd keep them all for her . ''"
"`` You 'll have to eat them if no one comes for us , '' said Nan , who felt like contradicting every thing just then ."
"`` If we stay here a great many days , we shall eat up all the berries in the field , and then we shall starve , '' she added grimly ."
`` I shall eat sassafras .
"I know a big tree of it , and Dan told me how squirrels dig up the roots and eat them , and I love to dig , '' returned Rob , undaunted by the prospect of starvation ."
"`` Yes ; and we can catch frogs , and cook them ."
"My father ate some once , and he said they were nice , '' put in Nan , beginning to find a spice of romance even in being lost in a huckleberry pasture ."
`` How could we cook frogs ?
we have n't got any fire . ''
"`` I do n't know ; next time I 'll have matches in my pocket , '' said Nan , rather depressed by this obstacle to the experiment in frog-cookery ."
`` Could n't we light a fire with a fire-fly ? ''
"asked Rob , hopefully , as he watched them flitting to and fro like winged sparks ."
"`` Let 's try ; '' and several minutes were pleasantly spent in catching the flies , and trying to make them kindle a green twig or two ."
"`` It 's a lie to call them fire-flies when there is n't a fire in them , '' Nan said , throwing one unhappy insect away with scorn , though it shone its best , and obligingly walked up and down the twigs to please the innocent little experimenters ."
"`` Marmar 's a good while coming , '' said Rob , after another pause , during which they watched the stars overhead , smelt the sweet fern crushed under foot , and listened to the crickets ' serenade ."
"`` I do n't see why God made any night ; day is so much pleasanter , '' said Nan , thoughtfully ."
"`` It 's to sleep in , '' answered Rob , with a yawn ."
Do not let yourself slump like poor Cousin Sophia .
"She said , when the word came , ` Ah , it is nothing but a rift in the clouds ."
We are up this week but we will be down the next . '
"` Well , Sophia Crawford , ' said I , -- for I will never give in to her , Mrs. Dr. dear -- ` God himself can not make two hills without a hollow between them , as I have heard it said , but that is no reason why we should not take the good of the hills when we are on them . '"
But Cousin Sophia moaned on .
"` Here is the Gallipolly expedition a failure and the Grand Duke Nicholas sent off , and everyone knows the Czar of Rooshia is a pro-German and the Allies have no ammunition and Bulgaria is going against us ."
"And the end is not yet , for England and France must be punished for their deadly sins until they repent in sackcloth and ashes . ' '"
"I think myself , ' I said , ` that they will do their repenting in khaki and trench mud , and it seems to me that the Huns should have a few sins to repent of also . '"
"` They are instruments in the hands of the Almighty , to purge the garner , ' said Sophia ."
"And then I got mad , Mrs. Dr. dear , and told her I did not and never would believe that the Almighty ever took such dirty instruments in hand for any purpose whatever , and that I did not consider it decent for her to be using the words of Holy Writ as glibly as she was doing in ordinary conversation ."
"She was not , I told her , a minister or even an elder ."
"And for the time being I squelched her , Mrs. Dr. dear ."
Cousin Sophia has no spirit .
"She is very different from her niece , Mrs. Dean Crawford over-harbour ."
You know the Dean Crawfords had five boys and now the new baby is another boy .
"All the connection and especially Dean Crawford were much disappointed because their hearts had been set on a girl ; but Mrs. Dean just laughed and said , ` Everywhere I went this summer I saw the sign `` MEN WANTED '' staring me in the face ."
Do you think I could go and have a girl under such circumstances ? '
"There is spirit for you , Mrs. Dr. dear ."
But Cousin Sophia would say the child was just so much more cannon fodder . ''
"Cousin Sophia had full range for her pessimism that gloomy autumn , and even Susan , incorrigible old optimist as she was , was hard put to it for cheer ."
"When Bulgaria lined up with Germany Susan only remarked scornfully , `` One more nation anxious for a licking , '' but the Greek tangle worried her beyond her powers of philosophy to endure calmly ."
"`` Constantine of Greece has a German wife , Mrs. Dr. dear , and that fact squelches hope ."
To think that I should have lived to care what kind of a wife Constantine of Greece had !
The miserable creature is under his wife 's thumb and that is a bad place for any man to be .
I am an old maid and an old maid has to be independent or she will be squashed out .
"But if I had been a married woman , Mrs. Dr. dear , I would have been meek and humble ."
It is my opinion that this Sophia of Greece is a minx . ''
Susan was furious when the news came that Venizelos had met with defeat .
"`` I could spank Constantine and skin him alive afterwards , that I could , '' she exclaimed bitterly ."
"`` Oh , Susan , I 'm surprised at you , '' said the doctor , pulling a long face ."
`` Have you no regard for the proprieties ?
Skin him alive by all means but omit the spanking . ''
"cried Alan , `` if I make a boat , I 'll make a body to take it back again !"
"So deave me with no more of your nonsense , but walk -LRB- for that 's what you 've got to do -RRB- -- and let Alan think for ye . ''"
"All night , then , we walked through the north side of the Carse under the high line of the Ochil mountains ; and by Alloa and Clackmannan and Culross , all of which we avoided : and about ten in the morning , mighty hungry and tired , came to the little clachan of Limekilns ."
"This is a place that sits near in by the water-side , and looks across the Hope to the town of the Queensferry ."
"Smoke went up from both of these , and from other villages and farms upon all hands ."
"The fields were being reaped ; two ships lay anchored , and boats were coming and going on the Hope ."
"It was altogether a right pleasant sight to me ; and I could not take my fill of gazing at these comfortable , green , cultivated hills and the busy people both of the field and sea ."
"For all that , there was Mr. Rankeillor 's house on the south shore , where I had no doubt wealth awaited me ; and here was I upon the north , clad in poor enough attire of an outlandish fashion , with three silver shillings left to me of all my fortune , a price set upon my head , and an outlawed man for my sole company ."
"`` O , Alan ! ''"
"said I , `` to think of it !"
"Over there , there 's all that heart could want waiting me ; and the birds go over , and the boats go over -- all that please can go , but just me only !"
"O , man , but it 's a heart-break ! ''"
"In Limekilns we entered a small change-house , which we only knew to be a public by the wand over the door , and bought some bread and cheese from a good-looking lass that was the servant ."
"This we carried with us in a bundle , meaning to sit and eat it in a bush of wood on the sea-shore , that we saw some third part of a mile in front ."
"As we went , I kept looking across the water and sighing to myself ; and though I took no heed of it , Alan had fallen into a muse ."
At last he stopped in the way .
`` Did ye take heed of the lass we bought this of ? ''
"says he , tapping on the bread and cheese ."
"`` To be sure , '' said I , `` and a bonny lass she was . ''"
`` Ye thought that ? ''
cries he .
"`` Man , David , that 's good news . ''"
"`` In the name of all that 's wonderful , why so ? ''"
says I. `` What good can that do ? ''
"`` Well , '' said Alan , with one of his droll looks , `` I was rather in hopes it would maybe get us that boat . ''"
"`` If it were the other way about , it would be liker it , '' said I. `` That 's all that you ken , ye see , '' said Alan ."
"`` I do n't want the lass to fall in love with ye , I want her to be sorry for ye , David ; to which end there is no manner of need that she should take you for a beauty ."
Let me see '' -LRB- looking me curiously over -RRB- .
"`` I wish ye were a wee thing paler ; but apart from that ye 'll do fine for my purpose -- ye have a fine , hang-dog , rag-and-tatter , clappermaclaw kind of a look to ye , as if ye had stolen the coat from a potato-bogle ."
"Come ; right about , and back to the change-house for that boat of ours . ''"
"I followed him , laughing ."
"`` David Balfour , '' said he , `` ye 're a very funny gentleman by your way of it , and this is a very funny employ for ye , no doubt ."
"Cousin Sophia wanted them to elect Roosevelt , and is much disgruntled because they would not give him a chance ."
"I had a hankering for him myself , but we must believe that Providence over-rules these matters and be satisfied -- though what the Almighty means in this affair of Rumania I can not fathom -- saying it with all reverence . ''"
Susan fathomed it -- or thought she did -- when the Asquith ministry went down and Lloyd George became Premier .
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , Lloyd George is at the helm at last ."
I have been praying for this for many a day .
Now we shall soon see a blessed change .
"It took the Rumanian disaster to bring it about , no less , and that is the meaning of it , though I could not see it before ."
There will be no more shilly-shallying .
"I consider that the war is as good as won , and that I shall tie to , whether Bucharest falls or not . ''"
Bucharest did fall -- and Germany proposed peace negotiations .
Whereat Susan scornfully turned a deaf ear and absolutely refused to listen to such proposals .
When President Wilson sent his famous December peace note Susan waxed violently sarcastic .
"`` Woodrow Wilson is going to make peace , I understand ."
First Henry Ford had a try at it and now comes Wilson .
"But peace is not made with ink , Woodrow , and that you may tie to , '' said Susan , apostrophizing the unlucky President out of the kitchen window nearest the United States ."
"`` Lloyd George 's speech will tell the Kaiser what is what , and you may keep your peace screeds at home and save postage . ''"
"`` What a pity President Wilson ca n't hear you , Susan , '' said Rilla slyly ."
"`` Indeed , Rilla dear , it is a pity that he has no one near him to give him good advice , as it is clear he has not , in all those Democrats and Republicans , '' retorted Susan ."
"`` I do not know the difference between them , for the politics of the Yankees is a puzzle I can not solve , study it as I may ."
"But as far as seeing through a grindstone goes , I am afraid -- '' Susan shook her head dubiously , `` that they are all tarred with the same brush . ''"
"`` I am thankful Christmas is over , '' Rilla wrote in her diary during the last week of a stormy December ."
`` We had dreaded it so -- the first Christmas since Courcelette .
But we had all the Merediths down for dinner and nobody tried to be gay or cheerful .
"We were all just quiet and friendly , and that helped ."
"Then , too , I was so thankful that Jims had got better -- so thankful that I almost felt glad -- almost but not quite ."
I wonder if I shall ever feel really glad over anything again .
It seems as if gladness were killed in me -- shot down by the same bullet that pierced Walter 's heart .
Perhaps some day a new kind of gladness will be born in my soul -- but the old kind will never live again .
`` Winter set in awfully early this year .
Ten days before Christmas we had a big snowstorm -- at least we thought it big at the time .
"As it happened , it was only a prelude to the real performance ."
"It was fine the next day , and Ingleside and Rainbow Valley were wonderful , with the trees all covered with snow , and big drifts everywhere , carved into the most fantastic shapes by the chisel of the northeast wind ."
"Come away now , you must not stand any longer ."
Come and rest while I fetch a dish to put the flowers in till you want them ; '' and Mrs. Pecq turned her round with her small Maying safely done .
"`` I did n't think I 'd ever be able to do even so much , and here I am walking and sitting up , and going to drive some day ."
Is n't it nice that I 'm not to be a poor Lucinda after all ? ''
and Jill drew a long sigh of relief that six months instead of twenty years would probably be the end of her captivity .
"`` Yes , thank Heaven !"
"I do n't think I could have borne that ; '' and the mother took Jill in her arms as if she were a baby , holding her close for a minute , and laying her down with a tender kiss that made the arms cling about her neck as her little girl returned it heartily , for all sorts of new , sweet feelings seemed to be budding in both , born of great joy and thankfulness ."
"Then Mrs. Pecq hurried away to see about tea for the hungry boys , and Jill watched the pleasant twilight deepen as she lay singing to herself one of the songs her friend taught her because it fitted her so well ."
"`` A little bird I am , Shut from the fields of air , And in my cage I sit and sing To Him who placed me there : Well pleased a prisoner to be , Because , my God , it pleases Thee !"
"`` Naught have I else to do ; I sing the whole day long ; And He whom most I love to please Doth listen to my song , He caught and bound my wandering wing , But still He bends to hear me sing . ''"
"`` Now we are ready for you , so bring on your flowers , '' said Molly to the boys , as she and Merry added their store of baskets to the gay show Jill had set forth on the long table ready for the evening 's work ."
"`` They would n't let me see one , but I guess they have had good luck , they look so jolly , '' answered Jill , looking at Gus , Frank , and Jack , who stood laughing , each with a large basket in his hands ."
`` Fair to middling .
Just look in and see ; '' with which cheerful remark Gus tipped up his basket and displayed a few bits of green at the bottom .
`` I did better .
"Now , do n't all scream at once over these beauties ; '' and Frank shook out some evergreen sprigs , half a dozen saxifrages , and two or three forlorn violets with hardly any stems ."
"`` I do n't brag , but here 's the best of all the three , '' chuckled Jack , producing a bunch of feathery carrot-tops , with a few half-shut dandelions trying to look brave and gay ."
"`` Oh , boys , is that all ? ''"
`` What shall we do ? ''
"`` We 've only a few house-flowers , and all those baskets to fill , '' cried the girls , in despair ; for Merry 's contribution had been small , and Molly had only a handful of artificial flowers `` to fill up , '' she said ."
`` It is n't our fault : it is the late spring .
"We ca n't make flowers , can we ? ''"
"asked Frank , in a tone of calm resignation ."
"`` Could n't you buy some , then ? ''"
"said Molly , smoothing her crumpled morning-glories , with a sigh ."
`` Who ever heard of a fellow having any money left the last day of the month ? ''
"demanded Gus , severely ."
`` Or girls either .
"I spent all mine in ribbon and paper for my baskets , and now they are of no use ."
It 's a shame ! ''
"lamented Jill , while Merry began to thin out her full baskets to fill the empty ones ."
`` Hold on ! ''
"`` If he had been well spanked in his younger days he might have more sense now , '' retorted Susan ."
"`` But I suppose princes are never spanked , more is the pity ."
I see the Allies have sent him an ultimatum .
I could tell them that it will take more than ultimatums to skin a snake like Constantine .
"Perhaps the Allied blockade will hammer sense into his head ; but that will take some time I am thinking , and in the meantime what is to become of poor Serbia ? ''"
"They saw what became of Serbia , and during the process Susan was hardly to be lived with ."
"In her exasperation she abused everything and everybody except Kitchener , and she fell upon poor President Wilson tooth and claw ."
"`` If he had done his duty and gone into the war long ago we should not have seen this mess in Serbia , '' she avowed ."
"`` It would be a serious thing to plunge a great country like the United States , with its mixed population , into the war , Susan , '' said the doctor , who sometimes came to the defence of the President , not because he thought Wilson needed it especially , but from an unholy love of baiting Susan ."
"`` Maybe , doctor dear -- maybe !"
But that makes me think of the old story of the girl who told her grandmother she was going to be married .
"` It is a solemn thing to be married , ' said the old lady ."
"` Yes , but it is a solemner thing not to be , ' said the girl ."
"And I can testify to that out of my own experience , doctor dear ."
And I think it is a solemner thing for the Yankees that they have kept out of the war than it would have been if they had gone into it .
"However , though I do not know much about them , I am of the opinion that we will see them starting something yet , Woodrow Wilson or no Woodrow Wilson , when they get it into their heads that this war is not a correspondence school ."
"They will not , '' said Susan , energetically waving a saucepan with one hand and a soup ladle with the other , `` be too proud to fight then . ''"
"On a pale-yellow , windy evening in October Carl Meredith went away ."
He had enlisted on his eighteenth birthday .
John Meredith saw him off with a set face .
His two boys were gone -- there was only little Bruce left now .
He loved Bruce and Bruce 's mother dearly ; but Jerry and Carl were the sons of the bride of his youth and Carl was the only one of all his children who had Cecilia 's very eyes .
As they looked lovingly out at him above Carl 's uniform the pale minister suddenly remembered the day when for the first and last time he had tried to whip Carl for his prank with the eel .
That was the first time he had realised how much Carl 's eyes were like Cecilia 's .
Now he realised it again once more .
Would he ever again see his dead wife 's eyes looking at him from his son 's face ?
"What a bonny , clean , handsome lad he was !"
It was -- hard -- to see him go .
John Meredith seemed to be looking at a torn plain strewed with the bodies of `` able-bodied men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five . ''
"Only the other day Carl had been a little scrap of a boy , hunting bugs in Rainbow Valley , taking lizards to bed with him , and scandalizing the Glen by carrying frogs to Sunday School ."
It seemed hardly -- right -- somehow that he should be an `` able-bodied man '' in khaki .
Yet John Meredith had said no word to dissuade him when Carl had told him he must go .
"Maimie cried , falling on her knees , for the little house was now the size of a reel of thread , but still quite complete ."
"But as she stretched out her arms imploringly the snow crept up on all sides until it met itself , and where the little house had been was now one unbroken expanse of snow ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Fairies never say , ` We feel happy ' : what they say is , ` We feel dancey ' -RSB- Maimie stamped her foot naughtily , and was putting her fingers to her eyes , when she heard a kind voice say , ` Do n't cry , pretty human , do n't cry , ' and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy regarding her wistfully ."
She knew at once that he must be Peter Pan .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` The Little House ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` Peter 's Goat ' -RSB- VI PETER 'S GOAT Maimie felt quite shy , but Peter knew not what shy was . '"
"I hope you have had a good night , ' he said earnestly ."
"` Thank you , ' she replied , ' I was so cosy and warm ."
But you ' -- and she looked at his nakedness awkwardly -- ` do n't you feel the least bit cold ? '
"Now cold was another word Peter had forgotten , so he answered , ' I think not , but I may be wrong : you see I am rather ignorant ."
I am not exactly a boy ; Solomon says I am a Betwixt-and-Between . '
"` So that is what it is called , ' said Maimie thoughtfully ."
"` That 's not my name , ' he explained , ` my name is Peter Pan . '"
"` Yes , of course , ' she said , ' I know , everybody knows . '"
You ca n't think how pleased Peter was to learn that all the people outside the gates knew about him .
"He begged Maimie to tell him what they knew and what they said , and she did so ."
"They were sitting by this time on a fallen tree ; Peter had cleared off the snow for Maimie , but he sat on a snowy bit himself ."
"` Squeeze closer , ' Maimie said ."
` What is that ? '
"he asked , and she showed him , and then he did it ."
"They talked together and he found that people knew a great deal about him , but not everything , not that he had gone back to his mother and been barred out , for instance , and he said nothing of this to Maimie , for it still humiliated him ."
` Do they know that I play games exactly like real boys ? '
he asked very proudly . '
"O Maimie , please tell them ! '"
"But when he revealed how he played , by sailing his hoop on the Round Pond , and so on , she was simply horrified ."
"` All your ways of playing , ' she said with her big eyes on him , ` are quite , quite wrong , and not in the least like how boys play . '"
"Poor Peter uttered a little moan at this , and he cried for the first time for I know not how long ."
"Maimie was extremely sorry for him , and lent him her handkerchief , but he did n't know in the least what to do with it , so she showed him , that is to say , she wiped her eyes , and then gave it back to him , saying , ` Now you do it , ' but instead of wiping his own eyes he wiped hers , and she thought it best to pretend that this was what she had meant ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Looking very undancey indeed -RSB- She said out of pity for him , ' I shall give you a kiss if you like , ' but though he once knew , he had long forgotten what kisses are , and he replied , ` Thank you , ' and held out his hand , thinking she had offered to put something into it ."
"This was a great shock to her , but she felt she could not explain without shaming him , so with charming delicacy she gave Peter a thimble which happened to be in her pocket , and pretended that it was a kiss ."
Poor little boy !
"he quite believed her , and to this day he wears it on his finger , though there can be scarcely any one who needs a thimble so little ."
"You see , though still a tiny child , it was really years and years since he had seen his mother , and I dare say the baby who had supplanted him was now a man with whiskers ."
"`` It is easy to try that , '' says Alan ."
"Duncan Dhu made haste to bring out the pair of pipes that was his principal possession , and to set before his guests a mutton-ham and a bottle of that drink which they call Athole brose , and which is made of old whiskey , strained honey and sweet cream , slowly beaten together in the right order and proportion ."
"The two enemies were still on the very breach of a quarrel ; but down they sat , one upon each side of the peat fire , with a mighty show of politeness ."
"Maclaren pressed them to taste his mutton-ham and `` the wife 's brose , '' reminding them the wife was out of Athole and had a name far and wide for her skill in that confection ."
But Robin put aside these hospitalities as bad for the breath .
"`` I would have ye to remark , sir , '' said Alan , `` that I havenae broken bread for near upon ten hours , which will be worse for the breath than any brose in Scotland . ''"
"`` I will take no advantages , Mr. Stewart , '' replied Robin ."
`` Eat and drink ; I 'll follow you . ''
"Each ate a small portion of the ham and drank a glass of the brose to Mrs. Maclaren ; and then after a great number of civilities , Robin took the pipes and played a little spring in a very ranting manner ."
"`` Ay , ye can blow '' said Alan ; and taking the instrument from his rival , he first played the same spring in a manner identical with Robin 's ; and then wandered into variations , which , as he went on , he decorated with a perfect flight of grace-notes , such as pipers love , and call the `` warblers . ''"
"I had been pleased with Robin 's playing , Alan 's ravished me ."
"`` That 's no very bad , Mr. Stewart , '' said the rival , `` but ye show a poor device in your warblers . ''"
`` Me ! ''
"cried Alan , the blood starting to his face ."
`` I give ye the lie . ''
"`` Do ye own yourself beaten at the pipes , then , '' said Robin , `` that ye seek to change them for the sword ? ''"
"`` And that 's very well said , Mr. Macgregor , '' returned Alan ; `` and in the meantime '' -LRB- laying a strong accent on the word -RRB- `` I take back the lie ."
I appeal to Duncan . ''
"`` Indeed , ye need appeal to naebody , '' said Robin ."
`` Ye 're a far better judge than any Maclaren in Balquhidder : for it 's a God 's truth that you 're a very creditable piper for a Stewart .
Hand me the pipes . ''
"Alan did as he asked ; and Robin proceeded to imitate and correct some part of Alan 's variations , which it seemed that he remembered perfectly ."
"`` Ay , ye have music , '' said Alan , gloomily ."
"`` And now be the judge yourself , Mr. Stewart , '' said Robin ; and taking up the variations from the beginning , he worked them throughout to so new a purpose , with such ingenuity and sentiment , and with so odd a fancy and so quick a knack in the grace-notes , that I was amazed to hear him ."
"As for Alan , his face grew dark and hot , and he sat and gnawed his fingers , like a man under some deep affront ."
`` Enough ! ''
he cried .
`` Ye can blow the pipes -- make the most of that . ''
And he made as if to rise .
"But Robin only held out his hand as if to ask for silence , and struck into the slow measure of a pibroch ."
"It was a fine piece of music in itself , and nobly played ; but it seems , besides , it was a piece peculiar to the Appin Stewarts and a chief favourite with Alan ."
"The first notes were scarce out , before there came a change in his face ; when the time quickened , he seemed to grow restless in his seat ; and long before that piece was at an end , the last signs of his anger died from him , and he had no thought but for the music ."
"You could gather from his talk that he was a very brave boy , and no one was so proud of it as Maimie ."
She would have loved to have a ticket on her saying that she was his sister .
"And at no time did she admire him more than when he told her , as he often did with splendid firmness , that one day he meant to remain behind in the Gardens after the gates were closed ."
"`` Oh , Tony , '' she would say , with awful respect , `` but the fairies will be so angry ! ''"
"`` I daresay , '' replied Tony , carelessly ."
"`` Perhaps , '' she said , thrilling , `` Peter Pan will give you a sail in his boat ! ''"
"`` I shall make him , '' replied Tony ; no wonder she was proud of him ."
"But they should not have talked so loudly , for one day they were overheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves , from which the little people weave their summer curtains , and after that Tony was a marked boy ."
"They loosened the rails before he sat on them , so that down he came on the back of his head ; they tripped him up by catching his bootlace and bribed the ducks to sink his boat ."
"Nearly all the nasty accidents you meet with in the Gardens occur because the fairies have taken an ill-will to you , and so it behoves you to be careful what you say about them ."
"Maimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing things , but Tony was not that kind , and when she asked him which day he was to remain behind in the Gardens after Lock-out he merely replied , `` Just some day ; '' he was quite vague about which day except when she asked `` Will it be today ? ''"
and then he could always say for certain that it would not be to-day .
So she saw that he was waiting for a real good chance .
"This brings us to an afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow , and there was ice on the Round Pond , not thick enough to skate on but at least you could spoil it for tomorrow by flinging stones , and many bright little boys and girls were doing that ."
"When Tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to the pond , but their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first , and as she said this she glanced at the time-board to see when the Gardens closed that night ."
It read half-past five .
Poor ayah !
"she is the one who laughs continuously because there are so many white children in the world , but she was not to laugh much more that day ."
"Well , they went up the Baby Walk and back , and when they returned to the time-board she was surprised to see that it now read five o'clock for closing time ."
"But she was unacquainted with the tricky ways of the fairies , and so did not see -LRB- as Maimie and Tony saw at once -RRB- that they had changed the hour because there was to be a ball to-night ."
"She said there was only time now to walk to the top of the Hump and back , and as they trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little breasts ."
You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball .
"Never , Tony felt , could he hope for a better chance ."
"He had to feel this , for Maimie so plainly felt it for him ."
"Her eager eyes asked the question , `` Is it to-day ? ''"
and he gasped and then nodded .
"Maimie slipped her hand into Tony 's , and hers was hot , but his was cold ."
She did a very kind thing ; she took off her scarf and gave it to him !
"`` In case you should feel cold , '' she whispered ."
"Her face was aglow , but Tony 's was very gloomy ."
"As they turned on the top of the Hump he whispered to her , `` I 'm afraid Nurse would see me , so I sha 'n' t be able to do it . ''"
"Maimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but their ayah , when there were so many unknown terrors to fear , and she said aloud , `` Tony , I shall race you to the gate , '' and in a whisper , `` Then you can hide , '' and off they ran ."
"When two people do n't care overly much for each other , Nora May , a quarrel never amounts to much between them , and it 's soon made up ."
But when they love each other better than life it cuts so deep and hurts so much that nine times out of ten they wo n't ever forgive each other .
"The more you love anybody , Nora May , the more he can hurt you ."
"To be sure , you 're too young to be thinking of such things ."
"It all came like a thunderclap on Gil 's friends here at Greendale , because we had n't ever suspected things were going wrong ."
"The first thing we knew was that Anne had gone up west to teach school again at St. Mary 's , eighty miles away , and Gilbert , he went out to Manitoba on a harvest excursion and stayed there ."
It just about broke his parents ' hearts .
He was their only child and they just worshipped him .
"Gil and Anne both wrote to me off and on , but never a word , not so much as a name , did they say of each other ."
"I 'd ` a ' writ and asked 'em the rights of the fuss if I could , in hopes of patching it up , but I ca n't write now -- my hand is too shaky -- and mebbe it was just as well , for meddling is terribly risky work in a love trouble , Nora May ."
Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the last state of a meddler and them she meddles with is worse than the first .
"So I just set tight and said nothing , while everybody else in the clan was talking Anne and Gil sixty words to the minute ."
"Well , last birthday morning I was feeling terrible disperrited ."
"I had made up my mind that my birthday was always to be a good thing for other people , and there did n't seem one blessed thing I could do to make anybody glad ."
Emma Matilda and George and the children were all well and happy and wanted for nothing that I could give them .
"I begun to be afraid I 'd lived long enough , Nora May ."
"When a woman gets to the point where she ca n't give a gift of joy to anyone , there ai n't much use in her living ."
I felt real old and worn out and useless .
"I was sitting here under these very trees -- they was just budding out in leaf then , as young and cheerful as if they was n't a hundred years old ."
"And I sighed right out loud and said , `` Oh , Grandpa Holland , it 's time I was put away up on the hill there with you . ''"
"And with that the gate banged and there was Nancy Jane Whitmore 's boy , Sam , with two letters for me ."
One was from Anne up at St. Mary 's and the other was from Gil out in Manitoba .
I read Anne 's first .
She just struck right into things in the first paragraph .
"She said her year at St. Mary 's was nearly up , and when it was she meant to quit teaching and go away to New York and learn to be a trained nurse ."
"She said she was just broken-hearted about Gilbert , and would always love him to the day of her death ."
"But she knew he did n't care anything more about her after the way he had acted , and there was nothing left for her in life but to do something for other people , and so on and so on , for twelve mortal pages ."
"Anne is a fine writer , and I just cried like a babe over that letter , it was so touching , although I was enjoying myself hugely all the time , I was so delighted to find out that Anne loved Gilbert still ."
"I was getting skeered she did n't , her letters all winter had been so kind of jokey and frivolous , all about the good times she was having , and the parties she went to , and the new dresses she got ."
New dresses !
"When I read that letter of Anne 's , I knew that all the purple and fine linen in the world was just like so much sackcloth and ashes to her as long as Gilbert was sulking out on a prairie farm ."
"Well , I wiped my eyes and polished up my specs , but I might have spared myself the trouble , for in five minutes , Nora May , there was I sobbing again ; over Gilbert 's letter ."
"`` Patience is a tired mare but she jogs on , '' said Susan ."
"`` While the steeds of Armageddon thunder , trampling over our hearts , '' retorted Miss Oliver ."
"`` Susan , tell me -- do n't you ever -- did n't you ever -- take spells of feeling that you must scream -- or swear -- or smash something -- just because your torture reaches a point when it becomes unbearable ? ''"
"`` I have never sworn or desired to swear , Miss Oliver dear , but I will admit , '' said Susan , with the air of one determined to make a clean breast of it once and for all , `` that I have experienced occasions when it was a relief to do considerable banging . ''"
"`` Do n't you think that is a kind of swearing , Susan ?"
"What is the difference between slamming a door viciously and saying d -- '' `` Miss Oliver dear , '' interrupted Susan , desperately determined to save Gertrude from herself , if human power could do it , `` you are all tired out and unstrung -- and no wonder , teaching those obstreperous youngsters all day and coming home to bad war news ."
But just you go upstairs and lie down and I will bring you up a cup of hot tea and a bite of toast and very soon you will not want to slam doors or swear . ''
"`` Susan , you 're a good soul -- a very pearl of Susans !"
"But , Susan , it would be such a relief -- to say just one soft , low , little tiny d -- '' `` I will bring you a hot-water bottle for the soles of your feet , also , '' interposed Susan resolutely , `` and it would not be any relief to say that word you are thinking of , Miss Oliver , and that you may tie to . ''"
"`` Well , I 'll try the hot-water bottle first , '' said Miss Oliver , repenting herself on teasing Susan and vanishing upstairs , to Susan 's intense relief ."
Susan shook her head ominously as she filled the hot-water bottle .
The war was certainly relaxing the standards of behaviour woefully .
Here was Miss Oliver admittedly on the point of profanity .
"`` We must draw the blood from her brain , '' said Susan , `` and if this bottle is not effective I will see what can be done with a mustard plaster . ''"
Gertrude rallied and carried on .
"Lord Kitchener went to Greece , whereat Susan foretold that Constantine would soon experience a change of heart ."
Lloyd George began to heckle the Allies regarding equipment and guns and Susan said you would hear more of Lloyd George yet .
"The gallant Anzacs withdrew from Gallipoli and Susan approved the step , with reservations ."
The siege of Kut-El-Amara began and Susan pored over maps of Mesopotamia and abused the Turks .
Henry Ford started for Europe and Susan flayed him with sarcasm .
"Sir John French was superseded by Sir Douglas Haig and Susan dubiously opined that it was poor policy to swap horses crossing a stream , `` though , to be sure , Haig was a good name and French had a foreign sound , say what you might . ''"
"Not a move on the great chess-board of king or bishop or pawn escaped Susan , who had once read only Glen St. Mary notes ."
"`` There was a time , '' she said sorrowfully , `` when I did not care what happened outside of P.E. Island , and now a king can not have a toothache in Russia or China but it worries me ."
"It may be broadening to the mind , as the doctor said , but it is very painful to the feelings . ''"
When Christmas came again Susan did not set any vacant places at the festive board .
Two empty chairs were too much even for Susan who had thought in September that there would not be one .
"`` This is the first Christmas that Walter was not home , '' Rilla wrote in her diary that night ."
"`` Jem used to be away for Christmases up in Avonlea , but Walter never was ."
I had letters from Ken and him today .
They are still in England but expect to be in the trenches very soon .
And then -- but I suppose we 'll be able to endure it somehow .
"To me , the strangest of all the strange things since 1914 is how we have all learned to accept things we never thought we could -- to go on with life as a matter of course ."
"`` We 'll try , '' promised Cyrilla with dancing eyes ."
When the door closed behind Mrs. Plunkett the three girls looked at each other .
"`` Cyrilla , that idea of yours was a really truly inspiration , '' said Carol solemnly ."
"`` I believe it was , '' said Cyrilla , thinking of Miss Marshall ."
Dorinda 's Desperate Deed Dorinda had been home for a whole wonderful week and the little Pages were beginning to feel acquainted with her .
"When a girl goes away when she is ten and does n't come back until she is fifteen , it is only to be expected that her family should regard her as somewhat of a stranger , especially when she is really a Page , and they are really all Carters except for the name ."
"Dorinda had been only ten when her Aunt Mary -- on the Carter side -- had written to Mrs. Page , asking her to let Dorinda come to her for the winter ."
"Mrs. Page , albeit she was poor -- nobody but herself knew how poor -- and a widow with five children besides Dorinda , hesitated at first ."
"She was afraid , with good reason , that the winter might stretch into other seasons ; but Mary had lost her own only little girl in the summer , and Mrs. Page shuddered at the thought of what her loneliness must be ."
"So , to comfort her , Mrs. Page had let Dorinda go , stipulating that she must come home in the spring ."
"In the spring , when Dorinda 's bed of violets was growing purple under the lilac bush , Aunt Mary wrote again ."
"Dorinda was contented and happy , she said ."
Would not Emily let her stay for the summer ?
Mrs. Page cried bitterly over that letter and took sad counsel with herself .
"To let Dorinda stay with her aunt for the summer really meant , she knew , to let her stay altogether ."
Mrs. Page was finding it harder and harder to get along ; there was so little and the children needed so much ; Dorinda would have a good home with her Aunt Mary if she could only prevail on her rebellious mother heart to give her up .
In the end she agreed to let Dorinda stay for the summer -- and Dorinda had never been home since .
"But now Dorinda had come back to the little white house on the hill at Willowdale , set back from the road in a smother of apple trees and vines ."
"Aunt Mary had died very suddenly and her only son , Dorinda 's cousin , had gone to Japan ."
"There was nothing for Dorinda to do save to come home , to enter again into her old unfilled place in her mother 's heart , and win a new place in the hearts of the brothers and sisters who barely remembered her at all ."
Leicester had been nine and Jean seven when Dorinda went away ; now they were respectively fourteen and twelve .
"At first they were a little shy with this big , practically brand-new sister , but this soon wore off ."
Nobody could be shy long with Dorinda ; nobody could help liking her .
"She was so brisk and jolly and sympathetic -- a real Page , so everybody said -- while the brothers and sisters were Carter to their marrow ; Carters with fair hair and blue eyes , and small , fine , wistful features ; but Dorinda had merry black eyes , plump , dusky-red cheeks , and a long braid of glossy dark hair , which was perpetually being twitched from one shoulder to another as Dorinda whisked about the house on domestic duties intent ."
"In a week Dorinda felt herself one of the family again , with all the cares and responsibilities thereof resting on her strong young shoulders ."
"Dorinda and her mother talked matters out fully one afternoon over their sewing , in the sunny south room where the winds got lost among the vines halfway through the open window ."
Mrs. Page sighed and said she really did not know what to do .
"Dorinda did not sigh ; she did not know just what to do either , but there must be something that could be done -- there is always something that can be done , if one can only find it ."
Dorinda sewed hard and pursed up her red lips determinedly .
"`` Do n't you worry , Mother Page , '' she said briskly ."
`` We 'll be like that glorious old Roman who found a way or made it .
I like overcoming difficulties .
"`` I came back for my mother , '' he explained , `` to take her to the Neverland . ''"
"`` Yes , I know , '' Jane said , `` I have been waiting for you . ''"
"When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowing gloriously , while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy ."
"`` She is my mother , '' Peter explained ; and Jane descended and stood by his side , with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him ."
"`` He does so need a mother , '' Jane said ."
"`` Yes , I know . ''"
"Wendy admitted rather forlornly ; `` no one knows it so well as I. '' `` Good-bye , '' said Peter to Wendy ; and he rose in the air , and the shameless Jane rose with him ; it was already her easiest way of moving about ."
Wendy rushed to the window .
"`` No , no , '' she cried ."
"`` It is just for spring cleaning time , '' Jane said , `` he wants me always to do his spring cleaning . ''"
"`` If only I could go with you , '' Wendy sighed ."
"`` You see you ca n't fly , '' said Jane ."
Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together .
"Our last glimpse of her shows her at the window , watching them receding into the sky until they were as small as stars ."
"As you look at Wendy , you may see her hair becoming white , and her figure little again , for all this happened long ago ."
"Jane is now a common grown-up , with a daughter called Margaret ; and every spring cleaning time , except when he forgets , Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland , where she tells him stories about himself , to which he listens eagerly ."
"When Margaret grows up she will have a daughter , who is to be Peter 's mother in turn ; and thus it will go on , so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless ."

I THE GRAND TOUR OF THE GARDENS You must see for yourselves that it will be difficult to follow Peter Pan 's adventures unless you are familiar with the Kensington Gardens .
"They are in London , where the King lives , and I used to take David there nearly every day unless he was looking decidedly flushed ."
"No child has ever been in the whole of the Gardens , because it is so soon time to turn back ."
"The reason it is soon time to turn back is that , if you are as small as David , you sleep from twelve to one ."
"If your mother was not so sure that you sleep from twelve to one , you could most likely see the whole of them ."
"The Gardens are bounded on one side by a never-ending line of omnibuses , over which your nurse has such authority that if she holds up her finger to any one of them it stops immediately ."
She then crosses with you in safety to the other side .
"There are more gates to the Gardens than one gate , but that is the one you go in at , and before you go in you speak to the lady with the balloons , who sits just outside ."
"This is as near to being inside as she may venture , because , if she were to let go her hold of the railings for one moment , the balloons would lift her up , and she would be flown away ."
"She sits very squat , for the balloons are always tugging at her , and the strain has given her quite a red face ."
"Once she was a new one , because the old one had let go , and David was very sorry for the old one , but as she did let go , he wished he had been there to see ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The Hump , which is the part of the Broad Walk where all the big races are run -RSB- The Gardens are a tremendous big place , with millions and hundreds of trees ; and first you come to the Figs , but you scorn to loiter there , for the Figs is the resort of superior little persons , who are forbidden to mix with the commonalty , and is so named , according to legend , because they dress in full fig ."
"These dainty ones are themselves contemptuously called Figs by David and other heroes , and you have a key to the manners and customs of this dandiacal section of the Gardens when I tell you that cricket is called crickets here ."
"Occasionally a rebel Fig climbs over the fence into the world , and such a one was Miss Mabel Grey , of whom I shall tell you when we come to Miss Mabel Grey 's gate ."
"Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed."
"By chance a poor Brahman came by. ""Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!"" cried the tiger."
"""Nay, my friend,"" replied the Brahman mildly, ""you would probably eat me if I did."""
"""Not at all!"" swore the tiger with many oaths; ""on the contrary, I should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!"""
"Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious Brahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage. Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, ""What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!"""
In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to the justice of the tiger's action.
"So the Brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the matter, but the pipal tree replied coldly, ""What have you to complain about? Don't I give shade and shelter to every one who passes by, and don't they in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle? Don't whimper be a man!"""
"Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a buffalo turning a well-wheel; but he fared no better from it, for it answered, ""You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I gave milk they fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry they yoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!"""
"The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion."
"""My dear sir,"" said the road, ""how foolish you are to expect anything else! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!"""
"On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a jackal, who called out, ""Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look as miserable as a fish out of water!"""
"The Brahman told him all that had occurred. ""How very confusing!"" said the jackal, when the recital was ended; ""would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixed up?"""
"The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way, and still could not understand."
"""It's very odd,"" said he, sadly, ""but it all seems to go in at one ear and out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened, and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment."""
"So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws."
"""You've been away a long time!"" growled the savage beast, ""but now let us begin our dinner."""
"""Our dinner!"" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked together with fright; ""what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!"""
"""Give me five minutes, my lord!"" he pleaded, ""in order that I may explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits."""
"The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again, not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible."
"""Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!"" cried the jackal, wringing its paws. ""Let me see! how did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the tiger came walking by  """
"""Pooh!"" interrupted the tiger, ""what a fool you are! I was in the cage."""
"""Of course!"" cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; ""yes! I was in the cage no I wasn't dear! dear! where are my wits?"
"Let me see the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by  no, that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never understand!"""
"""Yes, you shall!"" returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal's stupidity; ""I'll make you understand! Look here I am the tiger  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the Brahman  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the cage  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And I was in the cage do you understand?"""
"""Yes no   Please, my lord  """
"""He just was a chap to ride!"" they said; ""so grand a knight isn't to be found in the wide world."""
"""Oh!"" said Boots, ""I should so like to have seen him, that I should."""
"""Ah!"" said his brothers, ""his mail shone a deal brighter than the glowing coals which you are always poking and digging at; nasty dirty beast that you are."""
"Next day all the knights and princes were to pass before the king and the Princess it was too late to do so the night before, I suppose that he who had the gold apple might bring it forth; but one came after another, first the Princes, and then the knights, and still no one could show the gold apple."
"""Well,"" said the king, ""some one must have it, for it was something we all saw with our own eyes, how a man came and rode up and bore it off."""
"So he commanded that every man who was in the kingdom should come up to the palace and see if they could show the apple. Well, they all came one after another, but no one had the golden apple, and after a long time the two brothers of Boots came. They were the last of all, so the king asked them if there was no one else in the kingdom who hadn't come."
"""Oh, yes,"" said they; ""we have a brother, but he never carried off the golden apple. He hasn't stirred out of the dusthole on any of the three days."""
"""Never mind that,"" said the king; ""he may as well come up to the palace like the rest."""
So Boots had to go up to the palace.
"""How now,"" said the king; ""have you got the golden apple? Speak out!"""
"""Yes, I have,"" said Boots; ""here is the first, and here is the second, and here is the third too;"" and with that he pulled all three golden apples out of his pocket, and at the same time threw off his sooty rags, and stood before them in his gleaming golden mail."
"""Yes!"" said the king; ""you shall have my daughter, and half my kingdom, for you well deserve both her and it."""
"So they got ready for the wedding, and Boots got the Princess to wife, and there was great merry-making at the bridal-feast, you may fancy, for they could all be merry though they couldn't ride up the Hill of Glass; and all I can say is, if they haven't left off their merry-making yet, why, they're still at it."
THE WIDOW'S SON
"Once on a time there was a poor, poor Widow, who had an only Son."
"She dragged on with the boy till he had been confirmed, and then she said she couldn't feed him any longer, he must just go out and earn his own bread. So the lad wandered out into the world, and when he had walked a day or so, a strange man met him."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man.]"
"""Oh, I'm going out into the world to try and get a place,"" said the lad."
"""Will you come and serve me?"" said the man."
"""Oh, yes; just as soon you as any one else,"" said the lad."
"""Well, you'll have a good place with me,"" said the man; ""for you'll only have to keep me company, and do nothing at all else beside."""
"So the lad stopped with him, and lived on the fat of the land, both in meat and drink, and had little or nothing to do; but he never saw a living soul in that man's house."
So one day the man said:
"""Now, I'm going off for eight days, and that time you'll have to spend here all alone; but you must not go into any one of these four rooms here. If you do, I'll take your life when I come back."""
"""No,"" said the lad, he'd be sure not to do that. But when the man had been gone three or four days, the lad couldn't bear it any longer, but went into the first room, and when he got inside he looked round, but he saw nothing but a shelf over the door where a bramble-bush rod lay."
"Well, indeed! thought the lad; a pretty thing to forbid my seeing this."
"So when the eight days were out, the man came home, and the first thing he said was:"
"""You haven't been into any of these rooms, of course."""
"""No, no; that I haven't,"" said the lad."
"""I'll soon see that,"" said the man, and went at once into the room where the lad had been."
"said the stranger, in his sweetest way; ""but who is the Moth who is punishing him that queer-looking one with a crooked feeler?"""
"""Sir,"" said she, moving farther from him, ""he is a friend of mine, and I do not think it matters to you if he is queer-looking."""
"""Oh!"" said the stranger. ""Oh! oh! oh! You have a bad temper, haven't you? But you are very good-looking in spite of that."" There is no telling what he would have said next, for at this minute Miss Cecropia's friend heard the mean things he was saying, and flew against him."
"It was not long before this stranger also was punished, and then the Moth with the crooked feeler turned to the others. ""Do any of you want to try it?"" he said. ""You must understand that you cannot be rude before her."" And he pointed his right fore leg at Miss Cecropia as she sat trembling on the branch."
"""Her!"" they cried mockingly, as they flew away. ""There are prettier Moths than she. We don't care anything for her."""
"Miss Cecropia's friend would have gone after them to punish them for this impoliteness, but she clung to him and begged him not to. ""You will be killed, I know you will,"" she sobbed. ""And then what will become of me?"""
"""Would you miss me?"" he asked, as he felt of one of his wings, now broken and bare."
"""Yes,"" she cried. ""You are the best friend I have. Please don't go."""
"""But I am such a homely fellow,"" he said. ""I don't see how you can like me since I broke my wing."""
"""Well, I do like you,"" she said. ""Your wing isn't much broken after all, and I like your crooked feeler. It is so different from anybody else's."" Miss Cecropia looked very happy as she spoke, and she quite forgot how she once decided to go away from him. There are some people, you know, who can change their minds in such a sweet and easy way that we almost love them the better for it. One certainly could love Miss Cecropia for this, because it showed that she had learned to care more for a warm heart and courage than for whole wings and straight feelers."
"Mr. Cecropia did not live long after this, unfortunately, but they were very, very happy together, and she often said to her friends, as she laid her eggs in the best places, ""I only hope that when my Caterpillar babies are grown and have come out of their chrysalides, they may be as good and as brave as their father was."""
THE BEES AND THE KINGBIRD
"There was in the forest a great hollow tree where for years a swarm of Bees had made their home. To look at it in winter, one would never guess what a store of honey was sealed up within, but in summer the Bees were always passing in and out, and it was indeed a busy place. Then the Workers had to gather honey and build the cells and look out for the Queen-Mother's many babies. The Queen-Mother had so much care of her eggs that she could really do nothing but attend to them. After they were ready in their cells, the Workers took care of them, and tucked in a lot of bread for the babies to eat when they were hatched. Then there was the bread-making to be done also, and all the Workers helped bring the pollen, or flower-dust, out of which it was made."
"The Drones didn't do anything, not a thing, not a single thing, unless it were taking care of the Queen when she flew away from the tree. They had done that once, but it was long ago, before she had laid an egg and while she was still quite young. They were handsome great fellows, all black and gold, and if you didn't know about them, you might have thought them the pleasantest Bees in the tree. Of course you would not care for them after finding how lazy they were, for people are never liked just because they are fine-looking."
"The Drones always found some excuse for being idle, and like many other lazy people they wanted the busy ones to stop and visit with them. ""What is the hurry?"" they would say. ""There will be more honey that you can get to-morrow. Stop a while now."""
"But the Workers would shake their brown heads and buzz impatiently as they answered, ""We can get to-morrow's honey when to-morrow comes, but to-day's honey must be gathered to-day."""
"Then the Drones would grumble and say that they didn't see the sense of storing up so much honey anyway. That also was like lazy people the world over, for however much they scold about getting the food, they are sure to eat just as much as anybody else. Sometimes lazy people eat even more than others, and pick for the best too."
"On cloudy days, the Workers did stay at home in the tree, but not to play. They clung to the walls and to each other and made wax. It took much patience to make wax. When they were gathering honey there was so much that was interesting to be seen, and so many friends to meet, that it was really quite exciting; but when they made wax they had to hang for a long, long time, until the wax gathered in flakes over their bodies. Then it was ready to scrape off and shape into six-sided cells to hold honey or to be homes for the babies."
One sunshiny morning the Queen-Mother stopped laying her eggs and cried:
"""Listen! did you hear that?"""
"""What?"" asked the Workers, crowding around her."
"""Why, that noise,"" she said. ""It sounded like a bird calling 'Kyrie!"
"K-y-rie!' and I thought I heard a Worker buzzing outside a minute ago, but no one has come in. I am afraid "" and here she stopped."
"""Of what are you afraid!"" asked the Drones, who, having nothing to do but eat and sleep, were always ready to talk about anything and everything. The great trouble with them was that if you once began to talk they did not like to have you leave and go to work."
"""Why,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I don't want to alarm you, but I thought it was a Kingbird."""
"""Well, what if it was?"" said a big Drone. ""There is only one of him and there are a great many of us."""
"""Yes,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""but there may not be so many of us very long if he begins to watch the tree. I have lived much longer than you and I know how Kingbirds act."""
"This was true, for Queens live to be very old, and Drones never live long because they are so lazy."
"""Well,"" said the big Drone, ""we must find out about this. Just fly around and see if it is a Kingbird,"" he said to a Worker. ""We must know about things before we act."""
"""Suppose you should go,"" she replied. ""I have my leg-pockets full of pollen, and it ought to be made into bread at once. I never saw Larvæ so hungry as these last ones are."""
"""I only wish that I could go,"" said the big Drone, limping as he got out of her way; ""but my fifth foot just stepped on my third foot, and I can hardly move."""
THE UNDECIDED RATTLESNAKE
"It is not often that one of the Forest People has any trouble about making up his mind, but there was one large Rattlesnake who had great difficulty in doing so. She lived in the southern edge of the forest, where the sunshine was clear and warm, and there were delightful crevices among the rocks in which she and all her friends and relatives could hide."
"It seemed very strange that so old a Snake should be so undecided as she was. It must be that she had a careless mother who did not bring her up in the right way. If that were so, one should indeed be sorry for her."
"Still even that would be no real excuse, for was she not old enough now to train herself? She had seven joints in the rattle on her tail and an eighth one growing, so you can see that she was no longer young, although, being healthy, she had grown her new joints and changed her skin oftener than some of her friends. In fact, she had grown children of her own, and if it had not been that they took after their father, they would have been a most helpless family. Fortunately for them, their father was a very decided Snake."
"Yes, it was exceedingly lucky for them. It may not have been so good a thing for him. His wife was always glad to have things settled for her, and when he said, ""We will do this,"" she answered, ""Yes, dear."" When he said, ""We will not do that,"" she murmured, ""No, dear."" And when he said, ""What shall we do?"" she would reply, ""Oh, I don't know. What do you think we might better do?"" He did not very often ask her opinion, and there were people in the forest who said he would never have talked matters over with her if he had not known that she would leave the decision to him."
"Now this is a bad way in which to have things go in any family, and it happened here as it would anywhere. He grew more and more selfish from having his own way all of the time, and his wife became less and less able to take care of herself. Most people thought him a very devoted husband. Perhaps he was. It is easy to be a devoted husband if you always have your own way."
"One night Mr. Rattlesnake did not return to their home. Nobody ever knew what had become of him. The Red Squirrel said that Mrs. Goldfinch said that the biggest little Rabbit had told her that the Ground Hog had overheard Mr. Crow say that he thought he saw somebody that looked like Mr. Rattlesnake chasing a Field Mouse over toward the farm, but that he might have been mistaken. This was all so uncertain that Mrs."
Rattlesnake knew no more than she had known before. It was very trying.
"""If I only knew positively,"" she said to her friend, Mrs. Striped Snake, ""I could do something, although I am sure I don't know what it would be."""
"Mrs. Striped Snake tried to help her. ""Why not have one of your children come home to live with you?"" she said pleasantly, for this year's children were now old enough to shift for themselves."
"""I've thought of that,"" answered Mrs. Rattlesnake, ""but I like a quiet life, and you know how it is. Young Snakes will be young Snakes."
"Besides, I don't think they would want to come back."""
"""Well, why not be alone, then?"""
"""Oh, it is so lonely,"" replied Mrs. Rattlesnake, with a sigh."
"""Everything reminds me so of my husband, and that makes me sad. If I lived somewhere else it would be different."""
"""Then why not move?"" said Mrs. Striped Snake, briskly. ""I would do that."
"Find a nice crack in the rock just big enough for one, or make a cosy little hole in the ground somewhere near here. Then if he comes back he can find you easily. I would do that. I certainly would."""
"She spoke so firmly that Mrs. Rattlesnake said she would, she would to-morrow. And her friend went home thinking it was all settled. That shows how little she really knew Mrs. Rattlesnake."
"The more Mrs. Rattlesnake thought it over that night, the more she dreaded moving. ""If he does not come back,"" she sighed, ""I may marry again in the spring, and then I might have to move once more. I believe I will ask somebody else what I ought to do."""
"So in the morning she began to consult her friends. They all told her to move, and she decided to do it. Then she could not make up her mind whether to take a rock-crevice or make a hole in the ground. It took another day of visiting to settle that it should be a hole in the ground. A fourth day was spent in finding just the right place for her home, and on the fifth day she began work."
"By the time the sun was over the tree-tops, she wished she had chosen some other place, and thought best to stop and talk to some of her friends about it. When she returned she found herself obliged to cast her skin, which had been growing tight and dry for some time. This was hard work, and she was too tired to go on with her home-making, so she lay in the sunshine and admired her beautiful, long, and shining body of reddish brown spotted with black. Her rattle had eight joints now, for when a Rattlesnake casts the old skin a new joint is always uncovered at the end of the tail. She waved it quickly to see how an eight-jointed rattle would sound. ""Lovely!"" she said. ""Lovely! Like the seeds of the wild cucumber shaking around in their dry and prickly case."""
"One could not tell all the things that happened that fall, or how very, very, very tired her friends became of having her ask their advice. She changed her mind more times than there are seeds in a milkweed pod, and the only thing of which she was always sure was eating. When there was food in sight she did not stop for anybody's advice. She ate it as fast as she could, and if she had any doubts about the wisdom of doing so, she kept them to herself."
"When winter came she had just got her new home ready, and after all she went when invited to spend the winter with a cave party of other Snakes."
"They coiled themselves together in a great mass and slept there until spring. As the weather grew warmer, they began to stir, wriggling and twisting themselves free."
Two bachelor Snakes asked her to marry. One was a fine old fellow with a twelve-jointed rattle. The other was just her own age.
"""To be sure I will,"" she cried, and the pits between her nostrils and her ears looked more like dimples than ever. ""Only you must wait until I can make up my mind which one to marry."""
"""Oh, no,"" they answered, ""don't go to all that trouble. We will fight and decide it for you."""
"It was a long fight, and the older of the two Snakes had a couple of joints broken off from his rattle before it was over. Still he beat the other one and drove him away. When he came back for his bride he found her crying. ""What is the matter?"" said he, quite sternly."
"""Oh, that p-poor other b-bachelor!"" she sobbed. ""I b-believe I will g-go after him. I think p-perhaps I l-love him the b-better."""
"""No, you don't, Mrs. Rattlesnake,"" said the fine old fellow who had just won the fight. ""You will do no such thing. You will marry me and never speak to him again. When I have lost two joints of my rattle in fighting for you, I intend to have you myself, and I say that you love me very dearly. Do you hear?"""
"""Yes, darling,"" she answered, as she wiped her eyes on the grass, ""very dearly."" And they lived most happily together."
"""He reminds me so much of the first Mr. Rattlesnake,"" she said to her friends. ""So strong, so firm, so quick to decide!"""
"He had a good mind to try it. There was nobody to watch him, and he crept up the trunk of a fallen tree which leaned over against its neighbors. It was a foolish thing to do, and he knew it, but young Rabbits are too full of mischief to always be wise."
"""I will hold my hind legs very still,"" he thought, ""and flap my forelegs for wings."" With that he jumped off and came crashing down upon the dry leaves. He felt weak and dizzy, and as he picked himself up and looked around he hoped that nobody had seen him. ""It may be a great deal of fun to fly,"" he said, ""but it is no fun alighting from your flight unless you have real feather wings. It is too bumpy when you fly with your legs."""
"At this minute he heard an old Gobbler call out, and saw the flock of Turkeys coming toward him. ""Wake up! Wake up!"" he cried to the Ground Hog. But the Ground Hog never moved."
"Still the Turkeys came nearer. The Rabbit could see that the fat old ones were getting ahead of the others, and that here and there a young or weak Turkey had to drop into the river and swim, because his wings were tired. They got so near that he could see the queer little tufts of wiry feathers which the Gobblers wear hanging from their breast, and could see the swaying scarlet wattles under their beaks. He called again to the Ground Hog, and getting no answer, poked him three times with his head."
"The Ground Hog turned over, stretched, yawned, moved his jaws a few times as though he dreamed of eating fresh spring grass, and then fell asleep once more. After that the Rabbit left him alone."
"The first to alight were the Gobblers, and they began at once to strut and chatter. Next came the mother Turkeys and their young, and last of all came the weak ones who swam across. It was a fine sight to see them come in. The swimmers spread their tails, folded their wings tightly, stretched their necks, and struck out swiftly and strongly with their feet."
"The young Rabbit could hear a group of mothers talking together. ""The Gobblers are growing quite fond of the children,"" said one."
"""Yes,"" said another; ""my husband told me yesterday that he was very proud of our little ones."""
"""Well, it is the season for them to begin to walk together,"" said the first speaker; ""but I never in my life had such a time as I had this spring. I thought my husband would break every egg I laid."""
"""I had a hard time too,"" said the other. ""None of my eggs were broken, but after my chicks were hatched I had to hurry them out of their father's sight a dozen times a day."""
"""It is very trying,"" said a third mother Turkey with a sigh; ""but that is always the way with the Gobblers. I suppose the dear fellows can't help it;"" and she looked lovingly over at her husband as he strutted around with his friends. You would not have believed if you had seen her fond looks, and heard her husband's tender ""Gobble,"" that they had hardly spoken to each other all summer. To be sure, it was not now as it had been in the springtime. Then he would have beaten any other Gobbler who came near her, he loved her so; still, the Rabbit could see as he watched them that when he found some very large and fine acorns, this Gobbler would not eat them all, but called his wife to come and share with him; and he knew that they were happy together in their own Turkey way of being happy."
At this minute the Ground Hog opened his eyes and staggered to his feet.
"The loud talking had awakened him. He did not look very dignified just now. His fur was rumpled, and he blinked often from sleepiness. There was a dry leaf caught on one of his ears, too, that made him look very odd. The Rabbit wanted to laugh, but he did not dare to do so. The Ground Hog walked toward the Gobblers, and raised himself on his haunches."
"""Good-evening, good-evening,"" said he (it was really morning, you know). ""We are very glad to welcome you to the forest. Make yourselves perfectly at home. The grass is not so tender as it was a while ago, yet I think that you will find good feeding,"" and he waved his paws politely."
"""Thank-you, thank-you!"" answered the Gobblers, while the mothers and young Turkeys came crowding up to look at the Ground Hog. ""We came for the acorns and nuts. We shall certainly enjoy ourselves."""
"""That is right,"" said the Ground Hog heartily. ""We have a very fine forest here. You will pardon me for remarking it. The Pond People have a saying that is very true: 'It's a mighty poor Frog that won't croak for his own puddle.' And my grandfather used to say that if a Ground Hog didn't love his own home he was a very poor Hog indeed. Good-night, my friends, good-night."" And he trotted happily away, followed by the Rabbit."
"When he was gone, the Turkeys said: ""How very kind of him!"" and ""What fine manners!"" And the young Rabbit thought to himself: ""It is queer. He was sleepy and his fur was rumpled, and that leaf bobbed around his ear when he talked. He said 'evening' instead of 'morning,' and spoke as though Turkeys came here to eat grass. And yet they all liked him, and were pleased by what he said."""
You see the young Rabbit had not yet learned that the power of fine manners is more than that of looks; and that people could not think of the Ground Hog's mistakes in speaking because they knew his kindness of heart.
THE TRAVELLERS GO SOUTH
"One night a maple tree, the very one under which Mr. Red Squirrel sat when he first came to the forest, dreamed of her winter resting-time, and when she awakened early in the morning she found that her leaves were turning yellow. They were not all brightly colored, but on each was an edging, or a tip, or a splash of gold. You may be sure that the Forest People noticed it at once."
"""I told you so,"" chirruped a Robin to her mate. ""The Orioles went long ago, and the Bobolinks start to-day. We must think about our trip to the South."" When she said this, she hopped restlessly from twig to twig with an air of being exceedingly busy."
"Her husband did not answer, but began to arrange his new coat of feathers. Perhaps he was used to her fussy ways and thought it just as well to keep still. He knew that none of the Robins would start South until the weather became much colder, and he did not think it necessary to talk about it yet. Perhaps, too, Mr. Robin was a trifle contrary and was all the more slow and quiet because his wife was uneasy. In that case one could hardly blame her for talking over the family plans with the neighbors."
"Later in the day, a Bobolink came up from the marsh to say good-by. He had on his travelling suit of striped brown, and you would never have known him for the same gay fellow who during the spring and early summer wore black and buff and sang so heartily and sweetly. Now he did not sing at all, and slipped silently from bush to bush, only speaking when he had to. He was a good fellow and everyone disliked to have him go."
"Mrs. Cowbird came up while they were talking. Now that she did not care to lay any more eggs, the other birds were quite friendly with her. They began to talk over the summer that was past, and said how finely the young birds were coming on. ""By the way,"" said she, in the most careless manner possible, ""I ought to have a few children round here somewhere."
"Can anybody tell me where they are?"""
"Mrs. Goldfinch looked at her husband and he looked at the sky. The Warblers and the Vireos, who had known about the strange egg in the Goldfinches' nest, had already left for the winter, and there seemed to be no use in telling their secret now or quarrelling over what was past."
"Some of the other birds might have told Mrs. Cowbird a few things, but they also kept still."
"""It is a shame,"" she said. ""I never laid a finer lot of eggs in my life, and I was very careful where I put them. I wish I knew how many there were, but I forgot to count. I have been watching and watching for my little birds to join our flock; I was sure I should know them if I saw them. Mothers have such fine feelings, you know, in regard to their children."" (As though she had any right to say that!)"
"The Mourning Doves were there with their young son and daughter, and you could see by looking at them that they were an affectionate family. ""We shall be the last to go South,"" they cooed. ""We always mean to come North in the very early spring and stay as late as possible. This year we came much later than usual, but it could not be helped."" They had spoken so before, and rather sadly. It was said that they could tell a sorrowful story if they would; but they did not wish to sadden others by it, and bore their troubles together bravely and lovingly."
"""How do the new feathers work?"" asked a Crow, flying up at this minute and looking blacker than ever in his fall coat. Then all the birds began to talk about dress. As soon as their broods were raised, you know, their feathers had begun to drop out, and they had kept on moulting until all of the old ones were gone and the new ones on. When birds are moulting they never feel well, and when it is over they are both happy and proud."
"""I changed later than usual this year,"" said the Crow, ""and I feel that I have the very latest fashions."" This was a joke which he must have picked up among the Barnyard People, and nobody knows where they got it. Fashions never change in the Forest."
The Fairy Flower
And she held the little Rabbit close in her arms and flew with him into the wood.
"It was light now, for the moon had risen. All the forest was beautiful, and the fronds of the bracken shone like frosted silver. In the open glade between the tree-trunks the wild rabbits danced with their shadows on the velvet grass, but when they saw the Fairy they all stopped dancing and stood round in a ring to stare at her."
"""I've brought you a new playfellow,"" the Fairy said. ""You must be very kind to him and teach him all he needs to know in Rabbit-land, for he is going to live with you for ever and ever!"""
And she kissed the little Rabbit again and put him down on the grass.
"""Run and play, little Rabbit!"" she said."
But the little Rabbit sat quite still for a moment and never moved.
"For when he saw all the wild rabbits dancing around him he suddenly remembered about his hind legs, and he didn't want them to see that he was made all in one piece. He did not know that when the Fairy kissed him that last time she had changed him altogether. And he might have sat there a long time, too shy to move, if just then something hadn't tickled his nose, and before he thought what he was doing he lifted his hind toe to scratch it."
"And he found that he actually had hind legs! Instead of dingy velveteen he had brown fur, soft and shiny, his ears twitched by themselves, and his whiskers were so long that they brushed the grass."
"He gave one leap and the joy of using those hind legs was so great that he went springing about the turf on them, jumping sideways and whirling round as the others did, and he grew so excited that when at last he did stop to look for the Fairy she had gone."
"He was a Real Rabbit at last, at home with the other rabbits."
At Last! At Last!
"Autumn passed and Winter, and in the Spring, when the days grew warm and sunny, the Boy went out to play in the wood behind the house. And while he was playing, two rabbits crept out from the bracken and peeped at him. One of them was brown all over, but the other had strange markings under his fur, as though long ago he had been spotted, and the spots still showed through. And about his little soft nose and his round black eyes there was something familiar, so that the Boy thought to himself:"
"""Why, he looks just like my old Bunny that was lost when I had scarlet fever!"""
"But he never knew that it really was his own Bunny, come back to look at the child who had first helped him to be Real."
The Book of DRAGONS
I. The Book of Beasts
"He happened to be building a Palace when the news came, and he left all the bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear up but then the news was rather remarkable news. You see, there was a knock at the front door and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it was the man come to see about the gas, which had not been allowed to be lighted since the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping rope to the gas bracket."
"And then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in and said, ""Master Lionel, dear, they've come to fetch you to go and be King."""
"Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands and brush his hair, and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept wriggling and fidgeting and saying, ""Oh, don't, Nurse,"" and, ""I'm sure my ears are quite clean,"" or, ""Never mind my hair, it's all right,"" and, ""That'll do."""
"""You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King,"""
said Nurse.
"The minute Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting for his clean handkerchief, and in the drawing room there were two very grave-looking gentlemen in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with velvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very expensive jam tarts."
"They bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said: ""Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is dead, and now you have got to come and be King."""
"""Yes, please, sir,"" said Lionel, ""when does it begin?"""
"""You will be crowned this afternoon,"" said the grave gentleman who was not quite so grave-looking as the other."
"""Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be fetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace collar?"" said Lionel, who had often been out to tea."
"""Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later. No, never mind about changing your suit; the Royal robes will cover all that up."""
"The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses, which was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived. It was No."
"7, on the left-hand side of the street as you go up."
"Presently the cab drew up near the pillar, and there was the dragon, his ugly purple head shining in the sun, and his ugly purple mouth half open."
"Uncle James said: ""Good morning, sir. We have brought you a small present for your birthday. We do not like to let such an anniversary go by without some suitable testimonial, especially to one who is a stranger in our midst. Our means are small, but our hearts are large. We have but one Princess, but we give her freely do we not, my child?"""
"The Princess said she supposed so, and the dragon came a little nearer."
"Suddenly a voice cried: ""Run!"" and there was Tom, and he had brought the Zoological guinea pig and a pair of Belgian hares with him. ""Just to see fair,"" said Tom."
"Uncle James was furious. ""What do you mean, sir,"" he cried, ""by intruding on a State function with your common rabbits and things? Go away, naughty little boy, and play with them somewhere else."""
"But while he was speaking the rabbits had come up one on each side of him, their great sides towering ever so high, and now they pressed him between them so that he was buried in their thick fur and almost choked."
"The Princess, meantime, had run to the other side of the pillar and was peeping around it to see what was going on. A crowd had followed the cab out of the town; now they reached the scene of the ""State Function"" and they all cried out: ""Fair play play fair! We can't go back on our word like this. Give a thing and take a thing? Why, it's never done. Let the poor exiled stranger dragon have his birthday present."" And they tried to get at Tom but the guinea pig stood in the way."
"""Yes,"" Tom cried. ""Fair play is a jewel. And your helpless exile shall have the Princess if he can catch her. Now then, Mary Ann."""
"Mary Ann looked around the big pillar and called to the dragon: ""Bo! you can't catch me,"" and began to run as fast as ever she could, and the dragon ran after her. When the Princess had run a half mile she stopped, dodged around a tree, and ran back to the pillar and around it, and the dragon after her. You see, he was so long he could not turn as quickly as she could. Around and around the pillar ran the Princess. The first time she ran around a long way from the pillar, and then nearer and nearer with the dragon after her all the time; and he was so busy trying to catch her that he never noticed that Tom had tied the very end of his long, tight, whipcordy tail to the rock, so that the more the dragon ran around, the more times he twisted his tail around the pillar."
"It was exactly like winding a top only the peg was the pillar, and the dragon's tail was the string. And the magician was safe between the Belgian hares, and couldn't see anything but darkness, or do anything but choke."
"When the dragon was wound onto the pillar as much as he possibly could be, and as tight like cotton on a reel the Princess stopped running, and though she had very little breath left, she managed to say, ""Yah who's won now?"""
"This annoyed the dragon so much that he put out all his strength spread his great purple wings, and tried to fly at her. Of course this pulled his tail, and pulled it very hard, so hard that as he pulled the tail had to come, and the pillar had to come around with the tail, and the island had to come around with the pillar, and in another minute the tail was loose, and the island was spinning around exactly like a top. It spun so fast that everyone fell flat on their faces and held on tight to themselves, because they felt something was going to happen."
"All but the magician, who was choking between the Belgian hares, and felt nothing but fur and fury."
"And something did happen. The dragon had sent the kingdom of Rotundia spinning the way it ought to have gone at the beginning of the world, and as it spun around, all the animals began to change sizes. The guinea pigs got small, and the elephants got big, and the men and women and children would have changed sizes too, if they had not had the sense to hold on to themselves, very tight indeed, with both hands; which, of course, the animals could not be expected to know how to do. And the best of it was that when the small beasts got big and the big beasts got small the dragon got small too, and fell at the Princess's feet a little, crawling, purple newt with wings."
"""Funny little thing,"" said the Princess, when she saw it. ""I will take it for a birthday present."""
"But while all the people were still on their faces, holding on tight to themselves, Uncle James, the magician, never thought of holding tight he only thought of how to punish Belgian hares and the sons of gardeners; so when the big beasts grew small, he grew small with the other beasts, and the little purple dragon, when he fell at the Princess's feet, saw there a very small magician named Uncle James. And the dragon took him because it wanted a birthday present."
"So now all the animals were new sizes and at first it seemed very strange to everyone to have great lumbering elephants and a tiny little dormouse, but they have gotten used to it now, and think no more of it than we do."
"All this happened several years ago, and the other day I saw in the Rotundia Times an account of the wedding of the Princess with Lord Thomas Gardener, K.C.D., and I knew she could not have married anyone but Tom, so I suppose they made him a Lord on purpose for the wedding and K.C.D., of course, means Clever Conqueror of the Dragon."
"If you think that is wrong it is only because you don't know how they spell in Rotundia. The paper said that among the beautiful presents of the bridegroom to the bride was an enormous elephant, on which the bridal pair made their wedding tour. This must have been Fido. You remember Tom promised to give him back to the Princess when they were married. The Rotundia Times called the married couple ""the happy pair."" It was clever of the paper to think of calling them that it is such a pretty and novel expression, and I think it is truer than many of the things you see in papers."
"Because, you see, the Princess and the gardener's son were so fond of each other they could not help being happy and besides, they had an elephant of their very own to ride on. If that is not enough to make people happy, I should like to know what is. Though, of course, I know there are some people who could not be happy unless they had a whale to sail on, and perhaps not even then. But they are greedy, grasping people, the kind who would take four helps of pudding, as likely as not, which neither Tom nor Mary Ann ever did."
III. The Deliverers of Their Country
"It all began with Effie's getting something in her eye. It hurt very much indeed, and it felt something like a red-hot spark only it seemed to have legs as well, and wings like a fly. Effie rubbed and cried not real crying, but the kind your eye does all by itself without your being miserable inside your mind and then she went to her father to have the thing in her eye taken out. Effie's father was a doctor, so of course he knew how to take things out of eyes he did it very cleverly with a soft paintbrush dipped in castor oil."
"When he had gotten the thing out, he said: ""This is very curious."" Effie had often got things in her eye before, and her father had always seemed to think it was natural rather tiresome and naughty perhaps, but still natural. He had never before thought it curious."
"Effie stood holding her handkerchief to her eye, and said: ""I don't believe it's out."" People always say this when they have had something in their eyes."
"""Oh, yes it's out,"" said the doctor. ""Here it is, on the brush. This is very interesting."""
"Effie had never heard her father say that about anything that she had any share in. She said: ""What?"""
"The doctor carried the brush very carefully across the room, and held the point of it under his microscope then he twisted the brass screws of the microscope, and looked through the top with one eye."
"""Dear me,"" he said. ""Dear, dear me! Four well-developed limbs; a long caudal appendage; five toes, unequal in lengths, almost like one of the Lacertidae, yet there are traces of wings."" The creature under his eye wriggled a little in the castor oil, and he went on: ""Yes; a batlike wing. A new specimen, undoubtedly. Effie, run round to the professor and ask him to be kind enough to step in for a few minutes."""
"""You might give me sixpence, Daddy,"" said Effie, ""because I did bring you the new specimen. I took great care of it inside my eye, and my eye does hurt."""
"The doctor was so pleased with the new specimen that he gave Effie a shilling, and presently the professor stepped round. He stayed to lunch, and he and the doctor quarreled very happily all the afternoon about the name and the family of the thing that had come out of Effie's eye."
"""Oh, I'm so fond of you, I couldn't help doing it when I knew that your heart lay there,"" said the Princess."
"""How can you be so silly as to believe any such thing?"" said the Giant."
"""Oh yes; how can I help believing it, when you say it?"" said the Princess."
"""You're a goose,"" said the Giant; ""where my heart is, you will never come."""
"""Well,"" said the Princess; ""but for all that, 'twould be such a pleasure to know where it really lies."""
"Then the poor Giant could hold out no longer, but was forced to say:"
"""Far, far away in a lake lies an island; on that island stands a church; in that church is a well; in that well swims a duck; in that duck there is an egg, and in that egg there lies my heart, you darling!"""
"In the morning early, while it was still grey dawn, the Giant strode off to the wood."
"""Yes! now I must set off too,"" said Boots; ""if I only knew how to find the way."" He took a long, long farewell of the Princess, and when he got out of the Giant's door, there stood the Wolf waiting for him. So Boots told him all that had happened inside the house, and said now he wished to ride to the well in the church, if he only knew the way. So the Wolf bade him jump on his back, he'd soon find the way; and away they went, till the wind whistled after them, over hedge and field, over hill and dale. After they had travelled many, many days, they came at last to the lake. Then the Prince did not know how to get over it, but the Wolf bade him only not be afraid, but stick on, and so he jumped into the lake with the Prince on his back, and swam over to the island. So they came to the church; but the church keys hung high, high up on the top of the tower, and at first the Prince did not know how to get them down."
"""You must call on the raven,"" said the Wolf."
"So the Prince called on the raven, and in a trice the raven came, and flew up and fetched the keys, and so the Prince got into the church. But when he came to the well, there lay the duck, and swam about backwards and forwards, just as the Giant had said. So the Prince stood and coaxed it, till it came to him, and he grasped it in his hand; but just as he lifted it up from the water the duck dropped the egg into the well, and then Boots was beside himself to know how to get it out again."
"""Well, now you must call on the salmon to be sure,"" said the Wolf; and the king's son called on the salmon, and the salmon came and fetched up the egg from the bottom of the well."
"Then the Wolf told him to squeeze the egg, and as soon as ever he squeezed it the Giant screamed out."
"""Squeeze it again,"" said the Wolf; and when the Prince did so, the Giant screamed still more piteously, and begged and prayed so prettily to be spared, saying he would do all that the Prince wished if he would only not squeeze his heart in two."
"""Tell him, if he will restore to life again your six brothers and their brides, whom he has turned to stone, you will spare his life,"""
"said the Wolf. Yes, the Giant was ready to do that, and he turned the six brothers into king's sons again, and their brides into king's daughters."
"""Now, squeeze the egg in two,"" said the Wolf. So Boots squeezed the egg to pieces, and the Giant burst at once."
"Now, when he had made an end of the Giant, Boots rode back again on the Wolf to the Giant's house, and there stood all his six brothers alive and merry, with their brides. Then Boots went into the hill-side after his bride, and so they all set off home again to their father's house. And you may fancy how glad the old king was when he saw all his seven sons come back, each with his bride ""But the loveliest bride of all is the bride of Boots, after all,"" said the king, ""and he shall sit uppermost at the table, with her by his side."""
"So he sent out, and called a great wedding-feast, and the mirth was both loud and long, and if they have not done feasting, why, they are still at it."
THE PRINCESS ON THE GLASS HILL
"Once on a time there was a man who had a meadow, which lay high up on the hill-side, and in the meadow was a barn, which he had built to keep his hay in. Now, I must tell you, there hadn't been much in the barn for the last year or two, for every St. John's night, when the grass stood greenest and deepest, the meadow was eaten down to the very ground the next morning, just as if a whole drove of sheep had been there feeding on it over night. This happened once, and it happened twice; so at last the man grew weary of losing his crop of hay, and said to his sons for he had three of them, and the youngest was nicknamed Boots, of course that now one of them must go and sleep in the barn in the outlying field when St. John's night came, for it was too good a joke that his grass should be eaten, root and blade, this year, as it had been the last two years. So whichever of them went must keep a sharp look-out; that was what their father said."
"Well, the eldest son was ready to go and watch the meadow; trust him for looking after the grass! It shouldn't be his fault if man or beast, or the fiend himself, got a blade of grass. So, when evening came, he set off to the barn, and lay down to sleep; but a little on in the night came such a clatter, and such an earthquake, that walls and roof shook, and groaned, and creaked; then up jumped the lad, and took to his heels as fast as ever he could; nor dared he once look round till he reached home; and as for the hay, why it was eaten up this year just as it had been twice before."
"The next St. John's night, the man said again, it would never do to lose all the grass in the outlying field year after year in this way, so one of his sons must just trudge off to watch it, and watch it well too. Well, the next oldest son was ready to try his luck, so he set off, and lay down to sleep in the barn as his brother had done before him; but as the night wore on, there came on a rumbling and quaking of the earth, worse even than on the last St. John's night, and when the lad heard it, he got frightened, and took to his heels as though he were running a race."
"Next year the turn came to Boots; but when he made ready to go, the other two began to laugh and to make game of him, saying:"
"""You're just the man to watch the hay, that you are; you, who have done nothing all your life but sit in the ashes and toast yourself by the fire."""
"But Boots did not care a pin for their chattering, and stumped away as evening grew on, up the hill-side to the outlying field. There he went inside the barn and lay down; but in about an hour's time the barn began to groan and creak, so that it was dreadful to hear."
"""Well,"" said Boots to himself, ""if it isn't worse than this, I can stand it well enough."""
"A little while after came another creak and an earthquake, so that the litter in the barn flew about the lad's ears. ""Oh!"" said Boots to himself, ""if it isn't worse than this, I daresay I can stand it out."""
"But just then came a third rumbling, and a third earthquake, so that the lad thought walls and roof were coming down on his head; but it passed off, and all was still as death about him."
"And the Snow Buntings and Juncos, who are bright and honest, nodded their dainty little heads and said, ""Nobody in our own dear north country ever spoke a truer word than that."" So they became firm friends of the Ground Hog, even if he were not so large as the rock."
THE END.
True Stories of Wonderful Deeds
The Royal Oak
"There is in Shropshire a fine oak-tree which the country people there call the ""Royal Oak"". They say it is the great-grandson, or perhaps the great-great-grandson of another fine old oak, which more than two hundred years ago stood on the same spot, and served once as a shelter to an English king. This king was Charles II, the son of the unlucky Charles I who had his head cut off by his subjects because he was a weak and selfish ruler."
"On the very day on which that unhappy king lost his head, the Parliament passed a law forbidding anyone to make his son, Prince Charles of Wales, or any other person, king of England. But the Scottish people did not obey this law. They persuaded the young prince to sign a paper, solemnly promising to rule the country as they wished; then they crowned him king. As soon as the Parliament heard of this they sent Cromwell and his Ironsides against the newly-crowned king and his followers, and after several battles the Scottish army was at last broken up and scattered at Worcester."
"Charles fled and hid in a wood, where some poor wood-cutters took care of him and helped him. He put on some of their clothes, cut his hair short, and stained his face and hands brown so that he might appear to be a sunburnt workman like them. But it was some time before he could escape from the wood, for Cromwell's soldiers were searching it in the hope of finding some of the king's men. One day, Charles and two of his friends had to climb into the tall oak to avoid being caught. They had with them some food, which proved very useful, for they were obliged to stay in their strange hiding-place for a whole day. The top of the oak-tree had been cut off some few years before this time, and this had made the lower branches grow thick and bushy, so that people walking below could not easily see through them. It was a fortunate thing for Charles, for while he was in the tree, he heard the soldiers beating the boughs and bushes in the wood as they searched here and there, and even caught glimpses of them through the leaves as they rode about below."
"When they had gone, without even glancing up into the tall oak-tree, he came down, and rode away from the wood on an old mill-horse, with his friends the wood-cutters walking beside him to take care of him as best they could. The saddle was a poor one, and the horse's pace jolted Charles so much, that at last he cried out that he had never seen so bad a steed. At this the owner of the horse jestingly told him that he should not find fault with the poor animal, which had never before carried the weight of three kingdoms upon its back. He meant, of course, that Charles was king of the three kingdoms of England, and Scotland, and Ireland."
"Carried by the old horse, and helped by the poor wood-cutters, Charles at last reached the house of a friend. Here he hid for a time, and then went on to try and escape from the country. This time, so that he might not be discovered, he was dressed as a servant, and rode on horseback, with a lady sitting on a cushion behind him, as was then the fashion."
After several more dangers he managed to get on board a ship and sailed away to France.
Bonnie Prince Charlie
"Prince Charlie was the grandson of King James II, who was driven away from the throne of England because he was a selfish man and a bad ruler."
"The young prince tried to win the crown back again. He came over to Scotland from France, with only seven followers; but soon a great many of the Scots joined him, for he was so gay, and handsome, and friendly, that all who saw him loved him. They called him ""Bonnie Prince Charlie""."
"But though the prince and his followers were very brave, they had no chance against the well-trained soldiers of King George of England. They won a few victories; then they were thoroughly beaten in the battle of Culloden. Thousands of brave Scots were slain, and the prince had to fly for his life."
"After this, for many weeks, he hid among the moors and mountains from the English soldiers who were trying to find him. He lived in small huts, or in caves, and many times had nothing but the wild berries from the woods to eat. Once he stayed for three weeks with a band of robbers, who were very kind to him; and though the king offered a large sum of money to anyone who would give him up, not one of his poor friends was false to him."
"At last, a young and beautiful Scottish lady, named Flora MacDonald, helped him to escape. She gave him woman's clothes, and pretended that he was her servant, called Betty Burke. Then she took him with her away from the place where the soldiers were searching, and after a time he reached the sea, and got safely away to France."
Nelson and Hardy
"Lord Nelson was one of the greatest seamen that ever lived. He commanded the British fleet at the battle of Trafalgar, when the navies of France and Spain were beaten, and England was saved from a great danger. He did not look like a famous admiral on board his ship, the Victory, that day. He was a small man, and his clothes were shabby. He had lost one arm and one eye in battle; but with the eye which remained he could see more than most men with two, and his brain was busy planning the course of the coming fight. Just before it began, he went over his ship, giving orders to the crew, and cheering them with kind words, which touched the hearts of the rough men, who loved their leader and were proud of him."
"""England expects every man to do his duty"" was the last message he sent them. Every man did his duty nobly that day, though the battle was fierce and long; but it was the last fight of the brave commander. He was shot in the back as he walked the deck with his friend Captain Hardy, and was carried below."
"He lay dying for several hours, but, in spite of his great pain, his one thought was of the battle. ""How goes the day with us?"" he asked of Hardy; and when told that many of the enemies' ships were taken, he cried eagerly, ""I am glad. Whip them, Hardy, as they have never been whipped before."" Later, when his friend came to tell him that the victory was won, Nelson pressed his hand. ""Good-bye, Hardy!"" said he, ""I have done my duty, and I thank God for it."" These were the last words of one of England's bravest sons."
Watt and the Kettle
"There was once a little Scotch boy named James Watt. He was not a strong child, and could not always run and play with other boys, but had often to amuse himself at home. One holiday afternoon little James amused himself in this way. He held a saucer over the stream of steam which came from the spout of a boiling kettle, and as he watched he saw little drops of water forming on the saucer. He thought this was very strange, and wondered why it happened, for he did not know that steam is just water changed in form by the heat, and that as soon as it touches something cold it turns again into water. He asked his aunt to explain it, but she only told him not to waste his time. If she could have foreseen the work which her nephew would do when he became a man, she would not have thought he was wasting his time."
"When James Watt grew up, he was as much interested in steam and its wonderful power, as he had been as a boy. He was sure it could be made of great service to men. It was already used for driving engines, but the engines were not good, and it cost much money to work them. Watt thought they could be improved, but it was long before he found out the way to do this. Often, he sat by the fire watching the lid of the kettle as it was made to dance by the steam, and thinking of many plans; and at last a happy thought came to him. His plan enabled great improvements to be made in the working of engines, and now steam drives our trains and ships, our mills and factories, and is one of our most useful servants."
Queen Victoria and her Soldiers
"Queen Victoria was always proud of her brave soldiers. In time of war, she gave orders that news of them was to be sent to her every day, and when the generals returned home, they were commanded to visit her, and to tell her of the bravery of the troops."
"During the long war with the Russians in the Crimea, the British soldiers suffered greatly from the freezing winds, and rain, and snow, of that cold land. When Queen Victoria heard of this, she and her children worked with their own hands to make warm clothing for them. A great many of the wounded and sick men were sent home in ships, to be nursed in the English hospitals, and the Queen paid several visits to the poor fellows as they lay there. Moving from one bed to another, she cheered them with hopeful words, and listened gladly to their stories of the battles in which they had fought. When she saw that the hospitals were crowded, and not very comfortable, she told Parliament that better ones ought to be provided, and after a time this was done, and the fine hospital of Netley was built, of which the Queen laid the first stone."

CHAPTER XXI
A HAND IN THE DARK
While they were talking a tug-boat towing a pile-driver came into view.
Boyd asked the meaning of its presence in this part of the river.
"""I don't know,"" answered Big George, staring intently. ""Yonder looks"
"SHAKE out your hair about me, so,"
That I may feel the stir and scent
Of those vague odours come and go
The way our kisses went.
"Night gave this priceless hour of love,"
"But now the dawn steals in apace,"
And amorously bends above
The wonder of your face.
"“Farewell” between our kisses creeps,"
"You fade, a ghost, upon the air;"
"Yet, ah! the vacant place still keeps"
The odour of your hair.
SOUVENIR.
HOW you haunt me with your eyes!

"Sad and sweet, across the distance"

much-befrilled bed.
There was a silence; then the little voice in the rug called out:
"""Say, what's your name?"""
"""Dick,"" whispered the man behind the curtains."
"""So long, Dick!"" drowsily."
"""So long, Girl!"" dreamily."
"There was a brief silence; then, of a sudden, the Girl bolted upright in"
"bed, and asked:"
"""Say, Dick, are you sure you don't know that Nina Micheltoreña?"""
"""Sure,"" prevaricated the man, not without some compunction."
Whereupon the Girl fell back on her pillows and called out contentedly a
"final ""Good-night!"""
XIII.
There was no mistaking then--no need to contrast her feeling of anxiety
of a few moments ago lest some other woman had preceded her in his
"affections, with her indifference on former occasions when her admirers"
"had proved faithless, to make the Girl realise that she was experiencing"
"she did so--""I suppose you've been too full of your politics to hear"
"much about the murder?"""
"""The murder?"" exclaimed the watchmaker. The doorkeeper crumpled up his"
"letter and stuffed it into the pocket of his coat, while his wife read"
to them the story of the discovery. The watchmaker listened with
interest.
"""Benham!"" he remarked. ""I never heard the name, did you?"""
"""You know him, Ned,"" said the doorkeeper's wife; ""him as Mr. Gaspard"
"used to go about with."""
"By a sudden common impulse, the eyes of the two men met; the woman went"
"off to brew them a pot of tea, and left them fearfully gazing at one"
another.
"""What stuff!"" said the watchmaker uneasily. ""It was only his blow. What"
"reason had he--?"" He paused and added, ""Seen him to-day, Ned?"""
"""No,"" answered Ned, fingering his note."
"""Wasn't he in the procession?"""
"""I didn't see him."""
"""When did you see him last?"""
The doorkeeper hesitated.
"""Night of our last committee,"" he whispered finally."

"I shook my head unhappily. ""Butt, why did you do it? I'd sure love to"

pointed at some of the bustling females. Sis was going to have three
"hundred bridesmaids. ""Any one of them would have jumped at the chance"
"to be your wife. And once on any woman's passport, you'd be free. Why"
"Sis?"""
"""That's what the Captain said in the lifeboat. Told him same thing I'm"
"telling you. I'm stubborn. What I like at first, I keep on liking. What"
"I want at first, I keep on wanting until I get."""
"""Yes, but making Sis sheriff! And you'll have to back her up with your"

"""Wait'll after we nest and go out to my islands."" He produced a"
"hard-lipped, smug grin, sighting it at Sis's slender back. ""She'll"

But all the London footlights know
The little plaintive smile that stirs
The shadow in those eyes of hers.
"Outside, the dreary church-bell tolled,"
The London Sunday faded slow;
"Ah, what is this? what wings unfold"
In this miraculous rose of gold?
AN ANGEL OF PERUGINO.
HAVE I not seen your face before
Where Perugino’s angels stand
"In those calm circles, and adore"
With singing throat and lifted hand?
"So the pale hair lay crescent-wise,"
"About the placid forehead curled,"
And the pale piety of eyes
Was as God’s peace upon the world.
"And you, a simple child serene,"
"Wander upon your quiet way,"
Nor know that any eyes have seen
The Umbrian halo crown the day.
"would be useful for us both."" He paused again, speaking to someone"
"else, then his voice came back. ""Shall we say four o'clock."""
"""What time is it now?"""
"""Please forgive me. I forgot. Your world is not regimented by time,"
whereas mine regrettably is measured down to seconds. It is now almost
three in the afternoon. I shall expect you in one hour. Your clothes
"are in the closet in your room. Now, if you will allow me. Affairs . ."

And the voice was gone.
"""Michael, are you really going to talk with that criminal?"""
"""Wouldn't miss it for the world. There's a game going on here, and we"
have to stay in. Everybody's got a score to settle. We're about to see
"who settles up first."""

"""Zero minus eighteen hours."" Yuri Andreevich Androv stared at the green"
"screen, its numbers scrolling the computerized countdown. ""Eighteen"
"fucking hours."""
"As he wheeled around, gazing over the beehive of activity in Flight"
"Control, he could already feel the adrenaline beginning to build."
Everything depended on him now. The vehicle was as ready as it was
"""I can't."""
"""She'll be hurt, Alicia. She'll think you don't care. Come, dear."""
"""Tell her--tell her I'm coming directly. Eleanor, you must let me go,"""
and breaking away she fled into the house.
Eleanor went alone to seek Lady Eynesford. Somehow Alicia's words had
quenched her high spirits for the moment.
"""Poor child! I do hope she hasn't been foolish,"" she mused. ""Surely"
"after what Mary told her--! Oh dear, I'm afraid it isn't all as happy as"
"it is about Dick!"""
And then she indulged in some very cynical meditations on the advantages
"of being a person of shallow emotions and changeful fancies, until she"
"was roused by the sight of Medland and Norburn walking up to the house,"
to attend the Executive Council. From the window she closely watched
"the Premier as he approached; her mood wavered to and fro, but at last"
"she summed up her impressions by remarking,"
"""Well, I suppose one might."""
CHAPTER XXII.
THE STORY OF A PHOTOGRAPH.
I seem to half surprise
In the evasions of those eyes.
"Once a child’s cloudless eyes, they seem"
"Lost in the blue depths of a dream,"
"As though, for innocent hours,"
To stray with love among the flowers.
"Without regret, without desire,"
"In those old days of love on hire,"
"Child, child, what will you do,"
"Emmy, now love is come to you?"
"Already, in so brief a while,"
The gleam has faded from your smile;
This grave and tender air
"Leaves you, for all but one, less fair."
"Then, you were heedless, happy, gay,"
Immortally a child; to-day
"A woman, at the years’ control:"
Undine has found a soul.
AT THE CAVOUR.
"WINE, the red coals, the flaring gas,"
Bring out a brighter tone in cheeks
That learn at home before the glass
IN AN OMNIBUS.
"YOUR smile is like a treachery,"
A treachery adorable;
So smiles the siren where the sea
Sings to the unforgetting shell.
"Your fleeting Leonardo face,"
"Parisian Monna Lisa, dreams"
"Elusively, but not of streams"
Born in a shadow-haunted place.
"Of Paris, Paris, is your thought,"
"Of Paris robes, and when to wear"
The latest bonnet you have bought
To match the marvel of your hair.
"Yet that fine malice of your smile,"
That faint and fluctuating glint
"Between your eyelids, does it hint"
Alone of matters mercantile?
"Close lips that keep the secret in,"
"Half spoken by the stealthy eyes,"
"Is there indeed no word to win,"
"No secret, from the vague replies"
"""What?"" She was shakily rising, pulling her yukata around her."
"""All the comforts of home. Too bad they forgot the geisha."""
"She came over and stood beside him. ""I don't believe this."""
"""Want to see if it's real, or just a mirage?"""
"She hesitantly stepped onto the decking, then walked out and bent down"
"to test the water. ""Feels wet."" She glanced back. ""So what the heck. I"
"could use it."""
"""I'm ready."" He kicked off his tabi and walked on out."
"She pulled off his _yukata_, then picked up one of the pails and began"
"filling it from a spigot on the wall. ""Okay, exalted male,"" she"
"laughed, ""I'm going to scrub you. That's how they do it, right?"" She"
stood up and reached for a sponge and soap.
"""They know how to live. Here, let me."" He picked up a second sponge and"
"began scrubbing her back in turn. ""How does it feel?"""
"""Maybe this is heaven."""
"""Hope we didn't have to die to get here. But hang on. I've got a"
"feeling the fun is just beginning."""
"He splashed her off with one of the pails, then watched as she gingerly"
climbed down into the wooden tub.
"""Michael, where do you think we are?"" She sighed as the steam enveloped"
"her. ""This has got to be Japan, but where?"""
the cotters to see how they were getting on.
"""So that's where he's gone?"" he said. ""Well, let him stay there, for all I"
"care!"""
The manufacturer cracked jokes to the very end. Of course he was a little
"depressed by the farewells, too, but he had to keep his family's courage"
"up. His wife stood holding one of his arms with both hands, and the"
children clung to his other arm.
"""I can't salute you,"" the manufacturer said to us, smiling. ""I'm not"
"allowed to say good-bye."""
"The children rejoiced at this and cried, ""No, he can't have his arm back;"
"Mummy, you hold him tight, too!"""
"""Come, come!"" the father said. ""I've got to go to Scotland, just a short"
"trip. And when you come home from the mountains, I'll be there, too."""
"""Scotland? What are you going to Scotland for?"" the children asked."
He twisted round and nodded to us.
"""These women! All curiosity!"" he said."
But none of his family laughed.
He continued to us:
"""I was telling my wife a story about a rich man who was curious, too. He"
"shot himself just to find out what comes after death. Ha, ha, ha! That's"
"the height of curiosity, isn't it? Shooting yourself to find out what"
"overlooking any bets, but I do admit that Miss Hemingway is a bit more"
"important to me than any of the rest."""
"""No, I suppose no one could blame you for that. Just keep it up,"
"Wilson."""
"""Sure,"" Ted said wearily. ""After all, this is a black and white job I'm"
"on. Either we'll be successful--or we won't."""
"""Luck."""
"""Spaceman's luck, Admiral."""
Wilson went back to his brooding....
Charles Andrews came back into the salon with a brisk air. He
"flexed his arms, took a deep breath, and mopped his forehead with a"
handkerchief. He sat down beside Alice and smiled at her warmly.
"""That thing is a wonder worker,"" he said, breathing deeply. ""Nothing"
"like exercise to make a man feel fine and fit."""
"Alice looked up at him with some amusement. ""Mr. Andrews, tell me. Are"
you the kind of man who opens the window on a winter morning about six
"o'clock, and takes deep lungsful of icy air?"""
"""Not quite that bad, my dear. Not quite. But brisk living does keep a"
man sharp and hard. I daresay I acquitted myself well on that pedal
"generator despite my fifty years."""
"""No doubt."""
"""I don't know. I'm not a spaceman, responsible for the lives of three"
"people--at a hundred clams an hour."""
"""Some day I'm going to shove those hundred fish down your throat."""
"""Do. And I'll spit 'em back at you!"""
Norton roughly took her shoulders in his hands. He twisted her to face
"him, clamped down on her soft shoulders until she turned her face up"
to complain with welling eyes. He put his lips on hers and tried to
"force some warmth into them. She submitted calmly, and when he found no"
"response and opened his eyes, she was staring at him vacantly."
Abruptly he let her go. She relaxed in the seat.
"""I'm not afraid to work,"" he said in a hollow voice."
"""Prove it,"" she replied flatly."
"He got up, left her there, and went below."
V
Wilson sat in the Information Center and eyed the search grid glumly.
"It stretched stereoscopically out in the room, a lot of its vacant"
"network of gleaming white lines frosted over with white shading, to"
mark where the search had covered.
"Next instant he was sprawling on the floor, with Dex rolling"
"helplessly on top of him, while the space ship bounced up twenty"
thousand feet as though propelled by a giant sling.
*       *       *       *       *
"The peep, peep of the radio signalling stopped. The space ship rolled"
"helplessly for a moment, then resumed an even keel. Brand and Dex"
gazed at each other.
"""What the hell?"" said Dex."
"He started to get to his feet, put all his strength into the task of"
"moving his Jupiter-weighted body, and crashed against the top of the"
control room.
"""Say!"" he sputtered, rubbing his head. ""Say, what _is_ this?"""
"Brand, profiting by his mistake, rose more cautiously, shut off the"
"atomic motor, and approached a glass panel again. ""God knows what it"
"is,"" he said with a shrug. ""Somehow, with our passing into the red"
"area, the pull of gravity has been reduced by about ten, that's all."""
"""Oh, so that's all, is it? Well, what's happened to old Jupe's"
"gravity?"""
"Again Brand shrugged. ""I haven't any idea. Your guess is as good as"
"mine."""
"He peered down through the panel, and stiffened in surprise."
"Nights of dreaming, days of loving,"
"When I loved you, when your kiss,"
"Shyer than a bird to capture,"
Lit a sudden heaven of rapture;
When we neither dreamt that either
Could grow old in heart like this.
"Do you still, in love’s December,"
"Still remember, still regret"
That sweet unavailing debt?
"Ah, you haunt me, to remind me"
"You remember, I forget!"
TO MARY.
"IF, Mary, that imperious face,"
"And not in dreams alone,"
Come to this shadow-haunted place
And claim dominion;
"If, for your sake, I do unqueen"
"Some well-remembered ghost,"
Forgetting much of what hath been
"Best loved, remembered most;"
"It is your witchery, not my will,"
"Your beauty, not my choice:"
containing the necklace. It was stolen from Schloss to whom you sold
"_my_ jewels. The other old bag, stolen from me, contains the paste"
replica you had made to deceive me.”
It was all so confused that I do not know how it happened. I think it
was Muller who opened the safe.
"“There is the new yellow bag,” cried Moulton, “from Schloss’ own safe."
Open it.”
"McLear had taken it. He did so. There sparkled not the real gems, but"
the replica.
"“The devil!” Moulton exclaimed, breaking from Winters and seizing the"
old bag.
He tore it open and—it was empty.
"“One moment,” interrupted Kennedy, looking up quietly from the counter."
"“Seal that safe again, McLear. In it are the Schloss jewels and the"
products of half a dozen other robberies which the dupe Muller—or
"Stein, as you please—pulled off, some as a blind to conceal the real"
"criminal. You may have shown him how to leave no finger prints, but you"
yourself have left what is just as good—your own forehead print.
"McLear—you were right. There’s your criminal—Lynn Moulton, professional"
"fence, the brains of the thing.”"
CHAPTER XIX
THE GERM LETTER
“Did you know that this man was alive when you married me?” he asked in
a hard voice.
"“No,” cried Yvonne. “How could I have married you? I thought he had been"
dead nearly three years.”
“What proofs did you have of his death?”
"“A friend sent me a number of the Figaro, with the announcement.”"
“Was that all?”
"“Yes,” said Yvonne."
"“Do you mean to tell me,” he insisted, “that you married a second time,"
having no further proofs of your first husband’s death than a mere
newspaper report?”
"“It never occurred to me to doubt it,” she replied, opening piteous,"
innocent eyes.
The childlike irresponsibility was above his comprehension. Her apparent
insensibility to the most vital concerns of life was another shock to
him. It seemed criminal.
"“God forgive you,” he said, “for the wrong you have done me.”"
"“But I did it unknowingly, Everard,” cried poor Yvonne. “If one has to"
"get greater proofs, why did you not ask for them, yourself?”"
"The Canon turned away and paced the room slowly, without replying. At"
(IN ABSENCE.)
I PASSED your street of many memories.
"A sunset, sombre pink, the flush"
"Of inner rose-leaves idle fingers crush,"
"Died softly, as the rose that dies."
"All the high heaven behind the roof lay thus,"
"Tenderly dying, touched with pain"
A little; standing there I saw again
The sunsets that were dear to us.
I knew not if ’twere bitter or more sweet
"To stand and watch the roofs, the sky."
"O bitter to be there and you not nigh,"
Yet this had been that blessed street.
"How the name thrilled me, there upon the wall!"
"There was the house, the windows there"
"Against the rosy twilight high and bare,"
The pavement-stones: I knew them all!
"Days that have been, days that have fallen cold!"
"I stood and gazed, and thought of you,"
Until remembrance sweet and mournful drew
Tears to eyes smiling as of old.
"So, sad and glad, your memory visibly"
"Alive within my eyes, I turned;"
"And, through a window, met two eyes that burned,"
"Tenderly questioning, on me."
"""You left her here?"" he inquired, interrupting.  ""Yes, in this very"
room.  But it seems that a quarter of an hour later one of the servants
"entered and discovered her lying upon the door, dead."""
"""Curious!"" he ejaculated.  ""Has a medical man seen her?"""
"""No.  The Countess sent for me as being one of her daughter's most"
"intimate friends, and I, in turn, sent for you."""
"""Where is the poor young lady?"""
"""In her room at the end of the corridor,"" I answered hoarsely."
"""Is there any suspicion of murder?"""
"""Apparently none whatever.  She had no visitor after I left."""
"""And no suspicion of suicide?"" he asked, with a sharp look.  ""Did you"
"part friends?"""
"""Perfectly so,"" I responded.  ""As to suicide, she had no reason, as far"
"as anyone knows, to make an attempt upon her life."""
He gave vent to an expression which sounded to me much like a grunt of
dissatisfaction.
"""Now, be perfectly frank with me, Gerald,"" he said, suddenly turning to"
"me and placing his hand upon my shoulder.  ""You loved her very dearly"
"once--was that not so?"""
I nodded.
Perhaps--perhaps we may have doubted the man somewhat over-hastily. But
"as for me, I will answer for La Giralda."""
"""For me,"" said El Sarria, sententiously, ""I will answer for no"
"woman--save only Dolóres Garcia!"""
Concha looked up quickly.
"""I also am a woman,"" she said, smiling."
"""And quite well able to answer for yourself, Señorita!"" returned El"
"Sarria, grimly."
For the answers of Ramon Garcia were not at all after the pattern set by
Rollo the Scot.
CHAPTER XXVII
THE SERGEANT AND LA GIRALDA
The dust-heat of the desolate plains of Old Castile was red on the
horizon when the Sergeant and his companion started together on their
"strange and perilous mission. Would they ever return, and when? What"
"might they not find? A Court deserted and forlorn, courtiers fleeing, or"
"eager to flee if only they knew whither, from the dread and terrible"
"plague? A Queen and a princess without guards, a palace open to the"
plunder of any chance band of robbers? For something like this the imp
of the deserted village had prepared them.
"""Where does she work?"""
"""Down in Wall Street."""
"""Not much chance we're interested. This money has been turning up around"
"Times Square."""
"""The other's a man--quiet, no trouble, pays his rent right on the dot"
every week. John Dennis his name is and he doesn't look like no
"counterfeiter."""
"Taber took a forward step. ""What's his room number?"""
"""Six--on the second floor. But he isn't in now. He just went out."""
"""Okay. Maybe I'll be back. As I said, we don't suspect anybody. We're"
"just checking for sources."""
Taber turned toward the door. The woman vanished back into her own
quarters as Taber snapped the lock. He stood in the vestibule for a
"minute or two, studying some cards he took from his pocket, and when she"
"did not reappear, he opened the door, went back in, and climbed the"
stairs.
The door to number six was not locked. Taber went inside. The window was
small and gave on an areaway. He could see nothing until he turned on
"the light. Even then, he could see nothing of interest--the room was"
ordinary in every sense.
"But as Brent Taber checked it out, some unusual aspects became apparent."
"There were two pieces of luggage in the closet. One, an oversized"
"suitcase, stood on end."
"And we, alike from each remote,"
"The world that works, the heaven that waits,"
"Con our brief pleasures o’er by rote,"
The favourite pastime of the Fates.
"We smoke, to fancy that we dream,"
"And drink, a moment’s joy to prove,"
"And fain would love, and only seem"
To love because we cannot love.
"Draw back the blinds, put out the light:"
"’Tis morning, let the daylight come."
"God! how the women’s cheeks are white,"
And how the sunlight strikes us dumb!
EMMY.
"EMMY’S exquisite youth and her virginal air,"
"Eyes and teeth in the flash of a musical smile,"
"Come to me out of the past, and I see her there"
As I saw her once for a while.
"Emmy’s laughter rings in my ears, as bright,"
"Fresh and sweet as the voice of a mountain brook,"
"And still I hear her telling us tales that night,"
Out of Boccaccio’s book.
"There, in the midst of the villainous dancing-hall,"
"the sea outside and the flowers in the delft bowl laughed, too."
“The angel has been having a good time.”
John cleared his throat again.
"“My dear,” said he, and then he stopped short. All the carefully"
prepared exordiums went out of his head. How now to break the news to
her he did not know.
“Are you very tired?” she asked.
"“Not a bit,” said John."
"“Then be a dear, and read me something. Read me 'Elaine.' ”"
The elevated and sophisticated and very highly educated may learn
with surprise that “The Idylls of the King” still appeal to ingenuous
fifteen. Thank God there are yet remaining also some sentimentalists of
fifty who can read them with pleasure and profit!
"“But that is so sad, Stellamaris,” said John. “You don't want to be sad"
this beautiful spring morning.”
"Which was a very inconsistent remark to make, seeing that he was about"
to dash the young sun from her sky altogether.
"“I like being sad sometimes, especially when the world is bright."
"And Lancelot was such a dear,”--here spoke ingenuous fifteen,--“and"
"Elaine--oh, do read it!”"
"So John, secretly glad of a respite, drew from the bookcase which held"
"for the disturbance, but are themselves badly mauled. Then the Pardoner"
"and the Friar go off amicably together. There is no allegory, no moral;"
merely satire on the fraudulent and hypocritical practices of pardoners
"and friars, together with some horseplay to raise a louder laugh. The"
fashion of that satire may be judged from the following exchange of home
truths by the rival orators.
"_Friar._ What, should ye give ought to parting pardoners?--"
"_Pardoner._ What, should ye spend on these flattering liars,--"
"_Friar._ What, should ye give ought to these bold beggars?--"
"_Pardoner._ As be these babbling monks and these friars,--"
_Friar._ Let them hardly labour for their living;--
_Pardoner._ Which do nought daily but babble and lie--
"_Friar._ It much hurteth them good men's giving,--"
"_Pardoner._ And tell you fables dear enough at a fly,--"
"_Friar._ For that maketh them idle and slothful to wark,--"
_Pardoner._ As doth this babbling friar here to-day?--
_Friar._ That for none other thing they will cark.--
"_Pardoner._ Drive him hence, therefore, in the twenty-devil way!--"
"_The Four P.P._ (? 1540), similarly, requires no more than a palmer, a"
cymbal claps. Triumphantly the _maialino_ looked around. He out-smacked
all.
"The bread of the country is rather coarse and brown, with a hard, hard"
crust. A large rock of this is perched on every damp serviette. The
"_maialino_ tore his rock asunder, and grumbled at the black-cap, who had"
got a weird sort of three-cornered loaf-roll of pure white bread--starch
white. He was a swell with this white bread.
"Suddenly black-cap turned to me. Where had we come from, where were we"
"going, what for? But in laconic, sardonic tone."
"""I _like_ Sardinia,"" cried the q-b."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically. And she tried to find out."
"""Yes, the Sardinians please me more than the Sicilians,"" said I."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically."
"""They are more open--more honest."" He seemed to turn his nose down."
"""The padrone is a Sicilian,"" said the _maialino_, stuffing a huge block"
"of bread into his mouth, and rolling his insouciant eyes of a gay,"
well-fed little black pig towards the background. We weren't making much
headway.
"""You've seen Cagliari?"" the black-cap said to me, like a threat."
"""Yes! oh Cagliari pleases me--Cagliari is beautiful!"" cried the q-b,"
who travels with a vial of melted butter ready for her parsnips.
"""Sibyl told me that he had a long chat with her, and she described him"
"as a most charming fellow."""
"""Ah, no doubt!  I suspected him and watched.  It was evident that he"
"came to my salon in order to meet her."""
"""To meet Sibyl!  Why?"""
"""That I cannot tell."""
"""But I think, Baronne, we may be both agreed upon one point."""
"""And that is?"""
"""That the man who now calls himself Rodolphe Wolf is here in Paris with"
"some secret motive."""
"""I am entirely in accord, m'sieur--quite.  Some steps must at once be"
"taken to ascertain that man's motives."""
"""It seems curious that he should have been introduced for the purpose of"
"meeting Sibyl.  What information did he want from her?"""
"""How can we tell?  You know better than myself whether she ever knows"
"any secrets of the Embassy."""
"""She knows nothing,--of that I am absolutely convinced,"" I responded."
"""Her father is devoted to her; but, nevertheless, he is one of those"
"strict diplomatists who do not believe in trusting women with secrets."""
"""Yet Wolf had a distinct object in making a good impression upon her,"""
she said reflectively.
"let a lady go to bed?"""
One by one the men filed through the door which Nick held open for them;
"but when all but himself had left, the devoted little barkeeper turned"
"to the Girl with a look full of meaning, and whispered:"
"""Do you want me to stay?"""
"""Me? Oh, no, Nick!"" And with a ""Good-night, all! Good-night, Sonora, an'"
"thank you! Good-night, Nick!"" the Girl closed the door upon them. The"
last that she heard from them was the muffled ejaculation:
"""Oh, Lordy, we'll never git down to Cloudy to-night!"""
Now the Girl slid the bolts and stood with her back against the door as
"if to take extra precautions to bar out any intrusion, and with eyes"
that blazed she yelled out:
"""Come out o' that, now! Step out there, Mr. Johnson!"""
Slowly the road agent parted the curtains and came forward in an
attitude of dejection.
"""You came here to rob me,"" at once began the Girl, but her anger made it"
impossible for her to continue.
"""I didn't,"" denied the road agent, quietly, his countenance reflecting"
how deeply hurt he was by her words.
"""You lie!"" insisted the Girl, beside herself with rage."
"""I don't--"""
"She was seated in a chair, motionless and statuesque, staring straight"
"before her.  The blow had utterly crushed her, for she was entirely"
devoted to her only daughter now that her husband was dead.  I well knew
"how deep was her affection for Yolande, and how tender was her maternal"
love.
"The room was in semi-darkness, for she had not risen to turn on the"
"light.  As I entered I did so with her permission, saying quietly:"
"""Madame, I come to you with a message."""
"""From whom?"" she asked in a hard mechanical voice."
"""From my friend Deane, the English doctor whom I have summoned.  Yolande"
"still lives!"""
"""She lives!"" she cried, springing to her feet in an instant.  ""You are"
"deceiving me!"""
"""I am not, madame,"" I reassured her, smiling.  ""Your daughter is still"
"breathing, and is increasing in strength perceptibly.  The doctors say"
"that she will probably recover."""
"""Thank God!"" she gasped, her thin white hands clasped before her.  ""I"
"pray that He may give her back to me.  I will go to her."""
"But I held her back, explaining that both the medical men had expressed"
a wish to remain there alone.
"""But what caused that appearance so akin to death?"" she asked quickly."
"Leaning across the table, over the beer,"
"While the music maddened the whirling skirts of the ball,"
"As the midnight hour drew near,"
"There with the women, haggard, painted and old,"
"One fresh bud in a garland withered and stale,"
"She, with her innocent voice and her clear eyes, told"
Tale after shameless tale.
"And ever the witching smile, to her face beguiled,"
"Paused and broadened, and broke in a ripple of fun,"
"And the soul of a child looked out of the eyes of a child,"
Or ever the tale was done.
"O my child, who wronged you first, and began"
First the dance of death that you dance so well?
Soul for soul: and I think the soul of a man
Shall answer for yours in hell.
EMMY AT THE ELDORADO.
"TO meet, of all unlikely things,"
"Here, after all one’s wanderings!"
"But, Emmy, though we meet,"

"For, is this Emmy that I see?"
A fragile domesticity
"""Well?"" she interrogated."
"""Well, we was sure that you was in trouble,"" put in Sonora. ""My breath"
"jest stopped."""
"""Me? Me in trouble, Sonora?"" A little laugh that was half-gay,"
"half-derisive, accompanied her words."
"""See here, that man Ramerrez--"" followed up Rance with a grim look."
"""--feller you was dancin' with,"" interposed Sonora, but checked himself"
instantly lest he wound the Girl's feelings.
"Whereupon, Rance, with no such compunctions, became the spokesman, a"
grimace of pleasure spreading over his countenance as he thought of the
unpleasant surprise he was about to impart. Stretching out his stiffened
"fingers over the blaze, he said in his most brutal tones:"
"""Your polkying friend is none other than Ramerrez."""
"The Girl's eyes opened wide, but they did not look at the Sheriff. They"
looked straight before her.
"""I warned you, girl,"" spoke up Ashby, ""that you should bank with us"
"oftener."""
The Girl gave no sign of having heard him. Her slender figure seemed to

"""This is a most curious case, my dear Trepard,"" began Dick, speaking in"
"French--""a case of coma, which I have mistaken for death;"" and,"
"continuing, he briefly explained how the patient had been found in a"
state so closely resembling death that he himself had been deceived.
"The old Frenchman placed his hand upon her heart, and, withdrawing it,"
said:
"""She's breathing now."""
"""Breathing!""  I echoed.  ""Then she is recovering!"""
"""Yes, old fellow,"" Dick replied, ""she is recovering--at least we hope we"
"shall save her.""  Then, turning to his colleague, he raised her hand and"
"pointed to the finger-nails, asking: ""Do you notice anything there?"""
"The other, adjusting his pince-nez, bent and examined, them one by one."
"""Yes,"" he answered at last.  ""A slight purple discoloration at the base"
"of the nails."""
"""And upon the lower lip does anything strike you as peculiar?"""
"""A yellow mark,"" he answered, after carefully inspecting the spot"
indicated.
"""And there?""  Deane asked, touching the mark upon the neck."
"""Very strange!"" ejaculated the elder man.  ""It is a most unusual case."""

"""No,"" was the man's truthful answer."
"""Oh, how glad I am! Take me--ah, take me I don't care where as long as"
"it is with you!"" cried the Girl in an ecstasy of delight."
"""So help me, God, I'm going to . . .!"" promised Johnson, his voice"
"strained, tense. ""You're worth something better than me, Girl,"" he"
"added, a moment later, ""but they say love works miracles every hour,"
that it weakens the strong and strengthens the weak. With all my soul I
"love you, with all my soul I--"" The man let his voice die out, leaving"
"his sentence unfinished. Suddenly he called: ""Why, Min-Minnie!"""
"""I wasn't really asleep,"" spoke up the Girl, blinking sleepily. ""I'm"
"jest so happy an' let down, that's all."" The next moment, however, she"
was forced to acknowledge that she was awfully sleepy and would have to
say good-night.
"""All right,"" said Johnson, rising, and kissed her good-night."
"""That's your bed over there,"" she told him, pointing in the direction of"
the curtains.
"""But hadn't you better take the bed and let me sleep over here?"""
"""Not much!"""
"""You're sure you would be more comfortable by the fire--sure, now?"""
"""Yes, you bet!"""

"“Spain is the place for all that,” said Kennedy. “Here in Italy the"
"Church ceremonies are too gay. Not so in Spain; at Toledo, at Burgos,"
"there is an austerity in the cathedrals, an unworldliness....”"
"“Yes,” said Cæsar; “unhappily we have nothing left there but"
"ceremonies. At the same time, the people are dying of hunger.”"
"They discussed whether it is better to live in a decorative, esthetic"
"sphere, or in a more humble and practical one; and Susanna and Kennedy"
stood up for the superiority of an esthetic life.
As they left the hotel Cæsar said to Kennedy:
“Allow me a question. Have you any intentions concerning Mrs.
Marchmont?”
“Why do you ask?”
"“Simply because I shouldn’t go to see her often, so as not to be in the"
way.”
“Thank you ever so much. But I have no intentions in relation to her.
She is too beautiful and too rich a woman for a modest employee like me
to fix his eyes on.”
“Bah! A modest diplomat! That is absurd. It is merely that you don’t
take to her.”
“No. It’s because she is a queen. There ought to be some defect in her
face to make her human.”
"listlessly, and his large head drooped forward as if at last its weight"
had proven too great for the squat body.
"""What's wrong?"" I asked."
"""How do you know there is anything wrong, my boy Jack?"""
"""You look so killingly happy,"" Tommy said, joining us."
"Monsieur's pale eyes stared for a moment, then blinked several times"
before he murmured:
"""The man I went to see is dead--murdered, just after he mailed that"
report. So I have no information. These police called it suicide because
a knife lay in his hand. Bah! I could place a knife in the hand of any
"man I kill!"""
"""Was he a friend of yours?"""
"""No. I have never seen him. But he knew something!"""
"""He evidently knew too much,"" Tommy suggested."
"""You speak true, my boy. It seems to be a dangerous thing here to know"
"too much of certain matters!"""
"""Well,"" I laughed, trying to put a heartiness in my voice and drive away"
"his depression, ""let's go ashore for dinner! Then the Opera--and"
"afterwards another bite where the high life eats? What-say, Professor?"""
"As it turned out, however, neither the dinner, nor all of Tommy's"
"banter, nor Madame Butterfly sung in Spanish (as if it could!) succeeded"
But the teacher was crying as if the tears quieted and comforted him.
"From this day they became friends, and the ""creatures that once were"
"men,"" seeing them together, said: ""The teacher is friendly with Tyapa"
...  He wishes his money. Kuvalda must have put this into his head ...
"To look about to see where the old man's fortune is ..."""
Probably they did not believe what they said.  There was one strange
"thing about these men, namely, that they painted themselves to others"
worse than they actually were.  A man who has good in him does not mind
sometimes showing his worse nature.

"When all these people were gathered round the teacher, then the reading"
of the newspaper would begin.
"""Well, what does the newspaper discuss to-day?  Is there any"
"feuilleton?"""
"""No,"" the teacher informs him."
"""Your publisher seems greedy ... but is there any leader?"""
"""There is one to-day....  It appears to be by Gulyaeff."""
"""Aha!  Come, out with it.  He writes cleverly, the rascal."""
"""'The taxation of immovable property,'"" reads the teacher, ""'was"
"introduced some fifteen years ago, and up to the present it has served"
"as the basis for collecting these taxes in aid of the city revenue ...'"""
"""It never rains but it pours,"" quoted ""Torps."" ""You'll attain"
"Flag-rank in another fifteen years, mark my words. Lieutenant Aubyn,"
"D.S.O."""
"The ""wire"" was a private tip from a personal friend at the Admiralty,"
informing Terence that His Majesty had been graciously pleased to
bestow upon him the Distinguished Service Order for gallantry in
"bringing H.M.S. ""Sunderland"" out of action during operations off the"
Belgian coast.
"""Torps"" was not far short of the mark, for a D.S.O. almost invariably"
means a rapid promotion to the fortunate and heroic recipient.
"""Flag-rank,"" echoed Terence. ""There's plenty of time for that."
"Meanwhile, that's where duty calls,"" and with a wave of his hand he"
"indicated the distant North Sea, on which the supreme contest for the"
supremacy of the waves will prove that the heritage of Nelson is
still worthily upheld by Britannia's sons.

This book contains a number of misprints.
The following misprints have been corrected:

"she was happier with me, in spite of it."""
"A movement of impatience escaped from Alicia. Seeing it he added,"
"""I beg your pardon. I didn't want you to think hardly of her."""
"""I don't want to think of her at all. Was she--was she like Daisy?"""
"""Yes; but prettier."""
"""I don't know what you expect me to say,"" she exclaimed. ""I know--I"
suppose some men don't think much of--of a thing like that. To me it is
"horrible. You simply followed your-- Ah, I can't speak of it!"" and she"
seemed to put him from her with a gesture of disgust.
"He walked beside her in silence, his face set in the bitter smile it"
always wore when fate dealt hardly with him.
"""I think I'll go straight home,"" she said, stopping suddenly. ""You can"
"join the others."""
"""Yes, that will be best. I'm not due at the Council just yet."""
"""I suppose I ought to thank you for telling me the truth. I--"" Her false"
composure suddenly gave way. With a sob she stretched out her hands
"towards him, crying, ""Why didn't you tell me sooner?"" and before he"
"could answer her she turned and walked swiftly away, leaving him"
standing still on the pathway.
She was hardly inside the gates of Government House when she saw Eleanor

"""They wouldn't be men if they weren't--"" Mrs. Carmichael had begun,"
"when she broke off, and the scissors that had been snipping their way"
steadily through the rough linen jagged and dropped on the table. She
picked them up immediately and went on with an impatient exclamation
at her own carelessness. But the involuntary start had coincided with
"a loud report from outside in the darkness, and a smothered scream."
Lois put down her knife.
"""Won't you come and help me?"" she said to Beatrice. ""Your mother will"
"not notice that you have gone."""
"Beatrice nodded, and letting the heavy head sink back among the"
"cushions, came over to Lois' side."
"""How brave you are!"" she said in a whisper. ""You seem so cool and"
"collected, just as though you believed your sandwiches would ever be"
"eaten!"""
"""I am not braver than you are. Look how steady your hand is--much"
"steadier than mine."""
Beatrice held out her white hand and studied it thoughtfully.
"""I am not afraid,"" she said, ""but not because I am brave. There is no"
"room for fear, that is all."" She paused an instant, and then suddenly"
"the hand fell on Lois'. The two women looked at each other. ""Lois, I"
"am so sorry."""
"noticed it when I was over."""
"""Is it meant to imply independent means?"""
"""I dare say that idea may be dormant under it somewhere. My wife says"
"the girls like it."""
"""Then your wife, Perry, is a traitor to her sex to make such"
"confessions. Besides, they didn't in my time."""
"""Come, you know, you're a forlorn bachelor. What can you know about it?"""
"""Bachelors, Perry, are the men who know. Which gathers most knowledge"

"""The operator, most of all."""
"""Doubtless."""
"""And that's the woman. Therefore, Oakapple, you're wrong and my wife's"
"right."""

"briefs."""
"In the afternoon, when these idlers had one and all set out for the"
"Legislative Assembly, some to work, others still to idle, Mr. Kilshaw"
felt interest enough in the fate of his late henchman to drop in at the
"police office on his way to the same destination. He was well known, and"
no one objected to his walking in and making for the door of the
Superintendent's room. An officer to whom he spoke told him that Ned
"Evans was in custody, and that it was rumoured that some startling"
"""I can say no more,"" Monsieur added. ""Accept my thanks and gratitude for"
"the help you have given me. And now--_bon soir_."""
"He bowed, backing himself toward the stairs as though leaving a royal"
"presence, doing it so easily, so naturally, that we did not even smile."
When he had quite disappeared we turned and faced each other.
"""What do you think now?"" I asked."
"""I think he's a treasure,"" Tommy cried. His face had lighted with a new"
"excitement. ""If we want any fun on this trip, don't let him get out of"
"our sight! Stick to him! I won't deny he has a screw loose, but----"""
"""That makes it all the better,"" I laughed, adding: ""Looks like the"
"Mater's toast might come true, after all, doesn't it!""--for I had"
described our New Year's Eve to Tommy.
"""Sonny, I've a hunch we won't even have to tiptoe over the hill to find"

At length the Rogan leader spoke. He addressed his sibilant words to

"""Why, yes, they're on this boat. They _must_ be! We were in the forward"

they must have cut the boat adrift. But we're _sure_ they're on this

"""So that was it! Of all the low-down dastardly tricks! Well, never mind"

He strolled about the garden waiting for her to get ready. Once she was
"visible through the doorway, and he called to her:"
"""Aren't you coming soon? Don't forget we've got to cross the mountain!"""
"""Well, I can't go bareheaded,"" she replied."
He was impatient.
"""No, you've got to put your hat on, and what a lot of time that takes!"
"Ugh!"""
She measured him coldly and said:
"""You're very--familiar."""
If he had paid her back in the same coin there would have been weeping and
"gnashing of teeth and cries of ""Go away! Go alone!"" and an hour's delay,"
"and reconciliation and embraces. But the actor's manner changed at once,"
"and he replied docilely, as his nature was,"
"""Familiar? Well--perhaps. Sorry!"""
"Then he strolled about the garden again, humming occasionally and swinging"
"his stick. I took note of the oddly feminine shape of his knees, and the"
unusual plumpness of his thighs; there was something unnatural about this
"plumpness, as though it did not belong to his sex."
"His shoes were down at the heel, and his collar was open. His raincoat"
"hung regally from his shoulders and flapped in the wind, though it was not"

"""Something scared him off and he lit out without his horse."" Which"
"remark brought temporary relief to the Girl, for Nick, watching her, saw"
the colour return to her face.
"Unconsciously, during this discussion, the Girl had risen to her feet,"
"but only to fall back in her chair again almost as suddenly, a sign of"
nervousness which did not escape the sharp eye of the Sheriff.
"""How do you know the man's a road agent?"" A shade almost of contempt was"
in the Girl's question.
Sonora breathed on his badly nipped fingers before answering:
"""Well, two greasers jest now were pretty positive before they quit."""
Instantly the Girl's head went up in the air.
"""Greasers!"" she ejaculated scornfully, while her eyes unfalteringly met"
Rance's steady gaze.
"""But the woman knew him,"" was the Sheriff's vindictive thrust."
The Girl started; her face went white.
clever enough? Then the situation stimulated her. She held out her hand
to Boswell.
“You have come to see me?” she cried delightedly. “Mr. Trent has just
"been telling us that you came down with him, and I hoped you would call"
soon.”
"“Yes, to be sure—to be sure. You might have known I would call soon.”"
"He bowed stiffly to Trent, and, seating himself close beside Jessica,"
murmured in her ear: “Cannot you get rid of that fellow? How did he find
you out so soon?”
"“Why, he came to see Edith, of course. Do you not remember how devoted"
he always was to her?”
“I do not—”
"“May I ask what you are whispering about, Mr. Boswell?” demanded Trent,"
breaking from Miss Decker. “Is he confiding to you the astounding
"success of his last novel, Mrs. Pendleton? Or was it a history of the"
United States? I really forget.”
"“Not the last, certainly. I leave it to you to make history—an abridged"
edition. My ambition is a more humble one.”
"“Oh, you will both need biographers,” said Mrs. Pendleton, who was"
beginning to enjoy herself. “I will give you an idea. Join the
Theosophists. Arrange for reincarnation. Come back in the next
generation and write your own biographies. Then your friends and
families cannot complain you have not had justice done you.”
“Ha! ha!” said Trent.
struggling together with some new and utterly unknown emotion which
"seemed to come surging over him like a flood, leaving him speechless,"
motionless.
"She had risen, and now held out her hand."
"""You will triumph yet.  I am assured of it.  And I shall pray God to"
"give you His strength and grace. Farewell, sir; we may meet again"
sometimes.  I shall hear of you.  I shall listen to hear naught but
good. Your mother’s voice shall plead through mine.  Give up evil
"companions; give up idle dissipation, and all that it brings in its"
"train.  Lead the higher life of the Courteous Knight, the Spotless"
"Knight, the Knight of the Holy Grail.  Did we not speak of them all when"
"first we met, and methought you looked such a one yourself?  Be true to"
"that better self; and so I say farewell again.  May God be with you!"""
"She was gone, and Grey stood looking after her as a man who sees a"
vision.
*CHAPTER VIII.*
*A STARTLING DISCOVERY.*
As Grey Dumaresq drifted downstream with the tide that sunny July
"morning, he felt as though something new and wonderful had come into his"
"life, as though some great and marvellous change had fallen upon him,"
"which, for good or ill, must leave its mark upon his life."
CHAPTER XVIII
THE BURGLAR’S MICROPHONE
"That night I was sitting, brooding over the case, while Craig was"
studying a photograph which he made of the smudge on the glass door
down at Schloss’. He paused in his scrutiny of the print to answer the
telephone.
"“Something has happened to Schloss,” he exclaimed seizing his hat and"
coat. “Winters has been watching him. He didn’t go to the Recherche.
Winters wants me to meet him at a place several blocks below it Come
on. He wouldn’t say over the wire what it was. Hurry.”
"We met Winters in less than ten minutes at the address he had given, a"
bachelor apartment in the neighborhood of the Recherche.
"“Schloss kept rooms here,” explained Winters, hurrying us quickly"
upstairs. “I wanted you to see before anyone else.”
As we entered the large and luxuriously furnished living room of the
"jeweler’s suite, a gruesome sight greeted us."
"There lay Schloss on the floor, face down, in a horribly contorted"
"position. In one hand, clenched under him partly, the torn sleeve of a"
woman’s dress was grasped convulsively. The room bore unmistakable
"traces of a violent struggle, but except for the hideous object on the"
floor was vacant.
"Kennedy bent down over him. Schloss was dead. In a corner, by the door,"
"“DEAR MADELAINE,"
I am called home.
"I leave my rooms and all in them to your care, knowing that they will"
"be in good hands. I leave you also all the money I can spare, to keep"
you in decency and comfort until I return.
"I shall send, early in the day, for the large leather bag which you"
will find labelled and ready by the door.
NOLL.”
And when he had sealed this letter he wrote another:
"“DEAR BABETTE,"
I hear that you arrived in Paris with Horace yesterday. By the time
you get this letter I shall have left my house in the clouds. Last
"night I found Madelaine at _The Golden Sun_. She was without home,"
"without means, except the sweating pay of mean industries on which"
no honest woman can live; she was without a bed. But her blood is
dancing with life--not with a desire to cower in sweating-dens.
"She was drifting. I gave her all these things that I might, last"
night--and she is now asleep here.
"Come to her as soon as you get this, and let her feel that she is not"
alone. She will babble all her news to you--it will be better for her
than babbling it to me.
Tell Horace not to go back to the haunts of his youth. The wine is
"what's the use of jaw?  I say get up stores, eh, Mackenzie?"""
"""Don't ask me,"" said old Mac.  ""I was thinkin' that mighty soon we'd"
"be able to settle that question about the buildin' of the _Potluck_."""
And as by this time Jones was calming down and was rather inclined to
"cry, Lampert came up to the restive crowd."
"""You dry up, Hart,"" he said roughly.  ""Until the ship's broken up,"
"you're on the articles.  Say another word and I'll break your jaw."""
"""Yes, sir,"" said Hart respectfully."
"Until dawn they loafed about the deck and in the cabin and foc'sle,"
"discussing whether they were on one of the Crozets or what, and"
"whether they would stay long there, and if so what, and so on."
And just as the dawn broke over the island they got an awful
surprise.  They saw a man standing on the low cliff on about a level
with the jagged splinters of the fore-topmast where it had gone short
in the cap.
"""The bloomin' hisland's in'abited,"" cried a foremast hand, and every"
one rushed forward to interview the gesticulating stranger.
"""Wod's the bloke say?"" asked the crowd.  ""Oh, say it again!""  And the"
stranger said it again.
But the crowd shook a unanimous head.
"""I believe the silly galoot don't talk English,"" cried Hart; ""'ere,"
"where's Dutchy?"""
"and Lady Eynesford, and all the rest, but what do I care if I have you"
"and him?"""
"""Me and him, Daisy?"""
"""Yes,"" she answered, smiling boldly. ""He's asked me to marry him--just"
"to show he didn't mind--and I think I will, father. We three against the"
"world! What need we care? Father, we'll beat Sir Robert!"" and she seized"
his two hands and laughed.
In vain Medland tried to tell her what he had come to say. Mighty as his
"relief and joy were, he still felt a burden lay on him. She would not"
hear.
"""Don't you see I'm happy?"" she cried. ""It can't be your duty to make me"
"unhappy. Jack doesn't mind, I don't mind!"" Her voice sank a little and"
"she added, ""It can't hurt mother now. Oh, don't be unhappy about it,"
"dear--don't, don't!"""
"They were standing now, and his arm was about her. Looking up at him,"
"she went on,"
"""They shan't beat us! They shan't say they beat us. We three, father!"""
He stooped and kissed her. There is love that lies beyond the realm of
"giving or taking, of harm or good, of wrong, or even of forgiveness."
"With all his faults, this love he had won from his daughter, and it"
"stood him in stead that night. He drew himself up to his height, and the"
air of despondency fell from him. The girl's brave love braced him to
meet the world again.
"""No, by Jove, we're not beat yet, Daisy!"" he said, and she kissed him"
concert. She had forgotten that Amédée was singing there. Everard was
"going. He would see the name on the programme, “Amédée Bazouge.” There"
could not be two tenors of that name in Europe. Everard must be kept
away at all costs.
"She rushed from the room and down the stairs, in terrible anxiety lest"
"he should have already left the hotel. To her intense relief, she saw"
him sitting in one of the cane chairs in the vestibule smoking his
after-lunch cigar. He threw it away as he caught sight of her at the
"head of the stairs, breathless, and holding the balusters, and went up"
to meet her.
"“My poor child,” said he in an anxious tone. “What is the matter?”"
"“Oh, Everard--I don’t want any more to be left alone. Don’t think me"
silly and cowardly. I am afraid of all kinds of things.”
"“Of course I ’ll come and sit with you a little,” he replied kindly."
They entered her room together. Yvonne lay down. Her head was splitting
with nervous headache. The Canon tended her in his grave way and
"sat down by the window with a book. Yvonne felt very guilty, but yet"
"comforted by his presence. At the end of an hour, he looked at his watch"
and rose from his seat.
“Are you easier now?”
"“You are not going to the Kursaal, Everard?”"
"“I am afraid Emmeline is expecting me.” She signed to him to approach,"
and put her arms round his neck.
"she asked in a low, intense voice.  ""You have forgotten me for three"
"whole years until now."""
"""I know--I know!""  I cried.  ""Forgive me."""
"""I have already forgiven,"" she said, allowing her hand still to remain"
"in mine.  ""But I have been thinking to-day--thinking ever so much."""
"Her voice was weak and faltering, and I saw that she was not herself."
"""Thinking of what?"""
"""Of you.  I have been wondering whether, if I had died, you would have"
"sometimes remembered me?"""
"""Remembered you?""  I said earnestly.  ""Why, of course, dearest.  Why do"
"you speak in such a melancholy tone?"""
"""Because--well, because I am unhappy, Gerald!"" she cried, bursting into"
"sudden tears.  ""Ah! you do not know how I suffer--you can never know!"""
"I bent and stroked her hair, that beautiful red-gold hair that I had so"
often heard admired in the great salons in Brussels.  It had been bound
"but lightly by her maid, and was secured by a blue ribbon.  She had"
"apologised for receiving me thus, but declared that her head ached, and"
"it was easier so.  Doctor Deane had called twice that morning, and had"
pronounced her entirely out of danger.
"""But why are you suffering?""  I asked, caressing her and striving to"
"charm away her tears.  ""Cannot you confide in me?"""
"She shook her head in despair, and her body was shaken by a convulsive"
glare of Port Townsend and saw in the distance the flashing
searchlights of the forts that guard the Straits. They saw him stop
"suddenly, and raise his night-glasses; Boyd laid his hand on Cherry's"
arm. Presently the Captain crossed to them and said:
"""Yonder seems to be a launch making out. See? I wonder what's up."""
"Almost in their path a tiny light was violently agitated. ""By Jove!"
"They're signalling."""
"""You won't stop, will you?"" questioned Emerson."
"""I don't know, I am sure. I may have to."""
"The two boats were drawing together rapidly, and soon those on the"
bridge heard the faint but increasing patter of a gasoline exhaust.
"Carrying the same speed as _The Bedford Castle_, the launch shortly"
came within hailing distance. The cyclopean eye of the ship's
"searchlight blazed up, and the next instant, out from the gloom leaped"
"a little craft, on the deck of which a man stood waving a lantern. She"
"held steadfastly to her course, and a voice floated up to them:"
"""Ahoy! What ship?"""
"""_The Bedford Castle_, cannery-tender for Bristol Bay,"" Peasley shouted"
back.
"The man on the launch relinquished his lantern, and using both palms"
"for a funnel, cried, more clearly now: ""Heave to! We want to come"
"aboard."""
"With an exclamation of impatience, the commanding officer stepped to"
"the telegraph, but Emerson forestalled him."
"house of four stories, three gables in width. The upper stories jutted"
"out; the beams on which they rested were finely carved, the gables"
"were finished off with rich, wooden pinnacles. In each story, the"
"lowest excepted, were three long, low windows of the common Nuremberg"
"type, and the whole had a substantial and reputable air."
"The window at which I had seen Marie was farthest from the door, on"
"the first floor. To go to the door I had to lose sight of it, and"
perhaps for that reason I stood the longer. At last I went and
"knocked, and waited in a fever for some one to come. The street was a"
thoroughfare. There were a number of people passing. I thought that
all the town would go by before a dragging foot at last sounded
"inside, and the great nail-studded door was opened on the chain. A"
"stout, red-faced woman showed herself in the aperture."
'What is it?' she asked.
"'You have a girl in this house, named Marie Wort,' I answered"
"breathlessly. 'I saw her a moment ago at the window. I know her, and I"
wish to speak to her.'
The woman's little eyes dwelt on me stolidly for a space. Then she
made as if she would shut the door. 'For shame!' she said spitefully.
'We have no girls here. Begone with you!'
But I put my foot against the door. 'Whose house is this?' I said.
"'Herr Krapp's,' she answered crustily."
'Is he at home?'
"'No, he is not,' she retorted; 'and if he were, we have no baggages"
"calcium chloride, and finally by distillation."

"""Ours was a foolish infatuation,"" she answered with an effort.  ""It is"
"best that we should both of us forget."""
"""Forget!""  I cried.  ""But I can never forget you, Yolande.  You are my"
"love.  You are all the world to me."""
"Her eyes were grave, and I saw that tears stood in them."
"""No,"" she protested quietly; ""do not say that.  I cannot be any more to"
"you than other women whom you meet daily.  Besides, I know well that in"
the diplomatic service marriage is a serious drawback to any save an
"ambassador."""
"""When a man is in love as I am with you, dearest, he throws all thoughts"
of his career to the winds; personal interests are naught where true
"love is concerned."""
"""You must not--nay, you shall not--wreck your future on my account,"" she"
"declared in a low, intense voice.  ""It is not just either to yourself or"
"to the Englishwoman who loves you."""
"""Why do you taunt me with that, Yolande?""  I asked reproachfully.  ""I do"
not love her.  I have never truly loved her.  I was lonely after you had
"gone out of my life, and she was amusing,--that was all."""
"""And now you find me equally amusing--eh?"" she remarked, with just a"
touch of bitter sarcasm.
"""Why should you be jealous of her?""  I asked.  ""You might just as well"
"be jealous of Sibyl, Lord Barmouth's daughter."""
"""With the latter you are certainly on terms of most intimate"
the other end of the eyot.
"'I shall sleep,' Steve said drowsily."
"The insects were beginning to hum. The horses stood huddled together,"
swishing their long tails.
'You think they won't track us?' I asked.
"'Certain,' he said. 'There are six hundred yards of mud and water,"
"eel-holes, and willow shoots between us and the road.'"
The Waldgrave assented mechanically; it seemed so to me too. And
"by-and-by, worn out with the night's work, I fell asleep, and slept, I"
"suppose, for a good many hours, with the sun and shade passing slowly"
"across my face, and the bees droning in my ears, and the mellow warmth"
of the summer day soaking into my bones. When I awoke I lay for a time
"revelling in lazy enjoyment. The oily plop of a water-rat, as it dived"
"from a stump, or the scream of a distant jay, alone broke the laden"
silence. I looked at the sun. It lay south-west. It was three o'clock
then.
[Illustration: We were alone.... I whispered in her ear ...]
"A light touch fell on my knee. I started, looked down, and for a"
"moment stared in sleepy wonder. A tiny bunch of blue flowers, such as"
"I could see growing in a dozen places on the edge of the island, lay"
"on it, tied up with a thread of purple silk. I started up on my elbow,"
"and--there, close beside me, with her cheeks full of colour, and the"
"sunshine finding golden threads in her dark hair, sat Marie, toying"
"She was not to see me again, for I asked permission of the queen to"
"withdraw, and immediately left the ball."
"While I was crossing the park on my way back to Whitehall, the wind"
moaned and groaned--it did not breathe. The stars did not twinkle--they
glared. The nightingales did not sing--they screamed. And the roses were
odorless. Perhaps all this change to gloom was within me rather than
"without, but it existed just the same, and I went home and to bed, hating"
"all the world save Bettina, whom I vowed for the hundredth time never to"
see again.
"The next day at noon De Grammont came to my closet, where I had waited"
for him all morning.
"""Welcome to you, dear count!"" I cried, leading him by the hand to a"
chair.
"""Perhaps you will not so warmly welcome me,"" he returned, ""when you learn"
"my errand."""
"""I already know your errand, Count Grammont, and it makes you doubly"
"welcome,"" I answered, drawing a chair for myself and sitting down in"
front of him.
"""Ah, that is of good,"" he returned, rubbing his hands. ""You already know"
"the purpose of my visit?"""
"""Yes, I do, my dear count, but any purpose would delight me which brings"
"the pleasure of your company."""
"""Ah, it is said like a civilized man,"" he returned, complimenting"
fraught with significance. Lavender took the precaution to beach the
dory at an abandoned wharf near Sunset Lane.
"""Just as well not to show ourselves 'round Rockman's."""
"""When can we go out to the _Arabella_?"""
"""Not 'till four o'clock. We can go out to swim just like we always do."
Even if they see us they won't think it's funny for us to do that.
"They'd think it funnier if we didn't."""
"Sidney admitted the truth of this, but wondered how she could live"
until four o'clock!
"As they walked up Sunset Lane Sidney reminded Lavender that, because of"
"their promise, they ought to tell Mart. But when they stopped at the"
Calkins' house they found that Mart had already gone to Gert Bartow's.
"""Oh, dear,"" sighed Sidney, with an added pang of remorse."
At four o'clock Sidney and Lavender went out to the _Arabella_ to swim
as they had done always before Pola's coming. Except for a brightness
"in Sidney's eyes, an alertness about her whole body, and the occasional"
significant glances that passed between them they both appeared quite
normal. Lav talked casually of the heat of the day.
"""Gee, the water'll feel great. This is the hottest day we've had yet."""
"""I can't wait to get in."" Most certainly Jed Starrow, had he been"
"listening, could not have guessed how closely Nemesis pressed upon his"
heels!
"his _Euralia Past and Present_ the eminent historian, Roger"
"Scurvilegs, does not spare her; but that she had her great qualities I"
should be the last to deny.
"She had been writing poetry that morning, and she wore green.  She"
"always wore green when the Muse was upon her: a pleasing habit which,"
"whether as a warning or an inspiration, modern poets might do well to"
imitate.  She carried an enormous diary under her arm; and in her mind
several alternative ways of putting down her reflections on her way to
the Palace.
"""Good morning, dear Countess,"" said the King, rising only too gladly"
"from his nibs; ""an early visit."""
"""You don't mind, your Majesty?"" said the Countess anxiously.  ""There"
was a point in our conversation yesterday about which I was not quite
"certain----"""
"""What _were_ we talking about yesterday?"""
"""Oh, your Majesty,"" said the Countess, ""affairs of state,"" and she"
"gave him that wicked, innocent, impudent, and entirely scandalous look"
"which he never could resist, and you couldn't either for that matter."
"""Affairs of state, of course,"" smiled the King."
"""Why, I made a special note of it in my diary."""
She laid down the enormous volume and turned lightly over the pages.
"""Here we are! '_Thursday._  His Majesty did me the honour to consult"
"me about the future of his daughter, the Princess Hyacinth.  Remained"
"same meaning to her ear: ""You have helped to do this--this is your"
"work."""
"""No help will come,"" Mrs. Carmichael said, shaking her head at the"
"darkness. ""When a whole province rises as this has done, it takes"
"months to organize a sufficient force, and we shan't last out many"
days. I wonder what people in England are saying. How well I can see
"them over their breakfast cups! Oh, dear, I mustn't think of breakfast"
"cups, or I shall lose my nerve."" She laughed under her breath, and"
there was a long silence.
"Presently the door of the bungalow opened, letting in a stream of"
"moonlight. It was closed instantly, and soft footfalls came over the"
boarded floor.
"""Who is it?"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered."
"""I--Lois,"" was the answer. The new-comer crept down by Beatrice's side"
"and leaned her head against the warm shoulder. ""I am so tired,"" she"
"said faintly. ""I have been with Archibald. He has been moaning so. Mr."
"Berry says he is afraid mortification has set in. It is terrible."""
"""Poor little woman!"" Beatrice put her arm about the slender figure and"
"drew her closer. ""Lay your head on my lap and sleep a little. You can"
"do no good just now."""
"""Thank you. I will, if you don't mind. You will wake me if anything"
"happens, won't you?"""
"""Yes, I promise."" It gave Beatrice a sense of comfort to have Lois"
"near her. Very gently she passed her hand over the aching forehead,"
and presently Lois fell into a sleep of absolute exhaustion.
adorably red. There was a new and brilliant light in her eye; and after
"one curiously comprehensive glance at the company, she turned about to"
"look for her companion, La Giralda, who presently cantered up on a"
"lumbering Estramenian gelding. La Giralda sat astride as before, her"
"lower limbs, so far as these were apparent, being closely clad in"
"leather, a loose skirt over them preserving in part the appearance of"
sex.
Rollo was dumb with sheer astonishment. He could only gaze at the
"flushed cheek, the tingling electric glances, the air completely"
unconscious and innocent of the girl before him.
"""Concha!"" he cried aloud. ""Concha--what do you here? I thought--I"
"imagined you were safe at the Convent of the Holy Innocents!"""
"And from behind Sergeant Cardono marked his cheek, alternately paling"
"and reddening, his stammering tongue and altered demeanour, with the"
utmost satisfaction.
"""Good--good,"" he muttered under his breath to El Sarria; ""he will make a"
true general yet. The saints be praised for this weakness! If only he
"were fonder of his dinner all might yet be well!"""
CHAPTER XXV
THE MISSION OF THE SEÑORITA CONCHA
"""I too have a mission, I would have you know,"" said Concha, a dangerous"
“There’s Gilroy’s flock of bears!” Jimmie shouted.
"“And a little bit of a black bear at that,” Ned laughed. “If Gilroy had"
"made an ugly face at him, he’d have run away!”"
The tree into which the fat confidential clerk had climbed was not a
"large one. In fact, it was swaying dangerously under his weight. As he"
"moved his position at sight of the black back of the bear, the slender"
upshoot to which he clung gave way and he came clattering down through
the few lower branches.
“Oh my! oh my! oh my!” he shouted. “I never should have come into this
blasted country! I shall be eaten alive!”
"Instead of rushing to Gilroy’s assistance, his rescuers, boy-like, sat"
down on the mat of pine needles which strewed the ground and roared with
laughter. Gilroy eyed them angrily without attempting to rise to his
feet. His rage only made the scene more amusing.
“Why didn’t you shoot him?” he demanded at length.
“Shoot him?” repeated Jimmie. “That bear is a great deal more frightened
"than you are. At the rate of speed he’s now going, he’ll strike the"
arctic circle at exactly four-fifteen tomorrow morning!”
"“He chased me up the tree,” whined Gilroy. “He nipped at my heels as I"
"left the ground, and I heard his teeth grinding together in the most"
frightful manner. I’ll never get over this!”
“I guess he would have climbed the tree after you in about another
"minute,” Jimmie declared, with a sly wink at Ned. “You see, it’s just"
"As he walked, he thought again about the new rumor he'd heard in the"
commissary at lunch. Gossip kept the Soviet staff going--an instinct
from the old days--but this one just might be true. Some lower-level
staffers even claimed they'd seen him. The Chief.
Word was Tanzan Mino himself--none other than the CEO of the Daedalus
"Corporation--had flown in this morning, together with his personal"
bodyguards and aides. The story was he wanted hands-on control of the
"first hypersonic test flight, wanted to be calling the shots in Flight"
Control when _Daedalus I _made history.
Finally. The Big Man has decided to show his face.
"""Yuri Andreevich, just a minute. Slow down."""
He recognized the voice immediately and glanced around to see Nikolai
"Vasilevich Grishkov, the portly Soviet chief mechanic, just emerging"
from the West Quadrant. His bushy eyebrows hung like a pair of Siberian
musk-ox horns above his gleaming dark eyes.
"""Have you seen her?"" Grishkov was shuffling toward him."
"""Seen who?"" He examined the mechanic's spotless white coveralls. Jesus!"
"Even the support crews on this project were all sanitized, high-tech."
"""The new woman. _Kracevia, moi droog. Ochen kracevia_. Beautiful beyond"
"words. And she is important. You can tell just by looking."""
"""Nikolai, there's never been a woman in this facility."" He laughed and"
"continued on toward Security. ""It's worse than a goddam troop ship."
"You've finally started hallucinating from lack of _pezdyonka_."""
"“What kind of a lady was Miss Sprowls—in looks, I mean?”"
"“Why, black-haired, sir, short, and stout, with a comical face. They"
left a week ago Tuesday.”
“And before they occupied it?”
"“Why, there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business."
He left owing me a week. Before him was Missis Crowder and her two
"children, that stayed four months; and back of them was old Mr. Doyle,"
whose sons paid for him. He kept the room six months. That goes back a
"year, sir, and further I do not remember.”"
He thanked her and crept back to his room. The room was dead. The
essence that had vivified it was gone. The perfume of mignonette had
"departed. In its place was the old, stale odour of mouldy house"
"furniture, of atmosphere in storage."
"The ebbing of his hope drained his faith. He sat staring at the yellow,"
singing gaslight. Soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the
sheets into strips. With the blade of his knife he drove them tightly
into every crevice around windows and door. When all was snug and taut
"he turned out the light, turned the gas full on again and laid himself"
gratefully upon the bed.
It was Mrs. McCool’s night to go with the can for beer. So she fetched
it and sat with Mrs. Purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where
house-keepers foregather and the worm dieth seldom.
"“I rented out my third floor, back, this evening,” said Mrs. Purdy,"
worth while to add that the next suite was his own.
"""A thousand pardons,"" repeated M. Dubois, very penitently. ""I am too"
stupid! But mademoiselle will perhaps be so gracious as to forgive me
"this time."""
"He bowed to Sallie again and to Slyne, and disappeared, sharply scanning"
the latter's face to the last.
"""Who's that son of a sea-cook?"" snapped Captain Dove, and Mr. Jobling"
looked wanly up out of one eye.
"""A French detective,"" Slyne answered reflectively. But Sallie felt sure"
"that he was afraid of M. Dubois, and wondered why."
"""Well, he has nothing against me that I'm aware of,"" the old man"
"declared. ""And now--what about this wire? Does it mean that some other"
fellow has scooped the pool--and that I've had all my trouble for
"nothing, eh?"" He clenched his fist again and shook it in the lawyer's"
face.
"""No, no,"" gasped Mr. Jobling. ""Don't be so hasty. It makes no difference"
"at all, now that we have Lady Josceline with us. I told you that the"
"American, Carthew, is of no account against her--and how he has ever"
"cropped up again I can't conceive. In any case--"""
"""In any case, you'd better be off to your room and ring for a bit of"
"beefsteak to doctor that eye with,"" Slyne interposed in a tone of"
intense annoyance.
"""And I wish to goodness, Dove!"" he added savagely, ""that you would"
"behave a little more like a reasonable human being and less--"""
"""I do not speak of these men, I am thinking of Judas Petunikoff, who is"
"one of them...."""
"""And you say you have nothing to do with them?"" asks the teacher,"
quietly.
"""But do you think that I do not live?  Aha!  I do live, but I suppose I"
ought not to be angry at the fact that life is desecrated and robbed of
"all freedom by these men."""
"""And they dare to laugh at the kindly anger of the Captain, a man"
"living in retirement?"" says Abyedok, teasingly."
"""Very well!  I agree with you that I am foolish.  Being a creature who"
"was once a man, I ought to blot out from my heart all those feelings"
"that once were mine.  You may be right, but then how could I or any of"
"you defend ourselves if we did away with all these feelings?"""
"""Now then, you are talking sense,"" says the teacher, encouragingly."
"""We want other feelings and other views on life.... We want something"
"new ... because we ourselves are a novelty in this life...."""
"""Doubtless this is most important for us,"" remarks the teacher."
"""Why?"" asks Kanets.  ""Is it not all the same whatever we say or think?"
"We have not got long to live ...  I am forty, you are fifty ... there"
"is no one among us younger than thirty, and even at twenty one cannot"
"live such a life long."""
"""And what kind of novelty are we?"" asked Abyedok, mockingly."
"“We might begin,” replied John, “with more elementary accomplishments.”"
"“I could teach her botany,” said Miss Lindon, pensively. “I got first"
"prize for it at school. I still have the book in a cupboard, and I"
could read it up. And I'm so glad I have kept my two volumes of pressed
"flowers. It's quite easy to learn, I assure you.”"
"“I'm afraid, my dear,” said John, “you 'll first have to teach her to"
"eat and drink like a Christian, and blow her nose, and keep her face"
clean.”
"“Ah, that reminds me. My head's in a maze, and I can't think of"
"everything at once, like some clever people. What kind of soap do"
"gentlemen use? I 'll have to know, so as to supply you with what you"
like.”
"“Any old stuff that will make a lather,” said John, rising."
"“But some soaps are so bad for the skin,” she objected anxiously."
“Vitriol would n't hurt my rhinoceros hide.”
"He laughed, and held out his hand. Further discussion was useless."
Miss Lindon accompanied him to the front gate and watched him stride
down the perky terrace until he disappeared round the corner. Then she
"went slowly into the house and uncovered the canary, who blinked at her"
"in oblique sullenness, and did not respond to her friendly “cheep” and"
the scratching of her finger against the rails of his cage. She turned
"to Dandy, who, snoring loud, was equally unresponsive. Feeling lonely"
"and upset, she rang the bell."

"These statistics are taken from the report of the British Parliament,"
"which, for learning and intelligence, as a deliberative body, has not"
"its superior, if it has its equal, in the world, and it is surely a"
"sufficiently Christian body to be accepted as authority in this matter,"
since a large number of its members are clergymen. These statistics
"hardly sustain the allegation that ""Infidelity is coupled with"

"We are willing to stand upon our record. But, lest it be claimed that"
"this is a British peculiarity, allow me to defer to the patriotic"

Again it seemed to Senator Crane that he heard a ripple of mirth--louder
this time. It had to be something to do with the acoustics. Except that
"he was suddenly aware of smiles, too. The next question had to do with"
possible consultation with Russia on the matter of the coming space
invasion.
Senator Crane agreed that such consultation should be made and then
retired hastily into seclusion. A touch of panic hit him. He felt like a
"man who was far out in the water without a boat, with the closest land a"
few hundred feet straight down. Good God! Had he miscalculated? Of
course not. He had only to await the verdict of the nation's top
newspapers before proceeding with the publicity program that might well
make him presidential timber.

"John Dennis, for the first time since Rhoda had known him, seemed"
nervous. He kept licking his lips and shifting his eyes from Rhoda to
Frank Corson.
"Frank Corson sat quietly, keeping his thoughts to himself. Rhoda crossed"
to the liquor cabinet and poured a double Scotch. She went to the sofa
and sat down a little uncertainly.
"""I guess you two haven't met. John, this is Frank Corson."""
"John Dennis paid no attention. He walked to the sofa, sat down, and took"
"“About two miles on the level,” Frank suggested, “and about four hundred"
miles the way the surface of the ground runs.”
"After a short rest the boys proceeded south, climbing over jutting"
"spurs, dipping into depressions, and sliding over stony slopes until"
they were almost too tired to take another step.
"“We’ll get used to this in a month or two,” Harry said, sitting plump"
down on a boulder.
"Frank followed the boy’s example, except that he stretched himself at"
"full length, while Jack pushed on a few steps and stood peering over a"
rim of rock which lay directly in their way.
"“Look here, boys!” Jack finally called. “You remember the place in"
"Mexico called the Devil’s Cauldron? Well, this is it!”"
“What have you found now?” demanded Frank sleepily.
"“Here’s a round hole in the mountain,” Jack answered back, “that you"
might hide a city block in. It’s deep and the sides are almost smooth.
"Looks like the pit Kipling gets one of his characters in, only there’s"
rock instead of sand.”
The boys rose to their feet and looked over the ledge.
"“And right there in the bottom,” Harry exclaimed, “is a pool of water so"
clear that it looks like a diamond!”
"“Running water, too,” added Frank. “Now, where do you think that water"
"comes from, and where does it go to?”"
"_do_ you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?"""
*       *       *       *       *
"He cocked his head and considered a moment. ""Look,"" he said finally,"
"""I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I"
couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all
the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the _Eleanor
Roosevelt_ because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine
and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat--don't you know that
every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?
"Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?"""
"""Yes,"" she said bitterly. ""You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you."
I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him
"equally guilty?"""
"""No, Sis, he didn't,"" I was beginning to argue. ""All he wanted--"""
"""Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be"
"sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences."""
"""Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?"""
"He waved his hands at her impatiently. ""I'm not talking law, female;"
I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to
look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your
"way to Venus for a husband. So let's."""
"Sis actually staggered back. ""Let's? Let's _what_? Are--are you daring"
"to suggest that--that--"""
“Yes; that’s true. She is too much of a prize beauty.”
“That is the defect in the Yankee women; they have no character. The
"weight of tradition might be fatal to industry and modern life, but it"
is the one thing that creates the spirituality of the old countries.
"Beyond contradiction American women have intelligence, beauty, energy,"
"attractive flashes, but they lack that particular thing created by"
centuries: character. At times they have very charming impulses. Have
you heard the story about Prince Torlonia’s wife?”
“No.”
"“Well, Torlonia’s present wife was an American girl worth millions, who"
"came with letters to the prince. He took her about Rome, and at the end"
"of some days he said to her, supposing that the beautiful American had"
the intention of marrying: ‘I will introduce some young noblemen to
you’; and she answered: ‘Don’t introduce anybody to me; because you
please me more than anybody’; and she married him.”
“It was a pretty impulse.”
"“Yes, Americans do things like that on the spur of the moment. But if"
"you saw a Spanish woman behave that way, it would seem wrong to you.”"
Chattering amicably they came to the Piazza Esedra.
“Would you care to have lunch with me?” said Kennedy.
“Just what I was going to propose to you.”
“I eat alone.”

THE WHAT-SHALL-I-DO GIRL
"Or, The Career of Joy Kent"
_By Isabel Woodman Waitt_
"_12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated by Jessie Gillespie. Net $1.25;"
postpaid $1.40_
"When Joy Kent finds herself alone in the world, thrown on her own"
"resources, after the death of her father, she looks about her, as do"
"so many young girls, fresh from the public schools, wondering how she"
can support herself and earn a place in the great business world about
"her. Still wondering, she sends a letter to a number of girls she had"
"known in school days, asking that each one tell her just how she had"
"equipped herself for a salary-earning career, and once equipped, how"
she had found it possible to start on that career. In reply come
"letters from the milliner, the stenographer, the librarian, the"
"salesgirl, the newspaper woman, the teacher, the nurse, and from girls"
who had adopted all sorts of vocations as a means of livelihood. Real
"As De Grammont was leaving my closet, he paused at the door, and, after a"
"moment's hesitancy, whispered:--"
"""You may expect a letter from France soon. It will come from M. l'Abbé du"
"Boise, who I hope will come soon to London on the business of my king."
"You know him not--M. l'Abbé?"" The eyebrows lifted questioningly. ""No? You"
"soon will know him, yet you will not know him. You and perhaps a lady may"
"help him in his mission. I, too, shall help him, but I, too, know him"
"not. Yet I know him. If he succeed in his mission, he will be rich, he"
"will be powerful. And I? Mon Dieu, my friend! If he succeed, my decree of"
banishment from Paris--it will be to revoke. I may return once more to
bask in the smile of my king. You must not speak; the lady must not
"speak; I must not speak when Monsieur l'Abbé comes, nor before. It is to"
"silence. Stone walls have one ear."""
"""Two, sometimes, count,"" I suggested, laughing."
"""Yes, I should have said one ears! Non, non! I forget this damnable"
"tongue of yours! When I arrive to great interest, it is to talk faster"
"than it is to think, and--"" A shrug of the shoulders finished the"
sentence.
"""Let us speak French hereafter, my dear count,"" I suggested."
"""Mon Dieu, mon Dieu! It is to me more of pain to hear my sweet language"
"murdered than to murder yours,"" answered Grammont, seriously."
"""Ah, but I speak French quite as well as I speak English. Perhaps I shall"
"not murder it,"" I replied."
"""Perhaps? We shall try,"" he said, though with little show of faith."
Travers nodded.
"""I heard you talking, but I wanted to make sure. It has all been my"
fault--every bit of it. It's decent of you not to make me feel it
"more. You are not to blame--her. You know I tempted her, I made her"
"help me. She isn't responsible. At any rate, she made a clean breast"
of it--that's something to her credit. I didn't want to--I never meant
to. I am not the sort that repents. But this last week you have been
"so decent, and Lois such a plucky little soul--she ought to hate"
"me--and perhaps she does--but she has done her best. Nicholson, are"
you listening? Can you hear what I say? It's so damned hard for me to
"talk."""
"""I can hear,"" Nicholson said kindly. ""Don't worry about what can't be"
"helped."" In spite of everything, he pitied the man, and his tone"
showed it.
"Travers lifted himself higher, clinging to the other's shoulder. His"
"voice began to come in rough, uneven jerks."
"""But it can be helped--it must be helped! Don't you see--I came"
between you and Lois purposely. From the first moment you spoke of her
I knew that you loved her--and I wanted her. I never gave your
message. I didn't dare. You are the sort of man a woman cares for--a
"woman like Lois. I couldn't risk it. But now--well, I'm done, and"
"afterward she will be free--"""
Nicholson drew back stiffly.
"""You are talking nonsense,"" he said, in a colder tone. ""No one wants"
"you to die--and in any case, you know very well we have no chance of"
"getting through this alive."""
Before Peters could reply the red-haired man took a single step forward
and faced Bob.
"“I can tell you in two shakes of a lamb’s tail,” he snapped viciously."
"“This river hog o’ yours thinks he kin play the devil with my boom, but"
he’s got another guess comin’. I own this land an’ that sawmill. I got a
right to run my booms out in the river same as anybody else. I ain’t
"lookin’ for trouble, but the first man as tries any monkey business"
"wants to look out, that’s all.”"
"Bainbridge raised his eyebrows, and let his gaze wander leisurely from"
the man’s head to his heels with an expression which brought an added
touch of color to the already flushed cheeks.
“Indeed!” he drawled. “Who are you?”
“Who be I?” retorted the other angrily. “Humph! I don’t see that it
"makes no difference, but my name’s Joyce--John Joyce. An’ I ain’t the"
"kind as backs down an’ takes water, believe me!”"
A singularly irritating smile curved the corners of Bob’s lips. His
"unruffled composure served, as he hoped it might, to increase the rage"
of Mr. Joyce.
“Do you realize that you’re obstructing navigation?” he inquired
suavely.
"“I don’t admit it,” snapped Joyce. “There’s plenty of room for your"
"drive to git past if you had a gang that knew their business, instead of"
a lot o’ greenhorns.”
"“I dare say you could give us all points,” Bainbridge murmured smoothly,"
"""To please me."""
Mr. Wagge's readjusted glance stopped in confusion at her waist. He
"answered, in a voice that he strove to make bland:"
"""If you put it in that way, I don't reelly know 'ow to refuse; but it"
"must be quite between you and me--I can't withdraw my attitude."""
Gyp murmured:
"""No, of course.  Thank you so much; and you'll let me know about"
"everything later.  I mustn't take up your time now.""  And she held out"
her hand.
Mr. Wagge took it in a lingering manner.
"""Well, I HAVE an appointment,"" he said; ""a gentleman at Campden Hill.  He"
"starts at twelve.  I'm never late.  GOOD-morning."""
"When she had watched his square, black figure pass through the outer"
"gate, busily rebuttoning those shining black gloves, she went upstairs"
and washed her face and hands.
"For several days, Fiorsen wavered; but his collapse had come just in"
"time, and with every hour the danger lessened.  At the end of a fortnight"
"of a perfectly white life, there remained nothing to do in the words of"
"the doctor but ""to avoid all recurrence of the predisposing causes, and"
"shove in sea air!""  Gyp had locked up all brandy--and violins; she could"
control him so long as he was tamed by his own weakness.  But she passed
"some very bitter hours before she sent for her baby, Betty, and the dogs,"
and definitely took up life in her little house again.  His debts had
"Then, after an interminable time, Miss Craig called out cheerily;"
"""There, that's enough for this morning,"" and came down to the dory,"
opening a little crocheted bag. From it she took two crisp one dollar
"bills. ""Take this, girls, and divide it. And we are ever so"
"grateful--you were splendid types. We'll have you again some day."""
Sidney's hand had barely closed over her dollar bill when she spied a
"woman and a girl slowly walking along the wharf, watching with interest"
the artists who were still at work. The girl looked startlingly
familiar to Sidney. She gave a little gasp and ran forward.
"""_Pola!_"" she called loudly."
"The girl turned in astonishment at the sound of her name, stared for a"
"moment, then quickly advanced laughing."
"""Why, you're the Romley girl, aren't you? Of _all_ the things! What are"
"you doing here?"""
"""I'm visiting my aunt,"" explained Sidney, suddenly conscious of her"
appearance and in consequence painfully ill-at-ease.
"""Oh, and do they hire you to pose? What fun! I suppose that's a sort of"
"costume they make you wear, isn't it?"""
"""Y--yes,"" Sidney faltered, miserably. Pola's manner was prettily"
condescending and she made no move to join Sidney on the beach.
"""I'm a wreck myself,"" Pola went on, airily surveying her trim and"
"elegant person. ""Mother and I are motoring. And I made her bring me"
down here to see my cousin. He's an artist and lives here summers.
He'll just despise seeing us because he comes here to get rid of
"""That's my business!"" came like a knife-cut from the Girl."
"""Do you know you're talkin' to the Sheriff?"""
"""I'm talkin' to Jack Rance, the gambler,"" she amended evenly."
"""You're right,--and he's just fool enough to take you up,"" returned"
Rance with sudden decision. He looked around him for a chair; there was
"one near the table, and the Girl handed it to him. With one hand he"
"swung it into place before the table, while with the other he jerked off"
"the table-cover, and flung it across the room. Johnson neither moved nor"
"groaned, as the edge slid from beneath his nerveless arms."
"""You and the cyards have got into my blood. I'll take you up,"" he said,"
seating himself.
"""Your word,"" demanded the Girl, leaning over the table, but still"
standing.
"""I can lose like a gentleman,"" returned Rance curtly; then, with a swift"
"seizure of her hand, he continued tensely, in tones that made the Girl"
"shrink and whiten, ""I'm hungry for you, Min, and if I win, I'll take it"
"out on you as long as I have breath."""
"A moment later, the Girl had freed her hand from his clasp, and was"
"saying evenly, ""Fix the lamp."" And while the Sheriff was adjusting the"
"wick that had begun to flare up smokily, she swiftly left the room,"
saying casually over her shoulder that she was going to fetch something
from the closet.
"""What you goin' to get?"" he called after her suspiciously. The Girl made"
"""Sallie--_Harris!_"" Mr. Jobling ejaculated. ""Dear me! Did you say"
"Sallie--er--Harris?"""
"""I said Saleh Harez,"" affirmed Captain Dove, and filled the glass at his"
"elbow again. ""But all that concerns you, so far's I can see, is that"
I've known her ever since she was knee-high to me. I've been a father to
"her all those years, and she's my adopted daughter. So now, you can take"
"it from me, Mr. Jobling, that I'm the joker, and both bowers too, in"
"this merry little game."""
"""Which makes it all the more unfortunate for you that you haven't a"
"single penny to stake on your hand,"" Slyne put in, while the lawyer"
"looked somewhat blankly from one to the other of them. ""So--don't waste"
"any more time bluffing, but tell Jobling how you found Sal--Lady"
"Josceline."""
"Captain Dove darted a very evil look at his friendly adviser. ""And what"
"if I refuse?"" he asked."
"Slyne almost smiled. ""Why cut off your own nose to spite your face?"" he"
"returned. ""You won't refuse, because it would cost you a hundred"
"thousand dollars to do so."""
"Captain Dove stroked his chin contemplatively, and his face slowly"
cleared.
"""A hundred and fifty thousand, you mean,"" he said in a most malevolent"
tone.
"Slyne got up from the table as if in anger, and for some time the two"
"wrangled over that point, the stout solicitor gazing at them with"
"evident dismay, while Sallie awaited the upshot of it all with bated"
chuckled ecstatically. His own eyes were shining.
"""That settles it, Lady Josceline,"" said he triumphantly, turning to"
"Sallie. ""I'll stake my professional reputation on your identity now. You"
"need have no further doubt--"""
"""And just to clinch the matter,"" growled Captain Dove, ""you'd better add"
this to your affidavy:--The clothes the kid was wearing when I fetched
her off that dhow were all marked with the moniker 'J. J.' and some sort
of crest. But--they were all lost when the ship I commanded then
"was--went down at sea."""
"Mr. Jobling groaned. ""How _very_ unfortunate!"" he remarked before he"
resumed his writing. And Slyne stared fixedly at the old man until the
lawyer had finished.
"""Now,"" said Mr. Jobling, adjusting his pince-nez and beaming about him"
"again, ""we can call in a couple of witnesses and--"""
"""We'll witness each other's signatures."" Slyne disagreed. ""Better not"
"bring in any outsiders."""
"The stout solicitor frowned over that, but finally nodded concurrence."
"And Captain Dove took the pen from him, only to hand it to Slyne."
"""Gimme my thousand dollars and your joint note for the balance first,"""
he requested unamiably.
"Slyne signed the new note Mr. Jobling pushed across the table, and Mr."
Jobling endorsed it. Captain Dove read it over carefully before he
"pocketed it, and also counted with great caution the bills Slyne tossed"
"to him. Then he in his turn signed, without reading it, the statement"
"grounds, chatting and sipping tea, I was watching, watching. And my hand"
"was never far from the butt of the Webley automatic which, slung from my"
"waist, was hidden in a bag of silk."""
"""Heavens!"" he cried out. ""You are...."""
"""Hush,"" interposed Madame. ""A lawyer and a Gatepath should be more"
"discreet. The war is over, and I can tell you now that I fought every"
"minute of it in the Secret Service, the Civil branch. I was the head"
"woman, the bright particular star, in Dawson's Secret Corps."""
"""Is it discreet to tell me this?"" he asked, countering her reproof of a"
moment earlier.
"She smiled rather wickedly. ""Are you not a lawyer and a Gatepath? And"
"can one not tell anything to a lawyer and a Gatepath? Besides, I have"
"sent in my resignation, and am now a free woman. It has been a good"
"time, a very good time. I have fought devils and mastered devils in"
"England and France and Italy for four long years, and now I would rest."
You say that time and sorrow have spared me. Yet I have known both time
"and sorrow. Have I not lost...."""
"He broke into a babble of apologies. ""I did not know.... I did not"
"realise...."""
"She waved a hand, and he fell silent. ""I do not wear the trappings of"
"woe, for though I am eternally widowed, I glory in my loss. It was in"
"the rearguard at Caporetto, when all less gallant souls had fled, that"
"my Guilberti fell."""
Of course from that moment Gatepath was her slave. She had flattered him
and humbugged him as she flattered and humbugged all of us. Madame had
"be in the mornin'. You'll see in the mornin' that there'll be--"" She"
"stopped and stared in frozen terror at the sinister face of the Sheriff,"
who was coolly watching his handkerchief turn from white to red under
the slow rain of blood from the loft above.
"""Oho!"" he emitted sardonically, stepping back and pointing his gun"
"towards the loft. ""So, he's up there!"""
"The Girl's fingers clutched his arm, dragging desperately."
"""No, he isn't, Jack--no, he isn't!"" she iterated in blind, mechanical"
denial.
"With an abrupt movement, Rance flung her violently from him, made a grab"
"at the suspended ladder and lowered it into position; then, deaf to the"
"Girl's pleadings, harshly ordered Johnson to come down, meanwhile"
covering the source of the blood-drops with his gun.
"""Oh, wait,--wait a minute!"" begged the Girl helplessly. What would"
happen if he couldn't obey the summons? He had spent himself in his
"climb to safety. Perhaps he was unconscious, slowly bleeding to death!"
"But even as she tortured herself with fears, the boards above creaked as"
though a heavy body was dragging itself slowly across them. Johnson was
evidently doing his best to reach the top of the ladder; but he did not
move quickly enough to suit the Sheriff.
"""Come down, or I'll--"""
"""Oh, just a minute, Jack, just a minute!"" broke in the Girl frantically."
"""Don't shoot!--Don't you see he's tryin' to--?"""
"""Come down here, Mr. Johnson!"" reiterated the Sheriff, with a face"
as little to your mind as to mine.  We can flatter and fool and make
mock with the best; but when it comes to marriage!  Faugh! one’s soul
sickens at the thought.  What man in his senses would trust his
happiness or his honour in the hands of that tawdry crew?  Gilt and
"tinsel do very well to play with; but when one desires to purchase, one"
"asks for gold."""
Grey’s heart seemed to stand still within him.  He felt growing numb and
"cold.  As they passed beneath the gateway, and the lamp shone upon his"
"face, Lord Sandford saw that it was white as death, and a strange gleam"
came into his own eyes.
"""Come, my friend, you do not answer.  What think you of the wife that I"
have chosen?  What think you of the Lady Geraldine Adair?  Is she not a
matchless creature?  Who would have believed such a sport could come
"from such a tree?"""
Grey commanded himself by a great effort.
"""Is the Lady Geraldine Adair, then, your affianced wife?"""

shall be betrothed ere long.  I thought you might be learning as much
from her own lips to-night.  Did I not hear my name pass between you

"""She did ask some question anent you,"" answered Grey, who had no desire"
"to fence or parry—he felt too stunned and bewildered; ""but she spoke not"
"of any troth-plight.  Why should she?"""
"""True, why should she?  She is not one of your empty-headed chatterers."
She wears not her heart upon her sleeve.  And your acquaintance is of
instant he fell full length on the boarded floor of the loft with the
hand outstretched in which was the handkerchief he had been staunching
the blood from the wound in his side.
With a whispered injunction that he was all right and was not to move on
"any account, the Girl put the ladder back in its place. But no sooner"
was this done than on looking up she caught sight of the stained
"handkerchief. She called softly up to him to take it away, explaining"
that the cracks between the boards were wide and it could plainly be
seen from below.
"""That's it!"" she exclaimed on observing that he had changed the position"
"of his hand. ""Now, don't move!"""
"Finally, with the lighted candle in her hand, the Girl made a quick"
survey of the room to see that nothing was in sight that would betray
"her lover's presence there, and then throwing open the door she took up"
such a position by it that it made it impossible for anyone to get past
her without using force.
"""You can't come in here, Jack Rance,"" she said in a resolute voice. ""You"
"can tell me what you want from where you are."""
"Roughly, almost brutally, Rance shoved her to one side and entered."
"""No more Jack Rance. It's the Sheriff coming after Mr. Johnson,"" he"
"said, emphasizing each word."
The Girl eyed him defiantly.
"""Yes, I said Mr. Johnson,"" reiterated the Sheriff, cocking the gun that"
"he held in his hand. ""I saw him coming in here."""
"""What are your plans of escape?"" I asked."
"""I shall work my way down to Sheerness, where I hope to find a boat"
"for The Hague or the French coast. Lilly, who seems to know everything,"
"past, present and future, came last night to tell me that the king has"
"fifty men seeking me in various parts of England, especially the"
"seaports, and has offered a reward of two hundred pounds for me, dead"
"or alive, preferably dead, I suppose. If I go direct to Sheerness and try"
"to take a boat, I am sure to be examined, and I'm not prepared for the"
ordeal. So I intend to preach my way down the river and induce the king's
"officers to send me abroad by force."""
"""How are you off for money, George?"" I asked."
"""I borrowed ten guineas from Lilly,"" he answered."
"""I thought you might be in need of money, so I brought fifty guineas from"
"the strong box under my bed,"" I said, offering him the little bag of"
gold.
"He hesitated, saying: ""If I take the money, you may never again see a"
"farthing of it."""
"""In that case, I'll take my pay in abusing you,"" I replied."
"""Do you believe he would, Frances?"" asked George, turning to my cousin."
Then continuing thoughtfully:
"""It is strange that I should have found such a friend at the bottom of a"
"quarrel, all because I allowed him to abuse me. Truly forbearance is a"
"profitable virtue. The 'other cheek' is the better of the two."""
"""A man named Wolf--Rodolphe Wolf."""
The next instant I saw that the mention of that name affected the mother
no less markedly than it had affected the daughter.  Her face blanched;
"her eyes opened wide in fear, and her glance became in a moment"
"suspicious.  With marvellous self-possession she, however, pretended"
ignorance.
"""Wolf?"" she repeated.  ""I do not remember the name.  Possibly he is some"
"person we have met while travelling."""
"""Yolande knew him, I believe, in Brussels,"" I remarked.  ""He appeared to"
"be acquainted with you."""
"""My daughter's friends are not always mine,"" she remarked coldly, with"
"that cleverness which only a woman of the world can possess, and at once"
returned to the discussion of Yolande and the probability of her
recovery.
This puzzled me.  I felt somehow convinced that she knew the truth.  She
"had some distinct object in endeavouring to seal my lips.  What it was,"
"however, I could not determine."
"She was expressing a fervent hope that her daughter would recover, and"
"pacing the room, impatient to go to her bedside, when, of a sudden, Dick"
"opened the door, and, putting his head inside, addressed me, saying:"
"""Can I speak with you a moment, Ingram?""  She dashed to the door in"
"eagerness, but after a word of introduction from myself, he informed her"
that Yolande had not sufficiently recovered to be disturbed.
"""Perfect quiet is absolutely necessary, madame,"" he urged.  ""Your"
"hard work must be strong and healthy, and they should have strong and"
"healthy children....  Do I speak truly?"""
"""Yes,"" assented the listeners."
"""But all this will never happen,"" says Yashka, becoming rather"
"frightened at the prospect held out to him by the teacher.  ""She is"
"healthy, and I cannot have reached the child ...  She is a devil--a"
"hag!"" he shouts angrily.  ""I would ...  She will eat me away as rust"
"eats iron."""
"""I understand, Yakov, that you cannot help beating your wife,"" the"
"teacher's sad and thoughtful voice again breaks in.  ""You have many"
reasons for doing so ... It is your wife's character that causes you to
"beat her so incautiously ...  But your own dark and sad life ..."""
"""You are right!"" shouts Yakov.  ""We live in darkness, like the"
"chimney-sweep when he is in the chimney!"""
"""You are angry with your life, but your wife is patient; the closest"
"relation to you--your wife, and you make her suffer for this, simply"
"because you are stronger than she.  She is always with you, and cannot"
"get away.  Don't you see how absurd you are?"""
"""That is so....  Devil take it!  But what shall I do?  Am I not a man?"""
"""Just so!  You are a man....  I only wish to tell you that if you"
"cannot help beating her, then beat her carefully and always remember"
that you may injure her health or that of the child.  It is not good to
beat pregnant women ... on their belly or on their sides and chests....
"Beat her, say, on the neck ... or else take a rope and beat her on some"

"stern and hard. ""Germans I can respect,"" said he, ""even those that"
pretend to be our friends. But one of our own folk--to sell us like
"this--ugh! Take the vermin away; Dawson, and stamp upon it."""
"We stood talking for a few moments, and then Dawson broke in with a"
"question. ""I have never understood, Admiral, why you were so very"
confident that Mr. Copplestone here had no hand in this business. The
"case against him looked pretty ugly, yet you laughed at it all the"
"time. Why were you so sure?"""
The Admiral surveyed Dawson as if he were some strange creature from
"an unknown world. ""Mr. Copplestone is a friend of mine,"" said he"
drily.
"""Very likely,"" snapped the detective. ""But is a man a white angel"
"because he has the honour to be your friend?"""
"""A fair retort,"" commented the Admiral. It happens that I had other"
and better reasons. For in July I myself showed Mr. Copplestone over
"the new battleship _Rampagious_, and after our inspection we both"
lunched with the builders and discussed her design and armament in
"every detail. So as Mr. Copplestone knew all about her in July, he was"
"not likely to suborn a draughtsman in November. See?"""
"""You should have told me this before. It was your duty."""
"""My good Dawson,"" said the Admiral gently, ""you are an excellent"
"officer of police, but even you have a few things yet to learn. I had"
"in my mind to give you a lesson, especially as I owed you some"
I'm glad you did. I suppose the lampooners will get hold of the story
and will set every one laughing at me. Kidnapped the wrong woman and
lost her! Odds fish! But you're a pair of wise ones. I see I shall have
"to find me a new Lord High Kidnapper."""
"The king was right concerning the lampooners, for soon they had the"
"story, and he became the laughing-stock of London, though Frances's name"
was not mentioned.
It is a significant index to the morals of our time that the king's
attempt to kidnap a woman in the streets of London should have aroused
laughter rather than indignation.
"As it was, the kidnapping episode brought no harm to my cousin, but she"
"did not want it to happen again, and so was careful to take a trusted"
escort with her when she went abroad thereafter.
CHAPTER X
AT THE MAID'S GARTER
"Betty was confined to her room during the greater part of the next month,"
and Frances visited her frequently. Notwithstanding my vows not to see
"Betty, I was compelled to go with Frances as her body-guard. I even went"
so far in my feeble effort to keep my resolution as to suggest Churchill
"as a body-guard, but Frances objected, and the quality of my good intent"
"was not enduring. So I went with my cousin, and the joy in Betty's eyes"
whenever we entered her room was not the sort that would come because she
"'I do not know,' my lady answered, and told him shortly of our flight,"
and how we had lain two days and a night in the osier-bed.
"'It was a good thought,' he said. 'But I fear that you are half"
"famished.' And he called for food and wine, and served my lady with"
"his own hands, while he saw that we did not go without. 'Campaigner's"
"fare,' he said. 'But you come of a fighting stock, Countess, and can"
put up with it.'
"'Shame on me if I could not,' she answered."
"There was a quaver in her voice, which showed how the rencontre moved"
"her, how full her heart was of unspoken gratitude."
"'When you have finished, we will get to horse,' he said. 'I must take"
"you with me to Nuremberg, for I am not strong enough to detach a"
"party. But this evening we will make a long halt at Hesel, and secure"
you a good night's rest.'
"'I am sorry to be so burdensome,' my lady said timidly."
"He shrugged his shoulders without compliment, but I did not hear what"
he answered. For I could bear no more. Marie seemed so forgotten in
"this crowd, so much a thing of the past, that my gorge rose. No word"
"of her, no thought of her, no talk of a search party! I pictured her"
"forlorn, helpless little figure, her pale, uncomplaining face--I and"
no one else; and I had to go away into the bushes to hide myself. She
"was forgotten already. She had done all for them, I said to myself,"
and they forgot her.
"Then, in the thicket screened from the party, I had a thought--to go"
"back and look for her, myself. Now my lady was safe, there was nothing"
Pola ate with nervous greed. Sidney bit off a piece but found it dry in
her mouth. She was thinking of her sisters and the safety of the dear
old house; as vividly as though it hung in a picture before her eyes
"she saw the little circle around the dining room table, the embroidered"
"square of Indian cloth, the green shaded lamp, Issy's books and Trude's"
"sewing, Vick's sketching things, the girls at their beloved tasks--and"
"her chair empty! Oh, what if she never sat again in that dear circle?"
Her heart broke in an agony of longing for Trude.
A sudden thought roused Pola to a feeble show of spirit.
"""If I had known how to swim we'd all be ashore now! And you two stayed"
"with me! I--I don't believe I'm worth that, girls."" She spoke with"
gloomy conviction.
But Mart answered with a promptness that settled that question forever.
"""Forget it. Why, you don't think we could a' done anything else, do"
you? And now I'm going up on deck and get some air. We must be most to
"Halifax by this time."""
"""_Halifax!_"" But this time Pola did not scream."
*       *       *       *       *
"Lavender, after his first plunge, had struck out toward the lighthouse."
His Mr. Dugald had taught him the science of swimming and because it
"was the one thing he could do easily and well, in spite of his"
"misshaped body, Lavender had taken pride in perfecting the practice."
"His assurance helped him now; he had no fear, he knew how to save his"
"strength; he swam first with one stroke, then with another, always"
keeping in sight the beacon of light.
till the day I can hand you your hundred thousand in cash. Everything's
"fair, square, and above-board now. I'm not asking you to risk anything."
"""And where in the wide world can you expect to do better for yourself!"""
"he argued. ""If you go East you'll get no more for the girl--and look at"
"the expense! You'll be sorry all the rest of your life, too, for I know"
you'd far sooner see her decently settled than sell her to any dog-faced
son-of-a-gun of a mandarin!
"""You can say what you like,"" he concluded, although Captain Dove had"
"said never a word. ""Clean money's pleasanter to spend than dirty, any"
"day. If I had been born wealthy, I'd never have needed to touch a marked"
"card. And now's your chance, too, to pull out of a rotten rut that'll"
"sooner or later land you among the chain-gang."""
"Captain Dove came forth from his cabin, indifferently clad, and eyed"
Slyne with a sarcastic interest which somewhat disconcerted that
homilist.
"""You don't _look_ just like a Band o' Hope!"" said the old man, ""but--"""
"Slyne rose again, and bit his lip, in simulated impatience. ""Oh, all"
"right,"" said he. ""If you're not interested--"""
"Captain Dove scowled at him. ""I'm interested,"" he said grudgingly. ""I'll"
"see this lawyer-fellow of yours whenever you like to bring him aboard,"
"and--if the money's there, you can count me in."""
"""He isn't the sort of lawyer you've been accustomed to, Dove,"" said"
"Slyne. ""You've got to go to him."""
"Captain Dove did his best to out-stare him, but failed."
And he went out and banged the door behind him. He walked the streets
furiously angry with Herold. He had gone to consult him on a baffling
problem. Herold had suggested a maiden aunt as a solution. He had but
"one, his mother's sister. Her name was Gladys. What was a woman of over"
fifty doing with such an idiot name? His Aunt Gladys lived at Croydon
and spent her time solving puzzles and following the newspaper accounts
of the doings of the royal family. She knew nothing. He remembered when
he was a boy at school coming home for the holidays cock-a-whoop at
having won the high jump in the school athletics sports. His Aunt
"Gladys, while professing great interest, had said, “But what I don't"
"understand, dear, is--what do you get on to jump down from?” He had"
"smiled and explained, but he had felt cold in the pit of his stomach. A"
futile lady. His opinion of her had not changed. In these days John was
rather an intolerant fellow.
"Chance willed it, however, that when he reached Fenton Square he found"
a letter which began “My dearest John” and ended “Your loving Aunt
Gladys.” And it was the letter of a very sweet-natured gentlewoman.
"John sat down at his desk to work, but ideas would not come. At last"
"he lit his pipe, threw himself into a chair in front of the fire, and"
"smoked till past midnight, with his heavy brows knitted in a tremendous"
frown.
CHAPTER VI
THE same frown darkened Risca's brow the next day as he waited for
admittance at his Aunt Gladys's door. It was such a futile little door
me. Will you see that Buster is sent up to my laboratory immediately?”
She nodded. It was evident that Buster was a great pet with her and
that it was with difficulty she kept from smoothing his silky coat.
“You—you won’t hurt Buster?” she pleaded.
"“No. Trust me. More than that, if there is any possible way of"
"untangling this mystery, I shall do it.”"
"Mrs. Blake looked rather than spoke her thanks. As we went downstairs,"
"accompanied by Miss Sears, we could see in the music room a very"
"interesting couple, chatting earnestly over the piano."
"Betty Blake, a slip of a girl in her first season, was dividing her"
attention between her visitor and the door by which we were passing.
"She rose as she heard us, leaving the young man standing alone at the"
piano. He was of an age perhaps a year or two older than Reginald
"Blake. It was evident that, whatever Miss Betty might think, he had"
eyes for no one else but the pretty debutante. He even seemed to be
"regarding Kennedy sullenly, as if he were a possible rival."
"“You—you don’t think it is serious?” whispered Betty in an undertone,"
scarcely waiting to be introduced. She had evidently known of our
"visit, but had been unable to get away to be present upstairs."
"“Really, Miss Blake,” reassured Kennedy, “I can’t say. All I can do is"
to repeat what I have already said to your mother. Keep up a good heart
and trust me to work it out.”
"“Thank you,” she murmured, and then, impulsively extending her small"
you can give it that and at the same time do me a favour. I was on my
way to dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling around the
corner. You come with me and we’ll have a cozy dinner and a pleasant
"talk together, and by that time your game ankle will carry you home"
"very nicely, I am sure.”"
"The girl looked quickly up into Chandler’s clear, pleasant countenance."
"Her eyes twinkled once very brightly, and then she smiled ingenuously."
"“But we don’t know each other—it wouldn’t be right, would it?” she"
"said, doubtfully."
"“There is nothing wrong about it,” said the young man, candidly. “I’ll"
"introduce myself—permit me—Mr. Towers Chandler. After our dinner, which"
"I will try to make as pleasant as possible, I will bid you"
"good-evening, or attend you safely to your door, whichever you prefer.”"
"“But, dear me!” said the girl, with a glance at Chandler’s faultless"
attire. “In this old dress and hat!”
"“Never mind that,” said Chandler, cheerfully. “I’m sure you look more"
charming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner
toilette.”
"“My ankle does hurt yet,” admitted the girl, attempting a limping step."
"“I think I will accept your invitation, Mr. Chandler. You may call"
me—Miss Marian.”
"“Come then, Miss Marian,” said the young architect, gaily, but with"
perfect courtesy; “you will not have far to walk. There is a very
respectable and good restaurant in the next block. You will have to
lean on my arm—so—and walk slowly. It is lonely dining all by one’s
"seen my friend, Le Grand, I shall write to you in cipher, of which I"
shall leave you the key. If I see a prospect of fortune worthy of
"Frances, I shall ask her to wait a time for me, but if my ill fortune"
"pursues me, I shall never again be heard from by any one in England. Are"
"you satisfied with the conditions?"""
"I gave him my hand for answer, and told him I would bring Frances to him"
early the following morning.
"I hastened back to Whitehall, and coming upon Frances unengaged, asked"
"her to go to her parlor with me. When she had closed the door, she turned"
"to me, asking:--"
"""What is it, Baron Ned? Tell me quickly. I know there is something wrong"
"with George."""
"""Will you go with me early to-morrow morning to see Betty--very early?"""
I asked.
"Her eyes opened in wonder, and she answered, somewhat amused: ""You have"
"been acting as my guardian for a long time, cousin Ned, and now I think I"
owe it to you to return the favor. You should not see so much of Betty. I
"know you mean no wrong to her, but you will cause her great suffering if"
"you continue to see her, for you must know that already the girl is"
"almost mad with love of you. Yet you cannot marry her."""
"""Nor can you marry some one else,"" I retorted, almost angrily, for a man"
dislikes to be prodded by a painful truth.
"""Ah, well, I suppose we are a pair of fools,"" she said."
"""You're right, Frances,"" I answered philosophically, ""and the only"
"Judas Petunikoff and pave the street with its timbers. By the way,"
"Mokei, I know out of what your wife baked to-day's kalaches; out of the"
frames of the third window and the two steps from the roof of Judas'
"house."""
When those present had laughed and joked sufficiently over the
"Captain's proposal, the sober market gardener, Pavlyugus asked:"
"""But seriously, what are we to do, your honour? ... Eh?  What do you"
"think?"""
"""I?  I shall neither move hand nor foot.  If they wish to clean the"
"street let them do it."""
"""Some of the houses are almost coming down...."""
"""Let them fall; don't interfere; and when they fall ask help from the"
"city.  If they don't give it you, then bring a suit in court against"
them!  Where does the water come from?  From the city! Therefore let
"the city be responsible for the destruction of the houses."""
"""They will say it is rain-water."""
"""Does it destroy the houses in the city?  Eh?  They take taxes from you"
but they do not permit you to speak!  They destroy your property and at
"the same time compel you to repair it!""  And half the radicals in the"
"street, convinced by the words of Kuvalda, decided to wait till the"
rain-water came down in huge streams and swept away their houses.  The
"others, more sensible, found in the teacher a man who composed for them"
an excellent and convincing report for the Corporation.  In this report
the refusal of the street's inhabitants to comply with the resolution
of the Corporation was so well explained that the Corporation actually
"""With all my heart!"" cried the soldier."
"Petunikoff was silent for a moment, then looked at him, and suddenly"
"asked, coldly and drily, ""And why do you wish to do so?"""
"Vaviloff did not expect such a question, and therefore had no reply"
ready.  In his opinion the question was quite unworthy of any
"attention, and so he laughed at young Petunikoff."
"""That is easy to understand.  Men like to live peacefully with one"
"another."""
"""But,"" interrupted Petunikoff, ""that is not exactly the reason why.  As"
"far as I can see, you do not distinctly understand why you wish to be"
"reconciled to us ...  I will tell you."""
"The soldier was a little surprised.  This youngster, dressed in a check"
"suit, in which he looked ridiculous, spoke as if he were Colonel"
"Rakshin, who used to knock three of the unfortunate soldier's teeth out"
every time he was angry.
"""You want to be friends with us because we should be such useful"
neighbours to you ... because there will be not less than a hundred and
"fifty workmen in our factory, and in course of time even more.  If a"
"hundred men come and drink one glass at your place, after receiving"
"their weekly wages, that means that you will sell every month four"
"hundred glasses more than you sell at present.  This is, of course, the"
lowest estimate ... and then you have the eating-house besides.  You
"are not a fool, and you can understand for yourself what profitable"
"neighbours we shall be."""
A low exclamation from Craig attracted my attention from Winters. In a
corner he had discovered a small box and had opened it. Inside was a
"dry battery and a most peculiar instrument, something like a little"
flat telephone transmitter yet attached by wires to earpieces that
fitted over the head after the manner of those of a wireless detector.
"“What’s this?” asked Kennedy, dangling it before Muller."
He looked at it phlegmatically. “A deaf instrument I have been working
"on,” replied the jeweler. “My hearing is getting poor.”"
Kennedy looked hastily from the instrument to the man.
"“I think I’ll take it along with us,” he said quietly."
"Winters, true to his instincts, had been searching Muller in the"
meantime. Besides the various assortment that a man carries in his
"pockets usually, including pens, pencils, notebooks, a watch, a"
"handkerchief, a bunch of keys, one of which was large enough to open a"
"castle, there was a bunch of blank and unissued pawn-tickets bearing"
"the name, “Stein’s One Per Cent. a Month Loans,” and an address on the"
Bowery.
"Was Muller the “fence” we were seeking, or only a tool for the “fence”"
higher up? Who was this Stein?
What it all meant I could only guess. It was a far cry from the wealth
"of Diamond Lane to a dingy Bowery pawnshop, even though pawnbroking at"
"one per cent. a month—and more, on the side—pays. I knew, too, that"
"diamonds are hoarded on the East Side as nowhere else in the world,"
"outside of India. It was no uncommon thing, I had heard, for a"
"""You've got some singular new attraction about you, Alwyn,""--he said,"
with a strange sense of keen inward excitement as he met his friend's
"calm yet flashing glance,--""Something mysterious, . . something that"
COMPELS! What is it? ... I believe that visit of yours to the Ruins of
"Babylon had a more important motive than you will admit, . . moreover.."
"I believe you are in love!"""
"""IN love!""--Alwyn laughed a little as he repeated the words.. ""What a"
foolish term that is when you come to think of it! For to be IN love
"suggests the possibility of getting OUT again,--which, if love be true,"
can never happen. Say that I LOVE!--and you will be nearer the mark!
"Now don't look so mystified, and don't ask me any more questions just"
"now--to-night, when we are sitting together in the library, I'll tell"
"you the whole story of my Babylonian adventure!"""
"And with a light parting wave of the hand he left the room, and"
Villiers heard him humming a tune softly to himself as he ascended the
"stairs to his own apartments, where, ever since he arrived, he had made"
it his custom to do two or three hours' steady writing every morning.
"For a moment or so after he had gone Villiers stood lost in thought,"
"with knitted brows and meditative eyes, then, rousing himself, he went"
"on to his study, and sitting down at his desk wrote an answer to the"
Duchess de la Santoisie accepting her invitation.
CHAPTER XXXIV.
REWARDS OF FAME.
"""Now you be careful, Ferdinand,"" Sis called after me as she opened a"
"book called _Family Problems of the Frontier Woman_. ""Remember you're"
"a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you."""
I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in
"front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their"
hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's
crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government
to run ships. I felt free all over--and happy. Now was my chance to
really see the _Eleanor Roosevelt_!
*       *       *       *       *
It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and
"behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out"
"of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white"
"doors--on and on and on. _Gee_, I thought excitedly, this is _one big"
ship_!
"Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of"
stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing
that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in _The Boy
"Rocketeers_, no portholes, no visiplates, nothing."
"So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned"
"left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading"
inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix
going _purr-purr-purrty-purr_ in the comforting way big machinery has
"when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the"
way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were

"""It's too bad I've got somebody in the best room,"" said Eilert. ""They're"
"gentlefolk from the city. They came down here through Stordalen, and they"
had to walk because the cars have stopped for the season. They've been in
"my house for quite some days, and I think they'll be staying on a while"
"yet. I think they're out now, but of course it means I can't let you have"
"my best room."""
"I looked up, and saw a face in the window. A shiver ran through me--no, of"
"course not a shiver, far from it, but certainly this was a fresh surprise."
"What a coincidence! As we were about to enter the door, there was the"
"actor, too--standing there looking at me: the actor from the Tore Peak"
"resort. It was his knees, his coat, and his stick. So I was right--I"
"_had_ recognized her face at an upper window. Yes, indeed, the world"
is small.
The actor and I greeted each other and began to talk. How nice to see me
"again! And how was Paul, the good fellow--still soaking himself in liquor,"
he supposed? Funny effect it has sometimes; Paul seemed to think the whole
"inn was an aquarium and we visitors the goldfish! ""Ha, ha, ha, goldfish; I"
"wish we were, I must say!--Well, Eilert, are we getting some fresh haddock"
"for supper? Good!--Really, we like it here very much; we've already been"
"here several days; we want to stay and get a good rest."""
"As we stood there, a rather stout girl came down from the loft and"
addressed the actor:
"""The missis wants you to come right upstairs."""
"""Oh? Very well, at once.... Well, see you later. You'll be stopping here,"
"too, I expect?"""
He hurried up the stairs.
"I jumped out and tried the door. It was locked, and I banged loudly"
without getting any answer. It would not do to lose an unnecessary
"minute, for the many miles we should have to walk later on loomed"
"unpleasantly ahead, but I knew there were pretty certain to be water"
"and washing-basin behind that door, and did not intend to leave them"
"unused if I could help it, _chokidar_ or no _chokidar_. So, I took a"
"butting run with my shoulder, the door gave, and I set out in search"
of the water tub.
"An open door on my right showed me a small room, absolutely empty,"
except for a row of tins against the wall. Knowing that petrol was
carried in such tin drums I went and examined them. The next moment
"Allan heard a shout that brought him hastily inside, wondering"
"whether I had gone mad, had been bitten by a wild beast, or was"
being murdered.
"""Look!"" I cried, as he came running up to me. ""Look at those tins and"
"tell me what's inside!"""
"Allan seized hold of one of the drums, read what was written on it,"
"gave it a shake, and we could both hear the blessed sound of lapping"
inside.
"""It's petrol, sir,"" he whispered in an awed voice."
Petrol in the desert--petrol where one would as soon have expected to
find a Bond Street jeweller!
At first we could neither of us believe it. Personally I imagined we
"had both got temporary jim-jams, but Allan, with his usual stolid,"

Dex Harlow was a six-foot Senior Lieutenant who had been on many an
out-of-the-way exploratory trip. Like Brand he was just under thirty
and perpetually thirsting for the bizarre in life. He was a walking
document of planetary activity. He was still baked a brick red from a
"trip to Mercury a year before: he had a scar on his forehead, the"
result of jumping forty feet one day on the moon when he'd meant to
jump only twenty; he was minus a finger which had been irreparably
frost-bitten on Mars; and he had a crumpled nose that was the outcome
of a brush with a ten-foot bandit on Venus who'd tried to kill him for
"his explosive gun and supply of glass, dyite-containing cartridges."
"He clutched Brand's fingers in a bone-mangling grip, and threw his hat"
into a far corner.
"""You're a fine friend!"" he growled cheerfully. ""Here I'm having a"
"first rate time for myself, swimming and planing along the Riviera,"
with two more weeks leave ahead of me--and I get a call from the Old
"Man to report to you. What excuse have you for your crime?"""
"""A junket to Jupiter,"" said Brand. ""Would you call that a good"
"excuse?"""
"""Jupiter!"" exclaimed Dex. ""Wouldn't you know it? Of course you'd have"
to pick a spot four hundred million miles away from all that grand
"swimming I was having!"""
"""Would you like to go back on leave, and have me choose someone else?"""
inquired Brand solemnly.
"""Well, no,"" said Dex hastily. ""Now that I'm here, I suppose I might as"
"well go through with it."""

one of the scout carriers. He told Hatch to make himself available

Then Wilson hit the sack to finish his off-duty.
"He dozed fitfully, but he did not sleep worth a damn. He would have"

Alice Hemingway awoke from a rather pleasant dream that had something
"to do with either ice skating or skiing, or it might have been"
tobogganing--the dream had faded so fast she could not be sure--to face
the fact that she was feeling on the chill side.
"Her blanket had slipped. She caught it around her, and in minutes"
"felt fairly warm again. It was not so much, she thought, the actual"
"temperature in the lifeship, but the whole damned attitude of people,"
and everything else that was so chilling.
"The lights were running all right, and from deep below she could hear"
the ragged throb of the pedal generator. She wondered which of the two
men was pumping it this time.
"When Jock Norton came in, she knew. He was mopping his face with a"
"towel. He looked clean and bright, freshly shaved."
"She looked at him and wished she could have a hot shower herself, and a"
change of clothing. She wanted a ten-hour sleep in a nice soft bed with
"clean sheets, too, and wearing a silk-soft nightgown."
in certain curiosities. She had seen that morning what had escaped the
Canon’s notice--the stranger’s grasp on Yvonne’s arm and the insolent
"admiration on his face. This fact, coupled with Yvonne’s agitation, had"
"put her upon the track of scandal. The result was, that at the concert"
"she made interesting discoveries, and, piecing things together in her"
"mind afterwards, bided her time to make use of them."
"It would be for the Canon’s sake, naturally. A woman of Mrs."
Winstanley’s stamp is always the most disinterested of God’s creatures.
She never performed an action of which her conscience did not approve.
But she was such a superior woman that her conscience trembled a little
"before her, like most of the other friends whom she patronised. She did"
not have to wait long. The Canon called upon her soon after his return
to invite herself and the Wilmingtons to dinner. It was his last
"evening at Ostend, and Yvonne was not feeling well enough to spend it,"
"as usual, at the Kursaal."
"“Yvonne is still poorly, Everard?” she asked, with her air of"
confidential responsibility.
"“A little. She has been gadding about somewhat too much lately, and it"
has knocked her up.”
“Has it not occurred to you that her encounter this morning may have had
something to do with it?”
"“Of course not,” replied the Canon, sharply. “It would be ridiculous.”"
"“I have reasons for not thinking so, Everard. The man was singing at the"
Kursaal this afternoon. Here is his name on the programme.” She
handed him the slip of paper. He read the name among the artistes. “M.
Bazouge.” He returned it to her.

The United Fruit Company is by far the greatest agricultural enterprise
the world has ever known. Its fruit plantations constitute a farm half a
mile wide and more than seven hundred miles long. All of its farm lands
exceed in area the 1332 square miles which constitute the sovereign
"State of Rhode Island. On these farms are more than 25,000 head of live"
stock. This agricultural empire is traversed by nearly 1000 miles of
railroad. To carry the fruits from the plantations to the seaports there
are employed 100 locomotives and 3000 freight cars. An army of nearly
"40,000 men is employed in this new and mammoth industry. The republics"
of Central America were inland nations before the United Fruit Company
made gardens of the low Caribbean coast lands and created from the
"virgin wilderness such ports as Barrios, Cortez, Limon and Bocas del"
Toro.

The young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden
"thought. His hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat, and drew out a"
"handful of letters. Selecting one, he handed it to the boy, following"
it with a silver dollar from his vest-pocket.
"“Give that letter to the lady,” he said, “and ask her to read it. Tell"
"her that it should explain the situation. Tell her that, if she had"
"mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal, much heartache"
might have been avoided. Tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much
has never wavered. Tell her I am waiting for an answer.”
The messenger stood before the lady.

"he’s no bum guy; and, lady, yer read dat letter, and I’ll bet yer he’s"

attack of her old heart-trouble in the conservatory at Mrs. Waldron’s

"proper attention, we might have lost her. I would be glad if you would"
call and undertake the treatment of her case.

"_Johan Johan_, or, at greater length, _The Merry Play between Johan"
"Johan the Husband, Tyb his Wife, and Sir Jhon the Priest_ (printed"
"1533), contains only the three characters mentioned, but possesses a"
"theme more nearly deserving the name of plot than do the other two,"
"namely, the contriving and carrying out of a plan by Tyb for exposing"
"her boastful husband's real and absolute subjection to her rule. Yet,"
"even so, it is extremely simple. Johan Johan is first heard alone,"
declaring how he will beat his wife for not being at home. The tuggings
"of fear and valour in his heart, however, give his monologue an"
"argumentative form, in which first one motive and then the other gains"
"the upper hand, very similar to the conflict between Launcelot Gobbo's"
conscience and the Devil. He closes in favour of the beating and

"world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers,"
together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was
to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn’t have dragged
"Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well,"
we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years
"from that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from"
what distance we might have to come. We figured that in twenty years
"each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made,"
whatever they were going to be.”
"“It sounds pretty interesting,” said the policeman. “Rather a long time"
"between meets, though, it seems to me. Haven’t you heard from your"
friend since you left?”
"“Well, yes, for a time we corresponded,” said the other. “But after a"
"year or two we lost track of each other. You see, the West is a pretty"
"big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively. But"
"I know Jimmy will meet me here if he’s alive, for he always was the"
"truest, stanchest old chap in the world. He’ll never forget. I came a"
"thousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and it’s worth it if my"
old partner turns up.”
"The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with"
small diamonds.
"“Three minutes to ten,” he announced. “It was exactly ten o’clock when"
we parted here at the restaurant door.”
"“Did pretty well out West, didn’t you?” asked the policeman."
"“You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well. He was a kind of plodder,"
"though, good fellow as he was. I’ve had to compete with some of the"
house and garden. Surely you could be happy in—in—appreciating it for a
change. Or you could take up some hobby.”
"And Lola the baby had chimed in loftily, “All men ought to have"
hobbies. It makes life impossible if they haven’t.”
"Well, well! He couldn’t help a grim smile as painfully he began to"
climb the hill that led into Harcourt Avenue. Where would Lola and her
"sisters and Charlotte be if he’d gone in for hobbies, he’d like to"
"know? Hobbies couldn’t pay for the town house and the seaside bungalow,"
"and their horses, and their golf, and the sixty-guinea gramophone in"
the music-room for them to dance to. Not that he grudged them these
"things. No, they were smart, good-looking girls, and Charlotte was a"
remarkable woman; it was natural for them to be in the swim. As a
"matter of fact, no other house in the town was as popular as theirs; no"
"other family entertained so much. And how many times old Mr. Neave,"
"pushing the cigar box across the smoking-room table, had listened to"
"praises of his wife, his girls, of himself even."
"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family. It’s like something one"
reads about or sees on the stage.”
"“That’s all right, my boy,” old Mr. Neave would reply. “Try one of"
those; I think you’ll like them. And if you care to smoke in the
"garden, you’ll find the girls on the lawn, I dare say.”"
"That was why the girls had never married, so people said. They could"
have married anybody. But they had too good a time at home. They were
"too happy together, the girls and Charlotte. H’m, h’m! Well, well."
Perhaps so....
By this time he had walked the length of fashionable Harcourt Avenue;
THE UNCLEAN THING.
"A few days later, Mr. Dick Derosne was walking in the Park at noon. He"
had been down to the Club and found no one there. Everybody except
"himself was at work: the politicians were scattered all over the colony,"
conducting their election campaign. Medland himself had gone to his
"constituency: his seat was very unsafe there, and he was determined to"
"keep it if he could, although, as a precaution, he was also a candidate"
"for the North-east ward of Kirton, where his success was beyond doubt."
"His friends and his foes had followed him out of town, and the few who"
were left were busy in the capital itself. Such men as these when at the
"Club would talk of nothing but the crisis, and, after he had heard all"
"there was to hear about the Benyon affair, the crisis began to bore"
"Dick. After all, it mattered very little to him; he would be out of it"
"all in a month, and the Medlands were not, when he came to think of it,"
"people of great importance. Why, the Grangers had never heard of them!"
"Decidedly, he had had enough and to spare of the Medlands."
"Nevertheless, he was to have a little more of them, for at this instant"
"he saw Daisy Medland approaching him. Escape was impossible, and Dick"
had the grace to shrink from appearing to avoid her.
"""The deuce!"" he thought, ""this is awkward. I hope she won't--"" He raised"
his hat with elaborate politeness.
Daisy stopped and greeted him with much effusion and without any
embarrassment. Dick thought that odd.
"""I was afraid,"" she said, ""we were not going to see you again before you"
"disappeared finally with the Governor."""
"was striving after speech. Slyne, outwardly cool and contemptuous of his"
"visible fury, stood gazing down at him, hands in pockets. Mr. Jobling"
"was wriggling restlessly in his chair, glancing from one to the other,"
prepared to flee from the coming storm.
"Still without a word, Captain Dove reached again for the"
"brandy-decanter, directly defying Slyne. Slyne stepped forward and"
snatched it out of his hand.
"Simultaneously, the old man and Mr. Jobling sprang from their seats, the"
"former making for Slyne and the latter for the door, which opened just"
"as he reached it, so that he all but fell over a boy in buttons who had"
knocked and entered carrying a telegram on a tray.
"Slyne had not moved. Captain Dove, almost at his throat, spun round on"
one heel.
"""For me?"" Mr. Jobling exclaimed anxiously as he ripped the envelope"
open. And a slow pallor overspread his puffy pink features while he was
perusing its contents.
"""From Mullins, my managing clerk,"" he mumbled as he passed the message"
"to Slyne, who looked it over indifferently, and then re-read it aloud in"
"a low but very ominous voice: ""'_American claimant landed at Genoa"
yesterday. Now on way to London. Court granted decree in his favour._'
"Handed in at Chancery Lane, in London,""--he pulled out his watch--""fifty"
"minutes ago."""
The page-boy had disappeared. Slyne pushed suddenly past Mr. Jobling and
set his back against the door. Captain Dove was approaching the
"terrified solicitor softly, on tiptoe, his fists clenched, all his"
tobacco-stained fangs displayed in a grin of fury. One of his long arms
The Lady’s Maid
_Eleven o’clock. A knock at the door._
"... I hope I haven’t disturbed you, madam. You weren’t asleep—were you?"
"But I’ve just given my lady her tea, and there was such a nice cup"
"over, I thought, perhaps...."
"... Not at all, madam. I always make a cup of tea last thing. She"
drinks it in bed after her prayers to warm her up. I put the kettle on
"when she kneels down and I say to it, “Now you needn’t be in too much"
of a hurry to say _your_ prayers.” But it’s always boiling before my
"lady is half through. You see, madam, we know such a lot of people, and"
they’ve all got to be prayed for—every one. My lady keeps a list of the
names in a little red book. Oh dear! whenever some one new has been to
"see us and my lady says afterwards, “Ellen, give me my little red"
"book,” I feel quite wild, I do. “There’s another,” I think, “keeping"
"her out of her bed in all weathers.” And she won’t have a cushion, you"
"know, madam; she kneels on the hard carpet. It fidgets me something"
"dreadful to see her, knowing her as I do. I’ve tried to cheat her; I’ve"
"spread out the eiderdown. But the first time I did it—oh, she gave me"
"such a look—holy it was, madam. “Did our Lord have an eiderdown,"
"Ellen?” she said. But—I was younger at the time—I felt inclined to say,"
"“No, but our Lord wasn’t your age, and he didn’t know what it was to"
"have your lumbago.” Wicked—wasn’t it? But she’s _too_ good, you know,"
"madam. When I tucked her up just now and seen—saw her lying back, her"
hands outside and her head on the pillow—so pretty—I couldn’t help
"thinking, “Now you look just like your dear mother when I laid her"
out!”
"Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb"
"things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what _Women_"
like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting
"married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her"
wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.
"Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do"
"with me. I knew what Sis could say to _that_, but at least it was an"
argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.
"I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to"

"movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding"
"off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it"
must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose
"against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,"
Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!
"Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of"
blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the
"wall in glowing red letters were the words, ""Lifeboat 47. Passengers:"
"Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!"""

It was extraordinarily easy for me to obtain employment in the heart
of your naval mysteries. Few questions were asked; you admitted me as
one of yourselves. I took the broad open path of full acceptance of
your conditions. I first obtained employment in a marine engineering
"shop at Southampton, joined a trade union, attended Socialist"
"meetings--I, a member of one of the oldest families in Trieste. Though"
"a Catholic, I bent my knee in the English Church, and this was not"

"Blundell's. To you, my friend, I can say this, for you are of some"
strange sect which consigns to the lowest Hell both Catholics and
"""No, thanks. I'm going to do something lots more exciting than sitting"
"_there_! And I'm in a hurry, too."" And with that Mart swung on past"
"them, her head high."
"Sidney had a moment's longing to run after her and coax her to come,"
"but Pola's light giggle checked her. ""Isn't she a riot? I'd have _died_"
"if she'd come with us!"""
"""Oh, Pola--she'll hear you!"" pleaded Sidney."
She hated herself because she did not tell Pola at once how bravely
"Mart shouldered her responsibilities, about gran'ma, who looked to Mart"
for everything. Instead she simply walked along with Pola and let Pola
"giggle. Pola, sensing Sidney's feelings, slipped her arm through hers"
and gave it an affectionate little squeeze.
"""You're such a funny child,"" she said softly. ""You'd be nice to"
"anything. I can't, of course, for I go around to so many places and"
"mother's warned me often about strangers. Anyway, it's lots nicer for"
"just us two to be together, isn't it?"""
But in spite of Pola's soft flattery and countless lumps of sugar the
"tea tasted bitter to Sidney and the Green Lantern, with its futurist"
"awnings, its bizarre hangings and cushions, had no allure. The thought"
came suddenly to Sidney that it had been a whole week since she had
even seen Mart; in that time she had scarcely exchanged more than a
half dozen words with Lavender.
To the tune of Pola's ceaseless chatter Sidney's thoughts kept darting
back to that uncomfortable fact. Pola always talked of things she had
"done at home, abroad, at school, of her boy friends whom she called"
"""men."" She liked to hint of countless ""affairs"" which simply must not"
"afterthought, ""that I promised to take for a run in your car, if--"""
"""You'll have time enough after lunch,"" Slyne suggested, and drew the"
noble marquis toward the window.
"""The Marquis of Ingoldsby!"" muttered Captain Dove. ""A run in Slyne's"
"car! And--_Lady Josceline Justice!_"" He dug his knuckles forcibly into"
"his blinking eyes, and, ""I seem to be wide enough awake,"" said he in a"
stage aside as several waiters arrived on the scene.
While they were setting the table Sallie tried to collect her thoughts.
"Slyne had told her nothing till then, but that he had found out who her"
"folk were. And she had come away from the _Olive Branch_ blindly, only a"
little less distrustful of him than of Captain Dove's cruel intentions
"toward her if she had remained on board. Even now, she scarcely dared to"
believe--
In response to a sign from Slyne she took her place at the flower-decked
table. The Marquis of Ingoldsby immediately settled himself at her side;
"he also was obviously a young man who knew what he wanted, and meant to"
"have that at all hazards and, while the others were seating themselves,"
he ogled her killingly.
"Slyne had sat down at her other hand, leaving Mr. Jobling and Captain"
Dove to keep one another company behind the great silver centre-piece
"which adorned the circular table. The marquis, leaning on one elbow, had"
"turned his back on Mr. Jobling, and Slyne turned his on Captain Dove."
"""This is a little bit of all right!"" his lordship remarked to Sallie,"
"with a confidential grin. ""Only--I wish--How is it that we haven't met"
"before, Lady Josephine? But never mind that. Let's be pals now. Shall"
"we, eh?"""
"""You have need of better marksmen,"" he said; ""even the Migueletes could"
"not do worse than that!"""
"""Who are you?"" demanded a tall grey-headed gipsy, who like the Sergeant"
"had remained apparently unarmed; ""what is your right to be here?"""
The Sergeant had by this time seated himself on a detached boulder and
was rolling a cigarette. He did not trouble to look up as he answered
"carelessly, ""To the Gitano my name is José Maria of Ronda!"""
The effect of his words was instantaneous. The men who had been ready to
"kill him a moment before almost fell at his feet, though here and there"
some remained apparently unconvinced.
Prominent among these was the elderly man who had put the question to
the Sergeant. Without taking his eyes from those of the Carlist soldier
"he exclaimed, ""Our great José Maria you cannot be. For with these eyes I"
"saw him garrotted in the Plaza Mayor of Salamanca!"""
The Sergeant undid his stock and pointed to a blood-red band about his
"neck, indented deeply into the skin, and more apparent at the back and"
sides than in front.
"""Garrotted in good faith I was in the Plaza of Salamanca, as this"
"gentleman says,"" he remarked with great coolness. ""But not to death. The"
"executioner was as good a _Gitano_ as myself, and removed the spike"
which strikes inward from the back. So you see I am still José Maria of
"Ronda in the flesh, and able to strike a blow for myself!"""
The gipsies set up a wild yell. The name of the most celebrated and most
lawless of their race stirred them to their souls.
and to the last possessed that loftiness of spirit wedded to sombre
fatalism which is the heritage of the Latins. He was at war with his
"kindred of Italy and France, and with the English among whom he had"
"been brought up, and whom he loved. He was their enemy by accident of"
"birth, but though he might and did love his foes better than his"
"German friends of Austria and Prussia, yet he had taken the oath of"
"faithful service, and kept it to the end. I could understand why"
"Dawson--that strange human bloodhound, in whom the ruthless will"
continually struggled with and kept under the very tender heart--would
allow no one to slander Trehayne.
"Cary was watching me eagerly, waiting for me to read the letter."
"Dawson's head was resting on one hand, and his face was turned away,"
"so that I could not see it. He could not wholly conceal his emotion,"
but he would not let us see more of it than he could help. He did not
move once during my reading.

... But one day I managed to get a pair of scissors and—would you
"believe it, madam? I cut off all my hair; snipped it off all in bits,"
like the little monkey I was. Grandfather was _furious_! He caught hold
of the tongs—I shall never forget it—grabbed me by the hand and shut my
fingers in them. “That’ll teach you!” he said. It was a fearful burn.
I’ve got the mark of it to-day.
"... Well, you see, madam, he’d taken such pride in my hair. He used to"
"sit me up on the counter, before the customers came, and do it"
"something beautiful—big, soft curls and waved over the top. I remember"
"the assistants standing round, and me ever so solemn with the penny"
grandfather gave me to hold while it was being done.... But he always
"took the penny back afterwards. Poor grandfather! Wild, he was, at the"
fright I’d made of myself. But he frightened me that time. Do you know
"what I did, madam? I ran away. Yes, I did, round the corners, in and"
"out, I don’t know how far I didn’t run. Oh, dear, I must have looked a"
"sight, with my hand rolled up in my pinny and my hair sticking out."
People must have laughed when they saw me....
"... No, madam, grandfather never got over it. He couldn’t bear the"
"sight of me after. Couldn’t eat his dinner, even, if I was there. So my"
"aunt took me. She was a cripple, an upholstress. Tiny! She had to stand"
on the sofas when she wanted to cut out the backs. And it was helping
her I met my lady....
"... Not so very, madam. I was thirteen, turned. And I don’t remember"
"ever feeling—well—a child, as you might say. You see there was my"

But his speeches did not have any effect--a mouthful of even the
freshest and purest water will not satisfy a hungry man.
Deacon Taras also tried to amuse the people by singing his songs and
"relating his tales.  He was more successful, and sometimes his"
endeavours ended in a wild and glorious orgy at the eating-house.  They
"sang, laughed and danced, and for hours behaved like madmen.  After"
"this they again fell into a despairing mood, sitting at the tables of"
"the eating-house, in the black smoke of the lamp and the tobacco; sad"
"and tattered, speaking lazily to each other, listening to the wild"
"howling of the wind, and thinking how they could get enough vodki to"
deaden their senses.
"And their hand was against every man, and every man's hand against them."
PART II.
"All things are relative in this world, and a man cannot sink into any"
"condition so bad that it could not be worse. One day, towards the end"
"of September, Captain Aristid Kuvalda was sitting, as was his custom,"
"on the bench near the door of the dosshouse, looking at the stone"
building built by the merchant Petunikoff close to Vaviloff's
"eatinghouse, and thinking deeply.  This building, which was partly"
"surrounded by woods, served the purpose of a candle factory."
"JAVANESE DANCERS,"
"TWITCHED strings, the clang of metal, beaten drums."
"Dull, shrill, continuous, disquieting;"
And now the stealthy dancer comes
Undulantly with cat-like steps that cling;
"Smiling between her painted lids a smile,"
"Motionless, unintelligible, she twines"
"Her fingers into mazy lines,"
Twining her scarves across them all the while.
"One, two, three, four step forth, and, to and fro,"
"Delicately and imperceptibly,"
"Now swaying gently in a row,"
"Now interthreading slow and rhythmically,"
"Still with fixed eyes, monotonously still,"
"Mysteriously, with smiles inanimate,"
"With lingering feet that undulate,"
"With sinuous fingers, spectral hands that thrill,"
"The little amber-coloured dancers move,"
"Like little painted figures on a screen,"
Or phantom-dancers haply seen
Among the shadows of a magic grove.
"shove in a dash of what he would prescribe, night and morning.  Perfect"
"quiet.  No stimulant.  A little cup of strong coffee without milk, if he"
seemed low.  Keep him in bed at present.  No worry; no excitement. Young
"man still.  Plenty of vitality.  As to herself, no undue anxiety."
To-morrow they would see whether a night nurse would be necessary.  Above
"all, no violin for a month, no alcohol--in every way the strictest"
"moderation!  And with a last and friendliest wink, leaning heavily on"
"that word ""moderation,"" he took out a stylographic pen, scratched on a"
"leaf of his note-book, shook Gyp's hand, smiled whimsically, buttoned his"
"upper waistcoat, and departed."
Gyp went back to her seat by the bed.  Irony!  She whose only desire was
"to be let go free, was mainly responsible for his breakdown!  But for"
"her, there would be nothing on his mind, for he would not be married!"
"Brooding morbidly, she asked herself--his drinking, debts, even the"
"girl--had she caused them, too?  And when she tried to free him and"
herself--this was the result!  Was there something fatal about her that
must destroy the men she had to do with?  She had made her father
"unhappy, Monsieur Harmost--Rosek, and her husband!  Even before she"
"married, how many had tried for her love, and gone away unhappy!  And,"
"getting up, she went to a mirror and looked at herself long and sadly."
XX
"Three days after her abortive attempt to break away, Gyp, with much"
"heart-searching, wrote to Daphne Wing, telling her of Fiorsen's illness,"
"and mentioning a cottage near Mildenham, where--if she liked to go--she"
"would be quite comfortable and safe from all curiosity, and finally"
begging to be allowed to make good the losses from any broken
"school and partly on the Continent during leave. Dawson, who was"
"evidently very proud of his young pupil and assistant, paraded his"
"accomplishments before us rather to Trehayne's embarrassment. ""Try him"
"with French and German,"" urged Dawson. ""He can chatter them as well as"
English. But he is as close as wax in all three languages. Some men
"can't keep their tongues still in one."""
"I turned to Trehayne and spoke in French: ""German I can't abide, but"
"French I love. My vocabulary is extensive, but my accent"
abominable--incurably British. You can hear it for yourself how it
"gives me away."""
"""It is not quite of Paris,"" replied Trehayne. ""Mais vous parlez"
"francais tres bien, tres correctement. Beaucoup mieux que moi."""
"""Non, non, monsieur,"" I protested, and then reverted to English."
"""Now,"" said Dawson, when Trehayne had left us, ""I must get along, see"
"the Commander of the _Malplaquet_, and draw a uniform and rifle out of"
the marine stores. It will be quite like old times. You won't see me
"until Saturday, when I shall be either a triumphant or a broken man."
"What is the betting, Mr. Copplestone?"""
"I could not understand the quizzical little smile that Dawson gave me,"
nor the humorous twitch of his lips. He had contemptuously disclaimed
"all use of theories, yet there was more moving behind that big"
forehead of his than he chose to give away. Did his ideas run on
parallel lines with mine; did he even suspect that I had formed any
"idea at all? I could not inquire, for I dislike being laughed at,"
"especially by this man Dawson. I had nothing to go upon, at least so"
little that was palpable that anything which I might say would be
"dismissed as the merest guesswork, for which, as Dawson proclaimed, he"
"third, also in French, and bearing no signature, made an appointment to"
meet her in the English tea-shop in the Rue Royale on the following day
at five o'clock.
"That note, written upon plain paper of business appearance, had"
"apparently been left by hand.  Who, I wondered, was the person who had"
"made that appointment?  To me the writing seemed disguised, and"
"probably, owing to the thickness of the up-strokes, had been penned by a"
"male hand.  There was a mistake in the orthography, too, the word"
"""plaisir"" being written ""plasir.""  This showed plainly that no Frenchman"
had written it.
"I placed the letter in my pocket, and, encouraged by it, continued my"
investigations.
In the tiny letter-rack was a note which the unfortunate girl had
written immediately before being struck down.  It was addressed to
"""Baronne Maillac, Chateau des Grands Sablons, Seine et Marne.""  The"
little escritoire contained four small drawers; the contents of each I
"carefully scrutinised.  They were, however, mostly private letters of a"
social character--some from persons whom I knew well in Society.
"Suddenly, from the bottom of one of the smaller drawers, I drew forth"
several sheets of plain octavo paper of a pale yellow shade.  There
"were, perhaps, half-a-dozen sheets, carefully wrapped in a sheet of"
"plain blue foolscap.  I opened them, and, holding one up to the light,"
examined the water-mark.
Next instant the truth was plain.  That paper was the official paper
used in French Government offices for written reports.  How came it in
"her possession, if the accusation against her were untrue?"
"I held it in my hand, glaring at it in bewilderment.  Sheet by sheet I"
"come to her mother's attention, assuring Sidney that she was absolutely"
the only one to whom she confided these deep intrigues. She had worn
Guy Townsend's fraternity pin the whole winter before and not a soul
had known whose pin it was for Guy was tabooed by mothers in general
and Mrs. Allan in particular. Now Pola was simply crazy over a Jack
"Sicard who was playing the lead in ""Hearts Aquiver."" But not even"
"Jack's manly beauty, as described by Pola, failed to draw from Sidney"
"more than a mild: ""He must be cute."" Pola gave way to vexation."
"""You're scarcely listening to me, Sidney Romley, when I'm telling you"
things I haven't told a _soul_! I believe you're still thinking of that
"ridiculous girl we met."""
"""She isn't ridiculous!"" Sidney was prompt enough now in Mart's defense."
"""She looks funny, but you see I've gotten well acquainted with her and"
"she's awfully nice."""
"""Oh, _nice_, of course! But _anyone_ can be nice! You know perfectly"
"well, Sidney, that there's as much class in this country as there is in"
"Europe and being _nice_ does not break down social barriers."""
Sidney had no answer ready for this. Curiously into her mind flashed
what Mr. Dugald had said about the solid aristocracy. But somehow she
knew Pola would not understand this. Pola went on:
"""I'm a dreadful little snob, anyway. But I suppose that is the result"
of my education. It would be funny to go to the most expensive schools
"and have all the culture that Europe can offer and _not_ be a snob."""
"Still Sidney stared into her teacup. She thought Pola was all wrong,"
but she did not know how to say it. Pola herself had told her that she
had gone to Grace Hall because it had no examinations and graduated a
At Bruges they were told that the train would not leave for Ghent
and Brussels for another two hours--some mobilization delay; so Hawk
proposed they should go and see the Memlings and then have some
dinner.
"""Don't you think they're perfectly wonderful?""--_àpropos_ of the"
pictures in the Hospital of St. Jean.
"_Vivie_: ""It depends on what you mean by 'wonderful.' If you admire"
the fidelity of the reproduction in colour and texture of the
"Flemish costumes of the fifteenth century, I agree with you. It is"
also interesting to see the revelations of their domestic
"architecture and furniture of that time, and the types of domestic"
"dog, cow and horse. But if you admire them as being true pictures of"
"life in Palestine in the time of Christ, or in the Rhineland of the"
"fifth century, then I think they--like most Old Masters--are"
perfectly rotten. And have you ever remarked another thing about all
"paintings prior to the seventeenth century: how _plain_, how _ugly_"
all the people are? You never see a single good-looking man or
woman. Do let's go and have that dinner you spoke of. I've got a
"prison appetite."""
At Ghent another delay and a few uneasy rumours. The Court was said
to be removing from Brussels and establishing itself at Antwerp. The
train at last drew into the main station at Brussels half an hour
after midnight. Vivie's mother was nowhere to be seen. She had
evidently gone back to the Villa Beau-séjour while she could. It was
too late for any tram in the direction of Tervueren. There were no
taxis owing to the drivers being called up. Leaving most of her
luggage at the cloak-room--it took her about three-quarters of an
"SYMPSON, DAVID."
Born at North Berwick.
One of Roberts's crew. Tried and hanged at Cape Coast Castle in 1722. On
the day of execution Sympson was among the first six prisoners to be
brought up from the ship's hold to have their fetters knocked off and to
"be fitted with halters, and it was observed that none of the culprits"
"appeared in the least dejected, except Sympson, who ""spoke a little faint,"
but this was rather imputed to a Flux that had seized him two or three
"days before, than Fear."" There being no clergyman in the colony, a kindly"
"surgeon tried to take on the duties of the ordinary, but with ill-success,"
the hardened ruffians being quite unmoved by his attempts at exhortation.
"In fact, the spectators were considerably shocked, as indeed they well"
"might be, by Sympson, suddenly recognizing among the crowd a woman whom he"
"knew, calling out ""he had lain with that B----h three times, and now she"
"was come to see him hanged."""
"Sympson died at the age of 36, which was considerably above the average"
age to which a pirate might expect to live.
"TAYLOR, CAPTAIN."
"This formidable South Sea pirate must indeed have looked, as well as"
"acted, the part, since his appearance is described by Captain Johnson as"
"follows: ""A Fellow with a terrible pair of Whiskers, and a wooden Leg,"
"being stuck round with Pistols, like the Man in the Almanack with Darts."""
This man Taylor it was who stirred up the crew of the _Victory_ to turn
"have left him long ago,' she said, 'but I tried to save him. Thank God"
"we have no children,' That seemed to be her most insistent thought,"
for she repeated it over and over again. 'Thank God that we have no
"children.'"""
"""I hope that you were gentle with her, Dawson,"" said I, deeply moved."
Long ago the wife had come to me and pleaded for her husband. She had
"shed no tear; she had admitted the justice, the necessity, of my"
"sentence. ""Can you not give him another chance?"" she had asked. ""No,"""
"I had answered sadly. ""He has exhausted all the chances."" When she had"
"risen to go and I had pressed her hand, she had said, still dry-eyed,"
"""You are right, sir, it is no use, no use at all. Thank God that we"
"have no children."""
"""I hope that you were gentle with her, Dawson,"" I repeated."
"He astonished me by the suddenness of his explosion. ""Damn,"" roared"
"he--""damn and blast! Do you think that I am a brute. Gentle! It was as"
"much as I could do not to kiss the woman, as your little daughter"
"kissed me, and to promise that I would get her husband off somehow."
"But I should not be a friend to her if I tried to save that man."""
"So Dawson had soft spots in his armour of callousness, and little"
Jane's instinct was far surer than mine. She had taken to him at
"sight. When I tried to get from her why, why he had so marked an"
"attraction for her, her replies baffled me more than the central fact."
"""I love Colonel Dawson. He is a nice man. He has a little girl like"
me. Her name is Clara. Her birthday is next month. I shall save up my
pocket money and send Clara a present. I like Colonel Dawson better
"even than dear Bailey."" I tore my hair, for ""Bailey"" is a wholly"
"imaginary friend of little Jane, whom I invented one evening at her"
bedside and who has grown gradually into a personage of clearly
"Geraldine, honour me by accepting my escort.—Grey, will you join us?"""
"He spoke the last words over his shoulder, and there was a note in his"
"voice which the young man had never heard before, and which he did not"
"fully understand.  It seemed to sting him, but he knew not why."
"""I thank you—no,"" he answered.  ""I am going home."""
And then he stood quite still to watch Lord Sandford lead away the fair
"Geraldine, who threw him one strange, half-appealing glance over her"
"shoulder, but spoke no word of farewell."
"Grey had meant to go home, but somehow he could not bring himself to do"
"so.  His brain seemed on fire, and his heart with it.  He knew not what"
"ailed him, but a fever was consuming him.  He left the gardens, but"
"walked on and on, not knowing or caring whither he went.  The night was"
"far spent, and the dawn was beginning to blush in the eastern sky,"
before he found himself in the region of Sandford House again.
The place was still and deserted.  The revellers and roisterers seemed
"all at home.  A watchman dozed at his post, thankful for the peace of"
"the streets, and Grey met no interruption, till suddenly, round a"
"corner, he came face to face with his host, who gave him a look, uttered"
"a short laugh, and linked his arm within his."
"""Well met, friend Grey!  You too have had no desire to woo the somnolent"
"god?  We find metal more attractive elsewhere.  Say now, what think you"
of the future Lady Sandford?  Methought you had eyes but for her
to-night.  Will she not queen it right royally here—the beautiful
"stately creature? You have taste, Grey, and I am well pleased that you"
"have.  Those painted, patched, and powdered Jezebels, smirking and"
"ogling and running all over the town for the adulation of the crowd, are"
"_Antigone_ for damage to her forefoot. Engineers were on one job, and"
platers and riveters on the other. Different trades. So not a workman
who was in the _Antinous_ was also in the _Antigone_. We can rule out
all the workmen. We can also rule out my lieutenant R.N.R. with the
German name who has gone to sea in the _Antinous_. The care and
maintenance party in the _Antigone_ was not the same as the one in the
"_Antinous_, not a man the same."""
"""You are sure of that?"" cried I, for it seemed that my daring theory"
"had gone to wreck. ""You are quite sure."""
"""Quite. I have all the names and have examined all the men. They were"
all off the ship by eleven o'clock last night. I hadn't one of my own
"men among them, but, to make sure, I sent Petty Officer Trehayne on"
board at eight o'clock to keep a sharp look-out and to see all the
harbour party off the vessel. He reported a little after eleven that
they were all gone and the ship taken over by her own crew. The damage
"was discovered at four bells in the morning watch."""
"""Six o'clock a.m.,"" interpreted Cary."
"""It looks now as if there might be a traitor among her own crew, which"
"is her officers' job, not mine. I wash my hands of the _Antigone_, but"
it is very much up to me to see that nothing hurtful happens to the
_Malplaquet_. The Admiral has orders to support me with all the force
under his command; the General of the District has the same orders.
But it isn't force we want so much as brains--Dawson's brains. I have
"been beaten twice, but not the third time. I've told the Yard that if"
"the _Malplaquet_ is touched I shall resign, and if they send any one"
"to help me I shall resign. Between to-day, Thursday, and Saturday I am"
going to catch the wily josser who has a fancy for cutting gun cables
"or Dawson will say good-bye to the Force. That's a fair stake."""

During this interview Rollo had stood absent-mindedly with his hand
"pressed on Concha's, as he listened to the strange speech of La Giralda."
Even his acquaintance with the language of the gipsies of Granada had
only enabled him to understand a word here and there. The girl's colour
"slowly returned, but the fear of the plague still ran like ice in her"
"veins. She who feared nothing else on earth, was shaken as with a palsy"
"by the terror of the Black Death, so paralysing was the fear that the"
very name of cholera laid upon insanitary Spain.
"""Well?"" said Rollo, turning to La Giralda, who stood considering with"
"her eyes upon the ground, after her interview with the crook-backed"
dwarf.
"""You must give me time to think,"" she said; ""this boy is one of our"
"people--a Gitano of Baza. He is not of this place, and he tells me"
strange things. He swears that the Queen and the court are plague-stayed
at La Granja by fear of the cholera. They dare not return to Madrid.
They cannot supply themselves with victuals where they are. The very
guards forsake them. And the Gitanos of the hills--but I have no right
"to tell that to the foreigner--the Gorgio. For am not I also a Gitana?"""

The village where Rollo's command first stumbled upon this dreadful fact
"was called Frias, in the district of La Perla, and lies upon the eastern"
"spurs of the Guadarrama. It was, therefore, likely enough then that the"
"boy spoke truth, and that within a few miles of them the Court of Spain"
was enduring privations in its aerial palace of La Granja.
But even when interrogated by El Sarria the old woman remained
obstinately silent as to the news concerning her kinsfolk which she had

"Dex shuddered; and a low moan came from Greca, whose clear blue eyes"
had rested on the contents of this vast room before in her capacity as
hostage and interpreter for the inhuman Rogans.
And now another sense of Dex's began to register perception on his
brain.
"A peculiar odor came to his nostrils. It was a musky, fetid odor, like"
"that to be smelled in an animal cage; but it was sharper, more acrid"
"than anything he had ever smelled on Earth. It smelled--ah, he had"
it!--_reptilian_. As though somewhere nearby a dozen titanic serpents
were coiled ready to spring!
"Looking about, Dex saw a six-foot square door of bars in one wall of"
"They travelled next day, reaching London at half-past two.  Betty had"
gone up in the early morning to prepare the way.  The dogs had been with
Aunt Rosamund all this time.  Gyp missed their greeting; but the
installation of Betty and the baby in the spare room that was now to be
"the nursery, absorbed all her first energies.  Light was just beginning"
"to fail when, still in her fur, she took a key of the music-room and"
"crossed the garden, to see how all had fared during her ten weeks'"
"absence.  What a wintry garden!  How different from that languorous,"
"warm, moonlit night when Daphne Wing had come dancing out of the shadow"
"of the dark trees.  How bare and sharp the boughs against the grey,"
"darkening sky--and not a song of any bird, not a flower!  She glanced"
"back at the house. Cold and white it looked, but there were lights in her"
"room and in the nursery, and someone just drawing the curtains.  Now that"
"the leaves were off, one could see the other houses of the road, each"
"different in shape and colour, as is the habit of London houses. It was"
"steel-grey sea with wistful, far-away eyes."
At his instigation she veiled herself very closely. And he had brought
with him a hooded cloak for Ambrizette. No one took any particular
notice of the inconspicuous party which presently left the Hôtel de
"Paris in a hired car, as if for an excursion along the coast."
At a station fifty miles away they left the car and caught the
"night-mail for Paris. Slyne's baggage was on board it, in the care of a"
"sullen chauffeur, and there were also berths reserved for them all."
"""Did you see any more of Dubois?"" Sallie heard Slyne ask the man, who"
shook his head indifferently in reply.
The long night-journey passed without other incident than a dispute
"between Captain Dove and the sleeping-car attendant, which raged until"
Slyne threatened to have the train stopped at the next station and send
for the police. And the sun was shining brightly when they reached
Paris.
"Mr. Jobling went straight on to London, but Slyne took Sallie and"
"Captain Dove to a quiet but expensive hotel, where they remained for a"
"few days, which passed in a perfect whirl of novelty and excitement for"
"her. And when they in their turn crossed the Channel, she had for"
baggage at least a dozen new trunks containing the choicest spoils of
the Rue de la Paix. Slyne had pooh-poohed all her timid protests against
"his lavish expenditure on her account, and had also provided for Captain"
Dove and Ambrizette in their degree. He had evidently a fortune at his
"disposal, and was bent on showing her how generous he could be."
He was also unostentatiously displaying other good qualities which had
all gone to make those days pass very pleasantly for her. She could not
"""Some of them,"" returned Villiers cautiously--""Not all. Not the Sunday"
"ones, for instance."""
"""Still, you can't possibly have helped seeing my descriptions of famous"
"people 'At Home,' you know! I write for ever so many journals. I"
"think""--and she became complacently reflective--""I think I may say with"
perfect truth that I have interviewed everybody who has ever done
"anything worth noting, from our biggest provision dealer to our latest"
sensational novelist! And all my articles are signed 'Tiger-Lily.' NOW
"do you remember? Oh, you MUST remember? ... I am so VERY well known!"""
There was a touch of genuine anxiety in her voice that was almost
"pathetic, but Villiers made no attempt to soothe her wounded vanity."
"""I have no recollection whatever of the name,"" he said bluntly--""But"
"that is easily accounted for, as I never read newspaper descriptions of"
"celebrities. So you are an 'interviewer' for the Press?"""
"""Exactly!"" and the lady leaned back more comfortably in the Louis"
"Quatorze fauteuil--""And of course I want to interview Mr. Alwyn. I"
"want..."" here drawing out a business looking note-book from her pocket"
she opened it and glanced at the different headings therein
"enumerated,--""I want to describe his personal appearance,--to know when"
"he was born, and where he was educated,--whether his father or mother"
"had literary tastes,--whether he had, or has, brothers or sisters, or"
"both,--whether he is married, or likely to be, and how much money he"
"has made by his book."" She paused and gave an upward glance at"
"Villiers, who returned it with a blank and stony stare."
"""Then,""--she resumed energetically--""I wish to know what are his"
methods of work;--WHERE he gets his ideas and HOW he elaborates
"them,--how many hours he writes at a time, and whether he is an early"
Nelson. More than once Sidney donned the cherry crêpe de chine and
"dined with Mrs. Allan and Pola and Dugald at the hotel, feeling very"
grand and traveled.
But to Sidney's deep regret Pola professed an abhorrence of swimming.
"""Just please don't _ask_ me,"" she had begged, shuddering. ""I loathe it!"
It's one of my complexes. Of course I've gone swimming in almost every
"body of water on the globe, but I hate it. You'll spoil my fun"
"_utterly_ if you even try to make me!"" After that Sidney could not"
"urge. She did not know what complexes were, but Pola had made them"
sound real and convincing and a little delicate. Though Sidney missed
the jolly swims with Lavender and Mart she refrained from even a hint
of her feelings.
Often when they were together Pola waxed confidential over her cousin.
"""He's a thorn in Aunt Lucy's side,"" she explained one day as the girls"
"lounged in Pola's room at the hotel, a huge box of candy on a stool"
"between them. ""She always wants him to go in for society and to go"
"abroad with her and do all the fashionable resorts on the Continent,"
"but couldn't you _see_ him? Not for Duggie boy, ever! When she starts"
planning something like that he bolts off somewhere and the next thing
you hear is that he's painted a wonderful picture and sold it or had
first mention or a gold medal. Of course that makes him terribly
interesting and there are dozens of single ladies from forty to
fourteen itching to catch him. And Dug's such a simple old dear that he
doesn't know it. But his mother does and she has them all sorted over
and the eligible ones ticketed. You see Dug will be dreadfully rich
some day and goodness knows what he'll do with the money for he hasn't
the brains of a child where business is concerned. His father's even
"richer than Dad."""
"What HAVE I done?""  No answer came.  And such rage against men flared up"
"that she just stood there, twisting her garden-gloves in her hands, and"
"biting the lips he would have kissed.  Then, going to her bureau, she"
"took up her address book and looked for the name: Wing, 88, Frankland"
"Street, Fulham. Unhooking her little bag from off the back of the chair,"
"she put her cheque-book into it.  Then, taking care to make no sound, she"
"passed into the hall, caught up her sunshade, and went out, closing the"
door without noise.
She walked quickly toward Baker Street.  Her gardening-hat was right
"enough, but she had come out without gloves, and must go into the first"
"shop and buy a pair.  In the choosing of them, she forgot her emotions"
"for a minute.  Out in the street again, they came back as bitterly as"
"ever.  And the day was so beautiful--the sun bright, the sky blue, the"
clouds dazzling white; from the top of her 'bus she could see all its
brilliance.  There rose up before her the memory of the man who had
"kissed her arm at the first ball.  And now--this!  But, mixed with her"
"rage, a sort of unwilling compassion and fellow feeling kept rising for"
"that girl, that silly, sugar-plum girl, brought to such a pass by--her"
husband. These feelings sustained her through that voyage to Fulham.  She
"got down at the nearest corner, walked up a widish street of narrow grey"
houses till she came to number eighty-eight.  On that newly scrubbed
"step, waiting for the door to open, she very nearly turned and fled."
What exactly had she come to do?
The door was opened by a servant in an untidy frock.  Mutton!  The smell
"of mutton--there it was, just as the girl had said!"
"""Is Miss--Miss Daphne Wing at home?"""
"In that peculiar ""I've given it up"" voice of domestics in small"
"households, the servant answered:"
was simply the train of thought aroused which struck Bainbridge
unpleasantly. He felt Schaeffer to be capable of almost any villainy
provided it could be accomplished with safety to himself. The
"humiliation of that fight, too, had added a powerful incentive to the"
one already offered by Crane and the Lumber Trust for the eclipse of Bob
Bainbridge. And a total eclipse would be so easy! Just a single shot
fired from the bushes at a moment when there was no one else about to
see or hear. In this wild country the chances of escaping were infinite.
The man might not even be suspected.
"Bob suddenly moved his shoulders impatiently, frowned, and turned away."
A moment later his eyes twinkled mirthfully.
"“Another minute and I’d have the undertaker picked out,” he chuckled."
"“The scoundrel hasn’t the common courage to do murder. All the same,” he"
"added, with a decisive squaring of the shoulders, “I’ll put a crimp in"
"his little game about those records. I’ll have cookee scrape ’em all up,"
"and ship the whole bunch down to John. That clerk, Wiggins, can put ’em"
"together, I’ll bet! Patience is his middle name--patience and picture"
"puzzles. We’ll have the laugh on Pete, after all--hanged if we won’t!”"
CHAPTER IX. IN THE SWIFT CURRENT
"The clumsy, slow-moving scow loaded with the cook’s outfit and a supply"
"of bedding followed the drive downstream, and, that night, fastened up"
"to the bank close to the inlet of Deer Pond, the middle one of three"
small bodies of water strung along the length of the Megantic. It was a
"full day’s work, much better than Bainbridge had hoped for, and, as he"
approached the big drying fire flaming up at one side of the camp made
"by Charlie Hanley, the cook, Bob shook his own hand in silent, grinning"
self-congratulation. He knew that they were far from being out of the
"If the transients were entranced by the fascinating Aileen, the"
regulars were her adorers. There was much rivalry among many of the
steady customers. Aileen could have had an engagement every evening. At
least twice a week some one took her to a theatre or to a dance. One
stout gentleman whom she and Tildy had privately christened “The Hog”
"presented her with a turquoise ring. Another one known as “Freshy,” who"
"rode on the Traction Company’s repair wagon, was going to give her a"
poodle as soon as his brother got the hauling contract in the Ninth.
And the man who always ate spareribs and spinach and said he was a
stock broker asked her to go to “Parsifal” with him.
"“I don’t know where this place is,” said Aileen while talking it over"
"with Tildy, “but the wedding-ring’s got to be on before I put a stitch"
"into a travelling dress—ain’t that right? Well, I guess!”"
"But, Tildy!"
"In steaming, chattering, cabbage-scented Bogle’s there was almost a"
"heart tragedy. Tildy with the blunt nose, the hay-coloured hair, the"
"freckled skin, the bag-o’-meal figure, had never had an admirer. Not a"
man followed her with his eyes when she went to and fro in the
restaurant save now and then when they glared with the beast-hunger for
food. None of them bantered her gaily to coquettish interchanges of
"wit. None of them loudly “jollied” her of mornings as they did Aileen,"
"accusing her, when the eggs were slow in coming, of late hours in the"
company of envied swains. No one had ever given her a turquoise ring or
"invited her upon a voyage to mysterious, distant “Parsifal.”"
"Tildy was a good waitress, and the men tolerated her. They who sat at"
her tables spoke to her briefly with quotations from the bill of fare;
and then raised their voices in honeyed and otherwise-flavoured
"who don't worry about Tom, Dick, or Harry, but choose an Orestes at"
"least for their tormenting; so that, when they give up their pursuit"
"of a Risca, he may excusably regard it as a personal slight. It was the"
morose and gloomy nature of the man.
"“I know I 'm a fool,” he said to Herold, when every one had gone to bed,"
“but I can't help it. Any normal person would regard me as insane if
I told him I was stopped from saving the wreck of my career by
consideration for the temporary comfort of a bedridden chit of a girl
"half my age, who is absolutely nothing to me in the world (her uncle"
"married my first cousin. If that is anything of a family tie, I'm weak"
on family feeling); but that's God's truth. I'm tied by her to this
"accursed country. She just holds me down in the hell of London, and I"
"can't wriggle away. It's senseless, I know it is. Sometimes when I 'm"
"away from her, walking on the beach, I feel I 'd like to throw the whole"
of this confounded house into the sea; and then I look up and see the
"light in her room, and--I--I just begin to wonder whether she 's asleep"
and what she's dreaming of. There 's some infernal witchcraft about the
child.”
"“There is,” said Herold."
"“Rot!” said Risca, his pugnacious instincts awakened by the check on"
his dithyrambics. “The whole truth of the matter is that I'm simply a
sentimental fool.”
"“All honour to you, John,” said Herold."
"“If you talk like that, I 'll wring your neck,” said Risca, pausing for"
"à second in his walk up and down Sir Oliver's library, and glaring down"
"at his friend, who reclined on the sofa and regarded him with a smile"
"exasperatingly wise. “You know I'm a fool, and why can't you say it? A"
a translation of an account of the payments for kaloma making.
ACCOUNT OF THE KALOMA MAKING
Supposing some man from inland lives in Kiriwina or in Luba
or in one of the villages nearby; he wants a katudababile. He
would request an expert fisherman who knows how to dive for
"kaloma. This man agrees; he dives, he dives ... till it is"
"sufficient; his vataga (large folding basket) is already full,"
"this man (the inlander) hears the rumour; he, the master of the"
"kaloma (that is, the man for whom the necklace will be made) says:"
"""Good! I shall just have a look!"" He would come, he would see,"
he would not give any vakapula payment. He (here the Sinaketan
"diver is meant) would say: ""Go, tomorrow, I shall break the shell,"
"come here, give me vakapula."" Next day, he (the inlander) would"
"cook food, he would bring, he would give vakapula; he (the diver)"
"would break the shell. Next day, the same. He (the inlander) would"
"give the vakapula, he (the diver) would break the shell. Supposing"
"the breaking is already finished, he (the diver) would say:"
"""Good! already the breaking is finished, I shall polish."" Next"
"day, he (the inlander) would cook food, would bring bananas,"
"coco-nut, betel-nut, sugar cane, would give it as vakapula;"
"this man (the diver) polishes. The polishing already finished,"
"he would speak: ""Good! To-morrow I shall drill."" This man (the"
"inlander) would bring food, bananas, coco-nuts, sugar cane,"
"he would give it as vakapula: it would be abundant, for soon"
"already the necklace will be finished. The same, he would give a"
"big vakapula on the occasion of the rounding up of the cylinder,"
"for soon everything will be finished. When finished, we thread it"
"on a string, we wash it. (Note the change from the third singular"
"into the first plural). We give it to our wife, we blow the conch"
"the glass; shuddered, turned her back on herself, and sat down again.  In"
her own house!  Why not here--in this room?  Why not before her eyes?
Not yet a year married! It was almost funny--almost funny!  And she had
her first calm thought: 'I am free.'
"But it did not seem to mean anything, had no value to a spirit so"
bitterly stricken in its pride.  She moved her chair closer to the fire
again.  Why had she not tapped on the window?  To have seen that girl's
face ashy with fright!  To have seen him--caught--caught in the room she
"had made beautiful for him, the room where she had played for him so many"
"hours, the room that was part of the house that she paid for!  How long"
had they used it for their meetings--sneaking in by that door from the
back lane?  Perhaps even before she went away--to bear his child!  And
there began in her a struggle between mother instinct and her sense of
"outrage--a spiritual tug-of-war so deep that it was dumb, unconscious--to"
"decide whether her baby would be all hers, or would have slipped away"
"from her heart, and be a thing almost abhorrent."
"She huddled nearer the fire, feeling cold and physically sick.  And"
suddenly the thought came to her: 'If I don't let the servants know I'm
"here, they might go out and see what I saw!'  Had she shut the"
drawing-room window when she returned so blindly?  Perhaps already--! In
"a fever, she rang the bell, and unlocked the door.  The maid came up."
"""Please shut the drawing-room, window, Ellen; and tell Betty I'm afraid I"
got a little chill travelling.  I'm going to bed.  Ask her if she can
"manage with baby.""  And she looked straight into the girl's face.  It"
"wore an expression of concern, even of commiseration, but not that"
fluttered look which must have been there if she had known.
"""Yes, m'm; I'll get you a hot-water bottle, m'm.  Would you like a hot"
"bath and a cup of hot tea at once?"""
Of course I ought to be old enough to understand what all sensible
"Norwegians know, that our country is once more on the right road. The"
papers are all writing about the splendid progress the tourist traffic has
made in Stordalen since the motor road was opened--ought I not to go there
and feel gratified?
"From old habit, I still take an interest in the few of us who are left;"
Miss Torsen is still here.
"Miss Torsen--what more is there to be said about her? Well, she does not"
"leave; she stays here to complete the picture of the woman Torsen, child"
of the middle class who has read schoolbooks all through her formative
"years, who has learned all about _Artemis cotula_, but undernourished"
her soul. That is what she is doing here.
"I remember a few weeks ago, when we were infested with Englishmen, a young"
sprout coming down from the mountain top with a bloodstained rag which he
"threw on the ground, saying, ""Here's what's left of your lawyer that fell"
"off!"" Miss Torsen heard it, and never moved a muscle. No, she never"
"mourned the death of the lawyer very keenly; on the contrary, she wrote"
"off at once to ask another friend to come. When he came, he turned out to"
"be a swaggering scatterbrain--a ""free lance,"" he called himself in the"
visitors' book. I have not mentioned him before because he was less
"important than she; less important, in fact, than any of us. He was"
beardless and wore his collar open; heaven knows if he wasn't employed at
"a theater or in the films. Miss Torsen went to meet him when he came, and"
"said, ""Welcome to our mountains,"" and ""Thanks for coming."" So evidently"
she had sent for him. But why did she not leave? Why did she seem to
"strike root in the place, and even ask others to come here? Yet she had"
been the first to want to leave last summer! There was something behind
this.
Sheldon at the time—and there was a fair on the common.
"“Now, Ellen,” she said, “I want you to take the two young ladies for a"
ride on the donkeys.” Off we went; solemn little loves they were; each
had a hand. But when we came to the donkeys they were too shy to go on.
So we stood and watched instead. Beautiful those donkeys were! They
were the first I’d seen out of a cart—for pleasure as you might say.
"They were a lovely silver-grey, with little red saddles and blue"
bridles and bells jing-a-jingling on their ears. And quite big
"girls—older than me, even—were riding them, ever so gay. Not at all"
"common, I don’t mean, madam, just enjoying themselves. And I don’t know"
"what it was, but the way the little feet went, and the eyes—so"
gentle—and the soft ears—made me want to go on a donkey more than
anything in the world!
"... Of course, I couldn’t. I had my young ladies. And what would I have"
looked like perched up there in my uniform? But all the rest of the day
it was donkeys—donkeys on the brain with me. I felt I should have burst
if I didn’t tell some one; and who was there to tell? But when I went
"to bed—I was sleeping in Mrs. James’s bedroom, our cook that was, at"
"the time—as soon as the lights was out, there they were, my donkeys,"
"jingling along, with their neat little feet and sad eyes.... Well,"
"madam, would you believe it, I waited for a long time and pretended to"
"be asleep, and then suddenly I sat up and called out as loud as I"
"could, “_I do want to go on a donkey. I do want a donkey-ride!_” You"
"see, I had to say it, and I thought they wouldn’t laugh at me if they"
knew I was only dreaming. Artful—wasn’t it? Just what a silly child
would think....
"... No, madam, never now. Of course, I did think of it at one time. But"
it wasn’t to be. He had a little flower-shop just down the road and
across from where we was living. Funny—wasn’t it? And me such a one for
"the present Premier of Italy, who says:"
"""The church appears better than it once was. I no longer see in Rome"
"what I used often to see in my young days, ladies driving about its"
streets with their coachmen and footmen in the liveries of their
respective cardinals. Has this improvement come about because the
church is really growing better? Nothing of the kind. It is because the
"strong arm of the law checks the villainy of the priests."" That is the"
testimony of the Prime Minister of Italy.

"A few weeks after my return from Italy, while driving one afternoon"
"with a friend of mine, a lawyer of high intelligence and wide"
"information, our conversation turned to the subject of the recent death"
"of Pope Leo XIII., and from that drifted to the alleged liquefaction"
"of the blood of St. Januarius, and from that to relics in general. I"
mentioned some of the facts above stated concerning the numerous pieces

An Act to make further provision for the establishment of
"Prize Courts, and for other purposes connected therewith."
[_17th August 1894._]
"Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the"
"advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in"
"this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as"
follows:
[Sidenote: Short Title.]
"1. This Act may be cited as the Prize Courts Act, 1894."
[Sidenote: Constitution of Prize Courts in British Possessions.]
"2.--(1) Any commission, warrant, or instructions from Her Majesty the"
Queen or the Admiralty for the purpose of commissioning or regulating
"the procedure of a prize court at any place in a British possession may,"
"notwithstanding the existence of peace, be issued at any time, with a"
direction that the court shall act only upon such proclamation as
herein-after mentioned being made in the possession.
"(2) Where any such commission, warrant, or instructions have been"
"issued, then, subject to instructions from Her Majesty, the Vice-Admiral"
"of such possession may, when satisfied, by information from a Secretary"
"of State or otherwise, that war has broken out between Her Majesty and"
"any foreign State, proclaim that war has so broken out, and thereupon"

David is really the center of this territory. It is a typical Central
"American town of about 15,000 people, with a plaza, a cathedral, a hotel"
and all the appurtenances of metropolitan life in Panama. The place is
"attractive in its way, with its streets of white-walled, red-tiled"
"dwellings, with blue or green doors and shutters. It seems to have grown"
"with some steadiness, for though the Panama census for 1912 gave it"
"15,000 inhabitants, travelers like Mr. Forbes Lindsay and Albert"
"Edwards, who visited it only a year or two earlier, gave it only from"
"5000 to 8000 people. Its growth, however, is natural and healthy, for"
the country round it is developing rapidly. You reach David now by boats
of the Pacific Mail and the National Navigation Company from Panama. The
"quickest trip takes thirty hours. When the government railroad is built,"
"about which there is some slight doubt, the whole country will be opened"
and should be quickly settled. The road in all probability will be
continued to Bocas del Toro on the Atlantic coast.

"While the cattle business of the Chiriqui region is its chief mainstay,"
it is far from being developed to its natural extent. The Commissary
officials of the Canal organization tried to interest cattle growers to
"the extent of raising enough beef for the need of the Canal workers, but"
failed. Practically all of the meat thus used is furnished by the
so-called “Beef Trust” of the United States. It is believed that there
"are not more than 50,000 head of cattle all told in Panama. I was told"

that it was necessary to get her lover away just as soon as he was able
to ride a horse.
"Lying on the rug in front of the fire she had been thinking of him when,"
"suddenly, her quick ear, more than ever alert in these days, caught the"
sound of a stealthy footstep outside the cabin. With no fear whatever
"except in relation to the discovery of her lover, the Girl went"
noiselessly to the window and peered out into the darkness. A man was
making signs that he wished to speak with her. For a moment she stood
"watching in perplexity, but almost instantly her instinct told her that"
"one of that race, for she believed the man to be a Mexican, would never"
dare to come to her cabin at that time of night unless it was on a
friendly errand. So putting her face close to the pane to reassure
"herself that she had not been mistaken in regard to his nationality, she"
"then went to the door and held it wide open for the man to enter, at the"
same time putting her finger to her lips as a sign that he should be
very still.
"""What are you doin' here? What do you want?"" she asked in a low voice,"
at the same time leading him to the side of the room further away from
her lover.

"The visits to his uncle's home, and the attractive young lady whom he"
"there met, must have largely contributed to Ferrier's happiness in"
these years of mental fermentation. Such times come in many men's lives
"when youth is turning into manhood, and powers are wakening up within"
that seem as though they would lead us we know not whither. And so it
may have been with Ferrier. But he was endowed with considerable
"calmness and self-command, combined with a confidence in his powers"
sufficient to carry him through many difficulties that might otherwise
"have got the better of him. Wilson's home, Elleray, near the Lake of"
"Windermere, was the centre of a circle of brilliant stars. Ferrier"
"recollected, while still a lad of seventeen years of age, meeting there"
"at one time, in the summer of 1825, Scott, Wordsworth, Lockhart, and"
"Canning, a conjunction difficult to beat.[4] Once more, we are told,"
"and on a sadder occasion, he came into association with the greatest"
Scottish novelist. 'It was on that gloomy voyage when the suffering man

"foreign journey. Mr. Ferrier was also a passenger, and scarcely dared"
to look on the almost unconscious form of one whose genius he so warmly
admired.' The end was then very near.
"[4] This meeting occurred after the Irish tour of Scott,"
"Miss Anne Scott, and Lockhart, when they visited Wilson at"
"Elleray. Canning was staying at Storre, in the"
neighbourhood.
"Professor Ferrier's daughter tells us that long after, in the summer of"
"1856, the family went to visit the English Lakes, the centre of"
"attraction being Elleray, Mr. Ferrier's old home and birthplace. 'The"
the room where it was lying.  If she had not been ordered to give up
"nursing, that struggle would never have come.  Her heart ached, but a"
demon pressed her on and past the door.  Downstairs she just pottered
"round, dusting her china, putting in order the books which, after"
"house-cleaning, the maid had arranged almost too carefully, so that the"
first volumes of Dickens and Thackeray followed each other on the top
"shell, and the second volumes followed each other on the bottom shelf."
And all the time she thought dully: 'Why am I doing this?  What do I care
how the place looks?  It is not my home.  It can never be my home!'
"For lunch she drank some beef tea, keeping up the fiction of her"
"indisposition.  After that, she sat down at her bureau to write."
"Something must be decided!  There she sat, her forehead on her hand, and"
nothing came--not one word--not even the way to address him; just the
"date, and that was all.  At a ring of the bell she started up.  She could"
"not see anybody!  But the maid only brought a note from Aunt Rosamund,"
"and the dogs, who fell frantically on their mistress and instantly began"
"to fight for her possession. She went on her knees to separate them, and"
"enjoin peace and good-will, and their little avid tongues furiously"
licked her cheeks. Under the eager touch of those wet tongues the band
round her brain and heart gave way; she was overwhelmed with longing for
her baby. Nearly a day since she had seen her--was it possible?  Nearly a
day without sight of those solemn eyes and crinkled toes and fingers! And
"followed by the dogs, she went upstairs."
"The house was invisible from the music-room; and, spurred on by thought"
"that, until Fiorsen knew she was back, those two might be there in each"
"other's arms any moment of the day or night, Gyp wrote that evening:"
"""DEAR GUSTAV,--We are back.--GYP."""
What else in the world could she say?  He would not get it till he woke
"corrected by him and all those divines, whom he distrusted, would watch"
him at close quarters. But it was only to be for a few months. 'I have
"removed to Louvain', he writes to the Archbishop of Canterbury, 'till I"
"shall decide which residence is best suited to old age, which is already"
knocking at the gate importunately.'
"As it turned out, he was to spend four years (1517-21) at Louvain. His"
"life was now becoming more stationary, but because of outward"
circumstances rather than of inward quiet. He kept deliberating all
"those years whether he should go to England, Germany or France, hoping"
at last to find the brilliant position which he had always coveted and
never had been able or willing to grasp.
The years 1516-18 may be called the culmination of Erasmus's career.
Applauding crowds surrounded him more and more. The minds of men were
seemingly prepared for something great to happen and they looked to
"Erasmus as the man! At Brussels, he was continually bothered with visits"
"from Spaniards, Italians and Germans who wanted to boast of their"
"interviews with him. The Spaniards, with their verbose solemnity,"
particularly bored him. Most exuberant of all were the eulogies with
which the German humanists greeted him in their letters. This had begun
"already on his first journey to Basle in 1514. 'Great Rotterdamer',"
"'ornament of Germany', 'ornament of the world' were some of the simplest"
"effusions. Town councils waited upon him, presents of wine and public"
banquets were of common occurrence. No one expresses himself so
hyperbolically as the jurist Ulrich Zasius of Freiburg. 'I am pointed
"out in public', he asserts, 'as the man who has received a letter from"
"Erasmus.' 'Thrice greatest hero, you great Jove' is a moderate"
"apostrophe for him. 'The Swiss', Zwingli writes in 1516, 'account it a"
great glory to have seen Erasmus.' 'I know and I teach nothing but
"Erasmus now,' writes Wolfgang Capito. Ulrich von Hutten and Henry"
"Glareanus both imagine themselves placed beside Erasmus, as Alcibiades"
"Summer tourists were still there; the Casino was full of people, the"
shops were doing an active trade; the restaurants were crowded with
"English, Americans, Belgians taking tea, chocolate, or liqueurs at"
little tables and creating a babel of talk. Newspapers were being
sold everywhere by ragamuffin boys who shouted their head-lines in
"French, Flemish, and quite understandable English. A fort or two at"
"Liége had fallen, but it was of no consequence. General Léman could"
"hold out indefinitely, and the mere fact that German soldiers had"
entered the town of Liége counted for nothing. Belgium had virtually
won the war by holding up the immense German army. France was
"overrunning Alsace, Russia was invading East Prussia and also"
"sending uncountable thousands of soldiers, via Archangel, to"
"England, whence they were being despatched to Calais for the relief"
of Belgium.
"""It looks,"" thought Vivie, after glancing at the _Indépendance"
"Belge_, ""As though Belgium were going to be extremely interesting"
during the next few weeks; I may be privileged to witness--from a
"safe distance--another Waterloo."""
Then she returned to the train which in her absence had been so
crowded with soldiers and civilian passengers that she had great
difficulty in finding her place and seating herself. The young man
whom she had seen pacing the deck of the steamer approached her and
"said: ""There is more room in my compartment; in fact I have"
"selfishly got one all to myself. Won't you share it?"""
She thanked him and moved in there with her suit case and rugs.
When the train had started and she had parried one or two polite
"enquiries as to place and ventilation, she said: ""I think I ought to"
"tell you who I am, in case you would not like to be seen speaking to"
hour even to approach the receiving counter--Vivie walked across to
the _Palace Hotel_ and asked the night porter to get her a room. But
"every room was occupied, they said--Americans, British, wealthy war"
"refugees from southern Belgium, military officers of the Allies. The"
only concession made to her--for the porter could hold out little
hope of any neighbouring hotel having an empty room--was to allow
her to sit and sleep in one of the comfortable basket chairs in the
long atrium. At six o'clock a compassionate waiter who knew the name
of Mrs. Warren gave her daughter some coffee and milk and a
_brioche_. At seven she managed to get her luggage taken to one of
the trams at the corner of the Boulevard du Jardin Botanique. The
train service to Tervueren was suspended--and at the Porte de Namur
she would be transferred to the No. 45 tram which would take her out
to Tervueren.
Even at an early hour Brussels seemed crowded and as the tram passed
along the handsome boulevards the shops were being opened and
tourists were on their way to Waterloo in brakes. Every one seemed
"to think in mid-August, 1914, that Germany was destined to receive"
her _coup-de-grâce_ on the field of Waterloo. It would be so
appropriate. And no one--at any rate of those who spoke their
thoughts aloud--seemed to consider that Brussels was menaced.
"Leaving her luggage at the tram terminus, Vivie sped on foot through"
"forest roads, where the dew still glistened, to the Villa"
"Beau-séjour. Mrs. Warren was not yet dressed, but was rapturous in"
"her greeting. Her chauffeur had been called up, so the auto could"
"not go out, but a farm cart would be sent for the luggage."
"""I believe, mother, I'm going to enjoy myself enormously,"" said"
"Vivie as she sat in the verandah in the morning sunshine, making a"
"delicious _petit déjeuner_ out of fresh rolls, the butter of the"
"acquire no intelligence sitting down in Robat, whereas, if he came"
"with me, he would get all he wanted at first hand!"
I set myself to pick up all the information I could about the
"conditions of British ""influence"" in this part of Persia, and on"
the borders of Afghanistan. To make it in any way clear why we had
any influence here at all we must revert to the old fear of the
"threatened advance of Russia on India, in the days before Russia"
became our ally in the Great War.
Slowly and gradually Russia had been extending her influence in the
Pamirs until her outposts on the Oxus River were only eight marches
"from Chitral. Evidently, as a wide counter, strategic move, the"
Indian Government had sought to increase its own influence with
Persia and Afghanistan by pushing forward her outposts to Robat and
Nasaratabad.
"Consequently, at the time of which I am writing, Robat, Nasaratabad"
and Birjand were held lightly by chains of small posts composed
entirely of Indian troops and some local levies commanded by British
"officers. Our lines of communication running from Birjand to Nushki,"
"a distance of about six hundred miles, were held, in widely scattered"
"posts, by only one battalion of Indian Infantry and one regiment of"
Indian Cavalry and four mountain guns. Thus it will be seen that it
was very difficult to obtain any troops for a movable column.
"A British Consulate had also been established at Nasaratabad, which"
is on the borders of Afghanistan and Persia. During the War the
"importance and influence of the Consul increased considerably, as he"
was in a position to gather information which was of great value to
"the military commanders, who constantly sought his advice."
"her, too! I only wish that I might get the chance to see her sometime!"""
"said he. ""Well, just wait until to-morrow,"" said the giant, ""and then I"
"will lead you to her myself,"" he said. ""A thousand thanks, master,"" said"
"the king's son, ""but I think you are only joking!"" The following day the"
giant took him to the Master Girl.
"""Now you must slaughter him, and cook him in the big kettle, you know"
"which one I mean. And when the soup is ready, you can call me,"" said the"
"giant, and he lay down on the bench to sleep, and at once began to snore"
"so that the hills shook. Then the Master Girl took a knife, and cut the"
"youth's little finger, and let three drops of blood fall on the bench."
"Then she took all the old rags, and old shoes and other rubbish she"
"could find, and threw them all into the kettle. And then she took a"
"chest of gold-dust, and a lick-stone, and a bottle of water that hung"
"over the door, and a golden apple, and two golden hens, and left the"
giant's castle together with the king's son as quickly as possible.
"After a time they came to the sea, and they sailed across; though where"
they got the ship I do not exactly know.
"Now when the giant had been sleeping quite a while, he began to stretch"
"himself on his bench. ""Is dinner ready yet?"" he asked. ""Just begun!"""
said the first drop of blood on the bench. Then the giant turned
"around, went to sleep again, and went on sleeping for quite some time."
"Then he again turned around a little. ""Is dinner not ready yet?"" he"
"said, but did not open his eyes--nor had he done so the first time--for"
"he was still half asleep. ""It is half ready!"" called out the second drop"
"of blood, and then the giant thought it was the Master Girl. He turned"
around on the bench and took another nap. After he had slept a couple of
"hours longer, he once more began to move about and stretch: ""Is dinner"
"still not ready?"" said he. ""Ready!"" answered the third drop of blood."
The giant sat up and rubbed his eyes. But he could not see who had
"called him, and so he called out to the Master Girl. But no one answered"
"hopefulness, vigor and growth of Protestant Christianity in these"
strenuous latter days.

But we were soon to learn that the Roman Catholics did not think of the
infant Christ as lacking in power of a certain sort; on the contrary
they ascribe miraculous agency even to an image of the divine babe. On
"the afternoon of December 29th, as two of our party were returning to"
"our hotel, they passed at the foot of the Capitoline Hill a carriage,"
"out of the window of which hung a ribbon or sash of cloth of gold, and"
"they were not a little astonished to observe that, as this carriage"
"rolled along, people knelt reverently before it on the street. Inside"
they saw two bareheaded men holding a child on a pillow with a wealth
of lace about it. They thought perhaps it was the royal carriage with
"the baby princess, but they could not imagine why _men_ should be"
"nursing the baby, as that is usually the employment of women, nor why"
"the people should kneel so reverently before the young princess, a"
"thing which they never did even for the king himself. The fact is that,"
as they learned on the following afternoon when visiting the Church of
"Ara Coeli, on the Capitoline Hill, the carriage in question belonged to"
"a far more important personage in Rome than any princess, though that"
"personage was not even a living baby, but only a doll. It was the coach"
of the famous Bambino--_Il Santissimo Bambino_--which with its dress
"of gold and silver tissue and its magnificent diamonds, emeralds and"
"rubies, is the chief attraction of this church."

"Dr. Alexander Robertson, in his book on _The Roman Catholic Church in"
honourable and dangerous service which I had no choice but to accept.
My dreams of love had gone to wreck. I could have deceived the woman
"whom I loved, for she would have trusted me and believed any story of"
"me that I had chosen to tell. But could I, an officer, a gentleman by"
"birth and I hope by practice, a secret enemy of England and a spy upon"
"her in the hour of her sorest trial, could I remain the lover of an"
English girl without telling her fully and frankly exactly what I was?
Could I have committed this frightful treason to love and remained
other than an object of scorn and loathing to honest men? I could not.
"In soul and heart she was mine; I was her man, and she was my woman."
"With her there were no reserves in love. She was mine, yet I fled from"
"her with never a word, even of good-bye. I made my plans, obtained"
"certificates of my proficiency in the _Vernon_, kissed my dear love"
"quietly, almost coldly, without a trace of the passion that I felt,"
"and fled. It was the one thing left me to do. My friend, that was two"
years ago. She knows not whether I am alive or am dead; I know not
"permission to spend the night with her father, and Baron Clyde called"
"about four o'clock to escort her. Was not that the hour, baron?"""
"""Yes, your Grace,"" I answered, bowing. ""I accompanied my cousin to"
"her father's house, returned later to fetch her back to the palace,"
"but she did not care to face the storm, so I remained till ten o'clock,"
"returned to Whitehall, and slept till morning. Here is another witness,"""
"I continued, laughing, as I turned to John Churchill, who was standing"
"near the king. ""Step forward, Churchill, and testify. I left him making"
"his suit to one of the most interesting ladies in London."""
"The king turned with an inquiring look, and Churchill answered: ""Yes,"
"your Majesty, it is all true. I was making my suit until near the hour"
"of eleven, when Mistress Jennings, who was ill, told me it was time to"
"go home. If she was kidnapped Sunday night, it was before five o'clock"
"or after eleven."""
The time of our Dover journey was one of extreme depletion in the privy
purse. The king had borrowed from every person and every city within the
"realm who, by threats or cajolery, could be induced to part with money."
But now he had reached the end of his tether.
"When matters were thus in extremis, some one, probably Castlemain,"
"suggested the sale of England's possessions on the continent, chief of"
"which was the rich city of Dunkirk, situate on the French side of the"
"Straits of Dover. This fortified city, within a few leagues of Calais,"
"had cost the English nation heavily in blood and gold to gain, and still"
"more heavily to hold, but its value to England commercially and"
politically was beyond measure.
"Since Queen Mary had lost Calais, Dunkirk was the only important foothold"
England had on continental soil; therefore it was almost as dear to the
"English people as the city of London itself. Because of its importance,"
"it was greatly coveted by the French king, who shortly before the time"
of our journey to Dover had made overtures to buy it.
"Charles turned a deaf ear to King Louis's first proposal to buy Dunkirk,"
"not because he loved the city, or cared a farthing for its value to his"
"people, but because he feared the storm of indignation its sale would"
"raise. The Lord Chancellor objected to the sale of Dunkirk, and tried"
to show Charles the great folly of entertaining the offer. He was the
"only wise, honest man in the king's council, and, by reason of his"
"wonderful knowledge of mankind, was called ""the Chancellor of Human"
"Nature."" But the king needed money, so after a time he listened to"
"Berkeley, Crofts, Castlemain, and others of like character, whose"
"strongest argument consisted in accusing the king, most offensively,"
of being afraid of his people.
"""Are you not king?"" asked Castlemain. ""Does not Dunkirk belong to you,"
controlled himself for a whole week then there was a touching farewell
"scene between the two friends, which ended as a rule in the"
"eating-house of Vaviloff.  The teacher did not spend all his money, but"
spent at least half on the children of the main street.  The poor are
"always rich in children, and in the dirt and ditches of this street"
"there were groups of them from morning to night, hungry, naked and"
"dirty.  Children are the living flowers of the earth, but these had the"
"appearance of flowers that have faded prematurely, because they grew in"
ground where there was no healthy nourishment.  Often the teacher would
"gather them round him, would buy them bread, eggs, apples and nuts, and"
take them into the fields by the river side.  There they would sit and
"greedily eat everything he offered them, after which they would begin"
"to play, filling the fields for a mile around with careless noise and"
"laughter.  The tall, thin figure of the drunkard towered above these"
"small people, who treated him familiarly, as if he were one of their"
"own age.  They called him ""Philip,"" and did not trouble to prefix"
"""Uncle"" to his name. Playing around him, like little wild animals, they"
"pushed him, jumped upon his back, beat him upon his bald head, and"
"caught hold of his nose. All this must have pleased him, as he did not"
"protest against such liberties.  He spoke very little to them, and when"
he did so he did it cautiously as if afraid that his words would hurt
or contaminate them.  He passed many hours thus as their companion and
"plaything, watching their lively faces with his gloomy eyes.  Then he"
would thoughtfully and slowly direct his steps to the eatinghouse of
"Vaviloff, where he would drink silently and quickly till all his senses"
left him.

"Almost every day after his reporting he would bring a newspaper, and"
then gather round him all these creatures that once were men.
Abyedok was always the first to propose dreadful plans to effect the
"desired end, but the Captain, always first in every other argument, did"
"not join in this one.  They also spoke much and impudently about women,"
"but the teacher always defended them, and sometimes was very angry when"
"they went so far as to pass the limits of decency.  They all, as a"
"rule, gave in to him, because they did not look upon him as a common"
"person, and also because they wished to borrow from him on Saturdays"
the money which he had earned during the week.  He had many privileges.
"They never beat him, for instance, on these occasions when the"
conversation ended in a free fight.  He had the right to bring women
"into the dosshouse; a privilege accorded to no one else, as the Captain"
had previously warned them.
"""No bringing of women to my house,"" he had said. ""Women, merchants and"
"philosophers, these are the three causes of my ruin.  I will horsewhip"
anyone bringing in women.  I will horsewhip the woman also....  And as
"to the philosopher I'll knock his head off for him.""  And"
"notwithstanding his age he could have knocked anyone's head off, for he"
"possessed wonderful strength.  Besides that, whenever he fought or"
"quarrelled, he was assisted by Martyanoff, who was accustomed during a"
"general fight to stand silently and sadly back to back with Kuvalda,"
when he became an all-destroying and impregnable engine of war.  Once
"when Simtsoff was drunk, he rushed at the teacher for no reason"
"whatever, and getting hold of his head tore out a bunch of hair."
"Kuvalda, with one stroke of his fist in the other's chest sent him"
"spinning, and he fell to the ground.  He was unconscious for almost"
"half-an-hour, and when he came to himself, Kuvalda compelled him to eat"
"the hair he had torn from the teacher's head. He ate it, preferring"
this to being beaten to death.
"Besides reading newspapers, fighting and indulging in general"
"conversation, they amused themselves by playing cards.  They played"
"Frances and Bettina to the payment of the extraordinary admission fee,"
"and when we left the next morning, curiosity prompted them to pass near"
"the garter rack in the tap-room, where garters were hanging which had"
been taken from maids whose great granddaughters had become great
"grandmothers. The garters that had belonged to Frances and Bettina, being"
"the latest contributions, hung at the bottom of the rack, neatly dated"
"and labelled, and, as I left the room, I overheard Bettina whisper to"
Frances:--
"""I'm glad mine was of silk."""
"We made a short drive to Maidstone, where we stopped over night. The next"
"day a longer journey brought us to Canterbury, where we spent two nights"
"and a day, visiting the cathedral both by sunlight and moonlight; the"
combination of moonlight and Bettina being very trying to me.
"From Canterbury we drove in the rain to Dover, where we lodged at that"
"good inn, the Three Anchors, to await a fair wind for Calais."
"During the next three days the wind was fair, but it was blowing half a"
"gale, and therefore the passage was not to be attempted. Though I was"
"enjoying myself, I was anxious to post our letters, as mine gave a full"
account of several matters at court concerning which I knew George ought
to be informed.
"Among other news, I told him that King Charles had sent a messenger"
"into France carrying a personal letter to King Louis, asking his help"
"in finding the man Hamilton, who had threatened Charles's life. I also"
suggested in my letter that the king of France was trying to buy the
"city of Dunkirk from King Charles, and that because of the friendly"
"negotiations then pending, Louis might give heed to our king's request."
"In that case, it might be well, I thought, for Hamilton to leave France"
"After reading the letter, I felt sure that the Abbé du Boise was George"
Hamilton. I could hardly bring myself to believe that he would be so
"foolhardy as to visit Whitehall, though I knew the adventure was of a"
nature likely to appeal to his reckless disregard of consequences. I
"knew also that, if successful, he would win the reward without which"
life had little value to him.
I was sure that Hamilton had fully weighed the danger of his perilous
"mission, and that he was deliberately staking his life on a last"
desperate chance to win fortune and Frances Jennings.
"Though perhaps Lilly was a charlatan in many respects, he was to be"
trusted; still I did not feel that it was my place to impart George's
"secret to him, though I had in mind a plan whereby he might be of great"
help to the Abbé du Boise in influencing King Charles. The king consulted
"him secretly in many important affairs, and I was sure that if the good"
"Doctor should be called in by his Majesty in the Dunkirk affair, the"
stars would tell a story in accord with our desires if we made it to
Lilly's interest.
"However, all of that must wait for the Abbé du Boise. Of one thing I was"
sure; I must tell Frances at once so that she might be paving the way to
"the king with her smiles. It would be a disagreeable task, but I knew she"
"would do it gladly, and I also knew that no woman could do it better."
While I had expressed my doubts to Frances concerning Hamilton's
"emigration to Canada, I had not felt entirely sure there was nothing in"
"it, and she, womanlike, taking the worst for granted, had accepted it as"
"true. But the coming of the Abbé du Boise changed everything, and when I"
"saw her at her father's house and told her of my suspicions, and showed"
"her Le Blanc's letter, she was so greatly alarmed that she said she would"
Sidney literally blinked before the picture Pola drew--blinked and
blushed that she had dared angle for Mr. Dugald herself like the
forty-to-fourteen single ladies. Mr. Dugald belonged to a world that
"was foreign to the Romley girls, Pola's dazzling, peacock-world."
Sidney felt immensely flattered that Pola had taken her in among her
"peacocks. (Secretly, too, she considered that she carried herself well"
"among them. She was most careful of her dress, now!) She did not know"
"that Pola's sort instinctively seeks out someone to dazzle, that Pola's"
generosity was a part of the dazzling process. She thought Pola
"wonderful to accept so casually her gilded privileges. Why, if Pola"
didn't like a dress or a hat or a pair of shoes she simply didn't wear
it; she could buy anything she wanted from any one of the priceless
bits of jewelry in the shops at Hyannis to the delectable sweets in the
tea-rooms on Commercial Street. She could do just as she pleased--even
"more than Mart, for _she_ never had to darn or mend or wipe dishes or"
dust or hang up her clothes or brush them. Realizing all this Sidney
came to forgive that first condescension that had stung; she thought
Pola little short of an angel to be so prettily friendly with them all.
So engrossed was Sidney in basking in Pola's favor that for a time she
felt no compunctions at deserting Mart and Lavender; in fact she did
not even think of them. Both Mart and Lavender had become suddenly very
"busy with affairs that kept them out of sight. If, once in awhile,"
Sidney wondered what they were doing something of Pola's or something
Pola said quickly crowded the thought from her head. But one afternoon
they encountered Mart as they strolled toward the Green Lantern to sit
under its gay awnings and drink tea. Sidney introduced Mart to Pola and
"to cover Pola's rude stare she added quickly: ""We're going down to the"
"Green Lantern, Mart. Won't you come with us?"" conscious as she said it"
that her voice sounded stilted.
Could any one doubt who the other person in that strangely revealed
"photograph was, or fail to guess the relation between the man they had"
"been listening to and the man who was dead? A few had known Benyon, more"
"Gaspard, all Medland--the three figures of this drama; many remembered"
"the fourth, the central character, who had not tarried for the end of"
"it: the man was rare who did not spend a thought on the bright girl,"
"whose face was so familiar in these walls, and who must be dragged into"
"it. Where was she? asked one. She was gone. Norburn, with rapid"
"instinct, as soon as he had read, had run to her and forced her to go"
"home. He was back from escorting her now, and walked up and down with"
"hands behind him, speaking to no one among all the busily babbling"
throng.
"The waverers stood in a little group by themselves, talking earnestly in"
"undertones, while men wondered whether the paper would undo what the"
"speech had done, and whether the Premier's words had won a victory, only"
for his deeds to leap to light and rob it from him again.
"Inside, the debate lagged on, surely the dullest, emptiest, most"
neglected debate that had ever decided the fate of a Government. The men
who had been set down to speak came in and spoke and went out again; a
"House was kept, but with little to spare. Sir Robert went in and took"
"his place, opposite Medland, who never stirred through all the hours."
"Presently Sir Robert wrote a note, twisted it, and flung it to the"
"Premier. ""A splendid performance of yours, _mes compliments_,"" it said,"
"and, when Medland looked across to acknowledge it, Sir Robert smiled"
"kindly, and nodded his silver head, and the Premier answered him with a"
"glad gleam in his deep-set eyes. These two men, who were always"
"fighting, knew one another, and liked one another for what they knew."
"And this little episode done, Sir Robert rose and pricked and pinked the"
"Premier's points, making sharp fun of his heroics, and weightily"
"criticising his proposals. Now the House did fill a little, for after"
"[Sidenote: ""The Courteous Spaniard.""]"
"A few days ago we visited the Church of St. Laurence Without the Walls,"
"where in a silver shrine under the high altar, the remains of St."
Laurence and St. Stephen are said to rest. The walls of the portico of
"the church are covered with a series of frescoes, lately repainted. One"
series represents the story of St. Stephen and that of the translation
"of his relics to this church. ""The relics of St. Stephen were preserved"
"at Constantinople, whither they had been transported from Jerusalem by"
"the Empress Eudoxia, wife of Theodosius II. Hearing that her daughter,"
"Eudoxia, wife of Valentinian II., Emperor of the West, was afflicted"
"with a devil, she begged her to come to Constantinople, that her demon"
might be driven out by the touch of the relics. The younger Eudoxia
"wished to comply, but the devil refused to leave her unless St. Stephen"
was brought to Rome. An agreement was therefore made that the relics
of St. Stephen should be exchanged for those of St. Laurence. St.
"Stephen arrived, and the Empress was immediately relieved of her devil;"
but when the persons who had brought the relics of St. Stephen from
"Constantinople were about to take those of St. Laurence back with them,"
they all fell down dead! Pope Pelagius prayed for their restoration
"to life, which was granted for a short time, to prove the efficacy of"
"prayer, but they all died again ten days later! Thus the Romans knew"
"that it would be criminal to fulfil their promise, and part with the"
"relics of St. Laurence, and the bodies of the two martyrs were laid in"
"the same sarcophagus."" And thus we know how much more the Romans think"
"of relics than of honor and truth. ""It is related that when they opened"
"the sarcophagus, and lowered into it the body of St. Stephen, St."
"Laurence moved on one side, giving the place of honor on the right hand"
"to St. Stephen; hence, the common people of Rome have conferred on St."
"Laurence the title of '_Il cortese Spagnuolo_'--the courteous Spaniard."""
"flowers. We were having a lot of company at the time, and I was in and"
"out of the shop more often than not, as the saying is. And Harry and I"
(his name was Harry) got to quarrelling about how things ought to be
"arranged—and that began it. Flowers! you wouldn’t believe it, madam,"
the flowers he used to bring me. He’d stop at nothing. It was
"lilies-of-the-valley more than once, and I’m not exaggerating! Well, of"
"course, we were going to be married and live over the shop, and it was"
"all going to be just so, and I was to have the window to arrange...."
"Oh, how I’ve done that window of a Saturday! Not really, of course,"
"madam, just dreaming, as you might say. I’ve done it for"
"Christmas—motto in holly, and all—and I’ve had my Easter lilies with a"
"gorgeous star all daffodils in the middle. I’ve hung—well, that’s"
enough of that. The day came he was to call for me to choose the
furniture. Shall I ever forget it? It was a Tuesday. My lady wasn’t
"quite herself that afternoon. Not that she’d said anything, of course;"
she never does or will. But I knew by the way that she kept wrapping
herself up and asking me if it was cold—and her little nose looked...
pinched. I didn’t like leaving her; I knew I’d be worrying all the
"time. At last I asked her if she’d rather I put it off. “Oh no, Ellen,”"
"she said, “you mustn’t mind about me. You mustn’t disappoint your young"
"man.” And so cheerful, you know, madam, never thinking about herself."
It made me feel worse than ever. I began to wonder... then she dropped
her handkerchief and began to stoop down to pick it up herself—a thing
"she never did. “Whatever are you doing!” I cried, running to stop her."
"“Well,” she said, smiling, you know, madam, “I shall have to begin to"
"practise.” Oh, it was all I could do not to burst out crying. I went"
"over to the dressing-table and made believe to rub up the silver, and I"
"couldn’t keep myself in, and I asked her if she’d rather I... didn’t"
"get married. “No, Ellen,” she said—that was her voice, madam, like I’m"
"giving you—“No, Ellen, not for the _wide world_!” But while she said"
"it, madam—I was looking in her glass; of course, she didn’t know I"
could see her—she put her little hand on her heart just like her dear
"Then followed a lean and bony man of whom no one knew anything, with a"
"frightened expression in his eyes, the left one of which had a squint."
"He was silent and timid, and had been imprisoned three times for theft"
by the High Court of Justice and the Magisterial Courts.  His family
"name was Kiselnikoff, but they called him Paltara Taras, because he was"
"a head and shoulders taller than his friend, Deacon Taras, who had been"
degraded from his office for drunkenness and immorality.  The Deacon
"was a short, thick-set person, with the chest of an athlete and a"
"round, strong head.  He danced skilfully, and was still more skilful at"
swearing.  He and Paltara Taras worked in the wood on the banks of the
"river, and in free hours he told his friend or any one who would"
"listen, ""Tales of my own composition,"" as he used to say.  On hearing"
"these stories, the heroes of which always seemed to be saints, kings,"
"priests, or generals, even the inmates of the dosshouse spat and rubbed"
"their eyes in astonishment at the imagination of the Deacon, who told"
"them shameless tales of lewd, fantastic adventures, with blinking eyes"
and a passionless expression of countenance.  The imagination of this
man was powerful and inexhaustible; he could go on relating and
"composing all day, from morning to night, without once repeating what"
he had said before.  In his expression you sometimes saw the poet gone
"astray, sometimes the romancer, and he always succeeded in making his"
tales realistic by the effective and powerful words in which he told
them.
There was also a foolish young man called Kuvalda Meteor.  One night he
came to sleep in the dosshouse and had remained ever since among these
"men, much to their astonishment.  At first they did not take much"
"notice of him.  In the daytime, like all the others, he went away to"
"find something to eat, but at nights he always loitered around this"
friendly company till at last the Captain took notice of him.
"""Boy!  What business have you here on this earth?"""
of Press Censor and officer in charge of Publicity. After the
"occupation of Brussels and the fall of Antwerp, the ""patriotic"""
Belgian Press had withdrawn itself to France and England or had
stopped publication. Its newspapers had been invited to continue
"their functions as organs of news-distribution and public opinion,"
but of course under the German Censorate and martial law. As one
"editor said to a polite German official: ""If I were to continue the"
"publication of my paper under such conditions, my staff and I would"
"all be shot in a week."""
But the large towns of Belgium could not be left without a Press.
"Public Opinion must be guided, and might very well be guided in a"
direction favourable to German policy. The German Government had
"already introduced the German hour into Belgian time, the German"
"coinage, the German police system, and German music; but it had no"
"intention, seemingly, of forcing the German speech on the old"
"dominions of the House of Burgundy. On the contrary, in their tenure"
"of Belgium or of North-east France, the Germans seemed desirous of"
"showing how well they wrote the French language, how ready they were"
under a German regime to give it a new literature. Whether or not
"they enlisted a few recreants, or made use of Alsatians or"
"Lorrainers to help them, it is never-the-less remarkable how free as"
a rule their written and printed French was from mistakes or German
idioms; though their spoken French always remained Alsatian. It
suffered from that extraordinary misplacement and exchange in the
upper and lower consonants which has distinguished the German
people--that nation of great philologists--since the death of the
"Roman Empire. German officers still said ""Barton, die fous brie,"""
"instead of ""Pardon, je vous prie"" (if they were polite), but they"
were quite able to contribute _articles de fond_ to a pretended
national Belgian press. Besides there was a sufficiency of Belgian
"""Sans-Patries"" ready to come to their assistance: Belgian nationals"
When I sat at the feet of Professor Campbell Fraser in the Metaphysics
"classroom at Edinburgh in 1875, Ferrier's writings were being much read"
by us students. The influence of Sir William Hamilton was fast
crumbling in the minds of young men who felt rather than saw that much
"lay beyond it. We were still engrossed with the controversy, waged in"
"books which now, alas! sell for a tenth of their former price, about"
"the Conditioned and the Unconditioned. We still worked at Reid,"
"Hamilton, and Mansel. But the attacks of Mill on the one side, and of"
"Ferrier and Dr. Stirling on the other, were slowly but surely"
withdrawing our interest. Ferrier had pointed out a path which seemed
"to lead us in the direction of Germany if we would escape from Mill,"
and Stirling was urging us in the same sense. It was not merely that
"Ferrier had written books. He had died more than ten years earlier, but"
his personality was still a living influence. Echoes of his words came
"to us through Grant and Sellar. Outside the University, men like"
Blackwood and Makgill made us feel what a power he had been. But that
was not all for at least some of us. Mrs. Ferrier had removed to
Edinburgh--and I endorse all that my sister says of her rare quality.
"She lived in a house in Torphichen Street, which was the resort of"
"those attracted, not only by the memory of her husband, but by her own"
great gifts. She was an old lady and an invalid. But though she could
"not move from her chair, paralysis had not dimmed her mental powers."
She was a true daughter of 'Christopher North.' I doubt whether I have
"seen her rival in quickness, her superior I never saw. She could talk"
"admirably to those sitting near her, and yet follow and join in the"
conversation of another group at the end of the room. She could adapt
"herself to everyone--to the shy and awkward student of eighteen, who"
"like myself was too much in awe of her to do more unhelped than answer,"
and to the distinguished men of letters who came from every quarter
attracted by her reputation for brilliance. The words of no one could
"be more incisive, the words of no one were habitually more kind than"
hers. She had known everybody. She forgot nobody. In those days the
"gütes leute"" and that all would go smoothly in time."
Nevertheless the next morning when she could take stock she found
nearly all the poultry except the pigeons had disappeared; and most
"of the apples, ripe and unripe, had vanished from the orchard trees."
"The female servants of the farm, however, came back; and finding no"
"violence was offered took up their work again. Two days afterwards,"
"von Giesselin sent Vivie into Brussels in his motor, with his"
"orderly to escort her, so that she might deposit her valuables at a"
"bank. She found Brussels, suburbs and city alike, swarming with"
"grey-uniformed soldiers, most of whom looked tired and despondent."
"Those who were on the march, thinking Vivie must be the wife of some"
"German officer of high rank, struck up a dismal chant from dry"
"throats with a refrain of ""Gloria, Viktoria, Hoch! Deutschland,"
"Hoch!"" At the bank the Belgian officials received her with"
deference. Apart from being the daughter of the well-to-do Mrs.
"Warren, she was English, and seemed to impose respect even on the"
"Germans. They took over her valuables, made out a receipt, and"
cashed a fairly large cheque in ready money. Vivie then ventured to
ask the bank clerk who had seen to her business if he had any news.
"Looking cautiously round, he said the rumours going through the town"
"were that the Queen of Holland, enraged that her Prince Consort"
"should have facilitated the crossing of Limburg by German armies,"
"had shot him dead with a revolver; that the Crown Prince of Germany,"
"despairing of a successful end of the War, had committed suicide at"
his father's feet; that the American Consul General in Brussels--to
"whom, by the bye, Vivie ought to report herself and her mother, in"
order to come under his protection--had notified General Sixt von
"Arnim, commanding the army in Brussels, that, _unless he vacated the"
"Belgian capital immediately_, England would bombard Hamburg and the"
United States would declare war on the Kaiser. Alluring stories like
these flitted through despairing Brussels during the first two
"Helena returned from Palestine, bringing with her the stone on which"
"Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac, and that on which the Virgin Mary"
"sat down at the time of the presentation of the Saviour in the temple,"
"the horses drawing these precious relics stood still at this spot,"
"and refused every effort to make them move. Then Christian people,"
"'recognizing the finger of God,' erected a church on this spot--_S."
"Giacomo Scossa Cavalli_--where the stones are still to be seen."""
[Sidenote: The Hardness of St. Peter's Knees.]
"While speaking of interesting stones, I must not omit to mention those"
"in the Church of S. Francesca Romana, near the Forum, containing the"
"marks of the knees of St. Peter--(which show, by the way, that this"
apostle was a giant in size)--when he knelt to pray that Simon Magus
might be dropped by the demons he had invoked to support him in the
air in fulfilment of his promise to fly. One of these stones used to
"lie in the _Via Sacra_, and the water which collected in the two holes"
or knee prints was looked upon as so potent a remedy of disease that
groups of infirm people used to gather around them on the approach of
"a shower. According to the legend, the place where Peter knelt when"
he thus effected the discomfiture of Simon Magus and brought him to
"the ground with such force that his thigh was fractured, never to be"
"healed, was the ancient _Via Sacra_. But, after the priests had removed"
"the stone from the roadway into the church, the inconsiderate and"
"iconoclastic explorers of our day, who have made so many discoveries in"
"their excavations about the Forum, proved that the roadway from which"
"this relic was taken was not the ancient _Via Sacra_ at all, but a more"
modern roadway which had been mistaken for it!
[Sidenote: The Hardness of St. Peter's Head.]
"In the Mamertine Prisons, which are also quite close to the Forum, a"
"you cleaned out the stable?"" he asked. ""Yes, indeed, master, it is"
"spick and span,"" said the king's son. ""I'll have to see that,"" said the"
"giant, and went into the stable; but it was just as the king's son had"
"said. ""You surely have been talking to the Master Girl, for you could"
"not have done that alone,"" said the giant. ""Master Girl? What is a"
"Master Girl?"" said the king's son, and pretended to be very stupid. ""I'd"
"like to see her, too."" ""You will see her in plenty of time,"" said the"
giant.
The next morning the giant went off again with his goats. And he told
"the king's son he was to fetch his horse from the pasture, and when he"
"had done this, he might rest: ""For you have come to a kind master,"" said"
"he. ""But if you enter one of the rooms which I forbade you entering"
"yesterday, I will tear off your head,"" he said, and went away with his"
"herd. ""Indeed, you are a kind master,"" said the king's son, ""but in"
"spite of it I'd like to have another little talk with the Master Girl,"
"for she is just as much mine as yours,"" and with that he went in to her."
"She asked him what work he had to do that day. ""O, it is not so bad"
"to-day,"" said the king's son. ""I am only to fetch his horse from the"
"pasture."" ""And how are you going to manage that?"" asked the Master Girl."
"""Surely it is no great feat to fetch a horse from pasture,"" said the"
"king's son, ""and I have ridden swift horses before."" ""Yet it is not an"
"easy matter to ride this horse home,"" said the Master Girl, ""but I will"
"tell you how to set about it: When you see the horse, he will come"
"running up, breathing fire and flame, just as though he were a burning"
"pine-torch. Then you must take the bit that is hanging here on the door,"
"and throw it into his mouth, for then he will grow so tame that you can"
"do what you will with him."" He would take good note of it, said the"
"king's son, and he sat there with the Master Girl the whole day long,"
"and they chatted and talked about this and that, but mainly about how"
"delightful it would be, and what a pleasant time they could have, if"
they could only marry and get away from the giant. And the king's son
"there, I still would not know how much to ask for."" ""I will tell you"
"what you must do,"" said the Master Girl. ""You must go to the rock behind"
"the pasture, and take the club that is lying there, and strike the rock"
"with it. Then one will come out whose eyes flash fire, and you must tell"
"him your business. And if he asks how much you want, you must tell him"
"as much as you can carry."" He would take good note of it, said the"
"king's son, and he sat there with the Master Girl all day long until"
"evening, and he might be sitting there yet, if the Master Girl had not"
reminded him that he must still go to the devil about the tribute before
"the giant came home. So he set out, and did exactly as the Master Girl"
"had told him: he went to the rock, took the club and beat against it."
"Then one came out from whose eyes and nose the sparks flew. ""What do you"
"want?"" he asked. ""The giant has sent me to fetch his tribute,"" said the"
"king's son. ""How much do you want?"" the other again inquired. ""I never"
"ask for more than I can carry,"" was the reply of the king's son. ""It is"
"lucky for you that you did not ask for a whole ton at once,"" said the"
"one on the hill. ""But come in with me, and wait a while."" This the"
"king's son did, and saw a great deal of gold and silver lying in the"
hill like dead rock in an ore-pile. Then as much as he could carry was
"packed up, and with it he went his way. When the giant came home in"
"the evening with his goats, the king's son was running about the room,"
"whistling and singing as on the two preceding evenings. ""Did you go to"
"the devil for the tribute?"" asked the giant. ""Yes, indeed, master,"" said"
"the king's son. ""Where did you put it?"" asked the giant again. ""I stood"
"the sack of gold outside on the bench,"" was the reply. ""I must see that"
"at once,"" said the giant, and went over to the bench. But the sack was"
"really standing there, and it was so full that the gold and silver"
"rolled right out when the giant loosened the string. ""You surely must"
"have spoken to my Master Girl,"" said the giant. ""If that is the case I"
"will tear your head off."" ""With your Master Girl?"" said the king's"
"son. ""Yesterday master talked about that Master Girl, and to-day he is"
"talking about her again, and the day before yesterday he talked about"
"Scott writes of him: 'Honest old Mr. Ferrier is dead, at extreme old"
age. I confess I should not like to live so long. He was a man with
"strong passions and strong prejudices, but with generous and manly"
"sentiments at the same time.' James Ferrier's wife, Miss Coutts, was"
"remarkable for her beauty: a large family was born to her, the eldest"
"son of whom was James Frederick Ferrier's father. Young Ferrier, the"
"subject of this sketch, used frequently to dine with his grandfather at"
"his house in Morningside, where Susan Ferrier acted in the capacity of"
hostess; and it is easy to imagine the bright talk which would take
"place on these occasions, and the impression which must have been made"
"upon the lad, both then and after he attained to manhood; for Miss"
"Ferrier survived until 1854. In later life, indeed, her wit was said to"
"be somewhat caustic, and she was possibly dreaded by her younger"
"friends and relatives as much as she was respected; but this, to do her"
"justice, was partly owing to infirmities. She was at anyrate keenly"
"interested in the fortunes of her nephew, to whom she was in the habit"
"of alluding as 'the last of the metaphysicians'--scarcely, perhaps, a"
"very happy title for one who was somewhat of an iconoclast, and began a"
new era rather than concluded an old.
"[1] In a _Life of Susan Ferrier_, lately published, an"
account of the family is given which was written by Miss
"Ferrier, for her nephew, the subject of our memoir."
"James Frederick Ferrier's mother, Margaret Wilson, was a sister of"
"Professor John Wilson--the 'Christopher North' of immortal memory,"
whose daughter he was afterwards to marry. Margaret Ferrier was a woman
of striking personal beauty. Her features were perfect in their
"symmetry, as is shown in a lovely miniature, painted by Saunders, a"
"well-known miniature painter of the day, now in the possession of"
"Professor Ferrier's son, her grandson. Many of these personal charms"
"descended to James Ferrier, whose well-cut features bore considerable"
"publishers, although Morgan was, if possible, more indignant over the"
"statement in the same book that he had been kidnapped in Wales and sold,"
"as a boy, and sent to be a slave in Barbadoes. That he could descend to"
"rank dishonesty was shown when, returning from his extraordinary and"
"successful assault on the city of Panama in 1670, to Chagres, he left most"
"of his faithful followers behind, without ships or food, while he slipped"
"off in the night with most of the booty to Jamaica. No doubt, young Morgan"
"came to Jamaica with good credentials from his uncle, the Colonel, for the"
"latter was held in high esteem by Modyford, then Governor of Barbadoes,"
"who describes Colonel Morgan as ""that honest privateer."""
Colonel Morgan did not live to see his nephew reach the pinnacle of his
"success, for in the year 1665 he was sent at the head of an expedition to"
"attack the Dutch stronghold at St. Eustatius Island, but he was too old to"
stand the hardships of such an expedition and died shortly afterwards.
By this time Morgan had made his name as a successful and resolute
buccaneer by returning to Port Royal from a raiding expedition in Central
America with a huge booty.
"In 1665 Morgan, with two other buccaneers, Jackman and Morris, plundered"
"the province of Campeachy, and then, acting as Vice-Admiral to the most"
"famous buccaneer of the day, Captain Mansfield, plundered Cuba, captured"
"Providence Island, sacked Granada, burnt and plundered the coast of Costa"
"Rica, bringing back another booty of almost fabulous wealth to Jamaica. In"
"this year Morgan married a daughter of his uncle, Colonel Morgan."
"In 1668, when 33 years of age, Morgan was commissioned by the Jamaican"
"Government to collect together the privateers, and by 1669 he was in"
"command of a big fleet, when he was almost killed by a great explosion in"
"the _Oxford_, which happened while Morgan was giving a banquet to his"
"captains. About this time Morgan calmly took a fine ship, the _Cour"
"to take part in an important religious function, or ""entertainment,"" as"
"Rogers calls it, ""where,"" he says, ""we waited on the Governour, Signior"
"Raphael de Silva Lagos, in a body, being ten of us, with two trumpets and"
"a hautboy, which he desir'd might play us to church, where our musick did"
"the office of an organ, but separate from the singing, which was by the"
"fathers well perform'd. Our musick played 'Hey, boys, up go we!' and all"
"manner of noisy paltry tunes. And after service, our musicians, who were"
"by that time more than half drunk, march'd at the head of the company;"
"next to them an old father and two fryars carrying lamps of incense, then"
"an image dressed with flowers and wax candles, then about forty priests,"
"fryars, etc., followed by the Governor of the town, myself, and Capt."
"Courtney, with each of us a long wax candle lighted. The ceremony held"
about two hours; after which we were splendidly entertained by the
"fathers of the Convent, and then by the Governour. They unanimously told"
"us they expected nothing from us but our Company, and they had no more but"
"our musick."""
What a delightful picture this calls to the mind--the little Brazilian
"town, the tropical foliage, the Holy Procession, ""wax figure"" and priests,"
"followed by the Governor with an English buccaneer on either side, and"
"headed by a crew of drunken Protestant English sailors playing ""Hey, boys,"
"up go we!"""
"Rogers, not to be outdone in hospitality, next day entertained the"
"Governor and fathers on board the _Duke_, ""when,"" he says, ""they were very"
"merry, and in their cups propos'd the Pope's health to us. But we were"
quits with 'em by toasting the Archbishop of Canterbury; and to keep up
"the humour, we also proposed William Pen's health, and they liked the"
"liquor so well, that they refused neither."" Alas! the good Governor and"
the fathers were not in a fit state to leave the ship when the end came to
"the entertainment, so slept on board, being put ashore in the morning,"
"""when we saluted 'em with a huzza from each ship, because,"" as Rogers"
I got a vest.

Too late to fix.
No.
Look.

Just as I thought:
Cirrhosis pectoris.
What's that mean?
That means your eyes are twin pools of desire.
"Oh, doctor."
That's nice.
The things you do say.
"That doesn't hurt anymore, huh?"
"Oh, yes."
- Yes.
Yes.
- You'll be all right in the morning.

No.
"No, your ankle's all right."
But I'll tell you one thing.
You wear your garter too tight.

That's bad.
"- There, you see?"
You did find something.
"You are my doctor, aren't you?"
- Eddie.
Search him!
"Eddie, what's with the security?"
It's not our first deal.
Maybe he looks familiar.
"Here's $200,000."
We'll check the guns first.
What are you guys doing?
"Nothing special, officer."
A reunion.
Open the trunk.
Open it!
Now!
Damn you!
"You set me up, didn't you?"
Are you a cop?
Talk!
I'm no cop!
I didn't betray you.
Then how come he's here?
He's no cop!
"I stake my life on it, Eddie!"
"Lying bastard, I shouldn't have trusted you!"
The guy's a cop.
I recognize him!
You've got it wrong.
"Chang, I'll get him!"
That shithead!
Don't move!
"Goddamn mess, assho--"

You could have said anything.
A kitchen?
No.
That was like sexy chef.

"When you got out of the car, you thought, ""that was..."""
Slow.

It's a side effect.
Same thing happened to me.
It did?
Mm.
I had them for months.
"Charming, my husband, he used to wake me when I cried out."
He'd light a candle.
He said it would capture the nightmares.
He'd watch over me as I fell back to sleep.
Sounds like he lives up to his name.
Yeah.
Um...

"I don't think that's a good idea, Jason."
"Come on, hon."
Let's go.
We're very close.
"Jason, I'm not going anywhere."
"It pains me to say this, but I gotta let you go."
I love you.

It's over.
It's over.
"Daddy, wait."
I was wrong.

And hear a symphony.
"Albert Hall, sir?"
"Well, I sort of hoped that..."

"Yes, sir."
I'll go and put my things on.

Because we're not going.
Sir?
The bill is ever so good right here.
"Now, let's see, what shall we do?"

He wrote a bunch of fan letters to Marissa before she was killed.
Hey!
I'm a big fan!
Thank you very much.
Not you.
The lotto girl.
"""You'll thank me later!"""
That's not actually my line!
Mr. Monk said it first!
I don't really know you.
I....
I just feel connected to you.
I feel....
"I feel safe with you, like it's okay to be honest."
It's just one of those things.
I'm just attracted to you.
And it's not just because I think you're incredibly sexy.

You don't have to bubble-wrap everything.
It's not like you're moving to the north pole.
Oh.

There's some cyanosis in his fingers.

Let's get ready...
"- No, sorry."
It's totally closed.
- Heart rate up to 190.
- He needs an airway now.
- Who is this man?
Just a guy that works here.
Little bit screwy.
"Go on, stand over there, will you?"
He gets excited.
"Well, we'll be going, judge."
We'll make our report to the state board.
"- Goodbye, judge."
- Goodbye.
"I want you to do me a favor, Mr. Gargan."
I want you to stay here.
"For a time, anyway."
And run this place.
Don't worry.
I'll be here.
"- Goodbye, Miss Griffith."
"- Goodbye, Judge Gilbert."
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

Come on.
"Come on, move."
"All right, put it on the bar."
- What are you pullin' on me for?
- Get it on the bar.
Get the hell in there.
Put your hands on your head.
All of it.
"Smartass, you dropped something."
Pick it up.
You want that hand broken?
Get it up there.
"What else you got here, huh?"
[Cloudy] Turn around.
You're under arrest.
That goes for you too.
Get in that phone booth.

Keep 'em up.
That's good.
- Get in there.
"All right, face the wall, put your hands against the wall and lock yourself in."
"Hey, you, haircut."
- Where are you going?
"- You talkin' to me, baby?"
"Yeah, I'm talking to you."
You must really trust me.
- You really do trust me.
"- You're the best, Director Kim."
I told you he's really great.
What trust?
I don't trust people so easily.
"- By the way, he's not my boyfriend."
- Sorry?
"- Oh, come on."
- Come on what?
What?
"But, he said you were."
Do we have to have sex to be boyfriend and girlfriend?
Whatever.
"And yes, you have to have sex."
"Right, Director Kim?"
This is fun.
"We're just friends, you and I."
- Do friends kiss?
- That's so childish.
"Yeah, we kissed once."
Big deal.
Damn it.
This isn't funny.
"No, it's funny."
Very funny.
It's a sea star.
It's dead.
Cigarette.
"When the tide's out, it'll ebb to that lighthouse."
"- Like the Red Sea, right?"
- Yes.
What the...?
You can't go in there.
It's all right.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
He's not going to die.
You wanted me.
- Why did you kill Foon?
- White Tiger killed him.
You're harboring a fugitive!
"Yes, so what?"
"While you're still alive, I'll only be second-best."
Only Lion's Roar Hall can beat Bo Chi Lam.
You've committed a terrible crime!
You must pay for it!
You're my problem!
Sifu Wong...
Stop!
"Sifu Wong, spare me!"
Please let me go!
Let me go!
I apologize!

And Jai...
I get it.
It's between us.
Why drag Jaiprakash into this?
"All right, Hari..."
what's wrong?
Your touch has awoken the music in me!
That's the background score.
Who was playing it?
It happens in emotional scenes.
Was it the radio?
I've got to give you some news.
"Your husband is dead, isn't he?"
But don't worry...
"I'm willing to marry a ""window""!"
Window?
Aren't you a window now?
!
It's Widow; not window.
Never mind!
But we will still meet!
No.
We will not.
Two gardeners and a rose.
What?
!
Don't look back.
But that man there...
The chap with the blue shorts?
Hurry.
Why are we going downstairs?
I need to show you something.
"We got you, we got you."
"Let's go, let's go."
How did you?
"I heard the buzz, then I played dead."
Played dead?
Of course you did.
Oh wait.
"Connor, I..."
Riley.
I'm so sorry.
Thought I'd say goodbye.
Hey.
"I'm sorry, man."
You were the best crew I've ever had.
Listen...
"If I get out of here,"
"I swear to you,"
"I swear to you,"
I'm gonna buy your girl those boobs.
"I love you, bro."
"Oh, Connor."
No!
"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right."
It's all right.
I should have told you I tried that.
"All right, come on man."
"We gotta move, we gotta move."
What are we gonna do?
We gonna hide and wait it out?
"(GROANS) Come on up, come on."
"Hey, come on."
"Here, take your coat off."
Here you are.
Yeah.
This is my place.
My humble home.
I know.
- You want to take your coat off?
"- Oh, thank you."
"Yeah, I'll set it right here."
"- So, er... drinks?"
"- Sure, of course."
"We have some wine, red wine, white wine."
- Erm... red.
- Red?
- Norm?
- Prosecco.
- Ah...
- Prosecco!
"That's fancy, Norm."
NORM:
"You know, I love movies."
So here's a line from a movie.
You have to guess.
"She says to a younger man who's trying to woo her, to flirt with her..."
"And she says to him, ""You don't want me."
"You want somebody young and fresh."""
"And she goes, ""Armies have marched over me."""
"- All right, guess that one."
- Right away.
Thank you.
"Even if you have 2 guns, how many of us can you shoot?"
"Before we fight, sign the contract first."
You two go!
It was a misunderstanding.
Sorry.
Misunderstanding?
You made me lose face.
Put down your gun.
Fight!
So be it.
You think you can win me?
Come on.
Roll the camera!
Hold this.
Lincoln!
...
Lincoln!
I didn't hit him.
Will he die?
"Chairman, we saw you kill him."
Right...
Perhaps it's your internal strength?
"Michael, call the ambulance."
Oh no.
I will take the first flight tomorrow.
Any news in the papers and I leave.
"Go, police is coming."
Scorpion Yong!
"Doctor, how is he?"
He is stable.
You can go to see him.
I want to tell you
- Same here.
Good luck.
Give my regards to Jørgen.
Hi.
- Busy?
- A little.
- That looks nice on you.
- Thanks.
"- Have a nice day, okay?"
Bye.
- Bye.
Jacob.
Welcome.
My name is Jørgen Hansson.
- Jacob.
- This way.
Was the flight okay?
Good.
This is where we live.
You can see Sweden on a clear day.
"If you feel like it, that is."
A drink?
No thanks.
Cheers.
Cheers.
You have a video that can give me a sense of what goes on there.
It will take more than a video to show you that.
Meaning?
Bombay has over a million child prostitutes.
Four or five times that suffer from malnutrition.
They're not on the video.
Then there are those who die every day of...
"Everyone get insomnia, now and then."
Stevie.
I haven't slept in a year.
Jesus Christ!
I tried him too...
Sorry.
Hello?
Yeah.
No I can't.
I can't talk now.
Okay.
"My ex, he's a fucking Psycho."
"Trevor, I'm worried about you."
"Don't worry, no one ever died of insomnia."
"I hope not, you are my best client."
Can't afford to lose ya.
"Gee, thanks."
"Reznik, I need a hand."
"Gotta get this dead level here, help me out."
- Safety on?
"- Oh, yeah."
How's that?
"No, still off."
Is that any better?
"Hey, do your sleeping on your own time."
I need some help here.
Better.
It's now level.
Try the other side.
I hate this bitch.
Hey!
what did you do?
It may interest you.
But personally...
May I get out here?
- Where are you going?
"- To school, this way."
I'll drop you.
I'll see Farzad too.
"He has exams, I'll see what he's done."
"Sir, thank you."
Thank you again.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
- Are those the exam papers?
- Yes.
- Don't be too harsh on them.
- l'm not.
Tell our little colleague to come and see me.
Excuse me!
- What?
- Please do me a favour.
Don't tell Farzad what we were just saying.
All right.
Don't worry.
"Go on, get in the other side."
"Hurry up, get in."
- l can't come now.
- Why?
I need one more answer for the exam.
What is it?
The fourth question.
- You don't know the answer?
- No.
Open the door!
Open the door now!
Break it down!
This is a waste of time.
We don't need him anyway.
I need him.
"If he's a member of the resistance, he may be able to help me contact my ship."
Monster!
He's the one.
He took your mother.
We have to...
They want a fight.
Don't give them one.
What?
I've done nothing!
I've done nothing.
Please!
Please...
You look like a helpful citizen.
"So, tell me."
You might have seen some strangers who were in the marketplace earlier today.
"No, sir."
"No, I've seen no one."
Please.
You!
"I'm looking for someone, a woman."
I haven't seen any woman.
There are two right over here.
"You see them, don't you?"
Yes.
Maybe we should discuss this elsewhere.
Caylem...
Yeah?
Can you see what I'm doing?
It's not that nice.
- Are you all right?
"- Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm sorry.
So are we still on for tonight?
Yeah.
"Yeah, yeah."
"So, like, 8:00, right?"
You want me to pick you up?
"Yeah, 8:00."
I'll be waiting.
"All right, cool."
Bye.
Who was that?
Just this friend.
Do you have a friend I don't know?
This guy from school.
Going through a divorce.
"By the way, I was going to ask you a favor."
What?
What?
"I was gonna go out with him tonight and Jenna fucking hates him, so I'm just gonna tell her I'm with you, if that's cool."
You're fucking around on her.
What?
It's a guy from school.
No.
"Don't get me involved in this, please."
How can you fuck around on Jenna?
She's perfect.
She's beautiful.
"Oh, God."
"- All right, sad-arse?"
- Nina just rang from the hospital.
He's taken a turn for the worse.
But he's been asking for you.
"Look, we've done our best but he is... he's just too weak."
"Do you understand, Adam?"
"Well, look, we'll... we'll give you some time alone with him, OK?"
Dad?
Adam.
"I'm here, Dad."
Why?
What's happened?
You collapsed.
You weren't well.
You collapsed.
Are you all right?
Have you fed?
Here.
It's OK.
I've got these people looking after me.
"But they... they understand, do they?"
It's fine.
They're nice.
"Now, you give me a minute and we'll get out of here, hey?"
"No, listen."
You have to stay here.
I'm just...
I'm just so... so tired.
"You gave me too much, Dad."
You made yourself weak.
What else could we do?
- They can put the finger on you.
"- Quit waiting there, will you?"
Keep in touch.
Let me know what the doctor says.
- Get our doctor if you have to.
Come on.
- Wait a minute.
"Listen, Patsy, I'm asking you, don't go up there, will you?"
- All right.
- Wouldn't that mean--?
"Now, boys."
"Now, wait."
Now wait.
Now let's be sensible.
"Now, let's start all over again."
I'll change everything back to what it was before.
- I swear I will.
I'll change and--
- You're a liar.
"We, the jury, find you guilty of murder in the first degree."
Where did--?
Where--?
- Let's go.
Get him.
- Hurry up.
Hurry up and get him.
Let's hurry up and get him.
"Come on, boys, let's go."
Come on.
"Hurry, Patsy."
He's dead.
"Hey, come on."
But it's a bit late now.
She's a pretty girl.
I can see why you liked her.
Just one kiss and then we'll go and join the others.
What would you do without me?
Luke.
Lukey.
"I'm dying, mate."
I'm dying.
Just don't know that.
I've got holes in me.
I'm losing blood.
It's not rocket science.
I need a doctor... or I'm dead.
"One call, Luke."
"Give me one phone call, that's all I ask"
Just... just to give me a fighting chance.
I'm begging you.
That's it.
What're you doing?
"Luke, focus."
"We need... we need a phone, Luke."
Luke!
"Sorry, man."
Sorry.
This'll ease the pain.
"- Get away from me, you fucking coward!"
- I'm trying to help!
Luke.
Give me some.
What have you ever done for me?
"Everyone knows I'm a bitch, Luke."
"- Yes, I do."
I gotta go.
This isn't right.
"- Yeah, it is."
"- No, no, no."
"Kim, it isn't."
And I don't know what I thought was gonna happen tonight.
I definitely know what I hoped was gonna happen tonight.
But this isn't cool.
"I really, really, really want to have sex with you."
Yeah.
I can tell.
- You can tell that?
- Yeah.
Subtle signs.
But I can't.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
Okay.
It's gonna be okay.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
"Hey, this is Michael..."
Do something for me.
What?
"Go home, tell her that it's over and leave her."
- I can't.
- What?
You're an amazing guy.
You wouldn't be here with me right now unless you knew something was missing in your life.
- Please...
- What?
It's 7-4-6-3.
Can you remember?
Everything's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
"- Go, go..."
- Okay.
Can you keep your pressure on it?
Okay.
- Did we do it?
- I think so.
- Will I die?
"- No, you can live a long time like this."
I need a doctor.
Can you take the bullet out?
It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.
Not the bullet.
You.
You wouldn't...
What?
"You wouldn't do that to me, would you?"
No.
- Somerset Textiles.
- Blackleg Miner.
"All right, but aren't you the guide?"
Are you ennoyed?
"Not ""ennoyed"", ""annoyed""!"
Annoyed?
"Not yet, but if you carry on, I soon will be."
"Welcome, engineer."
Hello.
- We're honoured.
- The honour's mine.
This is it.
Welcome.
This is one of the rooms.
What did she say?
"If it's too small, there are other rooms."
"Thank you, we'll only be staying a couple of nights."
Make yourself at home.
This is the bathroom.
Another bedroom...
That's good.
Thank you.
- Where's the old lady's house?
- Who?
- The lady who's ill.
- You mean Malek?
"Yes, son."
She lives over there.
You can see it from the roof.
- Which way?
- This way.
- Can we see it from here?
- Yes.
See that blue window?
"I'm telling you, asshole, to get your ass out there!"
For crying out loud...
"Okay, I'll go."
"Come on, hurry!"
Shit.
Who the fuck are you?
What the hell?
"Stop, goddamn it!"
"Stop it, you dirty slut!"
You whore!
"Eat this, too."
"Amn, you're heavy."
I'm getting too old for this.
Don't be ridiculous.
Old ladies tell me men can still get it up after 70.
Then buy me some herbal supplements.
I keep having fucked-up nightmares.
What're you doing in there?
Oh hell.
Shit!
Nothing!
Get away from the car.
- Don't open it!
- What are you doing?
For crying out loud!
Dad!
Dad?
Look.
How do I look?
Pretty.
Freakishly pretty.
How long were you watching?
Meaning what?
Meaning nothing comes out of the mirror unless something goes back in.
Really?
And I am done... with that.
I beg to freaking differ.
Freak.
I suppose I should have destroyed that mirror when I had the chance.
Turn around.
This is on you.
You're the one who set me free.
"Well, I'm fixing that right now."
Turn around.
"Oh, my..."
I am never going back into that mirror.
Do you hear me?
Never.
And this.
This is my ace.
That's it.
Cash me out.
Curiouser and curiouser.
"Artie, now!"
"Pete, help me."
"Artie, where is Myka?"
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, you're welcome."
All right.
"Here, let's get this."
- So what now?
- Now...
Now we move Alice to the dark vault.
- What's the dark vault?
Why?
"Somebody's got to be a grown-up, and clearly, it's not you."
Uh... grown-ups drink.
I've been seeing someone.
Like...
A shrink?
Like a guy.
Who?
You don't know him.
And he doesn't drink?
He's been sober for 15 years.
Sounds horrible.
Wait.
Is that whose car is out front?
Yeah.
I'm on a waiting list for one of those.
How'd he get it?
He's a dealer.
Drugs?
Cars.
Asshole.
"So, where is he?"
He took the boys for a bike ride.
He's alone with the boys?
So?
"So you're giving me shit about my parenting skills, and some total stranger is off with..."
he's not a total stranger.
Yeah?
"Well, how well do you know this guy?"
Well.
How well?
Well enough that we're getting married.
I knew it.
- You asshole.
- I'm sorry.
"It is you that's been smoking too, isn't it?"
Wha...?
"Wait, what does that even matter?"
Have you...?
!
Have you been smoking?
No.
"No, I haven't."
I talked to Neil.
I told him.
He said I could stay at his boat for a while.
Excuse me?
Now you're moving out?
"- You're, like, leaving me?"
- No.
"No, I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to..."
Aren't we gonna deal with this?
Don't you wanna find some way for us to work through this?
"I assumed that when I told you, you would want me out."
Is that what you want?
No.
Okay.
Okay.
WOMAN 1:
You're doing a great job.
"Oh, my gosh, it's Bridget."
Hi!
WOMAN 2:
"Oh, my goodness."
You know what?
I need to un-know that!
Your friend is here.
Chuck.
Thanks for coming.
"Yeah, well, I don't have a lot of time, so can we do this?"
"Hey, no, don't!"
Don't!
Shut up.
Do it.
"Okay, this is gonna sting a little at first, but after a few seconds, you're gonna be feeling much more cooperative."
"No, stop it!"
"Help me hold him, please."
Don't!
"Okay, I'm giving him a low dose, but he's gonna conk out any minute, so you guys are gonna have to act fast."
There we go.
All right.
Let's take this again.
Where's his ex-wife?
I-c-
- I c-
- I can't.
Just relax.
That's it.
Calm down.
Where did you hide her?
Cy-
- Cyprus.
She's in Nicosia...
Under the name...
Yasmine...
Sadek.
I think I'm really hurt here.
"Help me, you son of a bitch."
"I mean, even out here, right?"
"Someone always does, eventually."
"I'm sorry I hit you, man."
"I'm really sorry, man."
"What were you doing, running in the middle of the road, anyhow?"
Can I move my...
No.
Bug out of here.
"Hey, stop."
I need help.
I'm down here.
Get off me.
You look pretty tasty.
Get away from me.
I think I'll start with your eyes.
Get away from me.
"Yum. ""Ant-solutely"" delicious."
"Please, don't hurt me."
"You're a real mess, my friend."
"I mean, seriously racked up."
Please.
Save your strength.
That would be my advice.
You'll need it.
Help me.
"You'll be all right, fellow."
Just lie still.
I think I'm paralysed.
Can you...
You'll be all right.
"We're here with you, Stan."
Stan.
Stan.
Now do you believe me?
Shut up.
There must be an explanation.
You sure you put him in the incinerator?
Yeah.
He's ashes.
I don't know who or what we just saw but it's not the same guy.
That cold.
"He's here in the house, with us."
"It's like ice in here, boss."
"What I don't understand is, why did he come to this house?"
Has he ever been here before?
Never.
I barely knew him.
I met you all for the first time last night.
Go.
Let's go.
Wait.
Don't leave me.
"Please, don't leave me."
Go on and see what it is.
He's been gone five minutes.
Where the devil is he?
I don't know.
Maybe he's with Stan.
I'm going up there.
Look!
One of my murderers is dead.
The others will also die.
I will never let him near you.
Okay?
Ever.
I know you won't.
Good?
Yeah.
Riley and I will sweep this area.
Thank you.
Can I have my gun back?
No.
"Come on, just, come on."
"You guys know what a jammer looks like, right?"
Does it have like a fan on it?
Fuck.
I knew he'd find a way to fuck this up.
He always does.
He has not changed at all.
"Ollie, can you please just stop?"
He's still my brother.
It's not in here.
What the hell?
I already checked there.
What?
Nothing.
"Dude, I'm just sayin', don't let 'im talk to you like that."
Fuck 'im.
"No, seriously, you say the word,"
"I'll clan his ass, son."
"Don't worry about it, all right."
I need you to focus.
"Come on, Riley."
Help me out.
"Come on, Red."
Bring him along!
Come on!
[MEN YELLING]
"Don't be like that, pal."
"Come on, this is gonna be swell."
"Look, I got a nice little one for you too."
Come on.
[SIREN WAILING]
[HORN BLOWING]
There.
You're out of it anyway.
[GUARDS CHATTERING]
"Men, stay out of it."
Don't be suckers.
You can't fight machine guns and riot guns.
"Go back to your machines, you hear--"
Get going!
Come on!
Let's go!
MAN:
"No, I won't go in there!"
[MEN SHOUTING]
We're heading for the warden's!
There he is!
[MEN SHOUTING]
"Lock the door, get in the mailroom and stay there."
Pull 'em up!
You're crazy.
"Put up those guns, men!"
I'm giving the orders now.
You're taking us through them gates!
What the hell was that?
"The retrovirus is having the opposite effect, than we intended."
I guess so.
Oh God.
Ellia?
You poor girl.
You never deserved this.
I know part of you is still there.
Ellia please!
This isn't you!
Zaddik!
Are you alright?
Don't try to move.
It was Ellia.
But it wasn't her fault.
Over here!
Come on.
"No, no, you people need to go back to the village."
It is not safe here!
Who is that?
Don't you remember me?
No.
It can't be.
You were taken by the Daemus.
No father.
Father?
I don't understand.
You're his son?
"If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old."
Precisely.
There's another one of those things out there.
Look what it did to Zaddik.
Yeah.
Yes!
What a world!
"It's hard to believe, isn't it?"
I jump off a bridge.
I don't die.
Go figure.
And you  being so smart.
That must be a real comfort to you at a time like this.
- Jimmy.
- Shut up!
Shut your fucking mouth!
I loved you.
You're my brother and you betrayed me for him.
You knew I was the best cop!
Say it!
- Who's the best cop?
- Jimmy was the best cop!
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
"Tommy, let's have a drink."
Me and you.
Just like the old days.
Remember?
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
What's the matter?
"You're a drunk, aren't you?"
Drink it!
Are you too proud to drink with a dead man?
Maybe I should drink with your little dove.
Hey.
"- Leave her alone, Jimmy."
The way you collect money will bankrupt us!
"- Sister, that Big Mouth..."
- You're a coward!
You're useless!
How can we go on like this?
"Sister, don't do it!"
Don't!
Big Mouth is just as fierce as you!
Don't!
Don't run!
"If you can't get Big Mouth's money today, don't come home for dinner!"
BO CHI LAM
Who's Wong Fei-hung?
- You're...
"- I'm the head of Water-Lion, Iron-Swallow."
- What do you want?
- Are you blind?
Wait here.
No way.
This way.
Sit down.
I'll heal you.
I can't take pain!
I go mad when I feel pain!
Then I'm violent!
"What, violence?"
I'm a specialist.
We don't need Sifu.
Stop it!
- Sifu.
- Is that how you treat a patient?
"No, I was cleaning your chair!"
- What's his problem?
- You're my problem!
"The way you're treating people, asshole!"
I tried to keep my mouth shut.
Who is that man?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
But be nicer to your customers.
I'm sorry.
Very sorry.
Please forgive us.
What the hell is this?
- You're scary.
"- I just yell, that's all."
- Have a cigarette.
- Yes.
- Let's go someplace else.
"- Director Kim, that wasn't right."
What?
You shouldn't have done that.
You shouldn't treat people like that.
Go and apologize.
I'm serious.
Go apologize.
What's wrong with you?
You don't do that to people!
Even if he's a waiter!
This isn't right.
"Go and apologize, okay?"
- You really should.
- I won't!
Why on earth should I?
I can look like a man.
What do you think?
- How is Maria Concetta?
- She escaped.
"Then you didn't get anything, is that it?"
"Yes, and you're going blind."
You're even wearing glasses|.
"Well, the doctor says..."
It's just that my eyes are exhausted.
Are you worried about syphilis?
"So we don't want to hear about that, is that right?"
I'm not the one who has to worry about that.
Very good!
Very good!
So why are you scratching?
True.
Quiet!
I was waiting for you.
Everything alright?
"Yes, it's fine."
It's hot.
It's hot.
"- Go on, push."
- It hurts.
It's too hot.
"Ice, I want ice."
Give me a bit of ice.
- Not coffee.
He wants ice.
"- Ice, I want ice."
Impossible.
Impossible.
Woman:
Are you done with that?
He did not!
Hey.
What do you want from me?
"Dad, it's me."
I stuck out my neck for you.
Now you live up-- [sigh] All right.
What took you so long?
They had to make the shit.
"Okay, so I got yours with no onions."
How you like it.
"Dad, you at least have to take a bite of it."
I will.
You should call a doctor.
"I told you, it's just a panic attack."
You sure your mom's okay with you staying here?
"Yeah, she seemed fine."
Did you ask her?
- No.
- That's what I thought.
"Well, she's been really busy lately."
She's on the phone more than usual.
"How's your mom and, uh, and your aunt Callie?"
How are they doing?
Gross.
I don't know.
Okay?
- I don't ask.
- I don't blame you.
Can you watch anything else?
Yeah.
What's the news?
Nothing special.
Take care.
Mrs Parvin!
I'm bringing you soup.
May your wishes come true.
is she well?
Yes.
Have you finished?
"If you hear me, hold the line, I'm going to higher ground."
I'm going higher up.
Hold the line.
"If you hear me, I'm not hanging up."
I'm going to higher ground so we can talk.
"If we're cut off, call me back."
"Yes, hello..."
It's you.
I thought it was Mrs Godarzi.
I told you not to call me.
I'll call you.
Godarzi calls me about work.
So why have you brought me all the way up here?
"I'm sorry, go ahead."
Really?
When?
I can't be there.
Tell them you couldn't reach me.
How is she?
Better?
"Hello, are you well, father?"
I'm listening. I'll be home soon.
I've bought it for you. lt's red.
You can't do this.
"C'mon, I bet you enjoy this."
"C'mon, look at her."
Look at me.
Her name's Betty.
"Bet he's got a nice, big weenie."
Look at me...
"Please, look at me..."
"C'mon buddy, look at Betty."
Morons.
What the hell!
You morons.
Why don't you stop fucking around?
Weren't you taught to not bother others?
"Say something, dammit."
"Hey, man!"
Why don't you shut up?
"Don't hit us, we're just pretending!"
Pretend in the damn room!
"Manager, what're you doing?"
Shut the hell up!
I don't care!
I'm gonna quit this damn place!
You listen.
I'm gonna get a job at a nice hotel.
Then I'll pay you back.
And I'll find me a better girl!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Suzuki San?
I'm running away!
Need a bike?
"Police, stay!"
Told you to stay!
My father may have Alzheimer's now.
He was awesome in South Asia 30 years ago.
You playing me?
I can't find the guy.
I give you 2 days to find him.
Or you are dead.
That's it.
What's wrong with you?
You've never listened.
Go to the toilet.
You too?
What the hell?
What?
"Look, numskull!"
You hit a cop?
How dare you are?
It's a tiger head.
Should have said so.
Forget it.
Let's go...
"Hey, who are you looking for?"
Someone with a scorpion tattoo.
Scorpion Yong?
I know where he is.
Let me go.
Wasn't that an intense toilet experience?
Intense?
Come later and I could have died.
"Well, you're the one who needed the toilet."
I asked you to come along.
I'm okay.
Come here.
You're okay now?
You're okay now?
Drink up.
Good girl.
Leave it.
I want to tidy up a little.
Leave it.
We've got the shaman to thank for everything.
Get some rest.
You must be exhausted.
Shaman
Damn fool.
Suspect arrested in the mushroom-tonic case...
Victims have developed severe mental derangement...
Mr. Yang E-sam?
Yes.
The landlady was a victim.
"Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too."
It's turned the town upside down.
We've gotta bring him in.
You should get a lawyer.
"After all, he's a victim, too."
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?
Get out.
Missed calls
- Shaman
What the hell?
What the...?
Hello.
Who said anything about dough?
"Well, uh, at least sit down and have a drink."
Why not make it two?
One for you.
"- Well, I'll have a little one."
- Good.
Heh.
How much?
"Oh, about two ounces."
One for each kidney.
[LAUGHING]
Here.
"Oh, uh, chaser?"
- Always have been.
- Oh...
[BOTH LAUGHING]
I walked in.
What are you doing?
This guy's a murderer.
A murderer!
Do you understand that?
"Well, I think about my wife tracy every day,"
And then I see his face.
I wanted something to put him away.
All right.
"I'll tell you what, if you're right,"
I'll help you.
But you better be right.
"Woman Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
You're sick!
Franz is coming too.
"Yes, he'll join us this evening."
You know him and me are friends.
All right.
Then I can talk to you about Franz.
Sure.
Where is he?
Freienwalde.
Karl will drive us.
There must be lots you can tell me about Franz.
"Yeah, lots."
"He's a good fellow, if a bit of a softie."
He cried on the stairs last night.
He wants out.
He's not a criminal!
- He's starting that again?
- Not him ― me!
"You, kitten?"
I see.
Let's have a kiss.
Kiss me!
You're quite a girl!
You give me ideas!
To think he works with men like you!
Shame on you!
"Yeah, shame on me!"
Let me go or I'll scream!
Go ahead!
Scream your head off!
Here.
Think you can run home and rat on me to Franz?
"""Reinhold tried to kiss me, and I let him have it!"""
Come with me.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
Do you dance?
"Oh, but the treatment."
Try this.
"Oh, that's wonderful."
Try it again.
Turn around.
(MUSIC STOPS)
But what about the treatment?
"Oh, I know what great lovers you Frenchmen are."
Kiss me.
"Oh, that's good."
You!
What are you doing with my wife?
"Uh, massaging the scalp."
"Oh, oh, pardon moi."
The jacket.
It's very warm here.
The jacket.
"Merci beaucoup, mademoiselle."
I ought to kill you for this.
(GRUNTING)
If you lay one...
"If you lay un hand on me, you know what I will do?"
What?
I'll bleed.
Au revoir.
"If I ever see your ugly face again, I'll kill you."
I want you to get out of town and stay out.
"(IN NORMAL VOICE) Yeah, all right, but I can't leave from up here."
Is there anything else?
Linda's coming in.
"Uh, okay."
"Well, you do that."
I'm just gonna drink a lot of wine.
That guy must really know what he's doing.
"Why, because he's slurping?"
Mm...
Ugh!
"Oh, my."
Excuse me!
Hey!
Hi!
Are you some kind of an expert?
I just overheard you doing that sound...
Oh.
I'm a wine enthusiast.
Although I'm not enthused by this first flight.
Oh!
He's hysterical.
You should come taste with us.
Oh!
You can give us tips on how to get tipsy.
Sure.
"Lin, no."
I don't want to drink with that guy.
Why?
"I do, Bobby."
He's an expert.
"Well, I was looking forward to a relaxing day off."
"I wasn't even gonna talk to you that much, to be honest."
I just don't want to drink with the guy...
Hi...
I would.
I know you would.
–Who did this to you?
–Fleetwood.
That prick that got Joe kicked off the force?
Yeah.
Joe's goin' after him.
You gotta stop him.
Okay.
You gotta stop him.
"–Come on, guys."
We're losing blood.
–Just hang in there.
–Gotta go.
–Just hang in there.
"Detective Wyms, Carlson just called."
There's a homeless guy with a bloody machete saying he killed somebody.
–Where?
–Just south of Bell on Vine.
That's a block from Kayla's apartment.
Where's Dutch?
I don't know.
Maybe he's checking in on Vic.
Have you heard anything?
Not yet.
Find Dutch.
Tell him to meet me there.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
They got the guy?
"–Sir, put the knife down, please."
–I'll kill again!
Hooray!
That dog done it.
- He all right?
- Hope so.
"Oh, I beg your pardon, old boy, but haven't you forgotten about the money?"
The gelt?
Please.
Mmm!
"Thank you, sir."
"- Oh, say."
You know something?
- Well?
You'd make a good dog biscuit.
"- What's that, a halter?"
- Yeah.
Hmm.
"Being as I'm working like a horse, I just as well look like one."
There you are.
Now hang on to this.
Is that all?
Did you remember nails?
Nails.
Hammers and saw.
Look.
You bought 'em yourself.
What's the matter with you this morning?
- Nothing.
Get out.
- Mmm.
"Oh, hey, listen-"
There's something we did forget - a medicine kit.
"We need some iodine and quinine, just in case."
What are you doing?
"Between you and me, I can't wait to find out."
"Right, if you look after everyone here, then I can..."
Clara!
Doctor!
That was stupid!
"You were stupid, too!"
"I'm allowed, I'm good at stupid!"
That's the way to do it!
Why does she keep saying that?
"Mirroring, random mirroring."
We need to get on the roof.
This way!
"I do the hand grabbing, that's my job, that's always me!"
"Come on, quickly!"
Agh!
What are you doing?
My bustle is stuck.
Your bustle?
!
You're going to have to take those clothes off!
I didn't mean...
I know.
"I understand, I do."
Good.
What's the plan?
Who said I've got a plan?
Course you've got a plan.
You took that.
Maybe I'm an idiot.
"You're not, you're clever."
Really clever.
"Brucey, Moreno, Lung-Dog..."
"I mean, all those guys started investing a couple months back."
They're doing well.
"I mean, so..."
"Like, if those idiots can do stuff in the stock market, why can't I?"
"Oh, my God, what are you gonna..."
You're gonna apply your grade nine education to the stock market?
I'm not...
That's...
Shh.
Yeah.
Go.
Be quiet.
Hey.
Sorry.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, what's up?"
Tim here?
Billy.
Yeah.
Came to bring you this.
What's this?
It's the money you owe those guys.
I don't want you to get beat up again.
I'm not bringing you into this.
"You're not bringing me into anything, Tim."
Is this why you came over?
Yeah.
And I'm not...
I'm not coming back here anymore.
- Where are we going?
- To a nicer room.
My lunch box....
There we go.
Don't you be scared.
I'll stay with you until we take you upstairs.
- I made it in school.
- It's beautiful.
- It's for you.
- Thank you.
- Nice.
- Yeah.
- The plastic surgeon will be here soon.
- We won't be needing your surgeon.
- Excuse me?
- My plastic surgeon's coming.
- Who?
- Fred.
- Fred Mendoza?
He'll cost a fortune.
- It's only your daughter's face.
"- No, I hate him."
That's why you called.
- He's the best in Chicago.
For lopsided breasts.
Touchy subject.
- Is he all right?
- Mouth-to-mouth's not working.
- His airway's blocked.
- Paramedics are coming any minute.
- That Medevac copter will take us.
- That's a TV news chopper.
- Me?
- What is that... ketchup?
What?
"- Okay, not bad."
- You felt it?
"A bit, a bit."
"- Okay, my turn."
- All right.
Taxi!
- I'm so sorry.
- No worries.
"Ooh, man, only a slight breeze that time."
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, it's getting better."
All right.
Ready for some driving?
"- Yeah, let's do it."
- Let's go.
"I could use a little ""Viva La Vida"" right about now."
"Okay, how about this?"
"From now on, whoever has the wallet controls the radio."
"Deal, baby."
Let the game begin.
What the...
How'd you do that?
- Thank you.
- Son of a bitch.

This better work.
"- It's sourdough, right?"
Did your mother change her mind?
No.
I didn't get on the plane.
Can you hide me?
Come in.
-You're so slow!
-Who's slow?
"It's really nice in here, isn't it?"
This is really what I want to do.
On the anniversary of the day we first met.
"-Wait, what are you looking for?"
"-Wait, don't move too much."
Wait!
"-Wait, wait a second!"
Wait!
-What are you looking for?
.
Where could it be?
"Here, here, here, here!"
Is this what you're looking for?
.
"Hey, wait!"
Wait!
Can you see that tree?
.
It's been there since I was young.
"You know, whatever storm comes, whatever kind of earthquake,"
It's still standing.
"Joy, I promise you."
That tree is as strong as my love for you.
"If you can't answer now, it's okay."
Let's get it on.
Now I know nothing about this guy.
Take him out quick.
Ready?
Fight!
That's it.
That's it.
man.
You look really good.
doing some fighting?
man.
Price.
I hear ya.
No harm in asking.
- All right.
- Nice fight.
Thank you very much.
I'll be talking to ya.
Price.
it's so nice not having to go to work.
I could do this every day.
You'd get bored.
I wouldn't.
honestly.
I do this nearly every day.
You'd get bored.
A man needs a reason to get up in the morning.
So is that why you stopped fighting and moved out to this bumfuck town?
I didn't stop fighting.
And I certainly didn't move here.
I had no choice.
What do you mean? I'm in the witness protection program.
He's bound to accept one or the other.
Mumsie.
"Oh, Mumsie!"
This is stark-staring murder!
"Remember, before you pop him in, you must take his keys."
But why should I have to do all the dirty work?
He'd never take a drink from me.
He'd suspect foul play!
- I shall be hung!
"- It's ""hanged"", and you won't be."
"Oh, Mumsie!"
I'll go by the service stairs to avoid him.
Is everything clear?
Good.
I'll be in the car at the front.
"The moment he falls insensible, signal from the window."
- You'll have a lot to answer for.
- Mumsie!
- It won't be long now.
Chin up.
Chin up...
Oh!
It's...
"Mumsie, she..."
(Shrieks)
(Doorbell)
Ohh...
Oh.
Mrs...
Miss Ransom?
Are you alone?
May I come in?
It's right here.
"Oh, here it is."
Here it is.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
- What are you doing?
- You want it?
There's the medicine.
That's why I wanna go as far away as I can.
I can't save you.
I can't watch you go do this over and over and over again.
"- Oh, no."
"No, no..."
- It's just...
I can't.
"Every time I think you're going to get better, you don't."
- It's too much.
"- No, wait."
Mommy's coming.
Mommy's coming.
"Oh, no, look, they're all over the..."
I'm gonna get them.
I'm gonna get all the pills.
I'm gonna pick them all up.
Every single one.
"I'm getting them all picked up, and then..."
And then...
And then...
"Here, you hold them for me."
"You hold them for me, honey."
That's good.
Okay.
"I'm gonna get them, and I'm gonna take all my pills."
"I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr. Jones."
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place all alone.
"Slimy pig, you let me go!"
Stop it!
Marion!
Hang on.
Don't...
- Indy!
- Don't fall!
"Marion, I got you!"
I got you!
I got you!
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!
Snakes!
"Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!"
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the Führer matters.
"I wonder sometimes, monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind."
"It was not to be, chérie."
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!
Indiana Jones... adieu.
No!
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
Thank you.
"Oh, my God, this whole place is slithering."
Indy!
Ow!
Don't worry about it.
Don't believe him!
Gary's not exactly on a winning streak.
Ignore that.
Just ignore that.
Focus just on this.
Breathe.
Just breathe.
Do it!
Aah!
My gosh!
In your face!
That is bullshit!
"No, no, no, that is such bullshit."
"Let's go again, double or nothing."
"Double or nothing, let's go again."
- Let's go again.
"- Don't be a sore loser, Freddy."
I think I better quit while I'm ahead.
"Hey, Gary is a pussy, okay?"
You don't have to be a pussy.
"And he's, like, so cranky."
He's so cranky.
Ever since Patty left him for the pool boy...
"Keep talking, Freddy."
Keep talking.
"- Jesus, calm down."
- Keep talking.
- Apologize to the lady.
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
- Apologize to the lady.
And I was the one who saw him first.
"Oh, don't be ridiculous."
Very well.
We'll use the joint account.
- Don't be angry with me.
"- I'm not angry with you, Ursula."
I'm just gonna get the washing.
"No, no, I'll do it."
I'll do it!
"Oh, Ursula."
[Men chattering]
[Dorcas]:
"Not cheap, is it?"
[Man]:
It is for everyone else.
You can afford it.
It's just as well.
[Men chattering]
[Dorcas]:
I want some pilchards.
[Man]:
No more left.
"What do you mean, haven't got any left?"
I did have half an hour ago.
"What have you done with it, then?"
All right.
Phyllis has got 'em up at the shed.
She'd better have.
[Woman]:
What's she want pilchards for?
Stargazey pie.
What's the matter with coley fish?
- Who is slave?
"I am a soldier, too, please."
- You're what?
Regimental bhisti.
"Proud ox, where is your army?"
How soon are they to follow?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Why don't you look in your crystal ball?
Make the ox talk.
You dirty pack of cowards!
Never mind him.
Now.
He's next.
- I'm waiting.
Will you speak?
- I don't know.
"Hold on, Mac, old boy!"
Stop.
Look.
"See them down there... coiling and wiggling, sticking their pretty tongues out?"
Are you going to speak?
Throw him in.
He'll talk from there.
"- No, I can't stand it!"
- Will you speak?
All right.
"If I ain't kissed by one of them snakes, I'll tell you."
Take me outside.
"- Be a man, Mac."
"- I can't go it, mates!"
"Come back, Mac, old boy!"
"- Well, Sergeant?"
We're talking about 100's square miles of forest.
Be patient.
"Ronon's been going up against the Wraith, one on one, for the last seven years."
"If anyone can track this thing, it's him."
And exactly how is he gonna do that?
I also have good hearing!
Right!
Carry on!
What about you?
You sensing anything?
I am not sure.
What do you mean?
"There is a presence here, but it is different."
I cannot quite explain it.
It's in there.
Ronon!
Dammit!
It's in there.
- It was a Wraith?
- Yeah.
- Did you see it?
- No.
"- Well, so how do you know?"
Ronon is correct.
I can definitely sense it now.
A female!
Ellia?
- Get out of the way!
- Please don't shoot!
She's not what you think!
She's my daughter.
She means you no harm!
"Oh, same old, same old."
You?
Yep.
- So where is Bethanne?
- She won't be coming back.
What happened?
Where is she?
"Well, you were right."
We shouldn't have left.
No.
Hungry?
"Next time, you'll listen to me."
I'm home.
"Teeth brushed, ready for bed."
Safe and sound.
"Oh, good, good."
I'm glad.
Is everything all right?
You sound serious.
"No, no, no."
Uh...
Not tonight.
You still have a few more minutes left of normal.
"I'll tell you about it tomorrow, okay?"
I had a really nice time on our date tonight.
- Such a liar.
"- No, I'm serious."
"In a way, it was exactly what it was supposed to be."
I had a really nice time too.
Could you help me out a little bit?
What the hell?
I could have killed you.

It's not our first deal.
Maybe he looks familiar.
"Here's $200,000."
We'll check the guns first.
What are you guys doing?
"Nothing special, officer."
A reunion.
Open the trunk.
Open it!
Now!
Damn you!
"You set me up, didn't you?"
Are you a cop?
Talk!
I'm no cop!
I didn't betray you.
Then how come he's here?
He's no cop!
"I stake my life on it, Eddie!"
"Lying bastard, I shouldn't have trusted you!"
The guy's a cop.
I recognize him!
You've got it wrong.
"Chang, I'll get him!"
That shithead!
Don't move!
"Goddamn mess, assho--"
Finish your sentence.
Ass... assho--
"Inspector Li, the suspect Eddie Hung held a hostage... in a crowded trolley car..."
Could you see him clearly?
- Let's have a look.
- There's fighting outside.
I haven't fought!
Please don't misunderstand me!
I just came to stop the fight.
He's fantastic!
Fantastic!
"I can't fight, I'm innocent."
You've cheated me.
Now you have taken my girls.
I haven't!
You don't have to deny it.
I understand!
Good!
Wu-tang will not lose to your Shaolin fist.
Shaolin?
Wu-tang?
What a minor art!
Are you really good at kung-fu?
He's inferior to you!
Please excuse me!
Thanks!
Shaolin won't lose to you Wu-tang.
"Jun-kit, you want to compete with me?"
Good...
let them compete!
"Sure, if you're interested!"
Good fist!
Watch out!
Shaolin Chin Kang Fist is not bad.
But now watch mine!
Are you alright?
Let's go.
"Shiv, we have met before."
In our past life.
What?
I was a princess and you were a warrior.
And we were in love.
What...what...what...
Zak killed you to make me his.
And the same thing is going to repeat again.
"Shiv, are you getting me?"
You lost your life because of me.
"Shiv, we can't be together anymore."
Just...just...just a second.
One second.
"Just give me a second, okay?"
- Listen to me.
"- Just a second, okay?"
Very important.
You nitwit!
Where is your Hidimba!
That bloody old hag!
You ask why am I cussing?
She has made my life hell.
- My girlfriend has lost it.
- Shiv!
"Past life, king and queen and what not she is talking about."
I'll stab her to death if I see her.
Let her know.
What?
I am on the other side of the island.
Wait a second.
Hey!
A foreign lab?
"Actually, no."
"Garcia, isn't Annandale where Morgan and Hotch are?"
That's not a gas main explosion.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
"Yeah, it's Morgan."
Hello?
"Garcia, can you hear me?"
We saw the explosion on TV.
"Yeah, I know."
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
"Oh, God."
Don't worry.
Don't think you're gonna get rid of me that easy.
Do you need anything?
I know who to call if I do.
"Thanks, baby doll."
They're all right?
Yeah.
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
Son of a bitch.
Sorry about Kenny.
"Yeah, me, too."
The chatter was a set-up.
They knew we'd be listening.
They led us straight here.
Just tell me you know where to look next.
Not yet.
They're okay?
We were right about the trap.
- Invitation to a party
I told you.
It'll be a bore.
- You prophesied a train crash
And then we'd all be charred alive after supper in a dinner-hall fire
"Look, boys."
- Where...?
He's the one
Where have we landed?
Was this your idea?
Us?
Or the waiters?
- For me.
Rocky shut your trap
Why did you have to call him?
"You know Sheena, haven't I seen you before?"
Me?
Really?
Where?
- At Robbie's party?
You might've.
I go to so many parties
You know Sheena...
- What?
Your eyes remind me of someone.
- My eyes?
Really?
Whom?
My grandmother
Is she singing or crying?
And I can play better piano
You know how to play the piano?
I want to come with you.
"No, out of the question."
"You don't want to, Helene."
It's sons and their father in the woods.
Or else they'll turn out gay.
Promise to use a life vest and water wings.
And the boys too.
- Bye bye!
- Bye.
Hi.
- Can we talk?
- What do you want to talk about?
- We could start with Jorgen?
- Stop already.
Listen.
Can I come in?
Thanks.
- So talk about Jorgen.
- Can we sit down?
We could find a chair.
This is fine.
May I sit here?
Okay...
Did you know Jorgen asked me to administer a fund?
- No.
What fund?
- It's aid work.
With Anna.
- You'll run it with Anna?
- With Anna.
"It's a very generous offer, but he's dragging things out."
I want to know what's going on.
Missed calls
- Shaman
What the hell?
What the...?
Hello.
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
L.
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
"Then""."
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
"Hey, Bella."
Do you want to jump in bed?
Do you want?
OK then!
Zıplıyoruz bed!
See?
This place is not bad I said to you!
- What is Jade?
"- Hi, Mike."
"- Sculpture, where is it?"
- I told you I wanted to go.
So sendeymiş.
Wow!
You t.şaklıymışsın vulgar.
- I want $ 1 million.
- How about meeting me?
We'll talk.
"If I make it, die."
Statue when you die.
So I'll do this as follows:
I'll tell you the location of the transmitter.
Give me my money.
Then he'll tell you where to find the statue.
"You play a dangerous game, Mike."
You can not hide from me.
I promise you:
"The one you will not hurt, burn, Mike."
Do not have to do this to me.
Bring the money to the donor.
Then you get the statue.
"Okay, Jade?"
Look ...
- Yeah.
Enough of doing it that way.
"All right,so..."
"Now, Claudia..."
Okay...
"Now, focus."
Don't just write it.
Believe it.
- No...
- Yes.
I will not disobay Arite.
How long you been working on that?
Since I lost my father.
"Artie, I'm sorry."
When did he die?
"Oh, he's alive."
I just hope that finishing this
Will help us find each other again.
Myka.
Yeah?
"So listen, I'm taking the girls out"
"For a little night on the town,"
"You know, which, in this part of South Dakota means"
Going for ice cream.
You wanna come?
I'm beat.
All right.
You want me to bring you something back?
You know I don't eat sugar.
"Right, butter pecan, caramel sauce,"
Chocolate sprinkles.
You all right?
Captain?
You just stay here.
Hold it down.
JIM:
"I'm so sorry, Mr. Glass."
HENRY:
"Bridger, press down here."
"He's bleeding down here, too."
(SCREAMING)
ANDERSON:
They're torturing the bastard.
The proper thing to do would be to finish him off quick.
Unless he has a chance of pulling through.
(SCOFFS)
Pulling through?
You saw what that grizz did to him.
He'll be dead inside an hour.
Mmm-hmm.
"Yeah, we all will be if he don't quit wailing like that."
Toward you and twist it into place.
I'll hold him.
Go.
Pa.
Hold him.
Go.
Go!
Now!
He passed out.
I'll take advantage and stitch up his neck.
Water.
"Bridger, tell the others we'll camp here tonight."

The building's almost empty.
Switching over to condos or some kind of gentrification or some kind of shit.

"I got it, pull me up!"
Estrella was wearing hose like those.

My head still hurts from the gin.

I don't like that place.
Nothing but ghosts around.
Can I go?

- 250 pesetas a kilo.
"What is it, Haribhai?"
I was terribly sorry... to hear of your mother's death.
When?
Oh yes... just now!
"She's dead, isn't she?"
Absolutely!
But that's an old story.
There's something new.
She's here.
Who's that?
Aunty!
I know that.
How did you know?
You told me just now.
Didn't you?
Damn it!
I speak a lot!
So what's the important thing you've got to discuss?
How do you know I had something to discuss?
How?
You didn't tell me.
Neither did Haribhai.
But I know it.
And how?
The fact that you're here means it's important!
First drive the Gujju out.
I'll go away.
But I must tell you something before I leave!
"You know I'm a widow, don't you, Jai?"
What is a man who loses his wife called?

Right!
Who is this?
Look at that.
Get in!
-Son Son.
-OK.

"Come on, boy."
Come here.
"Lu, what did you say this guy?"
Nothing.
He said you told him I I killed a woman and a child from that type.
What?
It's the same thing for you.
You're supposed to be representative Act.
What is this shit?
Fuck off.
Both.
Have you two last words you want to say to each other?
"Toni, I think it should be to kill them now."
"It will be tough for them outside,"
Since they will not know how to handle them.
Maybe Ray is killed while resisting arrest.
Came home late at night...
Burglar could kill him.
"Uneasily with you, boy?"
Get up!
You look uncomfortable.
I'm sorry.

It's all right.
I'm not here to hurt you.
Is your speech module installed?
Shit.
"Well, at least we know you're not deaf."
"It's all right, you can put your hands down now."
3 years I've been waiting for this moment and I get Charlie fucking Chaplin.
"Fuck's sake, come on!"
"All right, let's have a look at you."
"Open the glove box, please."
Take out that whole contraption.
You gotta untangle the wires.
Is that a wedding ring?
Are you... are you married?
You quickly do the accounts.
You think?
Have something to eat and live in serenity enough for me .
"- The addition, if you please!"
- Right now!
- Welcome!

You think this is enough?
Who's the next
"You mattes what, you"
None
All right.
The next is the wealthy Kamoda.
Because you could've killed me and you didn't.
You get one favor.
Now go before I change my mind.
"Actually, I get two favors."
What?
"Well, the way I see it I could have killed you twice."
The poison and when you were knocked out.
I didn't!
What do you want?

"Emma, look at me."
Have I told you a lie?
"I brought you here, I risked my own safety to help you."
The compass is in your hand.
Why do this to me now?
I can't take a chance that I'm wrong about you.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
You're sorry!
"Carry on, Mr. Scott-Padget."
Officer has reported with all equipment correct.

Small chance of a convoy still being here.

Sail ho!
"Deck, there!"
"Large sail, two points forward of the larboard beam!"

Can you tell?
"- She's a frigate, sir."
"Hear that, Mr. Scott-Padget?"
A single frigate.

After empty searches.
And near-death dives.
And with the weight Of the pomrenke empire.
On his shoulders...
Mr. Gold strikes again.
Shawn Has finally found gold.
Where his dad always Doubted he would.

We are all born alike.
"I'm not Bill, there is only one like me around the world."
I am a single krill.
-Where you going?
-I'm leaving.
"-I want to be free, Bill."
Do not have that to be free.
"Come on, let's think more school."
I'm full of shoals.
We walked into school life.
Sometimes I think your mind is its own.
"Tell me, what is beyond the school?"
More-school.
-And then.
"There is nothing beyond the school, a school are endless."
Everything has an end.
"See, I'm here."
And it's not a happy ending.
"It makes sense, Bill."
If I swim to the opposite of the school end up coming ...
At the end of the world.
Very well.
I'll count to three.
A. ..
Two ...
Three ...
"No, I can!"
I always figure to check out first anyway.

- Because that how usually goes for the good ones.
You got a hair dryer?
"Unit 42, come in."
"Unit 42, respond to dispatch."
You just missed her.
- Daze?
- She just left.
Who?
Rose.
- Was she alive?
- I don't know.
But she asked about you.
What did she say?
She said:
"""I'm looking for your partner."""
Those were her exact words.
- Is that all she said?
- No.
"She said that roses were dead, and violets were too."
She's fled after that and that's the end of it.
How long have you been here?
She's taller than I thought.
"How long have you been here, Daze?"
I can't really tell.
"Time is bend up now, so I don't know."
I keep missing my flights.
What's that?
"Oh, that?"
That's his.
The guy's.
Enough.
Do you want vada?
You mean firebrand?
OK
Hey why is a thread coming out of it?
-Got torn.
I only stitched it together.

Yes
Where is the chef?
It's one week since he left for hometown.
Then what about this vada?
"Well, he made it before leaving."
Oh!
Damn you all.
Why did you leave the table?

-I am Karthik.
-So what?
- I am a lawyer and I need a house for rent.
A lawyer?
- You look too timid.
Can you raise your voice?
"- Yes, I can."
It's very difficult to find a house for a lawyer.
- Ben and Mike.
- Mike?
- Jade trying to kid.
- He should be.
Someone else could not.
"- This is true, and I go on and kill."
I will not have to do that.
I'll do.
- Let me find a statue of a she.
- Here's what I want to say.
- You got your passport?
"- Yes, sir."
I always forget mine.
Rook This is a great issue.
This is a very big issue.
A very vital situation.
I know.
"I know, Dad."
Do not worry.
You can make it.
You know what?
In this world there are 2 types of crime.
"I used to did not know it, but now I know."
"In other words, the Wall Street bankers."

They are the real criminals.
Bankers.

Toronta'daki venue had bi guy.
How come?

What about Lydia?
She doesn't need me anymore.
Have you split up?
You could say that.
Believe me.
I could see it coming.
"Don't ask me how, but I did."
"There was something in your relationship, forgive me, that didn't work."
When are you leaving?
"Very soon, but I'll see you before."
I hope so.
I'm sorry you're going.
"Hey, Rosa."
"Hey, Marco."
I'm off.
"Benigno, see you soon."
Yes.
"Rosa, goodbye."

Has her period come yet?
Not yet.
Going by last month's nursing report it should have come.
"Yes, it is a bit late."
It's over two weeks.
That's too much.
Are you sure she had one last month?
I put the towel on her myself.
It was the week you had flu.
She even seems swollen.
"Yes, but at times they can be irregular."
Stop.
What's wrong?
Stop.
"I don't want to hear any more of it, and put that back where you found it."
Why?
What's... what's wrong?
"You okay there, Duval?"
You said that I could do this.
"Well, now I'm saying you can't."
"Just because you don't talk about him, doesn't mean that no one else can."
I'm your father and I told you to put it away!
So put that thing away now!
[Cork rattles]
I know.
That was wrong.
I know.
I'll apologize to Gracie in a minute.
Did something happen at work?
Yeah.
No.
I...
Let me ask you a question.
"If Dad came back, right now..."
What would you say to him?
"Oh, my god."
It's happening.
"It's finally happening, isn't it?"
What?
What's happening?
"Well, you're letting in that Dad is gone."
He's gone.
He's not coming back.
"Whoo, yeah!"
You think the city's big.
It's huge!
And lots of naked ladies.
"If I had my own naked lady, I'd never leave my room."
"If you had your own naked lady, I'd never leave your room."
"So, hold on-- do you got the money?"
We got everything!
Whoo!
Whoa...
Whoa...
"Oh, no."
I want to go back.
"Hey, the footpath's for virgins."
We are virgins!
"Hey, not for long."
"If you guys get killed, I'm going home."
Beautiful.
"Oh, my God."
Do you believe this?
"This woman gave birth to her own head, and it sang to her."
-Wow.
-Wow.
"Hey, Cash, where you going?"
You don't ask me that.
Never ask me that!
"Okay, I'm sorry."
I just forgot for a second.
"Guys, come here."
Whoa!
This is going to be tougher than we thought.
How do we tell a prostitute from everybody else?
You said so.
"He gives that appearance, yes."
"But in disturbances of this sort, we can't always be sure."
"No, I'm afraid John has to stay here."
But he can't.
We need him.
The business.
I must take him home.
You'd only be taking home his body.
His mind is...
Look for yourself.
I hope that ending was properly terrifying.
What's this?
Nothing but sawdust.
"Oh, well, two can play at that game."
That's all I have here.
This concludes our program for tonight.
"On our next program, we shall both be back."
Me and my shadow.
Good night.

Thanks a lot.
I'll get a flashlight.
I know it's tough...to go down and see him.
You're sure you don't want me to drive?
Hurry back.
"Take it easy guys, there's plenty here."
Cut pie.
Little portions.
John Philip Sousa.
I don't want to make love tonight.
It's our last night.
I know.
I don't want to make love.
"Yeah, you're right."
Me neither.
"Oh, Christ, Cora."
It's all in the feet.
You must watch the feet.
-Can I talk to you a minute?
"-It is beautiful, believe me."
-You just watch your feet....
Hey.
Come on.
It's an aftershock...
it'll stop in a second.
Pancakes !
"Oh, my God."
Kirsten ?
Kirsten ?
"Over here, Mr. Cohen."
Sandy.
Something is not right.
Nothing works.
It's like an information blackout.
"Well, the aftershock probably took out a power line or something."
"So listen, I'm going to go on foot and get help, I think."
"No, no, no."
"Well, we can't stay here."
I don't even know where here is.
"Well, I'm going with you."
"No, it's cool."
"Listen, I'm going to come back as soon as I can."
Promise.
What about the zombies ?
That's a really good point.
Okay.
"All right, buddy."
We have to keep you alert and on your feet.
"Now, when last we checked the list..."
Need some help ?
Yeah.
...we were on Trey.
Mm-hmm.
But it's not good.
There you are.
I had a dream about you.
Yeah?
Hope a good one.
"There was some kind of... disaster... nuclear, maybe, I don't know."
[muttering]
Seemed like the whole world was burned.
And I was looking for you.
"I couldn't find you, and I was..."
I was calling your name.
So not a good one.
You've been working too hard.
So why don't we stay in bed all day?
Order some food in.
Watch movies.
What?
What is it?
It's Sunday.
Yeah.
I know what day it is.
"Yeah, it's Marius' deadline."
Yeah.
"I know that, too."
"If you ruin Eddie's hands, you'll never get a chance to expose Mukherjee."
So you want me to give Eddie a pass.
Yeah.
"Hey, tell me something."
Yeah.
"I need to ask you something, and I want you to be honest with me."
Of course.
Do you still care about Marius?
Oooh...
That was a delayed one.
Nice.
Hm-m-m.
(gunfire)
(woman screams)
(gunfire)
We're doomed.
"Hi, Daddy..."
Dad.
"Sorry, son."
I can't save us.
I don't have the energy.
"Wait, my pills!"
"Junior, would you reach in my anus?"
Sure!
"Wait, let me check my pocket first."
(groans)
(gun cocks)
Any last puns or wordplay?
"You've heard of pirating cable, but how about cabling a pirate?"
You have defeated us.
Have I?
Yes!
Ugh!
I hate you!
Do you?
Ahh!
(ship's horn blares)
"Cleveland, you really saved the day."
Maybe I was wrong about you taking those pills.
"I hope so, 'cause I haven't stopped."
- Rocky Sullivan?
- Yeah.
- Does he know I'm here?
- Sure.
Didn't you want me to tell him?
That's all right.
Send him in.
"Well, well, Rocky!"
This is a surprise.
- What do you hear?
What do you say?
- I had the date on the calendar.
I thought it was next month.
Otherwise I would've met you with a brass band.
"I thought it was funny you didn't show, but you've been busy the last three years."
You got a swell layout here.
Looks like you're in the dough.
"- Yes, only..."
"Well, you know Mac Keefer."
- Mac Keefer?
"Yeah, heard of him."
- He owns the town.
Can buy and sell it.
- Only he doesn't buy it.
He sells it.
"- That's soft, eh?"
- Softer than that store cot I've been sleeping on for the last three years.
"- Well, you're out now, Rocky."
- Yeah.
- Where's that dough?
- What?
The hundred grand?
"Full ten points, very well done."
Team Araucarians - are you ready?
I hope so.
I can tell you you will be looking for...
"You've two minutes, reveal the hive."
Right.
There's Kil...mar...nock.
Along the top.
"I don't think that's a red herring, because it's right in the corner."
So let's pick that one out.
Have you got Blane?
Is that Oban?
Let's try and think of small places.
"Dumbarton, is Dumbarton in there?"
No.
Is there Dun-anything?
Dumfries?
Dumfries?
That sort of works around that edge.
"Yes, it does, you're right."
Let's go for that.
Enter.
Cum...?
Cumbernauld?
Cumber...
"Yes, that goes all the way around there."
There's Ayr.
"No, hang on, Cumber..."
"Oh, that way, oh yes!"
"So, around there."
Cumber...
And then...
- Later.
- Lunch.
"Ooh, he's got a blog."
Favorite music:
All things Christina.
- You might be right.
- Yeah.
That's her.
Kitty Walker.
"- Gary Morris, policy advisor."
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
"I was a big fan of Red, White  Blue."
Welcome aboard.
Thanks.
I'm happy to be here.
"Between you and me, the staff are concerned about you working for us."
- But so long as you're discreet...
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not sure I follow...
- Sorry.
I need to take this.
"Noreen, can you help Kitty get settled?"
Thanks.
Your office is this way.
"Not quite what you're used to, huh?"
"No makeup, no stylists."
This office is seriously lacking in glamour.
"Well, I worked in basic cable, so..."
Ooh.
- No glamour there.
No.
I don't know what it is.
Do you?
Not yet.
Now we are done here.
I apologize again.
For what?
Keeping me waiting or lying to me?
Both.
Good evening.
Sabine will show you out.
"Picked the wrong House to crash, Ma'am."
Chthon is pretty picky.
I was looking for my daughter.
She was there.
"A lot of people pass through them, Ma'am."
What's that?
An extract of garlic.
I'd say this is gonna hurt a little but I'd be lying.
I've always hated garlic.
This will be the last time you'll be able to smell it.
I promise.
"Oh my god, mom!"
What are you doing?
Get out of the way.
"You're gonna have to kill me first, you son of a bitch."
Blade.
Krista?
"Mum, we're gonna get you out of here."
"I'm a little busy, sweetheart."
"Mom, look at me!"
You've to come with me now!
I really want to do well at this job.
I can't do well if everybody thinks that I got my job by sleeping with my boss.
"So if you will excuse me, I am meeting with the EM very shortly..."
- EM?
- It's the executive matchmaker.
Now silence.
Mother.
You want help with that bar?
There you go.
- Hey.
"- Oh, hey!"
You made it.
Yeah.
"I didn't want Major Pain to make me do extra pushups, so I ran here."
- Wow.
"- Hey, you should check them out."
"Oh, yeah."
That...
Nice.
- I got yours in my bag.
- Great.
You need to break them in.
What are you doing tomorrow?
"- Say, around 11?"
- I...
I work.
I'm...
I'm a lawyer.
That's too bad.
"Not that you're a lawyer, that you're not free."
"Well, you know, I work pretty flexible hours."
Cool.
Every young student doctor...
She wanted to know my menstrual history.
I didn't know what she was talking about till she told me.
I felt like a right bleeding'eejit.
"Why didn't she just say ""your periods""?"
"We'll weigh you now, Sharon."
Doctors are always like that.
"""Menstrual history."""
"I got a ""C"" in that in me inter."
How are your movements?
Not bad.
How's yours?
There's the heartbeat now.
See it?
Yeah.
Only one heart.
What?
There aren't twins in there.
"Oh, yeah."
That there is a leg.
See it?
"Oh, yeah."
Sharon?
Why didn't you come in this morning?
Had a checkup.
I swapped with Mona.
You should be on check...
Ask her.
You should be on check-out now.
I can't do it!
Why not?
'Cause I have to keep going to the toilet!
Don't go now- or you'll all die.
"If you go now, your whole family will perish."
What are you talking about?
The Jap is waiting for you... to annihilate your family.
He's dead.
He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hvo-jm?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
"Baby""."
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
You might have split the bottom.
"We'll be back, my friends."
"For the time being, good-bye... and good-bye."
Look out!
"Well, they wanted gold."
Now they got it.
"Hey, Claire, get the medicine kit and some hot water."
Is he badly hurt?
Yeah.
He's got a nasty crack on the skull.
"Some prospector, I guess."
"Go away, Buck."
Get out of the way.
John!
John!
"Oh, John."
"John, darling.!"
"Claire, dearest..."
I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton.
"All right, dear."
I thought I'd... lost you.
"Try to rest, please."
He's feeling much better this morning.
"He remembers everything, thank heaven."
It wasn't so serious as we thought.
"He wants to see you, Jack."
What are you going to say to him?
I wanted you... and I took you with us.
"Well, I'm keeping you."
Jack.
"You know I love you, don't you?"
"You couldn't doubt that, could you?"
"Just leave her alone, you bastard!"
Two containers.
One's tap water.
One's battery acid.
You have to choose.
That's the dare.
"No, I'm not going to."
Tell me who sent the postcard.
"- I don't fucking know, all right?"
"- Chris, I'm going to pick a tap."
"If you choose, Gemma's got a 50-50 chance of surviving."
If I choose... she's got absolutely none at all.
Now left... or right?
- You're a sick man.
You're psychotic.
"- Oh, come on, tough guy."
You can do it.
Pick one.
- You're a fucking psychopath.
- Who sent the postcard?
"If I knew, you really think I wouldn't tell you."
I don't know.
"Five seconds, Chris."
Five...
Four...
"Please, don't hurt her."
"Please, she hasn't done anything wro..."
Three.
I'll give you a hint.
I'm left-handed.
"Left-handed, left-handed."
Two...
I need legal help.
We have a suspect who's refusing a cheek swab.
I'll file for a dna search warrant.
What's the name?
Rebecca kemp.
I'll e-mail you the info.
Listen... yomiss working with us?
I think the legal department is more my speed.
"Why,do you miss me?"
"Uh,sure."
Boss... agent lee is getting us our cheek swab.
Rebecca paranoid or guilty?
Might just be angry.
"At finn,us,t world."
"Go back with her to h apartment,get finn's stuff."
"And,no,I don'want to wait for a search warrant."
I'll grab my coat.
Wait at the elevator.
Okay.
"Hey,you."
Where's my money?
"Yeah,you."
Did you and jimmy spend it?
Please get away from me.
I don't know you.
I am jimmy's fiancee.
James loved me.
- He used you.
- You liar!
Chick fight!
He loved me!
get off of me!
Why would you be doing that?
You got a really good face.
Bullshit.
Don't give me that.
"No, no, really."
You got some great character--
Who are you doing this for?
Seriously.
"Just for practice, just for the heck of it."
This is what I do.
"I sit here all day, and I draw--"
- You've been here all day?
- ...people as they come by.
"All day, yeah."
"And you draw other people, too."
"- Yeah, plenty of them."
- Let me see.
I can't because actually I gave them the pictures.
Would you like your picture?
- You'll give it to me?
- Absolutely.
Here we go.
All yours.
Enjoy.
Okay.
"Sorry about that, man."
You just never know.
- You know what I mean?
- It's not a problem.
- Enjoy it.
"- Okay, buddy."
I haven't stuttered once in over six weeks.
You're doing your other voice.
"Yes, love, did you notice?"
"Naughty, naughty children!"
RUN!
What do we do?
"Frannie, Frannie, imagine her melting."
What?
!
"In your head, melt her."
I can't!
I'm getting impatient!
You have been VERY naughty!
What about the man?
"You said the man was here, the cloud man."
"Well, he's not, is he?"
Where's the Doctor?
I don't know!
Doctor?
Doctor who?
That's the way to do it!
"Oi, Ow!"
Where did she go?
Will she come back?
"No, don't worry."
She's currently draining through your carpet.
"New setting, anti-freeze, and you're very welcome, by the way."
I'm very grateful.
I knew you'd come.
"No, you didn't, because I don't."
Because this isn't the sort of thing
I do any more.
"Next time you're in trouble, don't expect me to..."
Dammit!
"come on, get in the truck quick!"
Come on!
"Easy, easy, there's space for everybody!"
Quick!
women and children first!
"To the left, left!"
- They're not animals!
- Are you American?
"- Listen, Sgt..."
- You better get in.
I'll wait for the next.
"There are no more trucks, Madam."
We won't be back for quite a while.
- But you told them!
- Do as you wish.
We're leaving!
"You know, grappa?"
I could use some now.
"Hey, stop!"
Stop!
"Hello, gorgeous, wanna ride with us?"
A blonde!
Lets have a look!
- Not bad...
"- Not bad, really."
- Are you blonde all over?
Ask her if she wants some candy to suck on.
How about 8 inches of sugar cane?
I'll take care of that.
What's your name?
She's pretty.
"This is not being a halfwit, but a total wit!"
Oh!
Yoon Jae!
Seo Yoon Jae...
What's with you?
To skip work like this?
I couldn't reach you on the phone either all day.
Are you just getting in?
Are you sick?
-Ugh...something...
I'll come back...
-What's wrong with you?
Are you...
Really sick?
You really do look sick.
Mushrooms...
I accidentally had mushrooms.
Mushrooms?
How?
I bet you suffered some!
That's why...
I'm suffering a lot right now.
I'm going to get some rest.
Yoon Jae.
You still have...
"what I gave you awhile ago, right?"
Huh?
Oh...
That?
I gave it to you to use it at times like this.
Since we're close...
"Don't feel burdened, and do as I say, okay?"
I'm getting chills.
-I'm getting nauseous.
-I'm getting rich.
"Come on, I told you it's all an act."
There's nothing to it.
It's all fake.
See?
"This isn't real wood, it's fake."
[BELL RINGS OVER TV]
There's the bell and we're under way.
"Come on, Bull."
Come on.
-Pulverize him.
-Use your footwork.
He's not moving.
"[CROWD YELLING, BOOING OVER TV]"
"Come on, Bull."
Do something.
The Battling Bailiff has yet to come out of his corner.
-You're very calm about all this.
-It's all part of the act.
"No, this isn't in the script."
"Wait, wait, he's moving."
"I told you, it's a sure thing."
The only way I can lose is if he left the ring.
He's leaving the ring.
"Bull, what are you doing?"
I could have burned the money.
It would have been quicker.
It's that kind of performance that gives this game a bad name.

GHS]
They see here.!
Taking!
We are going to chain you.
"Away, cheater!"
"Old cheaters and putas, outside here."
It is necessary to denounce to him.
Also the other patients...
do not kill all.
"Lift up, lift up, still you are healthy."
You will already see tonight.
I do not hold more!
I do not hold more!
"Dr. Cicchirini, he has died."
"It doesnt matter, we put him inside and we take him to the morgue."
They have killed him.!
Assassins!
We will denounce to him.
We denounce to Dr. Cicchirini!
-Yes?
-Cicchirini?
-Dr.
Cicchirini.
-Police.
-Police?
-We have an arrest order.
An order?
For whom?
"We go, walks, you do not resist."
"We go, assassin."
Carrion.
"-But, I am Dr. Cicchirini."
We know
Go!
"I'm being removed from my own helicopter, ladies and gentlemen."
The first margarita's on me.
Not so fast.
Did you get it?
Did you?
Yes!
I want big!
I want cinematic!
I want...
I want Pennebaker.!
Get this.
Get the copter.
You smell that?
Do you smell that?
"Nothing else in the world smells like that, son."
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
You know one day we had a hill bombed.
"When I walked out, we didn't find one of them."
Not one stinking dink body.
But that smell.
That gasoline smell.
The whole hill.
It smelled like... victory.

Your father hasn't come yet!
It's time to play Kettledrum_
Hallelujah.
Auf Wiedersehen.
I'll see you around.
- You okay?
- Sure.
Is this what you really want?
Do I have a choice?
Molly?
"Molly, do you know where you are?"
You're in the hospital.
You were hit by a car.
We're taking very good care of you.
You like my ring?
"I know you're scared, but I'll stay with you."
We called your parents.
They'll be here very soon.
"Okay, let's extubate her."
Carter....
- What's her tidal volume?
-500 ccs.
Gases are good.
All right.
Excellent.
- We're gonna take this tube out.
- Squeeze my hand.
Make sure the cuff is down before you extubate her.
Good.
"Now, what I want you to do is pretend you're blowing out your birthday candles."
Take another big breath.
"When I say go, blow out real hard, okay?"
Go.
- Nice.
Uh...
"Thanks, big man."
It really looks beautiful.
I'm sorry about earlier.
Please don't smoke in the house.
Roman.
You want one?
No.
You know I promised Ryan.
What's that?
Paper?
It's cute.

I was doing something for my brother.
Oh yeah?
Am I gonna meet this brother of yours?
It's not likely.

My Mom would have loved you.
"Well, of course."
You said she had good taste.
"You know, you can't ever leave me."
No matter how bad a wife I am.
You're a perfect wife.
Liar.
- What?
What is that?
"My God, I think... that's a telephone line."
"Look, you just stay here and I'll be back as soon as I can."
All right?
I'll go see.
Hey!
"Hey, mister, can I use your phone?"
"Hey, who are you?"
- What are you doing?
- I'm a pilot that crashed.
Airplanes ain't safe.
Airplanes ain't dependable.
Look what happened to you.
Put that down.
That's railroad property.
"- Mister, I gotta eat something."
- Put that down!
You roach.
"It's been a home for me, man and boy, for 50 years."
They still got a place for me on the railroad.
"Mister, I got a kid who's hurt bad."
I gotta take her something to eat.
- Leave it be!
- I'll pay for 'em.
You drop 'em.
Now you get outta here.
Take it easy.
Just take it easy.
You know you ain't gonna make it.
Damn!
Edgar!
Dude was bite-size.
That's funny?
"- Whatever, bitch."
"- Hey, watch your mouth."
"Are you almost done, man?"
Why?
You in a hurry to go to jail?
We can check on Alma.
She's probably in Recovery by now.
"- That means she's okay, then?"
- No.
She could wind up paralyzed.
"- Like, all over or just her legs?"
- They' re not sure yet.
"Well, better if they just killed her, you know?"
An hour ago you were ready for revenge.
"Yeah, that was personal."
"It was about my name, honor."
- But paralyzed?
That blows.
- Just dress the wound with Adaptic.
"Hey, Luka."
"- Piece of work, huh?"
- Yeah.
And she's pregnant.
- Who?
- The girl.
Says it's his baby.
You want to tell him?
No.
Do you?
Not really.
- I wrote it.
- What?
In these couple of days?
"Yeah, I think it's pretty good."
These two pages.
How'd you finish so quickly?
Amazing.
Do you like it?
"Don't know, maybe tomorrow it'll look like shit to me."
But it all came within a few hours.
"Funny, huh?"
"It came out so easy, as if I were possessed."
"Yes, Director Kim."
How are you?
I'm home.
Are you still there?
How's your leg?
It still hurts.
I think I was afraid again.
I miss you.
"I'm sorry, too."
Honestly.
When are you coming back?
I think I liked you a lot as a movie director.
And I think you'll have a hard time because of me.
Please stop.
You think so?
Should I try to find someone here who resembles you?
Like you did?
"Yeah, why don't you."
Don't worry.
I won't.
-Yeah.
-Completely?
-Completely.
That gets me off.
You're easy.
No.
With you I am.
So do I get to...?
Do I get to work on you for a while or do we just fall asleep?
You can work on me all night long.
"I mean, you're with someone."
Why would I let myself fall in love with you?
"What, like I'm just an object to you?"
"I'm just, like, a piece of ass?"
-You just looking to get laid?
-Yeah.
Right.
"-God, you're like a girl."
"-Oh, thanks."
That's really flattering.
"Yeah, it is."
Maybe that's why I like you.
Are you having a sexuality crisis?
No.
I'm not having any kind of crisis.
"You're lucky, you know that?"
No.
I don't know that.
Why am I lucky?
You can control your heart.
"-Hey, thanks for coming out, Darla."
-Good night.
It's not your fault.
"Still, sorry."
"C'mon, Kim, you gotta pull it tight."
"You forgot this, too."
Where's the candy?
Candy?
Didn't bring one?
"We call condoms ""candies"" here."
Mom.
Mom.
Can you hear me?
What're you doing?
I'm back.
Hey.
I'll go to the immigration office the day after tomorrow.
"Don't worry, they won't detain me for overstaying."
It's not like I entered with a fake passport...
Thank you for calling Juicy Fruits.
"Yes, any girl in particular?"
Ilia?
"Sure, for how long?"
"One hour, got it."
"Yes, no problem."
- Ilia.
- Yes?
You have a booking.
Okay.
"Mom, I'll call you again when I'm about to depart."
"Yes, sorry about that."
I'll get more days off so I can train at the gym.
"Yes, thank you."
"Ilia, it's your last day?"
They did an in-service.
I got it.
"'Kay, let's take a look."
Sats down to 92.
- Turn on the suction.
- It's on.
"- No, it's not."
- I have it on high.
I'm not getting anything here.
"Inez, go next door and help Dr. Lockhart with the chest tube."
I'm not allowed to work with any of the nurses now?
The patient is paralyzed.
I can't see the cords.
- I need suction.
- Hold your horses.
Suction container wasn't sealed properly.
You're welcome.
Tube.
Found it.
Two units on the infuser.
Set up for a subclavian.
"Okay, bag him."
- End tidal CO2 is yellow.
- Yellow's good.
I'll be right back.
"All right, hook me up."
O-silk is next?
- O-silk.
Come on.
- Here you go.
And I want to auto-transfuse this guy.
You need a side collector on the thoraseal.
Get away.
"Give me, what I need now is this."
I'll go to the ladies!
She recovered even before putting it on!
Must be very potent?
Darling!
Wait for me here!
Don't go away. I'll go put some on.
Save some for me!

I'd never ask you to dance.
I feel like dancing with someone handsome!
Me?
"Sam, the record's stuck!"
"Watch it, don't get fresh!"
It's you who's getting fresh.
Damn you!
- l feel dizzy!
- Me too!
How much does Fat Pig pay you?
Such awful taste!
I had worse taste 3 years ago!
Fat Pig is a traitor.
You'd marry a traitor?
I know that what he did was wrong.
It was stupid and I was angry at him.
But you were his best friend.
You should've helped him.
You were a little girl then.
I'm a big girl now.
I gave him a chance and he blew it.
You liar.
He's the one who gave you a chance.
He made you thrive on stage and gave you the best parts.
He took you places you thought you'd never reach.
"He let you dance and sing, the best thing you ever did."
I loved your father and mother very much.
How can you even talk about love?
"Relax, it'll be easier if you relax."
My love.
We'll try again.
Help me.
- Okay.
Gently.
- Okay.
"Okay, never mind."
I can't.
"Never mind, my love."
I'll get some bandages.
"Tell me the truth, Daddy."
"What, Gonki?"
About Mommy.
Tell me about Mommy.
"Say it, Daddy."
Mommy is dead.
Say it again.
"Well, I said maybe, but... look at his pant cuff, Tony."
Is that a gun?
Could be.
We have guns.
Not Ellie.
Uh... she packed hers.
"No, actually, mine's on me."
"Well, I-I thought you said you weren't comfortable traveling with it."
"Well, I wasn't at first, but it's become kind of a habit."
"Listen, this guy could be law enforcement, so let's show him ours and ask to see his."
"What, guns?"
Badges.
Hey.
Sorry to bother you.
"Again, you mean?"
Yeah.
"Uh, but this time I need to see some I.D."
"Well, too bad."
I'm not Navy.
She asked you a question.
You're making a big mistake.
Freeze.
Hands where I can see them.
Oh.
Okay.
"Well, what's his deal?"
I'm an air marshal.
Mike Beers.
Thanks for blowing my cover.
"Sorry I drew on you, Mr. Beers."
These two kind of...
forced my hand.
"Sorry, it does that sometimes."
My wife got the good car.
"So, how you doing?"
"Well, Stan, we need to talk."
I know.
I can't do this anymore.
What?
"You're nice and sweet, Christine, but..."
I just don't think this is working out for me.
What?
Why?
"Well, you know, I haven't been around much, and..."
I think you just might be a little too fast for me.
Fast?
It's been three years!
I got a kid that goes to this school.
I got to think of my reputation.
Your reputation?
If anything...
I helped your reputation.
Giving some of this is the best thing that ever happened to you.
You did me.
You know it!
You made me a mix tape.
"Oh, my stomach hurts."
"Yeah, I would die."

Amariss
It's a great neighborhood.
Say it.
Let's go.
Everywhere.
Everywhere.
Even though-
Even though- We're scared.
We're scared.
'Cause it's life- It's life.
And it's happening.
"It's really, really happening... right now."
All right.
"Now let's kiss to make it real, okay?"
Okay.
"So, how is your art project?"
- Is it in the museum yet?
- No.
That's not how it works.
"You know, they have to know about your work-"
"I would just march in there and show it to them, you know?"
No one is going to live your life for you.
Okay.
"That's not how itworks, but okay."
"So, how's Ellen?"
"Oh, she's wonderful."
I can't sleep at night thinking about her.
I just wish I had met her 50 years sooner.
- Yeah.
- But then maybe I needed... 70 years of life... to be ready for a woman like Ellen.
This rug is dirty.
Everyone get a box on the way out.
Ow.
Ow.
Defend us in battle.
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil.
Where is she?
Where's Hyo-jin?
!
Hyo-jin!
What is it?
Where are you headed in the dark of night?
I'm asking you.
Where is my daughter?
Where is she?
Girl about this tall?
Yeah.
Hyo-jin?
That's right.
She's possessed by an evil spirit.
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He's trying to suck her blood dry...
Shut the fuck up!
"Answer me, bitch!"
Where is Hyo-jin?
- Have you seen the Jap?
- Where's my daughter?
"At your home, where else?"
She's not home.
She is.
She just got back.
Don't go now- or you'll all die.
"If you go now, your whole family will perish."
What are you talking about?
The Jap is waiting for you... to annihilate your family.
He's dead.
Drink.
Passports.
"Yes, I know,  but..."
If we had the passports
She would understand who we are.
"I repeat that he is our king, Nicolas III, king of Belgium."
What will we do about our king?
What did the Queen want us to grasp?
Its vitality...
And his spontaneity.
And smiles.
And smiles.
We need an official version of this story.
Why not the truth?
Ready?
His Majesty?
What a relief to hear his voice.
"Yes, he is here, right next to me."
"No, I mean, that's right..."
"There is Mr. Moreau over here, I take it."
Ready.
His Majesty?
"Yes...  yes, we're fine."
And you?
"I mean, kingdom?"
And the political situation?
"Yes, I understand..."
The king is fine.
We have a small problem.
"Yes, you too, I imagine..."
Excuse me if I stop...
"No, we are not in Istanbul."
This was not the job.
I got business to finish.
You stay here.
How do I get to the Oval Office?
Take the stairs to the ground floor..
you go to the end of the West Colonnade.
There's an air strike coming!
Get them out of here.
Go!
You heard the man!
Tour's over.
I didn't sign up for this nuclear bullshit.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna get the money myself.
Hey!
Hey!
What?
You think I put my country through this for money?
I hate mercenaries.
It's about time.
I choose the pen!
Come here.
Get up.
Up!
Put your hand..
Weapon system unlocked.
Enter presidential launch code.
"Mr. President, please wake up, wake up."
Please!
"Sir, we're at DEFCON 1."
The nuclear football in the White House went live.
That's impossible.
It's happening.
That was seven years ago.
I know.
"I'm trying, darling."
Did you see this?
Why are the drapes open?
"Kay, are you all right?"
-Are you hit?
-No.
It's all right.
Stop!
Stop!
Halt!
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.
-Keep them alive.
-We'll try.
Alive!
Stay by the door.
"Yeah, come in."
"-Mike, are you all right?"
-Yeah.
"There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom."
And I know that's upset you in the past.
You felt it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.
But it's because I admire you and love you that I kept things secret from you.
Now you're the only one I can trust.
Fredo?
"Well, he's got a good heart."
"But he's weak and he's stupid, and this is life and death."
"Tom, you're my brother."
"I always wanted to be thought of as a brother by you, Mikey."
A real brother.
Do you readme?
"Listen, we losthim on the bridge."
Right.
I got him.
He's headin' north on East River Drive.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
You take Sal.
I'll take the beard.
There goes Sal.
- You want the red or the white?
- Pour it in your ear.
"- Yes, sir?"
"- Yeah, guyjust walked in, what's his name?"
I'm pretty sure that one's a Frog.
"He made me, too."
"He lives on four, he went up to six."
"He's cute, real cute."
The other guy's a Frog.
He checked into the Edison.
Had a hooker sent up.
You should have collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How about Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
"Why don't you do the same, Doyle?"
You look like shit.
Come on.
"Look, my partner and I made this case, you know, originally."
- We don't want any feds screwing it up.
- Case?
Hi.
Who's Mrs. Frederic?
"I'd tell you, but then he'd have to kill you."
What do you think?
6th to constitution?
This time of day I'd take 9th.
"Yeah, you're right."
Want to grab a beer after we drop off these two jokers?
"Ah, I can't. in-laws are in town."
"Hey, hey, hang on."
I want to pull over
And grab a paper.
They'll be fine.
"Before you say anything,"
I know that I mangled this.
I know I ran in there impulsively
Without--without thinking--without my bag--
Because I had a bigger--someone dug you up.
Oh.
So you know.
It's Macpherson.
I'm right.
"Yes, I'm afraid you are."
Now it's up to you to stop him.
Thank you.
Don't move!
"So, Mr. Ogawa, when does he get here?"
"Oh, God."
It works.
"- Hello, Arthur."
- James.
Good to see you after all these years.
Water...
"Good, we'll continue with his regular injections."
"Are you responsible for him, Ms. Cappia..."
Cappam?
"Cappi, Professor."
The needle...
"May we give you a hand, Doctor?"
Yes!
Yes!
"Come, come... this may hurt a bit!"
Now everything's ready.
- All set.
"- Just relax, relax..."
He requires an emergency operation.
I can't tomorrow.
I'm too tired.
Then there's the weekend.
I'll operate on Monday.
What is it?
Who died?
You!
- It must have been you!
- No.
We didn't do it!
- It must have been you!
I'll...
"- One, two and three... in my office!"
We always take her with us.
It's a bad habit.
"Courage, Doctor."
Courage...
It's always the three of them who organize these pranks.
"- Yes, no, yes."
"- Come on, come on."
"Yes, yes, oh yes."
All right.
I've deliberated.
No retrial.
Order.
"I said, order!"
Order in this court.
There will be order.
"S-h-u- you know what, comrade?"
"I'm getting a little tired of spelling ""Shuckton."""
It's a little town with a big heart and it is really easy to spell.
"Well, I am trying to speak to the Mayor of Russia."
"What do you mean, you don't have a m..."
"Look, do you people want to rape our land or not?"
Rape.
Rape!
R-a- never...
You know what?
Never mind!
Travis!
That's my name.
I'm gonna need a power shake.
And by power shake you mean Martini.
Yes.
But I'm gonna call it a power shake.
"But it is still a quadruple Martini, right?"
Yes.
"Ah, I'm on it."
Prosecution calls it's witness.
"Thank you, your honour."
Right there.
Darren vogel.
That's enright's attorney.
"Yeah, vogel bought a pair of the cuff links"
A week before the murder.
Think that's a coincidence?
"Not a chance, eric."
Oh...
Looks like we've got some babysitters.
"Have a nice day, gentlemen."
"well, what are you doing?"
What...
What are you wearing?
"Get off the phone, please."
bunny?
Yeah.
"No, I'll buy it for you, I'll buy it."
Excuse me.
"Uh, I think we've got a prospective client here."
"Yes, I-I've got to go."
All right.
"Yeah, all right."
I'll see you at 7:00.
"Yeah, love you."
"Now, you boys know that my billing rate is $2,000 an hour."
But here's the good news:
I take euros.
We are not soliciting counsel.
We're here about the tony enright case.
Enright?
Come on.
"That's old history, isn't it?"
A small chill by the column?
"No, a great chill."
"In addition, one is going away to me to melt."
"-Then, it is very urgent."
-It is what I am saying to him.
And if Lella had to be late?
It would be a disaster.
Then I to me leave orders before she is too much behind schedule.
Mother mine!
In fact...!
I am going to eat you!
-A moment.
"Before, undress."
-you quiet...
How long you take in uninformed?
Ever since I was born.
By where one begins?
"Hey, Gloria..."
-Álvaro!
-Lella!
So that is your fiancee.
You pick in your subjects.
And what do you do here?
I had brought you an ice cream for your birthday.
What do you do dressed like this?
You seem one whore.
"Alvaro, I..."
What I do with this?
Not even I like.
To the devil!
Lella.
-By the way?
Yeah.
You seemed bored.
-I tried to be seductive.
-Other guys can see it.
One guy under a bridge.
He wasn't interested.
-Answer it.
-It's ok.
-Nothing's wrong.
-Answer it.
-It's ok.
-I said answer it!
Answer it and turn it off.
It bothers me.
I'm going to the bathroom.
-Yeah.
-Hey I'm at yoga place.
It's not at this time usually.
"Yeah, the trainer came home late last night."
Maybe she was drunk her ass off.
She loves drinking.
You don't have to hang up.
She isn't here yet.
Are you busy?
I guess I'll have to hang up then.
I got vaccine for German Measles.
They say I don't have the antibodies.
Doctor says that we have to use condoms for a month to 3 months at least.
It takes about that long for the antibodies to generate.
You have to do them.
I can't take pills.
-Hyang Gi.
"Okay, I'll meet you over there."
You got it.
Come on!
Didn't tell me it was this heavy.
Hey!
"Hey, what the fuck are you guys doin' in here, huh?"
"You got a problem, buddy?"
"Uh, no-no problem."
"No, you ain't got no problem, right?"
That's right.
"Just be cool, motherfucker."
"Yo, Bobby..."
"Yo, yo, come here, man."
Hold this one.
Come on.
"Now, I advise you two to take that beer out the trunk of your car."
"And I advise you, smiley, to put that knife away."
You advise?
That's a pretty big word for a nigger.
- Yeah.
"- Oh, fuck!"
[Grunting]
[Box cracking]
"You okay, buddy?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Well, let's get rid of these turkeys and clean up this mess, huh?"
- Hey.
- Hmm?
Thanks.
You okay?
"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, how do you feel about goin' to shoot some pool?"
"Yes, I think."
Thank you!
Thank you?
By words only?
Earlier your smile was beautiful.
Can you smile again?
I don't like to smile!
Really?
"You don't like to smile,"
- or you don't like me?
- Let go of me!
Let me go!
Let me drive you home.
Why do you keep bothering me?
Why?
"It's not bothering, it's love!"
"If I tell you that I don't like you, will you stop what are you doing?"
What you do is not love!
Didn't I tell you that I have a boyfriend already?
So what?
"As long as I like you, I will make you fall in love with me!"
Xiamu...
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
- Are you allright?
- I'm allright!
Did you get injured?
Don't come near Shu Yawang anymore!
"I come near to her,"
- so what?
- I'll kill you!
Don't you believe me?
You want me to show you?
What are you looking at?
Don't you know me?
I'm Mousy!
I'm a fighter!
You're filthy!
And you have a bad attitude!
"You see good people, and you bully them!"
"You see bad people, and you fear them!"
My big sister's no coward!
"If we don't get the money, we'll come after you!"
"Mousy, who are you shouting at?"
- Him.
- Who's he?
He's me and I'm him.
Useless bum!
Where's the money you collected today?
I collected more laundry.
- Here.
- More business as well.
Your shirt looks dirty.
Take it off for a wash.
It's OK to be dirty.
- Take it off!
- No need!
Where's the money?
Where's the money you collected today?
Ah Fook's house has a fierce dog.
Ah Sao says he's got no money.
Big Mouth shouted at me.
I didn't collect any money.

Clean this up and go to your room!
You are not our mother.
Go to your room!
Show us your birthmark.
- Enough!
- Show us your birthmark.
I'm tired of this.
"Anything else, perhaps?"
I want you to repeat ten times that I'm your mother.
- Open up!
- Say it.
- You're my mother.
- More convincing.
You're my mother.
Look at me.
"You're my mother, you're my mother ..."
Harder.
You're my mother.
Stop this nonsense!
I'm not playing anymore.
Understood?
There is only one breakfast and one set of clothes.
Hi Zeke.
Hello young lovers.
I got to get back to class.
See you back in class...
Striktly hands of Bro.
"Zeke, I wouldn't do that."
She's just my friend.
You wouldn't?
That's what best-buds do don't they?
Yeah!
I can think about a dozen times...
-
I have been the best friend you ever have.
"Saved your ass, lie for you, stolen for you."
"Zeke, I am telling you."
Nothing is going on.
So we are on the same page?
Yeah.
"Ok, come on, let's hang out."
I steal 6 packs of beer how does that sound?
"Tonight, me and you we are going to the movies."
Leo is in a new movie.
You got to see it.
"I can't, I have to work tonight."
Why do you work in that awful place?
"I need the money, I have to save up to college."
"Alright, whatever."
I ask Mimi to go with me.
"Ok, see you later."
Bye!
All hands on deck.
Jake?
"I think you hit it again, sir."
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"Ready when you are, Mr. Fowler."
Be right there.
"Oh, sir, if you didn't think I was gonna be in the way,"
I would love to...
No.
Not at all.
Be my guest.
"Oh, thank you very much, sir."
I appreciate that.
"Excuse me, sir."
"I don't wanna appear grabby, but do you think I could have one of these, sir?"
Certainly.
As many as you want.
That's the usual publicity nonsense.
"Ward Fowler this, Ward Fowler that."
Nothing.
"Nothing to you sir, but to my wife..."
"Boy, she's gonna be tickled pink."
(CLEARS THROAT)
But blend it on.
All right.
No.
"I mean blend it, especially on this side."
"Oh, I see."
All right.
Like that?
I can't tell.
"Oh, am I in the way, sir?"
"Oh, forgive me."
- But he's coming this way.
- [Tia] who is he?
- [muscles] our worst enemy.
- He's worse than the goons.
"[Rocky] he's Mr. Yokomoto, the truant officer."
He's trying to make us go back to school.
[dazzler] let's go.
[all] yeah!
That's our hideout.
[stairs creaking]
[Tia] when do the ghosts get here?
[Rocky] don't say things like that.
This place could really scare ya.
[gasps]
Come on.
This is where we're gonna live when we run away from home.
"Yeah, you can't be tough"
If you take orders from your mom or older sister.
That's why we quit school.
"You can't be tough and educated, too."
[crusher] yeah.
- Tony!
- [boys] where?
I had a contact with him.
You...
You calling on the spirits?
Shh.
- She's weird.
- She's creepy.
I...
I ain't too sure I wanna meet this Tony.
Shh!
- Good.
"Sifu, there's a tailor outside... to make your birthday robe."
- What?
He said he wanted to make a new robe for you.
Ask him in.
BIRTHDAY ROBE TAILOR
I thought you were the tailor Thao.
Thao has gone back to his village.
"Sifu Wong, can I take your measurements?"
OK.
"If you wear what I make for you, you'll look good."
"Why don't you make one for yourself, too?"
"- Front chest, 24 inches."
Strong torso.
- Thank you.
"Arm, three feet."
What sleeve do you want?
Literati style.
"Sleeve width, six inches."
Two feet split.
"Height, five feet."
1.8 for the shoulder.
"Waist, 30."
Do you need a nail to take measurements?
A button was loose.
I was trying to fix it.
"Oh, thank you."
Any time.
Let me measure your neck.
"Collar height, two inches."
- Are you done?
"- If you'd stayed still, I'd have finished."
"Don't worry, Goni."
They'll be leaving soon.
"Mr. Ben-Shmuel,"
I'd like you to come down to the station with me.
Now?
"- Yes, now."
I don't want you to go.
I'll just go for an hour.
"Finish the bookshelf, then go through the house."
He'll stay here to finish.
Sorry for the disturbance.
Alex?
The police came and took Yitzhak.
I don't know.
- Detention center-
Will Daddy come home with us?
"I don't know, Goni."
Is it because of the policemen who came to the house?
- Yes.
What did they find?
- I don't know.
Then why did they take him?
Did he do something wrong?
"No, he didn't."
"Always remember that, Goni."
When will Daddy come home?
"I don't know, Goni."
He said he'd be back in an hour.
They took him to ask questions.
Are they allowed to?
- Yes.
Can we spend Saturday with him?
You can use these for the posterior.
"Let's face it ladies, what man doesn't like a little ""junk in the trunk""?"
So...
"What do you say, girls?"
Who wants to be bootylicious?
I think I'm bootylicious enough.
Whoo.
Uh...
Hi.
Excuse me.
Um...
I'm meeting someone here.
The reservation is under Elise Lacey.
Oh.
Hi.
Your date's waiting for you.
Follow me.
"Oh, really?"
Is he normal?
- I wouldn't exactly say normal.
- Really?
You must be Kitty.
That's very good.
Thanks.
"I'll be back to tell you about specials in a minute, senator."
Thank you.
I never would've figured you for a silent treatment type.
I'm not giving you silent treatment.
I'm considering how I can tell you off without losing my job.
- You're angry.
- Yes!
Yes.
"It was dad who said if I was gonna go, I should stay gone."
Your brother and me -- we needed you.
"You walked away, Sam."
- You walked away!
"- Stop it, both of you."
"You're the one who said, ""don't come back,"" dad."
"You're the one who closed that door, not me!"
This is never the life that I wanted for you.
"Look, I'm sure dad would have been here if he could."
She's such a slut.
So?
"Personally, I'm very pro-slut."
"What happened, anyway?"
"She totally banged Jamie Jaffe, that's what."
She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.
"Hi, Taylor."
How was your weekend?
"Fine, I guess."
You didn't... go to the rodeo?
That's my spot.
Sorry.
This is a skeev-free zone.
Slut!
Slut!
Slut!
Slut!
You shouldn't listen to those jerks.
Leave me alone.
I just mean...
"I'm sorry, that's all."
You?
You're sorry?
I saw it like five times.
Where's the love?
"Right on, let me get two apple chickens and some pecan waffles."
"Nothing for me, I--"
"I had, like, four hot dogs this morning."
"Eat, Lemon."
Eat!
I hate skinny women.
"Hey, Lorna."
Ten beers.
"So, Tracy, we should talk about the show."
"Yeah, I ain't doing it unless I can get to do it my way."
"You know, I want it to be raw."
HBO-style content.
"Well, it's not HBO."
It's TV.
And I don't think that it's a good fit--
"You know, cause I wanna drop truth bombs."
You know how pissed off I was when Us Weekly said that I was on crack?
That's racism.
I'm not on crack.
I'm straight up mentally ill!
Sure.
I got mental health issues.
"Sure, well, you know..."
"Who doesn't, really?"
"Hey, has anyone seen Liz?"
Or Pete?
She went out.
"Well, who's in charge when they're not here?"
I'm in charge.
Oh.
"Yes, of my aunt, by the one of the rent."
"One does not worry about the rent, we can reach an agreement."
That is what worries me.
By the way.
"It has called a friend of yours, a certain Sandro."
"He has said that it is very urgent, must call to him immediately."
I have pointed its number here.
-I can use your telephone?
"-Please, you can use everything you want."
-The hand.
-It pardons.
"yes, whats up."
"Benito, you must save me, you must help me."
My belly.
What?
Higher speech.
I do not hear you.
"I need the wee-wee the 22, the one of Sandokan, is urgent."
What?
wee-wee?
wee-wee?
!
Why I serve the wee-wee to you?
Wee-wee Why I serve to you?
For the analyses.
It dates haste.
Disgusting.
"Ah, for the analyses."
"The 22, Sandokan."
"Yes, in agreement."
Sandro.
Sandro.?
Is she my daughter?
Of course not.
She is mine and Jørgen's.
What were you thinking?
- Is she my daughter?
- I'll call tomorrow.
- I asked you a question!
- I'll call you tomorrow!
Won't you come to bed?
"- Why did you do it, Jørgen?"
- Do what?
"I didn't know it was him, Helene."
It's just too much of a coincidence.
- He shouldn't have come.
- No.
But we can't control everything in the world.
"Hi, it's 602 again."
Do I have any messages now?
Fine.
Thanks.
- That's nice.
- Let me have a look?
- It's got small swastikas on it.
- They're not swastikas.
It's wonderful.
It's from...
- It's from Allan and Kristina.
- One of our really good lawyers.
"He'll be fired for giving such an ugly vase, right?"
- Put it over there.
- It goes in the basement.
I have to talk to Helene.
Where is it...?
Where is it...?
Show me!
- ...
"Jesus Christ, dude...!"
- ...
What...?
You explain that to his mom...
That's okay...
"She's not going to tell her mom on us, is she...?"
"She fell down on the playground, that's all..."
Right?
Right...?
"Say it, little girl..."
"Say it... come on, dude..."
Let's go...
I fell down...
...On the playground.
"Well you have to be more careful, Okay honey?"
I don't like to see my baby hurt...
Bless us o Lord and these thy gifts... and protect us from evil
"look , I made one for you, and one for me"
Are you reading this?
"It's for school, it's boring c'mon, look...!"
It's so cool...!
We can talk to each other...!
Through the wall...!
Can you hear me through the wall?
...Only sometimes..
Did you hear anything the other night...?
why was your dad so mad...?
Where's your mom...?
"It was a hard thing for her to go through, but she's one in a thousand."
No one else will ever be like her.

2000 AD Summer
"We couldn't have known how important, ...that summer would turn out to be."
Until that day...
"Hey, wait up!"
"Toshi, slow down."
I'm the boss.
Slaves follow!
That's not fair!
Don't run.
Watch out for gopher holes!
I still can't believe it.
"Shut up, will you?"
"Fell right in, and bumped your head."
Weren't you gonna warn me?
No!
"You saw us jump, yeah?"
You should've figured it out.
"Let's finish this, ...or we'll miss the campfire."
What's that?
"Toshi, wait!"
- He's always like this.
- Don't leave us!
Ouch.
Yusuki?
Misaki?
You scared me.
Chah Bahar targeted.
Confirm Chah Bahar.
Go!
"Leave, leave, leave!"
"No, no!"
Not without my dad!
"Go, go, go!"
Your little bitch says you're gonna put me in jail!
"Come on, Martin."
This isn't you.
You protected presidents for the past 25 years.
What are you gonna do?
You really gonna shoot me?
All right.
Yes.
He deserved it.
You killed him!
Get back.
Get over here.
Get in the room or I'll knock you out!
And do as you're told.
"Go on, sit down!"
I'm gonna carve my name on your chest!
"No jail for you, you little bitch!"
No!
No!
Get it off!
There was an enormous explosion in the vicinity of the West Wing.
A huge ball of flames has burst into the sky.
It'sgotto be morethan100feet..
"Raptor Alpha 1, you are clear."
"Delta 26, copy that."
Kuya!
Wait!
That's just the remains of a previous experiment.
It's not someone you should be fighting.
"Hey, lemme know, if you're gonna be reckless like that!"
No way!
I see...
But remember the Von Dinosaur incident...
Proceed with extreme caution.
"Yes, of course."
"If you'll excuse me, sir."
"Now, we're fully prepared..."
"The world will now see the almighty power of the States, and realize who will lead the world!"
Is it going to take her away?
Cover her!
I won't allow you to take Manami!
Damn...
"Take me, too!"
More to come...
More to come...
More to come...
More to come...
No...!
Wh...
What?
Kuya!
You okay?
Yes...
Let's get the hell out of here!
Keep going!
Keep going!
Keep going!
Pen perfect?
It's not worth it.
What do you think?
It's not very good.
It's very...
Buckley.
It's not your fault in there.
Really isn't.
I better go home.
So...
Exterior train station.
"A full moon, a clear sky."
A man sits by the shore.
There has been a quarrel.
A woman is walking away from him.
Now she turns back.
I didn't mean what I just said.
And anyway...you said worse.
Hm.
Declaration...
Stupid bloody fool's good.
Did you think of that beforehand?
Are you trying to put a fight with me Mrs.Cole?
"No...what I'm trying to say is that, if all of this stopped."
"The sparring and the jibing, and the insults and the arguments."
I'd miss it.
Even if I were dead.
I'd still miss it.
The Catrin Cole school of dialog.
On and on and on and on and on.
Lose half.
Which half?
- Whose money are you using?
"- Yours, thank you very much."
But our money belongs to us again.
What's the idea?
Remember our bet?
"You see, you didn't get married."
- I'll pay you later.
- No.
All aboard!
- But I've got to get that train.
- You mean you had to get it.
"You know, you didn't win that lucky quarter."
I'll flip you for a ticket to New York.
I don't want to go to New York.
He doesn't want to go to New York.
"Goodbye, Lucky, old boy."
So long.
"- Goodbye, Lucky."
- See you later.
"Give my regards to the folks, will you?"
Say hello to Aunt Lucy.
So long.
"Goodbye, Lucky."
"Lucky, here's your suitcase."
Here's your toothbrush.
"Boy, I'd give my life for a smoke."
"- Well, take the quarter."
"- No, sir, not the lucky one."
Wait a minute.
I'll get a smoke.
"I beg your pardon, have you got a match, please?"
Thank you.
I love vinegar.
"So, your office is in Peel House?"
I've got clients on the fourth floor.
My office is just across the square.
We're on the first floor
- Stanley Brothers.
Pop in some time.
Pauline loves a visitor.
"Right, I shall."
I shall pop!
Please...
Are you Jimmy Baker?
Yeah...
Is your mother in?
"No, she's at her other job."
"Oh, right."
"Well, how are you doing?"
Have you been out playing?
"Singing, I'm in a choir."
"I sing, with a dance band."
We've been on the wireless.
So I've actually sung on the wireless.
"I gave you a rubber ball once, do you remember?"
You would have been about three.
"It was a big, coloured ball."
Have you not still got it?
I had better go in.
Hang on a minute.
I'm off to Canada.
Pastures new...
As they say.
Have you heard that?
"- with $20,000..."
- Wait.
Wait.
"Seriously, wait."
Wait.
Wait.
What if I go and get the watches out of the locker?
No one's looking for me.
We can... we can fence them and then we have the money.
We can do whatever we want.
"We can go wherever we want, right?"
We could change our identities and go to Tallahassee.
So you... you want to steal the watches to help me with get away with stealing the watches?
Yes.
That is exactly what I want to do.
I can't let you risk everything...
I love you.
"I love you, too."
You think you can do it?
I know I can.
You ready?
Yeah.
(Rhythmic crashes)
(Growling)
(Thunderous footsteps approaching)
(Grunts)
(Growling and thrashing)
"Oh, damn it."
Oi!
Hey!
You big git!
(Growls softly)
How can we go anywhere?
"- You're not dating her, then."
- I went to her house and...
- That's not dating.
- Have you gotten anywhere yet?
- No.
- I would have dug in the first 20 minutes.
"- Shut up, man."
- Dude.
"- Anyway, she invited me to a skate party Saturday night."
- It's a rich kids' party.
- Yeah.
"- Oh, yeah."
- This is nice.
Like it?
- Yeah.
- What is this?
250?
- Yes.
- How much?
- Way too much.
That's how much.
- I like it.
"- My mom's making chocolate cake tonight for Tim's birthday, if anyone wants to come over."
- I can't.
My parents want to have some bullshit big talk.
That sucks.
- I thought that Tim and your mom broke up.
- She took him back.
Fucking dick.
Treats her like crap.
Remember that one time when your mom kicked him out of the house?
Call yourself an eligible suitor for our fair Griselda?
You're a vagrant!
"Hold him, Madge."
Hold him!
You leave her alone.
Leave her alone.
Go on!
"Someone at the door, dear."
- We must make up our minds.
- Gentlemen!
- We can't delay.
- Let's do something.
This king's champion must be stopped.
The monster must be protected.
"If he kills the monster, we'll all be ruined."
Let me prevail upon you.
No more argy-bargy is necessary because I have a plan.
Behold!
The Black Knight.
Wonderful!
We must be getting closer.
Grease.
Grease.
Now that.
Get him.
And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
"Come to my arms, my beamish boy"
"- Oh, frabjous day!"
- The monster's dead!
The monster's dead!
Stop!
No one's to enter the city unless they have money.
You must work faster than this.
Okay.
Day 3
"Isn't this going overboard, bro?"
Your body might fall apart.
It's okay.
I've been up for 5 days before.
Kai.
I'm really thankful that you told me to work.
It really works.
Shit.
My head is so heavy.
Day 4
Yoon.
You accepted the job from Peng?
Yeah.
You know the scale of that job is 2 months of work.
You've only got 2 weeks.
And you accepted it!
Yeah.
You know even though I...
"I didn't screen it, you should have known better."
Why did you take it?
Peng always takes advantage of people.
You're the only one who looks up to him.
You know when he said that you're the first person he thought of.
He lied!
You know that?
"At least someone thinks of me, Je."
"Thought of you, that's f*cked up."
He only cares about his job.
So he sweet talked you into taking this job.
"Are you a robot, too?"
Yeah.
"I started to rust here, but Ohji fixed me."
"I'm usually prettier than this, but you caught me at a bad moment."
Because the Ruin's begun.
What is the Ruin?
"Is it going to happen to me, too?"
"Man, I don't know what's going on!"
"But, you really are beautiful, mister."
You aren't all beat up like me.
You're like a human!
"I have to get back, or else Ohji will be worried!"
Ohji will be worried!
Ohji will be worried!
Bye-bye!
I don't think you're beat up.
I don't.
You can have this.
It's the prettiest one I've ever found.
It'll keep you safe.
Thank you.
"Just now, that was..."
Luna...
Ringo!
"Humans will perish, just like us."
I'm a robot.
A robot kid?
I can't stand kids!
They have that new kid smell!
The world's on its way to Ruin!
It doesn't need any goddamn kids!
Die.
You're late.
The other bidders were hoping you wouldn't show.
I'll be happy to disappoint them.
- Sweetie?
- Yes sir.
- Stay close.
- Thanks.
See you later. 9:00.
Red eleven.
I'm approaching the cabin.
It's 5250.
Angels?
The signal's jammed.
Somebody doesn't want us listening.
Angels?
You're cutting it a little close.
I'm not here for the company.
I'm here to place my bid.
Are you sure your employer's prepared
- ...to compete in the big leagues?
- You'll see.
Welcome.
Business is for tomorrow.
Tonight...
A toast.
To the most beautiful flower in the world.
Salud.
Na zdorovie.
None of you have met my boss...
But he's successful because he's risk-averse.
That's why you all have been drugged.
The first thing to go is muscle control.
Yeah.
"Uh, yeah, this is much better than watching Damon visit Cougar Town."
- No offense.
- Don't remind me.
I've always wanted to see this place.
"Yeah, I guess it's a bit much."
Heh.
"Yeah, my entire house could fit in here, like, twice."
I feel like I've been here before.
It's weird.
Do you guys wanna watch a movie or something?
These are great.
That's just a little hobby of mine.
I did the entire Mustang series when I was 9.
- You like cars?
- That's an understatement.
Come with me.
"So the thing about cherries, you have to..."
Mm-mm.
"Oh, my goodness."
That's amazing.
You were quick.
And that would be my cue.
You're giving up already?
"Oh, yeah."
"See you, guys."
"Prepare yourself, my friend."
"Whoa, wait."
How do you have this?
It got passed down through the family.
Why don't you?
I mean...
"No, come on."
Already?
[Laughs]
Whoo!
"Now, do me a favor."
I want you to move around with her a little bit.
See if she's worth a shit.
Come on.
"Aye, aye, captain."
This is a fucking good burger.
Did you make this?
I'm on break.
How did you find me?
"Mm, girl's got to eat."
One of mine saw you here and told me.
Ahh.
"I'm not here for you, love."
Don't worry.
What do you want?
"A couple of my girls got picked up and started talking to the cops, saying my name, talking about my business."
I've never said anything.
"I know, Chris."
"That's why you're still here enjoying your new life, spending time with your sons."
The other girls aren't so lucky.
Anyway.
"Point is, if the cops do show up asking you questions,"
I hope you forget my name.
"Of course, Terry."
I'd never say anything.
Sure.
I know you wouldn't.
Ah.
Promise you'll do it.
Not until you tell me what's going on.
"Okay look, just get out of your apartment."
Turn off your cell phone.
I'll call you at the inn as soon as I can.
Go now.
Okay.
Tell Julia I love her.
Mama?
Right.
Who's Julia?
She's my daughter.
You were married.
Kyra's a friend of mine.
We both wanted a child.
I want you to tell me the truth.
About what?
"You, me, what happened in Berlin."
"I told you, we worked together."
Don't.
"The memories are fading, I can feel them disappearing."
I wanna know the truth while it still matters.
Please.
You were studying in Washington.
I was assigned to recruit you.
You seduced me.
It was part of the job.
Why me?
We knew you could help flip Kozlenko.
Who am I?
What is my name?
Kozlenko.
All I know is how to sit down and order a meal.
Not for you.
Just a place to hang.
The chef is great.
The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do?
Shoot him?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.
please.
Know anything about the restaurant business?
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.
he could be a stool.
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?
please.
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.
Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.
he goes to Paulie.
he goes to Paulie.
Tommy hecallsPaulie.
But now he has to pay Paulie everyweekno matterwhat.
Then the sword might not even work.
"And if it doesn't, the guy's going to come looking for it."
We are in a race.
We're in a race.
You two have to find what happened to that tsuba and fast.
"Well, Artie, we're looking for a 500-year-old sword."
800.
Exactly.
So it should be easy.
You guys follow the tsuba.
I will follow--
Ah...the implosion grenade.
And one of us will find the thief.
W--wait.
"I mean, wh--wh--where are you going?"
Somebody is making new grenades.
Somebody who promised not to.
Again he doesn't answer.
And no good-bye.
This is impossible.
Keep at it though. you're the smart one.
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
You're--you're doing great.
- Hello.
"- Leena, hey."
"Hey, is--is Claudia there?"
"Okay, she won't be able to find it either."
Claudia's out.
It's just me.
"Oh, my."
"You have got a present for mommy, don't ya?"
You need a diaper change?
- I'll do it.
- All right.
You have at it.
- Go see auntie Nic.
"- Okay, baby."
Who's the best baby?
Not in your mouth.
Not in your mouth.
"Ooh, that's yucky."
Wait.
"Oh, gotcha!"
"It's okay, baby."
"Auntie Nic's not really a baby person after all, is she?"
"Okay, I know-- oh, not a ""baby person""?"
Then what's this?
"Oh, well, I mean, honey, of course you're a baby person."
It just takes practice.
That's all.
Maybe she just doesn't like to have her diaper changed.
"Oh, no."
She doesn't.
"None of them do at this age, but you'll learn all that."
"Actually, you'll just get a nanny, and she can deal with all that stuff."
Okay.
There we go.
We're all better now.
- What?
"- Thank god for nannies, right?"
"I'll make sure to get one that's a ""baby person."""
"Night, hon."
Sorry!
- Trauma.
"- No problem, I just have to hurry."
How come?
- Don't get upset.
- Why would I be upset?
I need to clean for...
Sandy?
There's a real estate agent coming by first thing in the morning.
I need more milk.
A...
A real estate...
"OK, I give."
Why?
I was going to tell you on the way home.
To value the townhouse.
Value?
I just want to see how much it's worth.
- I know what value means.
"- I'm not selling, it would just be good to know in case."
- You're going to be in Dallas...
- I told you I'd pay my share!
- It's too big for me and Maya.
- It's only a contract!
You don't know that!
And it might be nice to be close to Mom.
Mom?
"Yeah, in case I need help."
"Sandy, Mom dropped Maya on her head."
It was an accident.
"Mel, you can't just go and make changes like this..."
You're not the one who disappeared.
You would've had to have been there in the first place.
"No, not Artie."
"Oh, all your--all your secrets,"
"And your--and your treasure hunts,"
And that damned place.
"You know, James believed in life."
You need to get one.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Carol.
Carol.
Carol.
Could you please--please.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
- What?
- Listen.
Listen.
Listen.
"Carol, if you're harboring him in any way,"
You're in danger.
What are you doing here?
Just about to ask you the same thing.
Why are you bothering that poor woman and torturing yourself?
It is called investigating a case.
This isn't the case.
This is self-pity.
The case is the implosion grenade
And the sword.
And someone out there is running around
Anyone called me?
"Oh, daughter, the veggie caviar worked out real good, with a soul to it!"
- I asked you:
Did anyone call?
- I can't hear you for all that music!
"Ira, I beg you, turn that stupid music off!"
Stop it now!
Go to your room!
I'm sick and tired of all this!
All right!
What's the matter?
My little baby...
"Nina, why is she like that?"
Like what?
A normal city child.
They're all like that in kindergarten.
They got a load of things to do.
I asked you:
Did anyone call me?
"- Well, did they?"
- I had no time to tell.
Someone did.
What's wrong?
Have you lost something?
Have you?
- Someone called?
- Yes.
It was embarrassing.
"I took it up, they say nothing."
"I yelled, then someone says politely:"
This is Ghena.
"And then he asks, you know:"
"Yeah, but my dad was only 12."
"Well, if I was older, do you think that I would make a very good husband?"
"If you were older, I think you'd make a wonderful husband."
I'll be back when I'm 25.
Will you wait?
That's a long time to wait.
It won't be as long as you think.
Now don't move.
I'll be right back.
Nancy?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What are we fightin' about?
I don't know.
I guess I do.
I'm jealous.
Of Wilbur?
He's only 14 years old.
He is?
"Well, how old did you think he was?"
"Oh, much older."
"I mean, he's very mature for 14."
I thought he was at least 15.
"Oh, Bob, you're so silly."
(CLEARING THROAT)
Now let's see.
"""Nancy, I know I'm not very much,"""
"""but I am old enough."""
"""And I couldn't love you any more if I were 100 years old."""
"No, that's no good."
"""Nancy, honey, if you marry me,"""
"""I'll be the happiest, luckiest man in the whole world."""
But it's...
"Look at it, it's..."
"Go on, say it, most people do."
It's smaller on the outside!
"OK, that is a first."
Is it magic?
Is it a machine?
It's a ship.
A ship?
Best ship in the universe.
Is there a kitchen?
Another first.
"I don't know why I asked that, it's just..."
I like making souffles.
Souffles?
!
Why are you showing me all this?
"You followed me, remember"
- I didn't invite you.
You're nearly a foot taller than I am.
You could've reached the ladder without this - you took it for me.
Why?
I never know why.
I only know who.
What's this?
Me.
Giving in.
I don't know why I'm crying...
I do.
"Remember this - this right now, remember all of it."
"Because this is the day, this is the day, this is the day everything begins."
Clara!
Mama!
Calm down.
This was a bad idea.
Hop out.
"Good for you, Jay."
It has to be when he is ready.
- Nope.
He's driving.
- What?
- What?
I-I can't.
- You're doing it now.
"Jesús, take the wheel."
He's terrified to be in the back.
Now you're gonna put him in the front seat so that he can kill all of us?
!
Can you not make this fear worse?
I watched Dede coddle Mitchell when he was afraid of the dark.
"Till he was seven, he'd only blink one eye at a time..."
Gave a lot of girls a very wrong idea.
"Manny, you don't want to do this right?"
"No, I really don't."
"Okay, papi, you know what?"
Let's switch.
I'm going to drive.
"I've got a bombshell, mom."
"Ay, papi, thank you, but this is a very weird thing to say when we're in this position."
"No, I've decided I'm never driving."
Uh... unh-unh-unh-unh!
No way.
You there.
You there.
What are we going to do with everyone ?
People are scared.
They'll get hungry.
And what about looters ?
We just have to get organized.
"Also, keep the radio on and gather up anything you think might be useful... flashlights, blankets, water, batteries, you'll be fine."
I can't get through to either of the boys.
"Well, keep trying."
How about you ?
We should get you to the hospital.
"I'm fine, it's just a bump on the head."
Mine.
Not his or hers.
Hello.
"Ryan, where are you ?"
They're at the Cooper house with Taylor.
Tell him to stay there.
Okay.
"Just stay there, okay."
All right.
Seth ?
"Hey, Dad."
"Yeah, yeah, we're okay."
I wish I could say the same for Ryan's car though.
How's Mom ?
Mm-hmm.
And Ryan ?
Ryan and Taylor are at your house.
"Yeah, sounds good, we'll do that."
"All right, take care."
Found a flashlight.
I can see that.
* The clothes that you wear
* Baby even your kiss was never like this *
* I'm in love all over again.. *
[tires screeching] [people chattering]
Here they come.
That college gang is here.
Half strength on all their drinks.
[indistinct chatter]
* I'm in love all over again *
- Ted.
- Get me my secretary.
"- Ah, here you are, Molly."
- Hail maestro!
"- Hello, Jane."
How are you?
- Fine.
"- Your show was grand, Doug."
- Did you like it?
You've certainly produced the best musical done at college.
I had a great gang.
How about a dance later?
- Certainly.
- I'll be over.
- You beautiful thing...
- Uh-uh.
Okay.
* Aah I'm in love
* All over again I'm in love *
* All over again
* Tell me what did you do You're better than you *
* I'm in love all over again *
* Got a trick
- Do you have many rooms?
"- Yeah, we do."
Do you need one?
"- Yes, maybe."
- We have many.
"I'll think about it, and come back later."
Let's go.
I'm going back to Seoul.
You are?
Why?
It's too quiet here.
Don't think I'll be able to write in this lonely place.
Makes sense.
"Okay, let's go together."
"Yeah, let's."
Hwasung Rest Area
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.
Over there.
- Hello.
"- Potatoes, large size, please."
"It's 2,400 Won, sir."
Director Kim.
You know I once lost my father in a rest area like this.
You did?
There was this little stream behind a building like this one.
"I was there, but no one knew."
They went crazy searching for me.
My dad really scolded me for that one.
Let's see each other in Seoul.
Don't strain yourself for me.
"No, don't say that."
"Excuse me, sweetheart."
So here you two are!
You're my friend.
You saved my life.
You get to wear my crown.
You are my friend
I'll be forever loyal
And you are my destiny
Franzie... dear Franzie.
"What is it, snookums?"
I can't make heads or tails of this stuff.
"Franz, how about we get away from this place?"
Why?
I've got money I can lend you.
Why?
Things are fine here.
You sent all the guys off.
Now we're short tonight.
We've got a first-class replacement.
Who?
I see.
Mr. Peep Peep.
A most respectable man... who'll soon be chirping a different tune.
Let's move out to the suburbs.
Come in.
"Miss Cilly, there's a man here to see you."
I just look at tax forms and I'm lost.
Reinhold says to tell you we need ―
You know.
He wants Franz to stop by.
Well?
Reinhold sent word to go see him.
Robbie.
Ease off.
You started this dance.
"He was stupid, you were stupid."
"Come on, let's just forget it and get out of here."
Come on.
"Thanks, Sonny."
"Forget it, man."
That's what I'm here for.
"Hey, I don't want to see you guys in here again."
"Yeah, we love you, too."
"Forget it, Annie."
You don't wanna be in the music business.
It's a jungle.
Exotic dancing ain't exactly the United Nations.
Neither is stripping.
I got a great set of pipes.
"Really, I do."
I agree.
But can you carry a tune?
"# Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?"
#
# My friends all have Porsches #
# I must make amends ##
"I need a singer, not a stripper."
I'll have my agent call you.
Sometimes it helps them if you pat them on the fanny.
"Oh, yeah?"
Thanks.
You got a baby?
"Well, in a manner of speaking."
His name's Noogie and I'm married to him.
I would have missed it myself.
Oh!
Umm...
"Spitfires, Sammy?"
It's in the pocket.
Pocket.
Ah!
Thank you.
Oh!
When can we expect to see you back at the screen Mr.Hilliard?
When indeed.
"Well, apparently Baker films have a done post-script in the works."
Hm?
"Apparently, you will be in here."
They want a title.
We haven't started bloody writing it yet.
And they are asking about locations.
Or start casting yet too?
Don't tempt me.
About a beach twins.
That's all you're getting.
Try Devon.
Or Dunkirk.
You can go scam-tit.
Personally.
Hm?
Her.
Seconded here to smile on us.
You tell her nothing.
Understand?
All the every government department and wives sticking their womb.
Desk.
"The drunkard has tattled, has he?"
Not him.
Producer Ranbir Kapoor told me his.
"Does he know about it, too?"
Of course.
It'll be out in the newspapers tomorrow.
"In the newspapers, too?"
Yes.
I've sent the news!
You're not an assistant director anymore.
You've been promoted.
Jaiprakash Paswan is now an independent choreographer!
What a cold reaction!
No!
It means the same!
Won't you reward me for the good news I've brought?
What do you want?
Don't you remember?
No!
This won't do!
What if someone sees us?
You mean aunty?
Yes.
That's how you hurt your own feet!
So let's go...
Okay...
"I mean, I've got to go to the loo!"
But aunty's using it now.
I'll go after she comes out.
I have a lot to do!
When must I come again?
When I'm not around
-Then talk to him.
-I don't know.
"It's worth finding out, if you like her."
"I do, so much."
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep..
You know what?
You have to go for it.
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.
Here's your warm milk.
I'm gonna put the bourbon in it at home.
"Anyway, seriously, just talk to the guy, okay?"
Let me know how it goes.
It's Rachel.
You're having a baby and you need to prepare.
You're gonna make yourself watch the whole thing.
Just do it!
I came to the big city to become a star.
-I'll do anything to make that happen.
-Anything?
Maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
I wonder which one of these guys becomes the father.
"No, no."
Can't get pregnant that way.
-Oh!
"Hey, Rach!"
-Hi.
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-You too!
How's living at Ross'?
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
Good-bye.
Look after each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.
Sallah.
That is for Fayah... that is for your children... and this is for you.
Thank you.
A British tar is a soaring soul
As free as a mountain bird
His energetic fist should be ready to a dictator...
Where did you go?
I'm cleaning up.
Where'd you get that?
From him.
Who him?
Katanga.
I got a feeling I'm not the first woman ever to travel with these pirates.
It's lovely.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
What'd you say?
Wait...
I don't need any help.
You know you do.
- How long has this statue here?
- Children.
Mike.
"When the statue distributed, gave to us."
- Causing panic?
- We have broken.
Someone attacked.
"The interesting thing about it, crying."
At least so he says come here.
Think of a miracle.
- Hey!
What are you doing?
!
"If you do heroin in the form of a pie, kururken sweat."
"I made heroin virgin, Father."
- You're not going anywhere!
- Let me go!
- Let me go!
- Give it to me!
Get away from me!
Now!
"Eddie, what are you doing?"
!
"First, your brother, you are now?"
!
Neela.
Also brought his son.
"Do you receive the goods arrived, so?"
The same conversation?
"- Oh, my protector came to visit again."
- Lazarus.
"I can see, our friend has grown even more."
What's that behind you?
Turn round...
"To the left, the one you touched."
Careful you don't break it.
Try to free it.
Pull it out.
Toss it up to me.
He was tall!
It's your size.
is it the left leg or the right?
It's a leg bone. lt's not a shoe.
"Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?"
"Thank you, you're very kind... lt's very difficult reaching you."
"It was the same in Tehran, always engaged."
Yes...
We're ready.
"Yes, they're ready too..."
Everyone's ready.
"Yes, if you don't mind, when you call, you have to wait a few minutes until I drive up to higher ground."
"Yes, that very place."
"Yes, yes."
All right.
Don't mention it...
Thank you...
Good-bye.
Behzad...
Hello.
Are you well?
- Why are you here?
- l've come to see you.
How did you know I was here?
"When I brought the bread, I asked Mim Kharaman,"
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
"Oh, what a beautiful dog."
"Seriously, Devon, I really did feel just a moment, a splash, of hesitation."
"No, there wasn't."
There wasn't any hesitation at all.
PAIGE:
You just did it again.
That was a pause.
DEVON:
I did not pause.
You must be Beth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Heard a lot about you from Paige.
Actually been lobbying to sit next to her single sister for weeks.
"Oh, yeah?"
So you must be:
"""Dan."""
Sort of.
- Sort of?
"- Well, I'm actually a Wiccan."
- A what?
- A Wiccan.
Wiccan?
- Male witch.
- Right.
So I also have a magical name.
It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.
But I didn't know if that would fit on the card.
Love that.
I'm guessing that I'm gonna hear a whole lot about you.
"Nature-based pre-Christian paganism, yeah."
-No worries.
You never know.
See you.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
Looking for an apartment...
There is no housing.
I have no money.
You've got the documents?
No.
"Come on, get out!"
Line!
You do not have to look for here.
How long was it?
-10 Minutes.
-Just.
"In barely 10 minutes later I noticed the ad, intercepted, searched and forced him out of the neighborhood."
"I'm not ga over there look, it's over."
We can go.
-OK.
Here we go.
"Listen, it's not complicated."
"I want 4 grenades, 3 electrical detonators and 5 kg of explosives."
Explosives?
What kind?
-C4.
Got it or not?
I've got everything.
But it will give you 5 pounds?
You want to breathe the air of Paris?
You are right.
Better that nothing not talking.
Sometimes it's just a bit monotonous.
Just a tiny bit dull.
"Hi, Claire."
"Frank, come here."
Have a look.
- Frank!
- Marvelous.
- Look at this.
It's a Torben Din.
- Very nice.
"- 25,000 kroner."
It's a steal.
- It is?
"- Yes, it's worth at least 30-40,000."
- I have to go help out the Gimp.
- He's putting Bodil in a home.
"- Well, good for him."
You just can't eat a thing around a mentally handicapped person.
- He's skin and bone.
- Why can't he eat?
- You can't eat around those people.
- Why not?
It turns you off food when fellow human beings are barmy.
I've never heard that before.
- You haven't?
- No.
- Mia said I was speaking for myself.
- I've never heard anyone think that.
I shagged a handicapped girl once.
I shagged a retard.
- But you can't.
A real retard?
It's OK.
I was too drunk to worry about it.
But really.
What were the odds I'd be scooped up by that other removal guy?
I couldn't take a step without being reminded of Johan.
"- So, what's up?"
"- Yeah, what's up?"
"Well, let me think."
Just screw the brain out of me.
"So, you really moved my stuff?"
(cell phone rings)
"Yeah, two hours or something."
I just need to move this piano.
"See you, honey."
Yeah?
Yes...
"Yeah, OK."
- What are you doing?
"- Hey, OK..."
- You're sick.
Sick!
"- Hey, sorry, OK?"
(slow jazz)
"I know this is awkward, but I'm just back from Paris and I..."
I just thought...
Can I come in?
"No, this is a bad idea."
I really feel bad.
"You were so good to me, and I just didn't..."
"I know I've completely screwed up, but if you'll forgive me..."
"Anna, please don't!"
I don't blame you for not daring.
Don't you?
Or do you just beat them until they do it?
Agreed.
But only until Casa Antigua.
Good.
We march in an hour.
We must hurry.
The French colonel will send the scouts after us at dawn.
How do you know it's a colonel?
Why not a captain?
Or a major?
Unless you watched us yesterday.
Watched us die and did nothing.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
"Now, listen."
I'm in charge here.
"Not them, not Harper."
I'm in command.
You follow me.
"Speak French, Harris?"
"Oui, certainement, je parle..."
That'll do.
I want two boards and some pitch.
"Hagman, I want a lantern, a pound of gunpowder and a pound of old iron."
"Cooper, go on sentry."
"- And, Perkins..."
- Sir?
Dig a proper grave for Captain Murray.
"Yes, sir."
- Out!
- That box on the horse.
- Good job.
Good job.
"Okay, let's send her for a head CT."
I'll be in Exam 2.
- What's your name?
- What?
What's your name?
- I'm Harper.
This is John.
"- Hi, Molly."
Good.
Other eye.
Yeah.
Your optic discs are perfectly normal.
- Are you sure you have glaucoma?
- My medicine must be working.
- How long have you been lightheaded?
- I wouldn't call it lightheaded.
It's more like I float.
- How long have you been floating?
- About two weeks.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
About two weeks.
- Having trouble?
- I lost Radiology.
- That's bad.
- No kidding.
- You have a file-recovery disc?
- No.
Let me have a go at it.
"A couple damaged clusters, but everything looks intact."
Jerry?
Is the cadaver in your way?
We could...
We could move it across the street if you like.
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
"So, how did it go upstairs?"
Fine.
Is that your boyfriend?
"Oh, no, this is my boss."
"This is Adrian Monk, who is a hugely famous detective."
He solves...
"Natalie, who does your hair?"
"Oh, God."
"Well, you take your time."
Okay?
"I'll just be over here at the crime scene, if anybody's interested."
Natalie?
"My mom's in the hospital, and it would mean so much to her if you would take a picture with me."
Please?
- Okay.
Thanks.
Murder!
Or suicide.
Or murder.
It's a tough call.
Yeah.
This is a tough one.
"In many ways, this reminds me of the killer astronaut case"
I solved last year.
You probably read about it.
"Hey, Monk?"
Look at this.
Addons Have you seen this video 2 months ago.
Is not it?
Addons Wednesday 15.
At 22:17.
And you seem Addons and the next morning.
At 11:53 Addons.
"Addons and you send the link, 5 of your friends."
I do not know ...
Consider some of the dirt ...
"Addons What say you add a message, when you send a link to your friends?"
Addons
- Repeat the question ...
- I do not know.
God!
"Addons Well, let's see ..."
"""It was ugly, watch through. """
"Not me, I was sent."
Addons Then who did?
Addons Why did you send?
What were the results?
Addons I was nice to see a man killed right before your eyes?
Of course not!
"Addons But you watch again, right?"
And again .. and again.
I just want to know.
I think it's fake.
No one who saw something like that.
Everything we do.
Who are we doing it?
This is fun ... friends.
We will not play.
"Addons If you are in doubt, Prizes will be lost."

What the...
"Amber, where are you going?"
It don't matter where I'm going.
What's important is that you won't be there.
You think I'm gonna just let you leave with my baby?
It ain't your choice.
I don't need your permission.
- Shit.
- I especially don't need your money.
Can you move?
And you know what?
"I damn sure don't need them damn flowers, so you can send those back to one of your other randoms."
You can't do this.
"Yes, me, too."
- Let's go over that side.
- Good.
Let's do it here.
Having a pee?
Nonsense!
I feel very sorry to the two of you.
"When you see Master Huang, ask him not to be angry with me, please."
- Certainly...
- Not!
"""Having a pee is not allowed."""
I can piss anywhere cause I'm a cop.
Don't watch me piss!
Stop it!
Mousy!
The two bounty hunters are dead.
- Are you sure?
- Of course.
- Where are they?
- Over there!
Must be masked killer!
The masked killer?
He must be connected with the opera troupe.
You don't have to tell me.
Just let me know if I can be of service.
No thanks.
You're not the Marshal.
I can easily handle this.
I've got all the masked opera singers here!
But who is the murderer?
Shut up!
Speak up!
He's accused of raping Alicia.
What are you talking about?
Try to help him.
The poor guy's got nobody.
Have you been to see him?
Me?
"After what he's done, I can't."
But he needs help and you're his friend.
All right.
What jail is he in?
It's in Segovia.
"Wait here for me, please."
Hello.
Hello.
I'd like to see an inmate.
"That's in Visitations, through that door to the left."
Thank you.
May I help you?
I'd like to see the inmate Benigno Martin.
"This isn't a visitor's day, but let me see."
"I'm sorry, I can't hear you."
I'm sorry.
This isn't a visitor's day.
"and what's more, the intern hasn't requested a visit."
He doesn't know I'm in Madrid.
I arrived yesterday.
Are you a relative?
"No, I'm a friend."
My name is Marco Zuloaga.
"May I see your ID, please?"
"Yes, of course."
Can I phone him?
Just put her in the oven!
"OK, a little privacy?"
Take a hike.
"Oh, oui."
"Oh, my gosh, I'm in love!"
You're like a cookie angel.
Wow!
"And you're hot, too!"
Hello?
I guess it didn't work.
Gingy.
Is it you?
The one I was made for?
We'll be together forever.
Sweet!
"Are you happy, Gingy?"
You bet!
The time since I met you has been the best...
seven and a half minutes of my life.
Good!
Because this is only the beginning.
"I'm going to love you and hold you, and feed you and dress you and cling to you and hang onto you and smother you with my love."
- Yeah.
- Forever and ever and ever and ever...
"You know, it's getting a little stuffy in here."
"You know, I'm gonna go get some air."
"- Oh, no, you don't."
"- Oh, no!"
Not without your umbrella.
Come on!
"Here, let me get that."
Wait for me.
Nice color scheme.
"Here,s another cabinet."
"No, it,s a bidet!"
How practical!
It really is.
"I,II just sit down."
- Not too sturdy.
- Sure it is.
This is great!
Did you see the tub?
Look!
Straight out of hollywood.
"It,s comfortable, with handles and everything."
"CIaudine, Jean-MicheI, please get cleaned up and meet us in the living room."
What kind of decor do you prefer?
I Iike antiques.
"I Iike natural, ecological materials."
"AII we,ve got is modern."
"Here,s one possible layout for the living room."
Do we have to follow it?
"No, do what you Iike."
- Can we keep it?
"It,II give us ideas."
- Sure.
"Ladies and gents, our table"
Now take a peek
And the chairs of plastic
Green is so chic
"Isn,t our hi-fi cool?"
And the TV?
Where does it go?
What could that be?
She wouldn't wear anything that wasn't perfect.
It doesn't matter anymore.
[ Sobs ]
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Can I-
"- Can I, uh, drive you home or somethin'?"
"I'm sorry, Mr. Spooner."
I--
I have to get out of here.
[ Sighs ]
No wonder nobody wants to touch me.
"Al, you scared me."
Scared you?
Comin' out of the coffin.
What about me?
You know how I feel about dead people.
I'm a coroner.
Yeah.
"Well, no."
"Actually, you're a mortician."
[ Chuckles ] It's 1 957.
"Uh, you're in Riven Rock, Massachusetts."
And in little towns like this sometimes they appoint the local mortician as the coroner.
This is horrible.
"Hey, I wouldn't mind sitting out this leap either."
"Well, maybe you can."
"I don't think I need you on this one, Al."
What do you mean you don't need me?
I don't need you.
What?
"On my bus, in my bible."
"Thanks for subbing tonight, Eddie."
"My pleasure, coach."
"Eddie, you want to ease up on the pedal there?"
I got it all under control.
What the hell was that?
Everyone okay?
Dirk!
Winchester.
"What are you gonna do, shoot me?"
Don't need to.
"That rope is soaked in salt water, Dirk."
You're not going anywhere.
"All right, everybody stay where you are."
You'll be okay.
Aren't you the P.E. teacher?
Not really.
"I'm like ""21 Jump Street."""
The bus driver sells pot.
Yeah.
It's not here!
Where is it?
No way you'll ever find it.
Where is it?

Sam Winchester.
Still a bully.
"You, you jocks."
You popular kids.
you always thought you were better than everybody else.
"And to you, I was just Dirk the jerk, right?"

Mr. Monk said it first!
I thought that was you.
"It's you, right?"
"Yeah, yes, it is."
- Yeah.
- Natalie Teeger.
"Oh, my god."
I hate to bother you.
Would you mind?
- Really do have to.
- Sure.
- We should... we should head up.

- Captain's probably.
- Mr. Monk.

I know what to say.
I write those letters?
Of course I wrote the letters.
My name's on them.
I'm not gonna Deny that.
- Did you bother reading them?
"- Yes, sir, I have."
Then you know I didn't threaten anybody.
I offered the producers and the lottery commissioner some constructive criticism.
I know why they don't listen to me.
I know more about this lottery system than any living American.
"Ooh, let's make some spicy ones."
Amy doesn't like spicy.
"Actually, she prefers no meat."
You work at a butcher shop.
Yeah.
"Okay, what about we make some hot sauce to dip them in?"
Good idea.
Remember that time...
No.
Not unless you tell me the time.
You got the fusilli stuck up your nose?
"Okay, whose idea was that?"
And Mrs. Ramsey called the fire department to get it out.
I was turning blue in the face.
I stuck it up both...
"Oh, hi."
"Oh, hi, Amy."
I didn't hear you come in.
"Hi, I take it you're Clementine?"
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
And who's this?
That's the guy I wanted you to meet.
"That's our son, John."
"Hey, John, say hi to daddy's friend Clementine."
No.

It's a great apartment.
"Thanks, yeah, we're good."
"So, how long have you been married?"
"Um, just a couple of weeks now."
"Oh, whoa, so you just got married."

"Okay, uh, I'll just come around, make sure everybody's form is okay, make sure you're, uh, keeping your cores tight, and, uh, your --"
"uh, good job."
Great.
Straighten that back out.
"It's dirty, there's something in the..."
- Jerry.
- What?
What are you doing?
Being forced to work quickly.
"- Normally, I'd be much more charming."
- Take it back!
"It was the biggest mistake I ever made, in my life,"
- not giving that to you.
- Don't... don't...
- Don't do this.
- The situation calls for a grand gesture.
That's all I got.
"I love you, Mel."
"And not being with you, it hurts."
Every day.
"- And it's my fault, I blew it."
- Stop.
"You're right, I should stop."
Jerry this...
- ... isn't going to work.
- It could.
It did.
And then it didn't.
Keep it.
I don't want to throw it away.
OK.
"So, like, hmm, I am..."
"I'm, well..."
"My boyfriend, Luke, hi Luke, he.. he said that he... he wants me to do this, and he told me he doesn't think that I will."
"I, Stacey Ragota, hereby accept the cinnamon challenge."
OK.
I'm ashamed now.
"But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie."
You're all I got.
"And I really, really need your help. I really do."
Take this.
And now I've got to turn my back on you.
Thirty-two hundred bucks.
That's what he gave me.
"$3,200 for a lifetime."
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.
-We got to get out.
-I don't want to run.
Am I supposed to pick up and leave everything?
Go hiding?
"I don't want to do that, Henry."
Is that what you want?
"Karen, lf we stay around here we're dead."
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
-You know what kind of questions they been asking him?
-l don't know.
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money.
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.
"Ah, shit."
"Yeah, that's ah, that's palladium."
"Riley, you're a fucking idiot."
"Man, just say what?"
Don't talk to my crew like that.
At least he's doin' something.
Have you tried playing dead?
I gotta show you somethin'.
"Blair, I don't get it."
"I mean, there's nothing in this house."
Why would anyone keep it on lock down?
It gets worse.
Great.
"What, we gonna pay Timmy Song back with with a 200 dollar TV?"
So he's into low-budget slasher flicks.
"Really, really big special effects budgets."
Same place.
Same place.
"Ollie, I'm really scared."
Blair.
Let's get out of here.
"I was gonna say I'm really scared too, but yeah, let's get the fuck outta here."
How can Conner's inside not know this?
Hey.
"He had an inside, right?"
That's what it said in the plans.
"No, he lied on the plans."
There's no inside.
Shit.
Connor!
Shit.
It's all your fuckin' fault.
Wait.
Hold it.
"Hey, come on."
"We're all concerned with human rights, for God's sakes."
"But the kids who want to get education have a right, too!"
Yeah!
Yeah!
Don't you understand?
"It's against your own principle, for God's sake!"
Yeah!
Yeah!
You can't accomplish anything by shutting kids out of their school.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hold it!
Hold it!
"If you want to effect any change, you have to do it within the system."
Director:
"Ok, cut."
That's a wrap.
"I think I'll walk home tonight, Mike."
Take that and drop it by my house.
"Good night, tom."
Good night.
There's not a day in my life that I don't feel like a fraud.
"Priests, doctors, lawyers-- I've talked to them all."
I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.
[Airplane flies over]
Hello?
In here.
Hi.
How did your day go?
"Oh, they're a bunch of fucking liars."
The president is a liar.
I think there may be a problem.
Only problem is you motherfucker think I can't hear you!
"Hi, Mr. Freeman."
Unh!
Hey!
"Damn it, watch where you're going, bitch!"
What the fuck is wrong with you?
!
Shit I ought to whup your big ass!
Now get the fuck out of my way!
"- Slow down, granddad!"
"- Granddad, watch out for that curb!"
Ow!
I can't find my seat belt!
"Whoa, hey, granddad, I think we should talk about your eyesight and whether it's safe to drive."
I've been driving my whole life!
I don't need to know how to see to drive!
Shut up!
"Now, what the fuck is this?"
!
I hate when people do that.
I hate it!
I hate it!
I fucking Hate it!
That was supposed to be our space!
You know what?
You know what?
!
Fuck That!
"That's our space, God damn it!"
It's when I'm nervous.
I used to sing that song to my children.
When they are scared.
To help them sleep.
"And now, whenever I am frightened..."
"Beautiful story, now shut the fuck up."
Shit.
"Hey, hey, no, no."
They are Massalit.
Villagers.
Farmers.
Why are they running?
- That's why.
- Janjaweed.
JACOUB:
What do we do?
Depends how many there are.
Let's take one alive and find out.
- You take the wheel.
- What?
Drive right up beside him.
You son of a bitch.
Jacoub!
Get off there and translate for me.
He's going to tell us where the camp is.
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
"If you become Tahir's woman, it will make you safe."
And you also.
I promise.
You cannot save everyone.
That's what Bakri said.
"But saving even one person, surely, would be something."
I will see.
They're closed.
Man over bullhorn:
"In the group over here,"
"I need a priest, a nun, and two students."
That's exactly what we want.
...and the camera goes around here.
Burke?
"Oh, Burke."
"Is the scene really essential, Burke?"
Would you do without it?
This damn thing doesn't make sense.
It's perfectly plain.
You're a teacher.
You don't want the building torn down.
"Come on, I can read."
"Well, what's wrong?"
"Well, why are they tearing the building down?"
Shall we summon the writer?
"He's in Paris, I believe."
Hiding?
Fucking!
"Scene 39, hotel."
Take 4.
"All right, hustle, background, and action!"
[Roar of protesters]
Girl:
We're not backing down!
Director:
"And action, Chris!"
[Feedback]
Wait a minute!
- Did he tell you he went to see Marosi ?
- No.
"He's bottling it up, he's dealing with all of this on his own."
I bet he didn't tell you his girlfriend dumped him.
Hold on one second.
"Alright you lot, leave him alone."
"What's going on, Stevie ?"
Talk to me.
I don't want to take it.
I think you should kick that ball as hard as you can.
Go for it.
"Listen to me, Pru."
"He's going through a lot right now, so... promise me you'll be there if he needs you."
I promise.
"Ok, great."
Bye.
I think I have one for you.
Please...
Please...
It's all right.
I'm here to help you.
"Mark, it's me."
Listen...
I need Pru's number.
She should be in a hospital.
"No, sorry,no can do."
Hospitals require all kind of information.
"- No, you're doing great."
- She needs an internal scan.
Did she have anything on her ?
A phone or ID ?
She is yet to speak.
It's a case you worked on when you were a copper.
"Jesse, Alan's boy."
"He's back, Dad."
Jesse's come back.
Leave her!
Dad?
Look at him.
"- Take his face away from me, please."
"- Dad, he didn't do it."
He admitted to it.
And you believe that?
Dad I know he wrote you letters.
"- I destroyed them, they gave me the creeps."
- All of them?
- Yes.
What about mom?
Did she keep any of them?
You know what?
You're gonna have to ask her that.
"What is all this, Mark?"
It was 20 years ago.
Why are you bringing all this up again?
"Here we are, one chicken curry and one lamb tagine, sir."
Enjoy it.
- Disgusted or not you must have read them.
"- Yes, of course I read them."
- And?
Well you know he wanted us to meet him.
Wanted us to a... to talk.
- But of course we wouldn't entertain the idea.
- Why not?
'Coz he killed your brother.
"Okay, I'm on my way."
Josh needs my help.
Esme's stoned.
- What?
- Yeah.
He wants me to go over and give her a talk.
- Really?
- Mm.
The first thing I got into trouble with as a teenager was smoking weed.
Mmm.
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
It's delicious.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
I'm glad you called.
"Guess you want me to come down pretty hard, right?"
Yeah.
She'll listen to you...
I hope.
- She's pretty stoned.
- Is she?
It's not funny.
"No, I know."
"For three, and it's good."
"He is just 3 of 13 behind the arch, and he puts up a big three to give his team a four-point lead."
This is a high-resolution S.P.E.C.T. Image of a chronic marijuana user.
"Okay, so, here you can see the decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex."
This is bad.
Oh.
"The, uh..."
"Weed, it can, uh... can trigger psychosis."
Aunt Kate?
Sure.
Come out!
Come out in the end.
We got them all.
Is there one left?
We can meet together now.
Where are you?
Why don't you come out?
What do you want?
"My name is Jurgen Hoffman, I'm a scientist."
I've come to get you out of here.
We should leave immediately.
What do you know?
I've watched through this window.
I've witnessed the deaths from over there.
I know how and why they died.
"You're in great danger, come with me."
So you tell me why they died.
What difference does it make to you?
Now.
Come with me.
Wait a minute you come to my place and you want me to leave and you don't want to tell me why?
"Ok, you have a creature, an alien creature on your roof."
Where?
I study these creatures.
"You're in great danger, come with me."
-Tell me where he is.
-You want to die?
-No.
-Let me explain.
-Let me go.
-Let me explain.
- Hanna?
- Her daughter.
Are you her son?
No.
I'm just the guy who opens the door.
"Mr. Leland, this is my daughter Hanna."
- Hello.
"- Hello, Hanna."
"Oh, I forgot to get your signature on this."
Um...
It's just part of authorizing you to look at the safe deposit box.
Sure.
Thank you.
Okay.
Um...
- I won't be late.
- Okay.
What are you doing coming to the front door?
It was a better way to meet than her tripping over me behind the furnace.
"Yeah, but just knocking on the door?"
Why couldn't you ask me?
- You would have said no?
- My mom thinks you're trouble.
- You don't like her boyfriend.
- He's not her boyfriend.
He's a customer at the bank.
Some architect from Syracuse.
Really.
"What do you mean ""really""?"
He had a crappy plastic pen.
So?
So architects draw for a living.
- I'm...
Shh!
(Whispers) I came to apologise about yesterday.
Is that the only reason you came?
"No, it isn't."
Now I've really lost Bill.
- I am going to the police.
- Please...
That's no good.
No point crying over spilt milk.
You don't understand.
It's not his money I care about.
I really love him.
"So, now I'm getting my own back on that beastly Dennis."
Just a minute.
You said you saw a file on that authoress Flora Ransom?
- Yes.
- Right!
We're going to see her.
I have a few questions to ask that murderous woman.
Excuse me.
- Have a good time.
- I am not going to have a good time!
Is Mrs Ransom in?
She's out but we are expecting her back soon.
Come in.
Thank you.
My name's Bastable.
I'm the lucky fellow she's consented to marry.
"She's a widow, you know."
This way.
"Oh, was Flora expecting you?"
Wow.
I get it.
"You are a trip, Ms. Sciuto."
"That's a good thing, right?"
(sighs)
What now?
Where is Baylor and who shot Ridgeway?
Wickes might be able to tell us if we ask nicely.
I'll ask.
I've seen your nice.
I'm going with you.
You said man-to-man.
Oh.
"Right, I'm sorry, we haven't met."
"Hi, I'm Elizabeth Brighton,"
SECNAV's public affairs officer during this time of crisis.
Wickes and I are going to form a special bond of our own.
(snickers)
GIBBS:
We think she might have a connection to whoever shot the secretary.
You know her?
(sighs)
I don't recognize her.
Did you talk to Lawrence Ridgeway?
He's dead.
He was murdered?
Murder weapon was a hunting rifle.
It's rare.
You know anyone with something like that?
(phone rings)
WICKES:
No.
"No way, we have a show coming up tonight."
Do the box again.
"Kids, didn't you hear me?"
We have a show tonight.
"Bye, kids."
All the best.
"Everything will be okay, my sweetie."
Give me a hug.
Barbuda loves you.
"- Bye, kids."
- Bye.
Here.
For you.
Maybe you'll need it someday.
"It's yours now, Maria."
"We promise that whenever the circus is around, or close enough, we'll come visit you, okay?"
"Look out for her, Quico."
"Maria, let me go."
"Be good, sweetie."
"Bye, kids."
My ring fell into the sea and it was lost to me the waters gave me a seashell as a present for you
Come on and eat Maria.
Do you still like chocolate milk?
Yes.
So...
Didn't you like the nightgown I bought for you?
But it's so pretty.
I've picked your school.
I'll take you to meet the principal.
She wants you to take a test.
But I've always studied!
In the circus?
Lock him up safely until he comes to.
I'll lock him up.
"I'm only sorry you didn't have a dizzy spell, too."
Then I'd lock you both up at the same time.
Good old Din.
What's up?
"Tonight, when everyone sleep, Din go back again."
- See gold.
- You did?
Where is it?
Didn't you bring any with you?
Bhisti cannot carry whole temple.
- Whole temple?
- Din see it.
All gold.
"Here, now."
We've got to get out of here now.
Get me some tools that I can rip these blinking bars out with.
- Already bring all tools could find.
- Yeah.
"Is this satisfactory, sahib?"
Think I want to break out of a blooming pudding?
"Go on, get something big."
Jaldi!
"Up, Annie."
"Please, Annie."
"What are you doing, Din?"
"A large tool you asked for, sahib."
"Annie, come on, pull these blinking bars out for me."
Work for me.
"Get me out of here, Annie."
"Come on, Annie."
- Shut up.
- He totally knows.
"- My point is it took Elliott a year to say he loved me, and another year to say it without using a cartoon voice."
"I think I should be ready for a guy who shows emotions,right?"
- Yeah.
Totally.
- Don't you think?
Just maybe not so many of them.
And on separate occasions.
"And,like,when you're not there."
"Hey,beautiful."
Hi.
This is a surprise.
I hope it's okay.
I just...
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
Dad.
Um...
"You know,I found a strand of your hair on my jacket."
"What,is he shipping out tomorrow?"
It smelled like you.
I'm kind of working.
I love that you're working.
"I love that you work here,and that your hair smells."
Thank you.
"Oh,can we go for a walk or something?"
Yeah.
Is that...?
Get a cramp?
You okay?
Yeah!
We should come back to the beach tonight.

"It's my fault, but I didn't do it on purpose!"
"Scapece was yelling, but I couldn't understand!"
Stay back.
Be careful.
If I asked you to marry me?
No rush.
Rememberwhen we got married?
"We lived everywhere, we didn't give a damn."
We were happy because we were together.
How could we have forgotten that?
Jackass.
Come in.
What is it?
It's foryou.

Goodbye.
Mamma's boy!
This is foryou.
There you go.
What're you doing here in the middle of night
You want to break into my shop?
"I'm sorry, boss, I need 1 0 grams of Tianqi 50 grams of Baiyao, also..."
Are you mad?
You know what time it is?
Come again tomorrow!
Please help.
It's a matter of life and death
What does it have to do with me!
I need to sleep!
"You can't sleep, boss!"
"Asshole, no sympathy at all"
All you want is sleep!
Think you can sleep no more?
What are you looking at?
Get off!
Asshole

Takehara sees Mother a lot?
I don't know.
Come in!
Hello.
Hello.
What do you think?
Will you let us use it?
It's a little embarrassing.
It'll get you a lot in return if you do let me use it.
My mother says that she can't make it today.
I think you were supposed to go the Kabuki with her.
Has something come up?
My father came back.
I see.
Welcome.
It's been a while.
How are you?
Same as ever.
"Takao, I haven't seen you in ages."
Is your mother well?
Yes.
You should come to Kamakura.
The beach is really popular.
I'd like to get there this summer.
Excuse me.
Someone from the Kokuminsha is here.
"Send him in, please."
Will you be going in the bath later?
"I will, but after we're done talking."
Make yourself at home.
Mother was a friend of hers wasn't she?
"Yes, I think they were very close."
Dennis!
"- That's not Dennis, Mumsie."
- Of course it's Dennis.
- I should know.
"- Well, it can't be."
Then who was the man in the trunk?
"Oh, Mumsie, what have you done?"
What have I done?
!
You have murdered an innocent bystander.
Control yourself.
- Get this back to the barge.
- Why?
"If he misses it, he'll be suspicious."
"Besides, it pointless our taking it while he's alive."
"If I nobble him now, we can get it back."
Though why you had to go and warn him...
Hurry!
Hurry!
Our whole future depends on it.
(Chuckles)
Forgive me.
I was getting rid of my daughter.
Getting rid of people seems to be a hobby of yours.
Eh?
!
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
"Oh, no."
"For once, I think I won't."
- Oh...
- Please sit down.
Business before pleasure.
- You believe me?
- Yeah.
- Poor bastard.
"- Jerry's a good guy, so don't..."
"No, I'm not."
"It's just that,"
"I mean, man, it's gotta hurt."
"One time I kissed this girl who I was,"
- I had such a crush on...
- I don't need to hear this.
- I had to watch you kissing Jerry.
- Yeah but that's not...
"Anyway, I did the Hail Mary thing, and it was great, I thought, and after the kiss, I was like, here we go, this is gonna happen."
- OK.
"- Yeah, OK, that's what I thought. ""OK."""
"Except she said, oh, kissing me was like kissing wait for it... her brother."
- Oh that's so gross.
- Right?
That's not what it's like kissing Jerry.
What?
He's a good kisser.
I'm just being honest.
But not as good as kissing me.
I forget.
Mm...
Still not sure...
You win.
I'm going to Dallas because I love you.
Do you love me?
"I can't believe I have to ask, but..."
"Yeah, I do."
I love you.
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, of course."
- We'll have you guys over.
Maybe I'll make some of my famous apps and we can throw some games in there.
"- That'll be fun, right?"
"- Hey, can you make those baby hot dogs that look like they're taking a nap in pastry?"
"- Oh, pigs in a blanket."
"- Yeah, I guess you could make those, too, if you want, pfft."
All right.

Those serrations near the base are pretty distinctive.
Exactly.
Find the knife...
Find the killer.
Nice work.

I hope your parents never come home.
"Seriously, dawg, let's find that punk's trailer park and burn it to the ground."
Who dat?
That freak from Chino.
He was all up in Luke's grill.
Maybe he's on OxyContin.
OxyContin is gnarly.
I heard he's like a total psycho.
He's a little bitch.
"I see that kid around again, I'm going to beat his ass."
"Yeah, run him out of Newport for sure."
I gotta go.
Hey wait up.
Where you going?
I can't be here right now.
What's the matter?
You don't know him.
You don't know anything about him.
He could be anywhere.
"Dad, I'm sure Ryan's fine."
We should just try again when it's light out.
Could be too late by then.
That's your friend from school.
Uh-huh.
"So, you're wearing a Mayhem shirt."
I am.
Yeah.
"Isn't the singer, like, a cannibal?"
"'Cause you're in, like, a Christian power metal band."
Seems kind of weird.
I don't know.
"No, actually that was just a rumor."
But he didn't actually eat anyone.
And Crucifictorious is actually...
It's not power metal.
"We're more of extreme grindcore with like, heavy thrash influences."
Like what thrash bands do you like?
Like Napalm Death?
Like the Keep?
Like Cannibal Corpse?
"Carcass, I mean, I really only have two sections for vinyl."
"Like metal, non-metal."
So...
Right.
"Well, mainly..."
You all ready to order?
Yeah.
I want the sizzling apple pie.
And I think also chips and...
"Oh, my..."
That's pathetic.
I'm back at the start.
What's up?
Um...
Was he on his way to tell me that he loved me?
What should I do if he wasn't?
"Gil Da Ran,"
I love you.
He was probably going to say it like that to you.
Alright then.
Is that so?
"It would be so, right?"
"If it's like that, I worried uselessly."
Like a fool!
"Yeah, yeah."
Like a fool.
Let's pack up your clothes!
This color suits Yoon Jae very well.
This color is good too!
This one matches well too.
"Here, go pack it up."
I'll go get a bag.
Does she like Seo Yoon Jae that much?
"Aish, what's this?"
Are these the keys for this house?
No.
Is it the contracted room for us after we get married?
What should we do?
"Wait a moment, and go answer the phone naturally."
What?
Hello?
"Oh, Yoon Jae."
- It's Se Young.
- So you were home?
- The doctor friend that you saw at the hospital.
I was so worried because you didn't answer your phone.
- Well ...
It's because of the surgery.
Do you think?
Yes.
I don't know.
How would you feel if you had undergone such an operation?
I don't know.
She is not like our mother.
Play it again.
Loads of kisses from me.
I can't wait to be back.
Pull up your blankets and close your eyes.
"Can you count the stars, shining in the night sky?"
"Can you count the clouds, hovering over the fields?"
Oh Lord watch over them with eyes that never doze.
He sees you and loves you.
He sees you and loves you.
Goodnight.
Get mom.
Mom?
Lukas?
Lukas?
- Hello?
"- Hi, good morning."
That was a huge order.
So many at the same time.
- Throwing a party?
- No.
Who are all those pizzas for?
"Pepperoni, Pepperoni?"
Is that your favorite?
Pepperoni pizza.
"Yo, how long you two been married?"
Come on.
Play ball.
"Okay, all right, time-out."
Time-out.
My time.
"You, uh, never played basketball, have you?"
"No, I've played once or twice."
Yeah?
"Yeah, I mean, I can see that."
"It looked like I was watching Lebron, and maybe he's just this much better."
You know what?
"Football was my sport, okay?"
Yeah?
Now you tell me that?
"Hey, you ready to quit?"
- No.
- Yes.
- Which one is it?
"Can you just give me a second, please?"
Can I have some space?
"All right, listen to me."
"You're not gonna outshoot him, so out-D him, all right?"
Play it like it's football.
"Put a body on him, steal the ball away from him and put it in the hoop, huh?"
"What's he gonna do, call a foul?"
We're in jail.
"All right, I can do that."
That's game.
"Let's have it, man."
"All right, badge, here it is."
A couple weeks ago we're in rec watching some tube.
Hadn't you better catch him up?
You don't want him taking the hump again.
"Oh, lord, he could be anywhere."
I'll see you at Popmobility.
Thanks for everything!
Bye!
Bye.
"You'll have to take the lift, love."
"Oh, flip."
It's all right.
You don't have to fling me into the gutter by the seat of my trousers.
It's not the Beano.
"Quick as you can, boys."
Up over there!
Who is it?
Sir!
"It's Jimmy Baker, he's up on that ledge."
Everyone shush!
"He's too late, though, isn't he, sir?"
"Because he didn't come on the tram, sir."
"Climb over, jump down, I'll catch you!"
Look lively.
Is everything all right over there?
Get in your place!
"Yes, thank you, Sir Hamilton."
Baker was just helping me up.
"Lost a leg, sniper, Vimy Ridge."
Good man.
I was Naval Reserve.
North Sea.
Lot to be grateful for.
You said Baker hadn't turned up.
"and on top of that, my little timmy has a black eye for the christmas portrait this year because harley was too busy saving your butt, instead of walking him home from town."
"and i'm sorry i said ""butt."""
okay?
don't say that.
mommy is mad.
- bob!
are you gonna say anything?
!
"- she does have a point, cind."
- [scoffs] fine. fine.
[sighs] you know what?
"i don't need any of you guys, okay?"
"and, peepers, i'm really sorry about your eye."
- is aunt cindy mad at me?
"[door slams] - it's okay, honey."
just -- just eat.
"let's just wash the day off of us, okay?"
none of this happened.
[siren wailing]
- [sighs] hey!
what are you doing here?
"- oh, uh... nothing."
"i'm just -- um, just, uh, cutting school."
- oh!
"well, you seen wayne?"
- no.
why -- why would i have seen wayne?
- 'cause he works here.
"- well, um... yeah."
"no, i... i haven't seen him."
- okay. cool.
"there you are, my little worker bee."
Oh.
Marissa?
Look who's here.
Luke!
Hi.
Hey.
Mm.
Just grabbing a little grub before we take the boat out.
Boat?
"Yeah, I thought we'd take my dad's DawnSea."
"Do a little water skiing, have a little lunch."
So you have no idea where Ryan might've gone?
I don't know.
He did say something about going down to Mexico and gambling on cockfights.
"I mean, I don't know what kind of jurisdiction you guys..."
Quit joking around.
Will you answer his question?
"Yes, I did."
I really don't know.
I do not know the guy.
I never got the chance.
"Hey, there's eggs."
"Oh, I'm taking Caitlin to the stable, so I need to get that check."
Does Caitlin really need a pony?
"In a couple of months, she's not even going to like horses."
What?
!
I love China.
She's the prettiest pony.
We're not giving up China.
"Now go wait in the car, sweetie."
Mommy will be right with you.
"I'm sorry, kid, I, uh,"
"I don't know, man."
6 months on the sidelines.
I guess I still have a few blisters where I used to have calluses.
I don't think that's what this is.
"Oh, no?"
Then what is it?
You're about to be a dad.
You know?
You have to expect the world to start to feel different.
It just feels so hard.
Not as in difficult.
Literally hard.
Like asphalt is hard.
Like pavement.
And children are soft.
Yeah.
Defenseless.
That's why every day we try to make this world a little safer.
"If there's one thing I'm sure of, is that you and Savannah are going to be great parents."
"Charge by the hour, Doc?"
Aah!
Josie?
!
Josie!
Aah!
No...
"Oh, my God."
Eleven.
Aah!
So what do we know?
"Our father's dead, daughter's missing, but we may have caught a break here."
You want to see the way little boys kiss?
"Well, that's nice, Wilbur."
This comes a little later.
Now cut that out!
What's wrong with you?
"Oh, oh, nothing's wrong."
I was just trying to show you what I shouldn't do.
"Well, that's right."
That's what you shouldn't do.
(BELL RINGING) No.
"Well, I..."
I must go.
"I hope you won't forget our little talk, Willy."
"No, I won't forget, Aunt Nancy."
(DOOR CLOSING)
"Goodbye, Uncle Bob."
"Now, wait a minute."
I want to have a little talk with you.
"Oh, oh, I can't."
Natalie has me until 4:30.
Natalie can wait.
Why don't you straighten up?
"Oh, I am straightened up."
It's just that my shoulders are stupid.
"That's funny, I got stupid shoulders."
I have to go.
"Now, look."
It's possible I could have had you all wrong.
Had me all wrong?
"Maybe you are a nice, simple, warm-hearted kid after all."
"Yeah, and a loyal, trustworthy pal."
That's right.
Gossip girl might be right about me
But she's--she's wrong about you.
Without serena van der woodsen
Who would i have dreamt about?
I might have spent my whole life on the outside
If you hadn't let me in...
Which i'm holding against you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, that makes sense."
Wait. they're a team.
Team of what?
Wait.
Why are you all here?
I got a text saying to meet you.
- Yeah
- So did I.
- So did I.
You wanted to meet gossip girl.
Well look around.
You just did.
I'm nothing without you.
And while most high school friendships fade
It's my hope that what happened today will bond you forever.
now that all my secrets are out
You have a clean slate...
Until college.
Congratulations.
I'm coming with you. oh.
- Drinks on me.
- Yes.
""" Love is a virus... that infiltrates itself... in the system of two lovers."
"Yours, Gary"""
"He didn't sign off""love,"" but there are two ""loves"" before."
"It's good, no?"
Remember me?
Of course.
My public defender.
"- Beautiful, isn't it?"
- What?
Far out.
Can I try it?
Far out.
I need to tell you that I love you
I could win or lose you
But I need to tell you that I love you
Beautiful.
You have mine.
I have yours.
Miami I can get you for $7 50.
It has to be New York.
Can I just buy a one-way ticket?
There's a flight with stopover in Paraguay for $650.
$650...
It's still a little high.
"No, thanks."
You can't get a hotel in New York for less than $7 0 a day.
I'm staying with my boyfriend.
- He has a loft in Soho.
- Can't he lend you some money?
"No, he doesn't know me yet."
Your boyfriend doesn't know you?
No.
Or you're just acting blind to the truth that we're husband and wife!
And the way to Bela is the only thing I remember.
Can't you understand that?
"I don't want to understand it because I'm so tired of you, Migs."
"Well, I'm tired too."
I can't take it anymore.
One more chance?
I will change.
"If I would keep you hoping, you'll get hurt even more."
"Migs, I need you."
I'm begging you.
-I'm here for you now.
-What are you doing here?
.
This is wrong.
-Wrong!
-Wrong?
.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
My heart and mind says you're the one I love.
You're the one my heart is screaming out.
"But what if, what if your memory comes back?"
How?
What if the accident really happened so I can come back to you?
.
I don't want to get hurt again.
Don't be scared.
Don't be scared.
What did she say?
.
"Hello, this is Joy."
You named your battleship after your assistant?
Yep.
"They're both cold, heartless war machines."
"Your tea, sir."
"Look, I am truly sorry for the mess I caused."
Let me make it up to you.
Take Zhu Li.
"My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it."
"It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing."
All right!
Team Avatar is back in business!
It's okay.
We're gonna stop Unalaq and get Jinora back.
I hope my dad's all right.
I'm sure he's fine.
Get the men and fall back.
What about you?
I'm going to end this right now.
Go!
"Hello, Tonraq."
Looking for me?
"Brother, I'm too strong for you."
You're no brother of mine.
You betrayed me.
You had me banished.
"Yes, I did."
Stop!
He's mine.
You are not the true chief.
I am.
And you will bow to me.
"Now that I've defeated you, your daughter is next."
- Where was she hit?
- In the neck.
"- BP's 100/76, pulse stable at 100."
- Through and through?
- Saw one hole but it wasn't leaking air.
- You need a hand?
- Possible SCI.
- Where is he?
Ricky?
- What's her name?
- Alma.
"Hang in there, Alma."
We' re gonna try to find him for you.
- Set up a cross-table lateral of the neck.
- Carter.
Still got med students waiting.
Want me to jump on that?
Better idea.
You talk to them.
So.
"Newbies, huh?"
You don't wanna work here.
"- Haleh, get that dead body out of here."
- And take it where?
- Someplace else.
- How much O2?
- Five liters by nasal cannula.
- You hurt anywhere else?
They shot him!
"Oh, please, God, don't let him be hurt!"
"We' re gonna find out for you, but you gotta help us."
- Do you have pain anywhere else?
But you and your boy the only ones to walk out alive.
Kind of a miracle.
HENRY:
"Shut up, Fitzgerald."
FITZGERALD:
Is that what you did?
Shot one of your own to save this little dog here?
Why?
"Was he playing with this little boy's mama, huh?"
Did he kill her?
"Hey, you can quit polishing that rifle when I'm talking to you."
I'm working on it.
You can work on it when I'm done talking to you.
Look at me.
HENRY:
That's enough!
"You're forgetting your place, boy."
"As far as I can tell, my place is here on the smart end of this rifle."
HENRY:
"You move along, Fitzgerald."
That's an order!
Listen!
There's only a couple hours of light left.
We got to stash these pelts and get rid of the boat.
Let's go!
(ALL AGREEING)
(SPEAKING PAWNEE)
(GRUNTS)
HENRY:
Beckett!
Weston!
JONES:
I know it!
I know now!
You have done this!
You have done this!
I know it!
"Dhanraj,just think that God has punished you for your misdeeds!"
"Your bad time has arrived, Dhanraj!"
Your mill has caught fire and there..
..you have sold offSwarg to bag 90 lakh!
I didnt get you.
Just think that if you dont have that 90 lakh then?
Hey!
This cant be!
This will never happen!
There is saying in every language and Gujrati too!
God is a silent punisher!
No!
Greetings!
Greetings!

What will you have?
We wont have anything.
We have come here to remind..

"-Yeah, we know."
"Dont worry, Mr. ToIani!"
You will get back your money with interest!
The goods are ready wejust have to deIiverthem!
Once you deIiverthe goods give us the money!
Sure.
Greetings!
"Greetings, Mr. Adda!"
Michelle's pregnant.
Dad?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed my husband.
We're gonna get you in a cast later.
You can have everybody sign it.
"You're just gonna have to be prepared for a little bit of itching, okay?"
All right.
You want to talk about it?
No.
I can't.
All right.
Okay.
"I know it feels that way, but, um, you gotta believe me."
There's a lot of people that want to help you.
Okay.
"Well, maybe later."
All right?
You still playing soccer?
Yeah.
Starting fullback.
"Oh, yeah?"
Starting fullback.
"That's, uh..."
"Yeah, see, I don't know anything about soccer."
You could ask me about basketball.
I'm good with the basketball.
"Invented by a doctor, probably to get more patients, 'cause, you know, basketball injuries."
Is my dad gonna be okay?
Dr. Bennett's taking care of him.
He's in good hands.
"Okay, so crits are stable."
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.
Don't worry.
"I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up time."
"Thank you, Sheriff."
But you know I can't go just yet.
"Well, why not?"
I'm not sure these tires can get me to California.
- Peet stop?
"Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?"
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
"Grazie, Mr. Lightning."
Grazie!
- Would you look at that!
- Our first customer in years!
"I am filled with tears of ecstasy, for this is the most glorious day of my life!"
"All right, Luigi, give me the best set of blackwalls you've got."
No!
"No, no, no."
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.
But-a this...
Whitewall tires!
"They say, ""Look at me!"
Here I am!
"Love me. """
"All right, you're the expert."
I know.
But nothing appears to be wrong with the thermostat.
And I couldn't find anything wrong with the lights and the TV either.
Okay.
So what is it?
"Something strange is going on in this suite, Danny."
Not you too.
"Come on, Don."
[Scoffs]
Thirty-nine degrees.
"Your, uh, dairy storage is exemplary, Delinda."
I bet you say that to all the girls.
[Chuckles]
Whoa.
Sorry.
"Well, filters clean."
Ventilation good.
Everything looks perfect.
"So, uh, we passed?"
"Oh, with flying colors."
I'm not supposed to reveal that until the official report is issued.
It'll be our little secret.
[Chuckles]
"Okay, so..."
Just...
Just one more thing.
What's that?
"Um, I was wondering if you might have dinner with me some evening?"
"Oh, Mr. Ackerman."
"Oh, no."
"Call meJerry, please."
Jerry.
"And that, you know, makes me uncomfortable."
[SCOFFS]
"Well, just because I'm comfortable with myself doesn't mean I don't wanna fit in."
"- What, you wanna fit in with us?"
- Yeah.
"I mean, you guys could try and be a little nicer to me at school."
"- Okay, well, we could try."
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Good.
- Okay.
Good.
- This is good.
- This is good.
This is a tip for you.
A tip?
"No, Marly, that's not..."
"Oh, a hundred bucks?"
"Whoa, thank you."
Somebody's getting a haircut.
And a new pair of shoes.
"I'm not looking, I'm not looking."
I just wanna get my purse.
"I don't wanna see anything, or, God forbid, touch anything."
"It's okay, he's gone."
Ah.
"Well, I am leaving."
I wanna thank you for a particularly humiliating afternoon.
- Are you mad at me?
- Mad at you?
"No, that was great."
"I don't know, which part was my favorite?"
- Yeah.
"I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes."
John.
- I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
"- No,you can't."
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
"It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45."
I tried to get you on the one to
"Charleston, but they're all booked up."
"So if you leave now, you'll just make it."
I can't.
I can't.
"It's Christmas Eve, John."
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
"Yeah, you can."
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
I know I can.
I can stop this.
"No one can stop it, John."
Listen to me.
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.
People you know and love are going to die... and no matter what that voice tells you... there's nothing you can do about it.
It's two years to the day.
He told me that she's goi ng to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.
He's lying.
"Hello, Goni."
I smell that wonderful soup of yours.
Gonki!
We're eating!
"I'm sorry, my darling."
How was your meeting with Alex?
Where did you meet?
At the theater cafe.
- And?
He asked me to direct a small insignificant play.
Do you know it?
"I know the playwright, that's enough."
I don't want to play anymore.
I hate that piano.
Why are you picking on the piano?
You don't have to practice if you don't want to.
"Still, he asked you to direct."
Yes.
In the basement hall.
That playwright is a disgrace.
Delicious.
Daddy made us such good soup.
"Gonki Galonki, why aren't you eating?"
Taste the soup.
I made you soup!
Did you see the doctor?
- Tomorrow.
I thought it was today.
You were wrong.
I'll pour Gonki Galonki some lemonade.
Now try the soup and tell me if it's good.
"Are you sick, Mommy?"
You still want to play charades?
Yeah.
I got to go.
(laughs) Really?
Mm-hmm.
Parker.
"You know, I can help you, Doc, with your ex."
(chuckles)
"No, you can't."
"Oh, yeah, I can."
I need to go home and check my judgment.
It's about Wickes again?
You were right about the tell.
He looked at that photo for a reason.
"Yeah, he did."
That's not enough.
"So, you were wrong about the guy."
No one here likes you any less.
"I want to stop running, Gibbs."
Really see the people around me and not just blurs as I fly by.
Really see them.
I just don't know if I can.
Not yet.
"I'm here, Doc."
I know.
(clears throat)
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
Previously on Dance Academy...
Our problem is with your kind.
You're a second-year in a first-year leotard and we don't like the second-years.
"Even if there was a moment, we've probably missed it, so there's no point in..."
GIGGLING
GIRL GIGGLES
"I'm sorry, I..."
Wait.
Please!
I'm Adam.
Patricia.
You must be his friend.
You must be his son.
"Come in, then."
Can I get your opinion on something?
What's wrong with this picture?
You want me to say she looks fat?
Would you say she looks at ease?
She's smiling.
You think?
I'd say that was a smile.
She's uncomfortable.
Self-conscious.
"Then, why did she do it?"
I'll call you.
HE SIGHS
I should...be getting back to work.
"So, what is it that you do, Patricia?"
I'm a journalist.
"Oh, so you work together."
"He really hasn't told you anything about me, has he?"
"I bet he hasn't talked about me much, either."
So we should be equally insulted.
"Well, maybe he's being cautious."
You've been seeing each other for over a year now.
Then he has told you something?
- He'll be fine.
- Jackass!
- Stop calling him that.
- Climbing in places like that?
- He got a good person killed!
- It was an accident.
Peter... a cop died!
There was no intention.
"In fact, he tried to stop her."
You're defending him.
He was just trespassing.
It was a sad and tragic accident.
I think you're minimizing just a little.
I have to get to work.
Can we talk about this later?
- Or we could not talk about it at all.
- Mel...
No.
I'm just surprised you feel that way.
"Alright, buddy, much as I love spending time with you, where the hell is this bar?"
Where is Natasha?
Um...
She works at this bar...
She works...
"The bar is, uh  somewhere."
"Hey, you and Natasha,"
- you sure she's going to want to see you?
"- Dude, she loves me."
She never judged me.
- Worst thing I ever did...
- Dumped her?
Yeah.
No more than five.
- I know a way in.
- No.
"No, your Abbess..."
- She doesn't need to know.
- She said they search every inch.
We can't.
There are inches Mother doesn't know about.
Ladies.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
This is...
Sister Marie.
- Miri.
- Since when do we bring strays home?
She's going to help hide our men at the Abbey.
Then she should be at the Abbey.
Why is she here?
She knows our plan.
I prefer not to let her out of our sight.
We'll need a car or a way to slow the Germans down.
The Abbey has a truck.
They take it to town on market days.
"I could ""borrow"" the keys."
When do you need it?
Walking freely is a privilege.
- Brilliant.
- Maybe now you will think twice before attacking.
Alfred's going to have to find a way out from the inside.
- How?
- I don't know.
He's going to need our help.
"Woof, woof."
Hello.
I've come to see Rose and Lily Starling.
I'm not to talk to papers.
I'm not to let no one in.
I'm not from the papers.
I'm from the Ministry of Information.
The Film division.
Film?
And then you went to Dunkirk?
We meant to.
But the engines stopped five miles out.
Broken bearing.
We never got there.
"But in the paper...it said, you got home troops."
This steam tug on it's way back gave us a tow.
Soldiers spilling' over the rails.
"So we pulled someone in, see."
Someone seen us docking' and put it in the paper.
They got the wrong end of the stick.
Didn't they?
"Dad said, we'd be a laughin' stock."
"Said, ""You mustn't tell the papers""."
But you write in the papers.
For the pictures?
Can Lily ask you somethin'?
Yes.
Have you ever met Robert Donat?
The famous actor?
No.
"No, I haven't I'm afraid."
Dad!
"I'm sorry, Mr Devereaux, but we get a lot of cars here and it's hard to keep track..."
- You mean the car is here now?
"- Oh, yeah."
It's right outside.
"They stole it right offthe street from you, huh?"
Goddamn.
"You're gonna have to pay the towing charge, you know."
"I was told these things happen in New York, but one never expects it."
"Yeah, well, that's New York."
Is this your first trip over here?
Yes.
"Where's my car, please?"
It's right over here.
You're lucky this time.
It's in perfect shape.
Not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.
Henri.
Je vous attendais.
Let's go!
I wouldn't be surprised if I'd been followed.
"- Listen, I'll see you at Pop's tonight."
"- OK, babe."
Take care.
They got the bridge blocked off!
This is the police.
You're surrounded.
Come out with your hands up!
This is the police.
You're surrounded.
Give 'em the gas!
Hold your fire!
It doesn't sit well with my policy of plausible deniability.
Let's get going.
I'll see you around.
"And by that I mean please, stay away from me."
"See you later, ghosts of staffers past."
"Madam President, I brought you Congressman Pierce."
"I brought him also, ma'am."
Richard Splett.
She already knows who you are.
You can go.
"No, no, no."
Not you.
Not you.
We're such big fans.
I'm a big fan of yours.
"Thank you, Madam President."
I am here to serve.
How can I help?
The president needs you to do something for her.
"And in exchange, she feels that you deserve a better job."
- Yes.
- Thank you.
"Ambassador, perhaps."
How does that sound?
Ambassador?
Me?
"Oh, wow."
Not what I was expecting.
What's your favorite city?
Dallas.
"I love Dallas, Texas."
"No, it needs to be a foreign city."
I bet you anything he's well hung.
How do you know?
Did you see him?
You want a cookie?
Of course not.
You can tell from a guy's face.
And especially from his crotch.
I've got a sixth sense.
"He's friendly with Benigno, isn't he?"
Yes.
"He isn't a faggot too, is he?"
No way.
Are you nuts?
Are you insinuating Benigno's a faggot?
I'm not.
"It's vox populi, honey."
You're very wrong.
Dr. Vega confirmed it for me.
How would he know?
Alicia's father told him.
"I don't approve of him being so intimate with the patient, but Dr. Vega told me not to worry."
"Benigno doesn't like women, he's into men."
My God!
I'll leave so you can carry on pulling him to bits.
The poor thing likes Benigno.
"Good choice, sweetie."
Hey.
"Hey, Benigno."
I'm free tonight.
I'm going to the Cinematheque.
Want to come?
I'm meeting my editor.
-Hi there.
-Hi.
"Just set it down there, OK?"
Are you studying the stars Miss Sylvia?
Exactly!
Thank you!
Oh my god!
God miss Sylvia?
Oh add out 20 percent.
"Very good, thank you."
"I'm falling asleep I'm tired, I'm falling asleep and you're boring me to death."
"Please don't die, I know you'll love it,"
Hurry up please!
hop
"You'll love it,"
Fuck!
I'm fucking you.
Fucking you...
"Sorry, you're eating."
Oh It's my pleasure.
How did you meeting go with the girl?
She didn't believe me.
Who would believe a man who's capable of waiting till the shrimps get cold?
"Oh, what did you got?"
This is for you.
This is what I drink.
"Oh, thank you."
"Start getting your dinner, I shouldn't start talking about your duty again."
"Here, open it."
Hey you?
Hey you?
What's with these glass arrows in the head?
- We should all be drunk for this.
- Let's get really drunk.
- All right.
- Yeah.
You know what?
I'll get some beers.
- Come with me.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Let him go.
- Mmm.
- I don't know what happened.
- Mmm.
Mmm.
- Mmm.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"Deandra, we've been at this for days now."
It's like you have no motor skills.
Just grab that bar and jerk it down behind your neck.
Hey!
How's the chip off the old block doin'?
"- Bobby, not now, okay?"
"- Hey, your old man ever tell you how we fought back in '61?"
"They billed it as ""Beauty Versus the Beast."""
Wasn't much of a fight.
First-round knockout.
- He went down like a...
"- Wait, wait, wait."
Hold on a second.
"What's goin' on with you, Thunderson?"
"What, are you trying to humiliate me?"
"Uh, I think you did that to yourself 40 years ago."
You know damn well you hit me after the bell.
"Come, Ashwini."
Let's go.
Let's not stay here.
"Who is it, Ashwini?"
Inspector Arivazhagan.
Can I come in?
"Sir, I killed him."
I accept my doing.
Do you know how many years of jail for a hit-and-run case?
"Keep quiet, Ashwini."
Sir...
What should I do?
I'll tell you.
"I'll miss you, Manoj."
Be careful.
I'll be awaiting your call.
Call me soon.
A beautiful plotter One who cannot be controlled whatsoever.
You are a small secret That hits away with ease the balls life throws at you.
A beautiful plotter One who cannot be controlled whatsoever.
A chameleon in the disguise of a cute barbie doll.
Ravi is nowhere to be seen.
His phone is not reachable.
Did he inform you?
Did he call you?
Get me my bag from the backseat.
Get it.
"Oh, you ...."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you ...."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you ...."
You didn't forget your phone again did you?
"Anyways, Aunt came out to check her bank account, and it broke her heart."
Give her a call ok?
Welcome!
This is driving nuts!
Give me a can of beer that's past the expiration date.
There's no such thing.
It's $1.70.
-Get money from Jang Min.
-Sis said that she will kill me.
"If that kills you, I should've been dead 88000 times."
It will be $1.70 sir.
I don't have money.
See?
"Fine, let me call my sister first."
Chan!
Come on Chan!
Geez.
"""Sis isn't answering her phone."
"I left her a voice mail."""
"""I told her that you cried your eye balls out."" Hehe look at this kid."
"""Ok."" Send."
"This is so simple, Honey."
Hey what time are you coming home?
"Yes, mother around 7?"
"Ok, I'll get ready then."
"Ok, Mom see you."
What did you want to eat?
Just make whatever you want.
Fine!
"We can just text this, ""What time?"" ""What do you want?"""
"""7,"" ""Kimchi"" It's so simple."
And I am not apologizing.
My past isn't about you.
"-Oh, that is cold."
"-No, it's not."
It's clear.
"You're gonna keep me in my place, are you?"
I'm not gonna keep you anywhere.
You are free to move around.
"Well, I'm not moving, for your information."
"You can work your tough-girl thing, but I know you're in love with me."
That's irrelevant.
"Kind of tired, babe."
You know?
-You're up early.
"-I know, and I'm not happy about it."
-You need some Valium?
-I don't wanna get back into that again.
"Yeah, that wouldn't be good."
Try swimming.
It helps.
-So how are you?
How's work going?
-Good.
-Just not sleeping enough myself.
"-Oh, I'm sure."
-Hospital's been busy.
"-A lot of psychos, huh?"
"No, just a lot of pained souls."
"Listen, I appreciate your interest in Alex."
I meant to tell you that.
I really like Alex.
I like her a lot.
"Victor, no."
Stop.
I'll bring him down myself.
Give that to me.
Look what you've done.
"Sickle, stop."
"Sickle, I'm commanding you to stop."
"Sickle, this is Dr. Victor Gannon commanding you to stop!"
- He's out of control.
- Sickle!
Go back!
Sickle!
No!
Letha...
look.
- I can't look.
- You must.
It's miraculous.
"There are no miracles, Letha."
Only scientific explanations for everything.
"Well, then, just explain to me what we're seeing."
It... must be that... boy.
There's a...
There's a force that centers around that boy.
A force capable of countermanding the basic physical law of...
gravity.
"Victor, I don't know what you're talking about."
Molecular mobilization.
"I need that boy, Letha."
- I need him desperately.
"- Now, just a minute."
"Brilliant, my boy."
Why?
What?
Gwen Addons you later

No!
Lord!

(PHONE RINGING)
Hi.
So are we doing something tonight or not?
I can't.
My girlfriends are sleeping over.
I'm having a sleepover.
This is like the first normal thing I've done since I got pregnant.
"All right, well..."
Just let me know where I fit in here.
"Okay, I'll talk it over with Jody and Francine and I'll let you know."
(SCOFFS)
I'm just joking.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, not funny."
And...
You know what?
This isn't going to work out.
I have to go.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"No, I have to go."
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"And I don't like your friends, either."
They're not nice.
What does that have to do with anything?
They're still my friends.
We'll see.
"Yeah, we will."
Boyfriend problems?
He thinks my friends aren't nice.
And why would he say that?
Because they aren't.
But it's high school and you have to have friends and these are the only friends I can get right now.
My job with you always comes first.
I promise.
Come on.
We've got a million things to do.
Okay.
We've got to talk to the publicity people and set up a photo shoot.
Natalie.
I hate that picture!
"I like the other one better, the one on the trolley cars."
What do you think?
I don't know.
"Oh, my God."
It's so weird seeing myself on a bus like that.
"I mean, I can't believe it's really me up there."
I can't believe this is really happening.
"I can't believe it, either."
"I hate to bring this up, but we have work to do."
"Remember your predecessor, Marissa Kessler?"
Murder victim?
Multiple stab wounds?
Does that ring a bell?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Randy and the Captain are probably already there.
It should be just around the corner.
It's number 24.
24. 24. 24.
Are you done?
Sorry.
Let's do this.
What's the guy's name again?
Take it!
Go!
"Hold it, lady, what are you doing?"
Looking for somebody!
Who are you looking for?
Chao Fung-wu.
Chao Fung is at a chess game with his master and Highness.
Having a chess game?
I'll join them.
His Highness has ordered that there be no disturbance.
It's alright!
I won't tell anybody if His Highness loses.
What are you doing?
I'm just looking for his student.
No!
No?
Surround her!
This is ridiculous!
"Go away, or we'll do something!"
I won't leave unless I see Fung-wu.
Brother!
"Yan-ling, why do you figtht with them?"
You better go away with your sister.
And don't disturb the chess game!
The chess game?
He's playing chess with Mr. Law!
You came to find Fung-wu.
"Yes, they just won't let me in."
Mr. Royal Guard!
We are friends of His Highness.
You should at least tell Fung-wu that she's here.
That's right!
"Yes, certainly I am."
Do you ever stop and think that some of this could possibly be your fault?
What?
What?
I was too permissive?
"No, no, no, no."
"I'm not talking about the liberal child-rearing sense, Mom."
You blame everybody but yourself.
"You go out of your way, it's me, it's Kevin, it's Dad."
Where were you in the picture?
Do you ever think about that?
I don't see any ocean out there.
This is a terrible place to come to.
Please!
Please!
Just one minute!
One minute!
It's for my little girl.
Thank you so much.
You're so kind.
This must happen every night.
"Yeah, it's like ""Sophie's Choice"" in here."
What do you need?
I need a grass Hawaiian skirt for a hula.
"There's miriachis, which would be Mexico..."
Coconut cup?
Closer...
Ukelele...that's a good sign.
Sorry.
"No, don't tell me that."
Don't tell me that.
"Look, I'm sorry."
"Yes, 'tell'."
Let's say 'tell'.
- Tell 'Tell'.
It's a great sauce.
This is mayonnaise.
This is vinaigrette with...
With garlic.
- Oh yes.
And this is 'Iyutenitsa'.
"It looks like ketchup, but it's natural."
Do you want to taste it?
I?
Mr. Lloyd?
What's up?
OMG.
The Turkish security officer.
Jesus Christ.
I think he would have accompanied us to Sofia's embassy.
Absolutely not.
The escape of the king would be a humiliation for the Turks.
It could cause a diplomatic incident.
Bulut would bring us back to Istanbul to overthrow the scandal.
Let's go home.
In ambulance.
"Ludovic, we have to stop shooting right away."
"Mr. Lloyd, that's enough."
"- Well, Louise."
Duncan filmed the trip.
Ludovic?
Sire?
- I would like to drive.
Excuse me?
A wee little thing like you should be enjoying yourself.
Do you like to get high?
"Mm, naughty girl."
I only have this much.
"Uh, we can do blowbacks."
"Oh, it's been a while since I've had that... but I don't think so."
Do you have a light?
"Hm, sure!"
I knew I would be of some use.
Stupid fucking bitch!
You don't know anything.
Isn't it time you fucked off?
Back to Wisconsin or whatever fucking hole you came from!
"Brandeis was a front, obviously... to launder money, right?"
"So what, your Dad didn't think he had enough?"
The Bank was fucked.
Dad compartmentalized.
He was trying to save the ank.
How?
How?
Elena.
Who is she?
You're missing a fantastic party.
What are you doing?
"Oh, relax, Mom!"
"Marcello, go back outside."
"Irina, hold on..."
Don't she's a child!
I'm not a child.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Adriana!
We could've missed something.
All right?
"Look, here's the plan."
We're gonna...
"Um, start a fire in the kitchen, and it'll distract them."
Then we'll run.
There is no plan.
What are you gonna do with that?
I don't know.
I shouldn't have borrowed that money.
"No, Blair, this is not your fault."
Okay?
It's not.
All right.
Two kids come back from Christmas break.
"The first kid says to the second kid,"
I had the best Christmas ever.
"Got a new XBOX with every single game for it, a new bicycle, season tickets to my favorite basketball team."
What did you get?
"Second kid says, I only got a sweater."
"First kid says, why."
Second kid says...
"It's because I don't have cancer, Jimmy."
I know you're scared.
"No, it's..."
Actually kind of funny.
I'm pregnant.
What?
Oh my God.
I'm not.
I...
I just wanted to know what it would feel like to say that.
Bi Boo!
What are you doing?
Can't you speak clearly?
You have to say each word clearly.
Bi...
Boo...
Get out of there.
Let me try.
What?
The chair's too small for 2.
I sit on you then!
Why don't you sit in the middle.
Bi Boo...!
I got it...!
Bi Boo...!
"Here's a police car, get in!"
Hurry up!
"Sit tight, here we go!"
Casablanca.
Here I come!
I've got the 'Beast' finally!
"""The bright sun quickens the tempo of life."""

And that is you will never see me dance.
I'll put money on it.
"One day, you'll dance."
Who's that out there?
Jude Cassidy.
Don't think I care for you.
I just need you alive.
"What do you mean, he's gone?"
Argument about the M25 got out of hand.
An argument with the M25?
You can't leave me here on my own.
"I don't know who to go to, Rose."
No sign of him leaving Mercer's flat.
I'll have to tell Lenny.
You'll sign Calum's death warrant.
Somebody's lying to me.
What's given can be taken away.
"Calum, let's discuss Jude's disappearance again, shall we?"
Pete?
Emergency services.
Which service do you require?
Which service do you require?
Hello?
"Hello, is anyone there?"
Hello?
- I didn't...
- What?
- Know anything.
- What didn't you know?
It wasn't...
You knew.
Nanteuil.
What's the matter?
We've been robbed.
- How?
- On the train.
The gold was bound for the Bank of Munich.
It wasn't monitored?
The conveyors didn't last long.
- They were thrown off the train.
- By whom?
A man.
Dressed in black.
A conveyor crashed on a pylon.
The others could make it but they're in poor shape.
A man.
All in black.
- Are you Mr Fandor?
"- Yes, why?"
"You must go at once to 46 Bonaparte St, 4th Floor."
This is Juve's address.
You must be mistaken.
No.
Not at all.
"Fandor, my boy!"
My boy!
Juve?
Is that you?
It's me in the flesh.
"When Lady Beltham's hotel blew up, you were found dead under the rubble."
"This is what I have made believe, in agreement with the Director of the force, Mr Havard."
"Immediately after the explosion, several of my men were found dead, some shredded."
One of them was unrecognizable.
- She's adorable in any outfit.
She is.
Damn her.
I looked like...
I literally look like a man who is...
Like a man who's...
A big man in this school uniform.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Who invented that?
- You're nuts.
"- Ari, you look adorable."
"- Oh, thank you, honey."
And I look like crap.
Fluffy.
- Fluffy.
Fluffy.
- Fluffy.
Fluffy.
"- Here we are, two girls..."
- Exuberant.
...off into the night.
You just came out of that door looking like you're surprised that you came out of that door.
- How did you achieve that?
- What does that mean?
You came out of the door like you didn't expect to.
Maybe one of the one of the ADs just pushed me out.
"- Oh, right."
- I didn't realize that we were rolling.
"Is it true that there's only, like, a few Yugos in the world?"
Here's a story:
I hit my head here really hard.
- It hurt.
- Would you?
- Mm.
"And, well... kinky."
Filthy.
Just arseholes.
A pair of complete and utter kinked-up... filthy racist arseholes.
"We've just left a vulnerable young boy with a pair of not only instinctive killers, but heinous pervs."
You do realise I'm zipping my coat up and going back there?
"Yeah, and I'm coming with you."
Mitchell?
Yeah?
Mitchell?
Are you packing?
"Unpacking, still."
"Oh, boys."
Your phone rang.
"Oh, thank you."
It's a withheld number.
Which usually means something official.
"Like a job, say."
They've left a message.
- It won't be good news.
"- Oh, you don't know that."
- Put it on loudspeaker.
- Uh.
Go on.
"Please, please, please."
"Hello, John."
This is Nita Mawulawde.
- That's how you say it.
- Duh.
I'm calling in regard to your interview this morning.
"Brígida Bonazzi. divine, it enters, Brígida Bonazzi, enters, enters, between..."
"Ah, you, Brígida Bonazzi are very good."
It will not do damage to him?
"No, it will seat to him either, it will seat to him very or."
"Oh, what pretty you are..."
You have paid attention?
"Small nose, small nose, small nose..."
Nothing is heard.
In the end that son of puta fuck really.
What is going to fuck that.
-You are very bad?
poor truth?
"-Who, I?"
"Oh, there are lost the memory."
"Calm, now you will see."
"Yes, yes, I want to see."
"Well, slowly, first I clear this to me..."
You do not hear anything?
Listening...
"-Thus, slowly?"
eh?
-Yes.
"Yes, now you will see pretty legs."
Thus...
Thus...
Fuck!
Now you are going to see.
"It quiets, you do not move, I am in charge."
-Let go.
I do not touch myself.
-It quiets.
You do not resist.
My mother says she's well.
Has she eaten or not?
"Yesterday evening, she took her a meal."
She didn't touch it.
My young uncle fed her.
He's fallen out with my mother.
They don't speak.
Why?
He wanted to feed her?
No.
They fell out a long time ago.
"Why is he your ""young uncle""?"
- How many do you have?
- Three.
- Are the others older?
- Yes.
Bravo.
Where are they?
"One is in Ahwaz, the other in Kermanshah and I don't know where the third one is."
Don't they visit their mother?
"Yesterday evening, my uncle told my mother that his holidays were over."
But they've fallen out.
How did he tell her?
My uncle speaks to her but my mother doesn't reply.
- The others aren't coming?
- No.
"Yesterday, my uncle told my mother that he has to go back."
He's leaving then?
Yes.
What about us?
I don't know.
I have exams that I have to take.
Lamaze.
Is that where they do the breathing that ease the pain?
"Yeah, it actually works."
"You know, you breathe fast and then slow, you know, like..."
"I don't know, like-- like a dog or something."
I wouldn't touch that line with a road crew tour bus.
Do you remember everything you've ever touched?
I'm just saying.
"Gentlemen, seriously, this has been a pleasure."
"Don't hurt yourselves tonight, all right?"
Take care of yourself.
"All right, Morgan--"
All right.
Later.
"All right, everybody in."
Come on.
"Come on, let's go."
Ante up.
Ante up.

Hey.
"Hey, beautiful."
How was the poker game?
Mmm.
Ah.
Broke even.
Oh.
But...
This little one chillin' inside your beautiful belly didn't do so badly.
Whatever that means.
"Master Y an, Master Zhou has been slain"
The body is lying outside
"Dad, don't know who did it this time?"
"Brother Y an, you see!"
You see!
Who killed him?
Who killed him?
Who did that?
"Brother Y an, what should we do?"
"That's right, Brother Y an, what should we do?"
What should we do?
Let's go!
"Go, go!"
"Wait, it'll be dangerous for us to stay here!"
What do you mean?
"If we stay here, we'll be killed all the same!"
I guess we should leave tomorrow!
T omorrow?
Now!
The bad guys of the boxing world
"I'm sorry, did I scare you all?"
How come everyone is here?
You want to flee?
Leaving Y an Qingwang here all by himself?
He'll be lonely!
So it's you!
It's too late now to know!
No wonder you look like a pig!
"Y an Qingwang, why are you so late?"
You should've come sooner to see my act
"You bastard, since you're here!"
My brothers died suddenly
"Oh, God."
"Oh Albert, I love you."
Do it this way.
Oh yeah...
Oh Albert!
(wistful cello music)
That'll be nice.
You can pick me up at the airport Charles de Gaulle...
Anna!
I met this guy...
"I look forward to work with you, too."
"No, I talked with them yesterday."
Thank you.
"OK, goodbye."
Au revoir.
- I met this handsome guy at the gym.
- So Albert is history now?
No.
"But he needs a place to stay, so I said my flatmate was going away."
"That's fine by me, as long as you take care of it all."
"Thank you, God!"
This guy will make your mouth water!
Tell Mr Mouthwatering that he can rent my room while I'm away.
He can pick up the keys on Saturday.
I love you!
If I'd known the true identity of this Mr Mouthwatering -
- I'd never have said yes.
- I know a trick.
- What's keeping him?
- What if he can't find it?
- Relax.
He's smart and he's gorgeous.
What?
It's no good.
I can't understand a word you're saying.
And don't get artistic.
Just peel the bloomin' thing.
Harris tweed.
Your father had a suit not dissimilar to this one.
I remember.
It lasted him for years.
"It's a lovely colour, Janet."
Hmm.
That's as may be.
That's it.
"You don't think it a little heavy for the summer, Mr. Penhaligan?"
"No, the advantage of tweed, Miss Widdington, is that it allows the wearer to breathe, as it were, because of the openness of the weave."
- I see.
- I like it.
It's also very hard wearing.
And the price?
Um... just over three guineas.
"Oh, good Lord."
[Whispering]
"Oh, yes."
And that includes an extra pair of trousers.
And without?
"Zip or button fly, sir?"
"Zip, please."
[Penhaligan]:
2 pounds and 15 shillings.
Fine.
Shirts?
Certainly.
Hey.
I didn't think I'd see you again.
"Look, I wanted to say thanks for the other night."
You always drink like that?
I thought you left.
I did.
I am.
"Ryan, we're all set."
You ready?
"Hi there, Marissa."
What are you doing?
Nothing.
We're just hanging out.
"Oh, look, it's somebody's birthday."
I guess my invitation probably got lost in the mail.
It's my friend Summer's birthday.
Summer's birthday is not till Wednesday.
That's what I heard.
I don't know.
That was a guess.
You guys are up to something.
"Dude, what did you tell her?"
I didn't tell her anything.
I think the black turtleneck in August tipped her off.
"Okay, I was going for stealth, and also it's slimming."
We should really go.
Have fun at your party.
You should probably be off.
Newport social scene awaits.
"Oh, yeah?"
Why won't you tell me where we're going?
This is pretty far away.
I swear.
If I knew anything.
I can handle it from here.
Okay.
"So, if he loves Sara so much why did he lie to us about seeing his mother?"
"He didn't lie to us, he lied to his father."
Huh.
"Your parents are still married, aren't they?"
"Okay, so Jessica's angry enough to manipulate her son."
You think she's angry enough to go further?
Angry ex-wives don't leave their last vic on ice and a prayer card at the scene.
Angry ex-wives have friends.
Hello?
Are you alone?
Yeah.
What's going on?
I said I didn't want the FBI protection.
Did Dad have me followed anyway?
"I don't know, Marce."
Probably.
Are you with Ben?
No.
I slept in my car.
What are you talking about?
I'm scared.
"Look, whatever's going on, just come home."
I can't.
Not yet.
The FBI wants to talk to you.
They know you and Sara were fighting.
How do they know that?
I told them.
Turn the cannons on them!
Turn the cannons!
"Break them, Lo!"
What's happening?
I can't see what's happening to my boys!
What's happening to my boys?
"Major, give me your glasses."
There's a rebel.
Take him prisoner.
"Will you help me up, please?"
"Sir, could you tell me what your name is?"
Who you are?
I would like to see General Hancock.
Do you know where General Hancock may be found?
"I'm sorry, sir."
The general is down.
- He's been hit.
- No!
Not both of us.
Not all of us.
"Please, God."
"Sir, we're having a surgeon come as quickly as we can."
"Can you hear me, son?"
"Yes, sir."
I can hear you.
Will you tell General Hancock that General Armistead sends his regrets?
Will you tell him how very sorry I am?
"I will tell him, sir."
I will tell him.
"General Webb, sir."
"Let go of the horse, Major."
"Major Sorrel, I said let go of the horse."
And to determine the degree of infiltration.
-Infiltration by whom?
-Alpha Draconians.
-Draconians?
Jaelen!
"Jaelen, what's happened?"
Jaelen...
"-They took it, Robert."
They took our baby.
-Alright we gotta... we gotta go.
- I'll take you to my house.
- That'd be perfect.
-It's safer.
- Our army is coming here to establish complete dominion.
It has always been our intent to shield you from this threat.
But we are entrenched in war and we haven't the means to bring the fleet here to protect you.
It is to be your darkest age.
"- Man, look at that."
Look at that.
Look at that.
That's amazing.
-Open that one.
-Wow.
-Open that one.
That's amazing.
Wow.
- We're gonna set the world on fire with this.
-And I think soon.
"- There, I got it."
"- Dude, we got a helicopter."
Right behind there.
See?
Why can't they see that?
Those fools!
It's me.
What!
?
I'll be right there.
"Chief, the medical team reports that Miya Shikitani has regained consciousness."
She's conscious...?
Dan...
Gai...
Oh...
Is it that time already?
Shall we go?
You haven't changed at all.
"I was just about your age, too."
How strange...
"For the past 17 years, you and I have lived together as one..."
From that day I first met you...
All this time...
Who... are you?
Protect it...
What is this?
Dangaioh.
Dangaioh...?
- You're almost there.
"Yeah, you got that."
Areyousure it's okay that we came here ?
"Well, it is now, but ifwe're going to keep on doing this, we're gonna have to fiind someplace else to practice."
Did you always want to be a doctor ?
Who said I wanna be a doctor ?
Chenille.
Everybody.
Right now!
Geez.
It's 11:29 at the tone.
Bing!
That's 56 minutes.
That's my best time yet.
"And I know I could do better on the road, because this last stretch of beach is all soft sand."
"What do you think this is, a gymnasium?"
"Hey, man, you stay in pretty good shape, huh?"
About how many miles do you jog a day?
Only eight.
Eight.
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, you swim a lot too, huh?"
Now and then.
I bet you can ride a bike pretty good.
Bicycle?
"T.C.,"
I am not in training to enter the Iron Man contest.
Honest.
A guy'd have to be crazy to do that.
"First you swim five miles, then you marathon 26 miles, then ride a bike a hundred miles all in the same day."
"Yeah, this is Rick."
I bet you could do it.
No bet.
Okay.
"Thomas, that was Jimmy at the gate."
There's a woman here to see you.
This has gotta stop.
"I mean, as Higgins would say, this is a private club, not an office."
Not an office.
My aunt was a Grimm all these years.
I didn't even know it.
Look.
I can show you film right here that will blow your mind.
[Door closes]
Juliette!
I know how this sounds.
This is why I didn't want to tell you.
This is why my aunt told me I shouldn't be with you.
"You need to talk to somebody, Nick, but it's not me."
"Juliette, I'm trying to explain."
Okay.
"Okay, remember that hair you found on the horse when it was attacked?"
You couldn't figure out what it was.
That is what I'm talking about.
You need professional help!
"No, Juliette."
"Look, yes, I understand why you're saying that."
There's one more thing I can do to prove to you--
"- Nick, please."
"Stop, okay!"
- You're really scaring me!
- I don't want to scare you.
I just want you to know the truth.
Come with me.
Just give me this one last chance.
"Hey, Nick."
Juliette.
What a pleasant surprise.
I think.
Come on in.
All right.
Tore it apart.
"All right, I'm on my way home."
"If he hit your place, he's probably going to hit mine."
Is Juliette home?
- No.
"- Well, don't let her go home."
- She's in the hospital.
- What?
What happened?
- Is she okay?
- I don't know yet.
But I can meet you at your place.
"No, you stay."
You take care of yours.
All right.
Then call for backup.
"Come on, work with me here."
I enjoy The Strand magazine as much as the next man but I am perfectly aware that Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character.
Get out!
Do you have a goldfish named Colin?
No.
Thought not.
Now...
Ooh!
I see this is one of your business cards - it says so on the front!
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
This.
"Wakey, wakey!"
"That is highly valuable equipment, you must step away now."
We are the Intelligence.
Oh!
"I don't mean that, but there's a..."
"Well, there is a certain way to do it."
"Oh, you mean little girls come with a set of instructions?"
No.
"No, what I mean is there are different kinds of kisses."
There.
Is that clear?
No.
Unless you mean little girls and little boys should kiss like this.
"Yes, yes, that's it."
Is that what I was doing?
"No, I'm..."
I'm afraid it wasn't.
You mean I was doing something like this.
Yes.
(STUTTERING) Yes.
That looked like what you were doing.
And I should have been doing this.
"Yes, that's it."
Now I'm all confused.
I forgot what I'm not supposed to do.
Wilbur.
"Oh, yeah."
I remember now.
(STUTTERING) That's enough!
"Hello, Bob."
Hello.
"Look, you stick to the little ones."
The big ones are mine.
"Now, don't... don't be silly."
I was just telling Willy here how to protect himself.
I don't think Wilbur needs protection.
- This week she thinks it's 1935!
-
"- Oh, dear!"
Tell you what.
I'll p--pop over tonight.
"If she catches us cuddling,"
-- you can introduce me as Stanley B--Baldwin!
-
"- No, thank you!"
"Play your cards right, I can get you a place on my cabinet!"
Or maybe in my sideboard!
I'm going to work.
Come over later and I'll get supper.
Lovely.
I'll b--bring a bottle of wine.
W--Wear something comfy.
"As we're almost related by marriage,"
I think it's time I introduced you to the secret practices of the small shopkeeper!
-
- Out of me way!
-
- Ow!
Ooh!
"Oh, dear!"
Not the easiest place to stick a plaster on!
G--Granville!
Fetch your toolbox!
"Oh, dear."
Where's y--your vest?
What are you doing out without a vest?
"Now, don't start."
I'm finished with all that clobber.
Nevermore.
No.
No.
Here you go to believe.
"Do not believe this about me, major lord!"
Towards a dawn Mariska's limbs started becoming stiff.
Ágika was refreshed again.
He was Tót in the baddest state.
His brain rumbled.
His sense organs stopped working.
He hallucinated.
It was light.
"I think, his time to go to bed."
This was superb one.
We felt very well.
- I hope for it tomorrow we continue.
- Of course.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Major lord.
Sweet dreams major lord.
"Sleep tight, Ágika."
Mom.
He kissed my forehead.
What do you say to this?
"We have to go to bed, my sweet good Lajos."
"Ow, my Gyula, my Gyula."
My small son.
"Well, not wonderful, mom?"
He was not tired.
"With regret inform it the Hungarian Red Cross, that yours son, Tót Gyula is an ensign in the fight against the enemy, died a hero."
(Field post 809/3)
"Well, I won it."
"Hey, mate."
I want a shot to get it back.
"Fuck you, Commodore."
I won this money.
All right?
"It's all right with me, pal."
-Good meeting' with ya.
"-Come on, Jim."
Wait a minute.
Let's play.
Did you see that good-looking girl that I was talking to leave here?
"No, I don't know where she went."
"Okay, you can turn 'em on."
I told you we shouldn'a hooked this up in the rain in the first place.
"Finish up, already."
-You check the connections?
"-Yes, I checked the connections."
-Did you check the switch?
-I checked the switch.
"Well, go check the hookup."
"Your boss say, ""Sign work both day and night."" I wanna lights on."
"-Want a cup of coffee, Nick?"
-Turn 'em on.
He's checkin' the hookup.
"Well, hurry up."
I wanna see lights on.
Turn on.
"Where the hell is it, anyhow?"
"Go around there, he said it's around to the left."
"Yeah, I think I've found it."
He would have found us anyway.
"Once she starts, she'll never stop."
- How true!
"It's so different, seeing it in real life instead of just reading a book about it."
This goes on every evening at our place.
He just comes home from the orchard...
"Let's not forget, hydroponic agriculture only started in the 21st century."
Back in this century they couldn't even control the weather.
Gee!
My dad!
"- Bye, then."
- Bye.
Didn't I tell you to get home earlier?
What's that in your hand?
Give me it!
Fido!
Fido!
Adam!
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you!
Give it to me!
"Dad, I didn't..."
I just...
Fido!
Dear God!
This dog is driving me crazy!
Look what he just did!
"You're the one who should look, at all these women!"
- Take it away!
- It's disgusting!
Wasting time on this instead of studying!
- My dear son!
- This kid will never amount to anything!
Huh?
[ Gasps ] I'm falling!
"Oh geez, I'm falling."
Guys!
"Yeah, but if he did have a jet pack, he could just put it on upside down!"
"Uh, they still cant hear me!"
My phone!
I dropped my phone!
Why do my powers just keep coming and going?
I was just so happy to be home.
Wait!
That's it!
Happiness!
My floating power's tied to my emotions!
"[ Groans ] Right, just like all my stupid powers!"
Ooh!
"Okay, right, I can control this!"
I just have to think happy thoughts and no negative thoughts!
"So, what makes me happy?"
Donuts?
"No, I'm not gonna get any."
The beach!
"No, that's where I'm going to die."
[ Thud ]
Mom?
"Oh geez, those feelings are complicated."
"Come on, come on, brain, time's running out!"
I just need something that makes me happy!
Something I can always depend on to cheer me up!
♪
My guys!
They spent all night with me just to keep me company.
"Look, you Boss told you to give me something in this replacement."
Then give me and go.
"No, How could I give you that?"
"It's not your age, Age not concerns."
"You know, how many little people has gone there."
"Look, I can't raise you up."
"I am saying, Sorry."
"I am saying, Sorry."
"You were the only Laxmi, Who was my last hope,"
"And If you betrays me, then what will happen with me?"
Think about it.
"Kill me, Kill me, Please, I want to go up."
"Kill me, Laxmi!"
"Leave me,"
"Kill me, please!"
Kill me.
Let me go.
What you've done?
We stop him to go.
"Don't touch him, He is my Laxminarayan."
"No, he's our Laxminarayan."
Who told you?
"He's our piece, He's not a piece, he's Laxminarayan."
"He's ours, He's mine."
"He's ours, He's mine."
One minute.
"Yes, Madam, Where are you?"
You know Laxminarayan was coming on 11:00.
"Yes, Madam but how could he?"
He's lay down here.
"He is not, He stands next to me."
You people come soon here.
"She loved me, you must understand."
"What, you think I don't understand love?"
It's better for the other.
- What's next?
- For what is above.
But you talk to God?
Could you not remain just for two minutes?
It would be sad.
- What isn't?
Open your eyes.
- I don't know how to see.
- But I know inside and I see later ...
- And have I came inside?
Young.
Want to check?
- So I'll be like your bitch!
"- No, you would not do."
And is this what you want?
"You are truly a beautiful asshole, cousin."
It's André.
"André, that's my cousin Leon."
André is a guy who fucks good.
"It is well established by my mother, and I was placed in his lap."
"Marivaux is nice, but side slut, he prefers me."
And once in America that could be done?
Mr. de La Fayette will give the instructions.
Aglaé!
- Aglaé!
- I come!
There is Simon there?
Who has two ...
There are two ...
You asked how long we've been friends a minute ago.
Oh yes...
Alright.
- We met in a hospital.
- In a hospital?
Yea.
"It was that dull hospital over at Lexington, know it?"
No.
We were doctors.
"I mean, surgeons."
Violet tells me to say surgeons.
"Working at the hospital never gave me bad dreams, that's for sure."
"Anyway, she's my best friend ever."
I'm kinda worry about her sometimes though.
"Half the time, I wish I was more like her."
And then...
What?
I don't know.
She reminds me of my daughter.
Is that her on the phone machine?
But it's not important.
"It is, but... don't let it distract you."
- What's with that?
- What's with what?
The numbers you two have.
- This?
- Yes.
"Oh, that's our rank."
Officially I'm killer number Nine and Violet's killer number Eight.
And how do you move up?
Makin' hits.
Vi says it beats dead entries.
"No, no, that ain't the woman!"
I ought to know!
"- Curly ought to know, too."
"- You're screwy, Curly."
That's just somebody who looks like her.
"You ain't going to work the boy over, are you?"
"That all depends on you, Joe."
You wanna talk?
"Listen, boy- You're not mine, see?"
"They just think you are, see?"
"So no matter what they do to you, you can take it."
I know that you can.
"Just like your old man, see?"
I don't know what you're talking about!
Let me go home to mother and dads!
"Don't let them throw you, Joey!"
Start him off.
"I think you'll decide to talk, Joe."
"Start walking, Sonny."
- What ?
- Get a move on!
Walk!
Pick them up!
Feet!
Feet!
"All right, my son."
Dad's at breakfast.
"You're not going to sleep all day, are you?"
"Oh, always throwing your things around."
Don't you want to eat breakfast ?
Paul!
Paul!
I had a dog like him once.
I went to have him put down.
He jumped out of my arms at the vet's and took off for the park.
Sometimes I still think I see him out there...
... watchingme...
... gnawingonan oldbone.
Excuse me.
"Hello, Nettie."
Can I help you with the basket?
"No, no. I didn't know Frank was expecting you."
Due espressi?
.
Maybe later.
"99 out of 1 00 times, we can beat something like this."
I don't like the odds.
We go back a long way.
"I know, I know."
"I tried to close the door, Frank."
Couldn't get it shut.
-What do you want me to do?
-Take the pressure off yourself.
Here's the thing.
They'll tell you:
"""""Yeah, yeah, sure."
You have the key to the cell.
"Go ahead. """""
But you won't be able to open it without singing.
You're a singer.
"Give me a chance, and I'll show you how quiet I can be."
"It's out of my hands, Frank."
"Do the right thing, will you?"
-Make it easy for yourself.
"Hey, you!"
Help the women!
Hurry up!
Try to get into the church!
"Faster, faster!"
"Run to the church, everybody!"
Hurry up!
They could be here any second now!
Stop!
Stop or we'll shoot!
Stay where you are!
Stay back!
Close all entrances.
Anyone who tries to escape will be shot.
"- Get back, everybody."
Come on.
- Get back.
What are you going to do with these people?
"Mind your own business, priest."
"- Father, what do these men want?"
- Begin.
No.
"For heaven's sake, no!"
No!
- You're insane!
Bloody murderers!
- Get back!
Carrasco used you so that he could escape.
"- Come on, take out two more."
"- All right, Coronel."
Get up!
Come on!
- Really?
- Sure did.
"So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?"
"Oh, well, Gary told me you said hi."
- I didn't say hi.
- You didn't?
"No, I told him to send you my regards."
I didn't say hi.
- Regards?
"- Yeah, regards."
"Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug."
"Oh, I hate smugness."
Don't you hate smugness?
Smugness is not a good quality.
"Oh, my God, that man over there."
I think he's wearing glasses that look like Jake's.
Pull over.
Stop the car.
Here.
I think I've got a way of getting back at my ex- boyfriend.
Good.
Revenge is very good.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
"Sir, sir?"
- Yeah.
"If you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?"
- Malaysia.
- Malaysia?
Yeah.
"Look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?"
"Union or no union, if you,re not ready, you,II pay!"
"- We,II see about that."
"- Yes, we will!"
"We,re not afraid of the minister."
"I,ve got a few things to tell him."
If you bother the minister with your problems -
This is the control room.
"hello, Schneider."
Did you drop something?
"This is Dr. GoIdberg, eminent psycho-futuroIogist, and his assistant, Mr. -"
Very interesting.
What happens here?
"That,s what we,re here to show you."
follow me.
This is our team.
"It,s an honor."
What is it?
"You're a Brahmin who's here to cook for Jai, right?"
But Jai is a non-vegetarian!
How will a Brahmin cook that?
That's between Jai and me.
Why must you interfere?
Okay.
I have something else to say.
What is it?
That's between Jai and me!
"I'll tell Jai, of course!"
"Atleast you tell me, Ratna."
"I will speak to Jai, too."
Okay.
Sit here and wait for Jai.
I'm off for a bath.
"I mean, it's neutral."
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.
So it could be whatever.
"It could be an office, it could be a guest room a gym, a baby's room..."
[LAUGHS]
"Wait, did you mean ""neutral,"" or ""gender-neutral""?"
- I don't know what you're talking about.
"- Oh, really?"
I know we said we'd wait to talk about it.
BEN:
Uh-huh.
- Mm-hm.
But I think that we're almost ready to start talking about it.
[UP-TEMPOED MUSIC PLAYING]
JARRAD:
So that's the last time I do anything pro bono.
[GIGI LAUGHS]
"Well, ladies, I guess I have to get back to the office."
You go back to the office after happy hour?
What's happy about that?
I met you.
I would love to call you sometime.
Do you have a card?
- Of course.
"- Oh, great."
Here is my info.
"- Nice to meet you, Janine."
- Nice to meet you.
"Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi."
"Oh, wait."
So how are we doing this?
- I'll call you back in an hour.
Bye.
They belong together.
They've danced for the Pope.
What kind of music is that?
They brought it with them.
Who would want to listen to that?
The Pope?
How would I know?
"Man Viktor, I wanted a singer."
Ask them if they can sing.
Excuse me.
Do you have a song prepared?
"Singing, songs!"
What's this pop shit?
What's this one's name here?
-That's Angie.
"Angie, Bring me a soda."
That's going to take a little while...
"First, I have to finish up the glasses, boss."
We could forget about the girls and just do your uncle's quiz show.
Why can't she just bring me a soda when I order a soda.
She likes to do one thing after another.
"Listen Viktor, let me tell you something."
Even if the quiz show works out...
Which we have no idea about yet...
It will work out.
I want a number here with a singer.
High class!
Alright.
High... class!
I'll take care of it!
Sex with a minor was all they could get him on.
Why was that?
She wouldn't cooperate.
Said he was a genius and apparently that's what geniuses do.
I wouldn't know what geniuses do.
I'm just a dumb arse cop.
I know nothing about art.
"Sleep well, Mr Greene."
(Door opens)
(Door closes)
I hear you had a big win.
"Oh, for God's sake, Barney."
Alright!
He was a man that I met at the Adelaide conference.
He's English.
And he is now safely back in Devon with his wife and he will never ever come back here.
What's his name?
Does it matter now?
You don't know him and I'm never gonna see him again.
OK!
OK.
John.
Bartrop.
John Bartrop.
There.
You happy now?
Bleeding saints.
Recognise this?
Guido Reni.
In six months the streets would have made him ugly.
He would have died in a crack haze down some lane.
"I gave him that, his moment of absolute perfection."
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
"Ready, set, go!"
"Hi, Harvard."
Going to invite me to the big game?
If it isn't my childhood sweetheart.
How are you?
Take a look.
Draw your own conclusions.
You've certainly improved with age.
Things must've been dull for you these past months.
You're right.
"Come on, let's take a walk."
What would your father say?
"Look, Betty, I don't care about that."
- Come on.
- Outings leave me cold.
"Let's grab some sandwiches, I've got a pint and go down to Crystal Pond."
"Hey, you can think for yourself once in a while, can't you?"
Okay.
"Hey, let's go get a hot dog or something."
- Okay.
- Good.
- Let's go swimming or something.
- Okay.
Okay?
- See that.
- What?
"Allison and Norman on their way to Crystal Pond to swim, all by themselves."
So what?
"They're young, happy, maybe in love."
What trouble can they get into?
It won an Oscar.
Rocky IV has Stallone in it... and he bashes a Russian's face to all smithereens.
"Lifting anvils and shit, and pulling trucks through the snow."
Million Dollar Baby is totally unrealistic.
- Girls can't fight.
They don't have muscles.
- It's true.
"Okay, that is a horribly sexist thing to say."
It's not sexist.
It's just truthful.
Girls can't pull trucks through snow.
- Can you pull trucks through snow?
- I absolutely could.
- You can barely walk in the snow.
- Excuse me.
Time out.
Is the truck parked in neutral?
- Hey!
"- What, dude?"
Empty your pockets.
- Now.
- Okay.
"Hey, let's just all stay calm."
Nice friends.
Maybe... one to two inches of snow?
- One to two inches...
- And a Ford F-150.
Right.
"In park, but no emergency brake."
Maybe I could pull it four feet.
- I'd give him four feet.
- I'd give him five.
You look beautiful tonight.
I'm not just saying that.
You really do.
I heard you.
Why don't you have some coffee?
I'll go find Claire.
"Claire, where have you been?"
Alex is looking for you.
"- Oh, brother, it's starting already?"
- Come on.
How could you do this?
I may never forgive you.
I may never forgive you.
That's another story.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Yes.
Yes.
- Yes!
- I'm Professor Gregory Larkin.
I'm calling about the response to my ad.
Is this Professor Morgan?
"No, this is her sister."
Rose doesn't even know I answered the ad.
"Well, then maybe we shouldn't be talking."
No!
"Please, it's just that Rose would never answer an ad herself."
"I mean, some of these guys are such creeps and losers."
"But when it said you taught at Columbia, something just clicked inside."
"- You have seen her picture, right?"
- Yes.
- And?
Drink it in.
- What the fuck?
- That looks like Osama bin Laden's beard.
"I know, right?"
"All right, boys."
Your turn.
Let 'em dangle.
- Let's just do it.
- Bring it.
Count of three?
One.
"Two, three."
"You guys are awesome, man!"
That's not even necessary.
- Would you please--
"- Oh, my dick!"
My dick cost a late-night fee
Your dick got the HIV
My dick plays on the double feature screen
Your dick went straight to DVD
My dick bigger than a bridge
Your dick look like a little kid's
"My dick large like the Chargers, the whole team"
Your shit look like you 14
"My dick locked in a cage, right"
Your dick suffer from stage fright
My dick so hot it's stolen
Your dick look like Gary Coleman
My dick pink and big
- This car is frickin' sweet.
"- Yeah, yeah, it's sweet."
'Cause we're fugitives.
"Look, I said I was out."
"I know, I know."
I respect your decision.
This is for Morgan.
He was your patient.
He talk about medieval torture?
In disturbing detail.
Big weirdo.
"Well, see ya."
"Annie, wait."
You just said you respected my decision.
It's not about that.
I have a favor to ask you.
A favor for you is like the kiss of death.
"I need you to go to this address and babysit on this guy for the day, make sure he stays sober."
- Not interested.
- I'll pay you.
"Look, I know I'm an asshole."
And I've been reckless... but everything I've done was to try to protect us.
"And I can fix this, but I need your help."
Who is he?
He's a friend.
$50 an hour.
"You really will be a millionaire one day, Annie."
I know.
"Hey,"
I bet this is one of them self-melting driveways.
Yeah.
I bet you should've been a football player.
Yeah.
Mrs. Dixon?
What's going on?
"Uh, with your mom and a six-pack?"
You don't really help the situation.
You could at least try to be nice.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
It's hard for me to show kindness to people that hate me.
I'm not that evolved.
So a movie tonight?
Whatever you wanna do is fine by me.
- But I'm late and I gotta go.
- Okay.
All right.
And the keypad is for texting which is what you do when you want to avoid talking to someone.
"Anna, it's Jeremy."
Uh...
- I haven't heard from you in a while.
"- Ha, ha."
- Okay.
"- I didn't break it, I swear."
I was showing Harper what you taught me.
Marvelous device.
- Who was that?
- Jeremy Gilbert.
- Is that your boyfriend?
- Of course not.
- What do you think?
- Very respectable.
That's the goal.
I can't say that I miss corsets.
Susie Sunshine gave me her car keys.
And her ATM card.
- What's that?
- I'll explain later.
Is he in an athletic tank?
"""An athletic tank""?"
Yeah.
"I believe that's the nice way of saying ""wifebeater."""
"That's the new way of saying the ""W. B.""?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"Where I'm from, they call them wifebeaters because everyone on ""cops"" was wearing those."
"That's... by the way, everyone calls them wifebeaters."
Okay.
What's the new thing...
"""Athletic tank""?"
"""Athletic tank"" is what it says on the package."
[ Laughter ] Is that a network...
"So, if a guy had, let's say, a classic land cruiser, what would you think?"
I love that car.
Like FJ40?
Yes.
I had one.
Really?
Is it for sale?
The last one I can think of...
And this is just off the top of my head...
"A guy with, say, a 1983 Honda Civic Wagon?"
Just picked that out of thin air.
Ah...
Totally redone.
No.
Right.
Interior/exterior?
"Yeah, plaid interior."
Plaid?
Wow!
It's so pretty!
Now you're becoming a great barista.
Right?
Unnie.
Your dad passing away must be really hard.
Your dark eye circles are going down to your chin.
Huh?
Cover it up a little before you head out the door.
Hello!
Da Hye!
Na Na unni!
You came.
Did you finish the things for your dad well?
Ah... well.
It turned out like that!
We are getting married!
Didn't I say you guys suit each other well!
Congratulations!
Thank you!
Na Na unni quit...
and Lee Yoon Sung's not there either.
The Blue House has become so tense...
"Well, but you said as long as you have me you'll always be happy."
Ah that's why marriage...
it's a really important decision.
Take it back!
"Take it back, unni!"
Da Hye!
"If you guys are busy and can't come, I can send you guys my bank account number."
You can put the wedding money in there!
"Be happy, Eun Ah."
Um... do you live here?
My dad has me on the weekends.
He's been online dating and he brings his dates here.
"But, on the bright side, I get to hang out with ol' Beanbag here."
"Up top, Beanbag."
Boom!
Yep.
We see a lot of Rudy.
Okay... rules:
"One, you can't leave the Juice Caboose for the duration of the trip."
"Two, don't bother me."
"And three, uh..."
always believe in yourself.
Thanks.
We can't leave the Juice Caboose?
Are you kidding me?
!
"Get comfy, 'cause this room is your life for the next four hours."
But there's nothing to do!
Open this door!
I can't hear you!
"The train's too loud... honk, honk."
"Honk, honk?"
!
Trains don't make that noise!
"All right, this is gonna be great."
We have a babysitter and a lot of alcohol.
"Wait, don't do..."
"No, don't do it!"
It's a tasting.
"You're supposed to swirl it around and shake the glass to open it up, or something."
"Hey, open up, wine!"
Are you a consultant?
Addons In summary:
"You are hypocritical, because it will,"
"Addons you start to consultation, before you give advice to others."
"Okay, now ..."
Addons Here ends the first round.
Addons Remember that we have an amazing gift.
Addons Thank you for participating in the game.
- Toast.
- Toast.
Toast ....
"Damn, it's just a game."
I know it will be a challenge.
"Let's play another round, maybe we dive."
Well as a good gift.
We've paid to play.
I wonder where they find it.
Photography is my profile.
I'm here to win the game.
Let us drink.
"They found something to do, right?"
Dave!
What is it with ...
You know that you ... with pircing site.
Damn.
That is ... it is good.
I think ...
- I'm infected with something ...
- Attack.
And I took ...
- Eggs?
- Pircing site.
"No, I've been trying to find a way for Scott to feed without killing ever since Mexico."
This could be his second chance.
What about those kids he killed?
Do they get a second chance?
[Carlos] Give me the goddamn bonds!
[pounding]
Come on!
"I'm coming, my little piggies!"
And I'm gonna make myself some chicharron de rinche!
Let's go!
"Go get 'em, cabrón!"
[sniffs]
[sniffs]
[Scott] Kate!
Get back here!
"They're too weak and hungry, they can't follow us."
Come on!
Stop!
What are you doin'?
Give me the bonds.
You're not gonna shoot.
"Look, I know it's hard to let family go."
"Just give me the bonds, or I swear to God the next one goes in your kneecap."
"Now, cuff yourself to the truck and throw me the keys."
Do it.
- You're making a huge mistake.
- No.
I am making up for one.
[slurping]
"[cracking sound] [grunts, gasps]"
Scott?
Scott.
is there somebody else I can talk to ?
"[Continues, indistinct]"
Wench. I gotta stand over her... to make sure she puts your name on the damn list.
Triflin' bitch.
Okay.
Ooo-kay.
Yeah.
Da da da da da da da da.
- l'll get that.
- [ Baby Gurgling ]
Da da !
I know. I know.
I know. I know.
"So, your dad's trippin' about the flight."
-Yeah.
-Probably thinks it's Derek's fault.
"No, I explained about Nikki."
"So, you put it all on her."
None of it's on you.
She started it.
I told you what she said.
"Maybe she didn't have no business getting up in your face, but she had reason to say what she said."
Wait a minute.
You agree with her ?
You and Derek act like it don't bother people to see you together.
Like it don't hurt people to see.
"Well, we like each other."
What is the big damn deal ?
"It's me and him, not us and other people."
"Black people, Sara."
Black women.
Derek's about something.
Good!
Yan.
"Yes, Send this picture to Ho Sai at once."
I want him to meet Foon in court.
"Master, why do you draw such pervertible picture?"
Do you feel happy?
"Brother Lone, we all count on you."
Please go ahead.
The witness must be bribed or threatened.
An eye for an eye!
I want to threaten them too.
Please find them out.
"And then torture them, make them confess."
Good idea.
How can you figure this idea out?
I...
I use my brain.
Don't worry.
Count on me.
"It's alright, count on me."
"Don't worry, count on me."
Brother Lone doesn't seems to be alright
"Your Honour, I would like to summon a new witness."
What big deal?
Your old man!
"Objection, how dare he scold my old man?"
"Come on, don't always object, can you listen his words first?"
Summon Sir Ho Sai.
I mean your dad!
This is my master.
Chan Mon-gut.
"Sir, thank you for your help."
What did you take?
What did you take?
No.
Aah!
No!
"How are your wrists, hon?"
I'm sorry they restrained you.
Lucy.
You've had another schizophrenic episode.
But we're gonna work on making you well.
"Lucy, why don't you introduce yourself to the group?"
"Hi, I'm Lucy."
I...
Obviously.
I go to law school.
- I went to law school.
- She's a schizo.
I saw them bring her in all strapped down and screaming.
Great.
"What'd you do, bite a cop?"
Bruce.
Okay.
"As if our party wasn't full enough with Chuckles, Forgetful, and Her Majesty here, now we add Schizo to the mix."
"Well, this isn't Club Med, so I doubt you're here for a tan."
"No, I, uh..."
I tried to:
Because I went off my meds.
Me too.
"Lucy, what do you think led you to make that decision?"
Um...
I wanted to prove to you that you were wrong.
Wrong about what?
Now listen.
The three of us are gonna work this out.
Yeah?
How?
"First things first, you're gonna put a dollar in my pocket, both of you."
You want attorney-client privilege?
So that everything you say is strictly between us.
I mean it!
Put a dollar in my pocket.
"Come on, make it official."
"Come on, do it!"
That's it.
Come on.
Just a dollar.
"All right, now you, ski bum."
Come on.
Give with the dollar.
- Go on.
- Be smart.
What?
- All I got's a 5.
- I'll take a 5!
"Come on, already."
Come on.
Be cool.
You're now both officially represented by Saul Goodman and Associates.
"Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment, all right?"
Take the ski mask off.
I feel like I'm talking to the Weather Underground.
Just do it.
So if a prison shanking is completely off the table... and we're sure of that?
No shanking!
Yeah!
"Yeah, yeah, kid, she's hot as a torch, but you don't know anything about her."
- I know plenty.
- Yeah?
Where's she from?
Somewhere else.
Why'd she leave?
Who cares?
"Her past doesn't matter, long as her future's with me."
"Oh, Petey, ever since this girl came to town, you got a dream in your head where your sense ought to be."
"- You know what, Dad?"
- What?
You're right.
Petey...
"I love you, Nicky Johnson."
Marry me.
Marcy came to see me.
She's fine.
Thought you'd like to know that.
Why didn't you bring her home?
She's 18.
"She's still my little girl, Agent Kelton."
"I'm sorry about that, but there was nothing I could do."
What we need to talk about is Curtis McNeal.
"Yeah, I just heard."
It's terrible.
"So what aren't you telling me, Senator?"
Excuse me?
"Look, I've worked a lot of kidnaps, but this one's different."
"They're trying to get to you, and they're trying to get to me."
Why?
I have no idea.
"Son, I got a man outside with a bullet in his leg."
Do you want to help me with him?
"I'm not outside, friend."
I'm right behind you.
"That's a safe place to be, if you're not a liar."
Have any water?
No.
"No, I don't."
"We're some thirsty, ma'am."
If you could just spare us a half a cup apiece.
We got less than a gallon.
It's for the boy.
Tommy.
Mmm.
"Oh, that sure is good, ma'am."
Haven't you got any manners?
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"It's miss, not ma'am."
"Where's your family, menfolk?"
"Well, yesterday, some men..."
Tommy!
They dead?
"They're away, that's all."
The storm's keeping 'em away.
And the Apaches?
"No, the Mongoles and the Chiricahuas water here."
We live at peace with them.
Oh?
"You live at peace with the marauders, too?"
"- They water here, too?"
- Not until you drank.
You better get off that leg.
Jalon!
- Oh!
"- Oh, no!"
It's nice to see you...
Holy shit!
I haven't seen you since we got arrested at the army induction center in [Indistinct].
What are you doing now?
I'm a doctor.
Baby!
I sell convertible bonds for Baldwin and byrne.
[Laughter]
Sounds brilliant.
"Hey, um, who's your friend?"
This is Dalton...
He's a cop.
A cop... that's a good one.
You always did have a sense of humor.
"Hey, want a joint?"
[Giggling]
You know that I have not seen jalon...
For twelve years?
"Those were some times, huh?"
"Yeah, they, uh..."
They were some times.
But they were a little different for you than they were for me.
What do you mean?
"Well, uh, I was there, and you were here."
Were you really?
Where do you think I was...
Sarah Lawrence?
"What I meant was, I haven't been out with anyone who was in Vietnam before."
"Well, most people from scarsdale wouldn't have."
Shouldn't you be a delivery man by now?
Harriet!
"Well, Harriet, I'll tell you."
"Not long ago, I had another life."
"I had a big business, I had a lot of money, and you know what?"
I was the most miserable man alive.
"So, one day, I told my wife that..."
- Wife?
"- I told my wife that I wanted to start all over again and if she wanted to, she could start all over with me."
So what happened?
"Oh, she left me, but that's all right, that was her choice."
"My choice was to become a delivery boy... well, man."
"I don't have the business, of course."
I don't have the money.
You know what?
My life is sweet again.
Hmm.
The wurst!
"Oh, no!"
My wurst!
"No, no!"
Oh...
"Oh, Lord."
"Oh, no."
No.
"Don't be sad, Katherine."
This is a blessing in disguise.
That's a pretty good disguise.
Don't you see?
The three of us have to go out for dinner.
- No.
- Yeah!
[Feigns laugh]
"It's gonna be a ""Day in the Life of a Chicago Firefighter"" sort of thing."
"We have a slow day, and you're just gonna reinforce the stereotype that all we do is sit around and eat."
"You got a problem with it, lieutenant?"
Go for it.
Drug tester's on his way.
"And again, this is mandatory."
"Hey, chief, there's a kid outside looking for you."
Thanks.
Good.
You came on by.
You said it was cool.
"It is, it is."
What's your name?
- Ernie.
- Ernie?
Chief Boden.
"You hungry, Ernie?"
"Hey, everybody."
This here is Ernie.
He's gonna be eating some turkey with us.
"- What's up, Ernie?"
"- Hey, Ernie."
"Hey, I need a sous chef, chief."
"Get over here, little man, we got a turkey dinner to prepare."
- Go ahead.
- Come on.
"First thing we gotta do, taste this gravy."
Tell me what you think.
- Good.
- It's good.
Where'd you find that mutt?
Where're they!
Tell me!
Tell me!
Go!
Wait
Where're they?
I let them go
You idiot!
What are you talking about?
You're wrong!
I'm a martial arts practitioner!
Get him!
"Master, the foreigners at the leprosarium have withdrawn suddenly"
Hurry!
Ask our men at the leprosarium to withdraw too
I want to save and set them free as well!
Someone set us free!
We want revenge!
Fight the Black Tiger Gang!
Fight the Black Tiger Gang to death!
Fight the Black Tiger Gang to death!
Fight the Black Tiger Gang to death...
Fight the Black Tiger Gang to death!
We have no fear for injury or death
We won't back off today
We want to get even with you
We won't back off!
We won't back off!
Quiet please!
Master Lei
We have 500 men here
"If we all fight, it will be a bloodshed"
That's Leslie Davison.
You guys go around back.
Make sure everything's all right there.
Looking for Officer Crowe.
They can't hear you.
You're dead.
You wanted to be Leslie.
"Well, you weren't good enough."
Somebody shoot that fucking car alarm.
"Say goodbye to the light, Emma."
I'm taking back the eyes you stole.
"Goddamn it, no!"
Over here!
Hold your fire!
You all right?
You all right?
"Sir, it's Crowe!"
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Ms. Brody, come with me."
Come on.
"Johnson, take the back."
Watch your head.
"Look, I know all of this has been hard on you... and again, I just want to thank you for everything."
I think we got enough now.
Sure you don't need to go to the hospital?
"No, think I've had enough of hospitals... for a while anyway."
Let me get somebody to take you home.
"I'll drop her off, lieutenant."
Why don't you take this.
Thank you.
It's the gray one.
I think I've got a ride home.
By the way she was really upset with me.
And Rosa?
I couldn't go to Rosa's place because her husband was there.
You didn't tell me that.
Truth is I felt offended by the failure of my marriage.
That's why I stayed at the hotel.
So absurd.
"-Quite absurd, yes."
Do you have any children?
One daughter.
Sara.
She kept her too.
I think that's great.
You tell me why?
We had terrible conflicts about Sara.
I started showing myself weak and falling back..
And all of a sudden I had to ask for permission to see my daughter.
(Praying)
Follow me.
She's much better now.
Jacoba!
Don't bother her.
Jacoba.
Who's there?
-I'm Máximo.
Máximo?
Did you come here from school?
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know if your parents are at home or if they've left.
Have you eaten already?
"Jacoba, how are you feeling?"
Bad.
You were right.
You knew it from the minute we saw him that day.
It wasn't kosher.
There was a second report.
That was only a feeling.
Now it's a fact.
5 people are dead.
Stern looks so judicial.
How could he be so corrupt?
The sweater unravels.
I'll give you one this time.
"""""The only thing new in this world is the history you don't know. """""
New Testament?
Harry Truman.
Judge Stern's a good man.
He's good?
5 people are dead!
-What's your point?
-You throw the book at the guy.
Embrace Detective Santos.
Max death settlement for her.
Medal of Honor for the deceased.
I'll make sure Leslie makes the morning editions with it.
So you got this all figured out?
"-That's my job, isn't it?"
-That's cold.
That's cold.
I mean you don't just... .
It's more complicated than that.
Forgive me.
I know the two of you are old friends.
Be careful how you judge people.
Ah.
"Yeah, I-I wouldn't know."
She and I are
Keeping our creative lives separate right now.
"Uh, you might wanna discuss this one,"
Since it involves her going to Haiti for three months.
"You know what, dad?"
I think I'm gonna have to cancel that waffle.
Okay.
All right.
See you.
Hey.
Um...
"I know this gala tomorrow night seems boring,"
"But I thought, uh, if there's a girl you like,"
Perhaps you'd like to invite her.
"Actually, I'm gay."
"So if I was going, which I'm not,"
Then my date would be a guy named Elliot.
That's cool.
Uh...
Bring Elliot.
I'd love to meet him-
Please stop acting like
You and I have any kind of relationship.
You're right.
Um...
I have a lot to make up for.
I'm sorry.
The window for that
"Closed somewhere between my 12th birthday and, um..."
My suicide attempt.
What the...?
..
Murder Squad...
"What are you bringing in here, you guys?"
!
This is crazy!
Successville.
"She's just a bit delusional, I'm so sorry."
"Sit down there, Elsie."
There you go.
"We're cops, Goddamn it, Cyrus!"
You're cops?
Yeah.
Why didn't you say you were cops?
What's this shit about?
You've made an enemy of one of the most powerful men in Successville.
How did I make an enemy?
"Work my arms, Dermot."
How did she make an enemy...?
"Both of them, Dermot."
What did I do?
I just...
What did you do?
"Yeah, what..."
You made me mad!
"You know what, you're crazy."
"You're dressed as an old lady, you have two pairs of glasses on and you've got a head scarf on."
"Screw you, buddy, I'm just a nice old person trying to help people!"
Really?
Yeah.
"How did you try and help Simon Cowell, when you pulled past his office the other night?"
You know what I did?
- You think he's been acting a part?
- No.
He loves her.
I am sure.
- Of course!
Has he left her any assurance of his return?
Ask if he proposed.
No!
I cannot force a confidence from Marianne.
Neither should you.
We must trust her to confide in us in her own time.
There was something underhand in his manner.
You will think the worst of him.
I give him the benefit of my good opinion.
He deserves no less.
I am very fond of Willoughby.
"I get next game, okay?"
-Coming through.
Coming through.
"-Doctor, is he dead?"
"-Please, get out of the way."
-Dr.
Greene...
... canyouconfirm or deny this report?
Get Security to get these people into the Press Room.
Do you question Dr. Ross' decision to fly the child here?
-Not for a second.
-Come on!
"Move, now!"
Let's go!
Hurry!
We're ready.
"Well, good."
I'll deposit it and bring you your receipt.
"Now, that's twenty thousand shares of Wentworth Drug at two dollars."
That's right.
Looking for a stock to buy?
Why?
Do you know of a good one?
Have you heard of Wentworth Drug?
I don't use drugs.
How much does it sell for?
Two dollars.
I never buy cheap stocks.
"Well, this one may become expensive."
Somebody just bought twenty thousand shares.
"Yes, so I see."
"You just bought twenty thousand at two, Mr. Sabourin."
Thank you.
You bought it.
What if it goes down to a dollar?
Then I'll buy more.
Look.
Still think it will go to a dollar?
I've got to get some.
Mr. O'Hara!
"Yes, Mrs. Ryan?"
Get me fifty thousand shares at two.
You'll never get it at two.
Not after that announcement.
Look!
Three and a half...
Three and five eighths...
Three and seven eighths.
- Good day.
"- Uh, no, I meant the young girl."
There.
- This is our niece.
She is lodging with us while my cousin's family is away overseas.
- I remember you from my first visit here.
Do you know my sister Isabel?
- She's a shy girl.
- She's very shy.
Very shy.
- Are you okay?
- I'll be there.
Go on.
"Well, it's so good to see you, Roderick."
"Best to the sister, yeah?"
Be well.
"You know, Isabel,"
I'm working on something very exciting.
I'd like to invite you to my lab to see it.
"Dr. Cairn says that your progression has been remarkable, so not to worry."
- I know my brother won't be pleased.
- You're a strong girl.
You don't need his approval.
You understand?
- Yes.
- Mr. Porter.
- Roderick.
"- Isabel, what are you wearing?"
Huh?
"Your fingers, they're filthy."
- I know.
- Who did this to you?
Why'd you have to leave me?
I can't explain that.
"(LINE RINGING, PHONE RINGING)"
"Hi, honey."
How was breakfast?
Did you tell Dad not to contact me?
(SIGHS)
It's not that simple.
"When he called out of the blue,"
I said that now might not be the best time.
You could have told me that last night.
- I'm tired of all these secrets.
- (HANGS UP)
- (SIGHS) - (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)
"So, who were you on the phone with basically at dawn?"
"- Hey, fun story."
None of your business.
- Always so mysterious.
"Look, maybe we should go get breakfast instead of breaking and entering?"
- I'll spring for pancakes.
- No pancakes.
"Ooh, wait!"
"Hey, frame me up."
"Maybe use, like, a Dutch angle so it's creepier."
I got it.
This is it.
"Oh, what?"
The unit was already unlocked?
Crescent Palms guy was hazing you.
We'll see.
- You recording?
- ‭Yup.
Timetable updated.
-Mmm-hmm.
We'll have you out of there in less than two hours.
Has everything been taken care of at your end?
I can't confirm that.
is there a problem?
-No.
"-Get it done, immediately."
What?
Two hours.
"Ugh, this drilling is driving me nuts."
I wanna find David and Meredith.
(tapping THE GUN)
You sure no one else could be in here?
-What?
-Nothing.
I was just thinking they wanted something in the broadcast room.
Gotta get over there.
-Think they got what they came for?
-Let's find out.
It's pretty standard activity.
Two broadcasts yesterday.
Three last night.
There's gotta be something.
What?
What do you got?
Fifteen broadcasts this afternoon.
What?
katherine:
Just 20 minutes apart.
Whoever broke in here didn't do it to stop the broadcasts.
"Well, that's a good thing, right?"
Have you ever seen him in our apartment before?
No.
It's not fucking normal.
Did you tell him about the camera?
No.
- Were you planning on it?
"- No, never!"
Then what the fuck is he doing in the apartment?
I said I don't know!
"Okay, is he dangerous?"
"Well, he takes bets from shady assholes like me."
"So, yeah, he's dangerous."
But...
I don't see Marcus here.
That's his goon.
"If I were in trouble, he'd be in this photo."
"Well, what if he's sitting over here?"
Out of view?
(CHEWING)
"I was up early this morning, and I heard him moving around in his room."
He came out about an hour ago.
Hasn't said a word.
"I don't know what those red pills are, but he's taken at least two of them already."
(SIGHS) Can you guys shut up for a sec?
(DIALS)
(BEEPS)
MAN:
Yeah?
"Hey, Ivan, it's Jasper."
I know.
How's it going?
What?
Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
But first... did you bring the flower?
I couldn't find it.
That's okay.
"But since you don't have it, I'm gonna need that kiss."
"*Theystareatme* * while I stare at you * * aah-aah-aah * * it's true, I crave you * * it's true, I crave you *"
Is...
Somethingwrong?
Pullherup .
Isshedying?
"Shemight,I...which is why this is gonna hurt."
Youbrokeherarm !
It'lltriggerthe healing process.
Istillgotta get the venom out.
This is where it's really gonna hurt.
Stiles... you make a good Batman.
Youknowwhoitis.
Jackson.
"YoujustwantedErica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
But we'll do it on one condition.
"We're gonna catch him, not kill him."
And?
Andwedo it my way.
"Thankyou,Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
Please...you have to tell him.
- It's the'80s.
The'70s.
"By the way, I'm sorry"
I came down on you a little hard at Leena's.
It's whatever.
"It's just 'cause I owe you, for helping me and saving Joshua."
"I mean, the guy hurt you."
It pisses me off.
If finding MacPherson...
Yeah.
"Just help me lift this thing, would you, on three."
"Well, can Mrs. Frederic find him?"
I don't know.
On three.
"One, two, three."
"The guy used to work here though, right?"
"And, what, the place drove him nuts?"
Something lured him to the dark side?
"He is the dark side and things are lured to him, people especially, which is why you're never gonna mention his name ever again."
- Just to you.
"- To anyone, promise me."
Is that Myka?
Whatever it is...
It's not good.
Red five.
- You're pushing our luck.
- And it's pushing right back.
- Take a break.
- I'm okay.
We've got enough.
Nobody's legs are getting broken.
Everybody's paid off.
"Said it was an accident, but-"
"I sentJasper away, and I ran."
Who are they?
They're your new best friends.
Stay here.
Ah.
"Well, what a piece of work she is."
"So, Evelyn used you to do the grunt work to track him down."
She shows up and finishes the job.
"And when she kills him, everyone comes looking for you."
She seemed so nice.
"Mike, she went through Lucy to get to you."
- Yeah.
Call Lucy.
Evelyn's not the type to leave loose ends.
- Right.
Oh.
Almost forgot.
That's for you.
- Evelyn has the Charger?
- Yeah.
It's gonna need some work.
- And your gun?
- Removed the trigger bar spring.
"Oh, that sounds like something you would do."
"You guys really do have a lot in common, don't ya?"
"Look, Fi."
"I know you're enjoying this, but now's not the time to say ""I told you so. """
"- This isn't like you, Michael."
"- Well, then go ahead-"
I know.
Fiona...
"Well, the DA defines murder as one human killing another so technically, you can't commit murder, can you?"
Does this make us friends?
Something up here after all.
-Him?
-You.
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
What about the others?
Can I help them?
Now that I have fulfilled my purpose I don 't know what to do.
"You'll have to find your way like the rest of us, Sonny."
I think that's what Dr. Ianning would have wanted.
That's what it means to be free.
"All NS-5s, proceed as instructed."
"All NS-5s, proceed as instructed."
OK...
Here we go.
Focus.
Speed.
I am speed.
"One winner, 42 losers."
I eat losers for breakfast.
Breakfast.
"Wait, maybe I should have had breakfast."
A little breck-y could be good for me.
"No, no, no, stay focused."
Speed.
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.
I am lightning!
"Hey, Lightning!"
You ready?
You know you're in trouble?
Me in trouble?
You must be kidding.
I'm perfectly alright.
Listen:
Fat Pig knows all about your plan.
And he's coming to get you!
That means I'm really in trouble!
Get away from there immediately!
- Where to?
- Go into hiding with a friend!
As an inspector has no friends but lots of enemies.
Then go to No.1 Hua Shi Street right away.
Where is it?
"Don't worry, I'll get someone to contact you."
"Our password is ""l am woman""!"
"If someone says 'l am woman,' that means 'He's a friend.'"
"Hurry up, let's go!"
Scram or you'll run out of time!
Open the door... I've already run out of time!
"Inspector, why are you still here?"
You're...?
I am woman!
We are women too!
Other policemen are coming.
They're not women.
"Inspector, run!"
"Dear sisters, so long for now!"
Go after him...!
So many people!
Go after him...!
"Uncle, I am woman!"
And no more car privileges.
Give me your keys.
Give 'em to me!
"Oh, for the love of God."
"Mom, you want me to... no."
"Mom, come on, let me just... mom."
Mom!
What is going on with you?
Is this about Allison?
Do you really wanna know?
Yeah.
Is this about your father?
"It is, isn't it?"
"Okay, you know what, um..."
We'll talk about this at home.
I'm gonna go get the car.
I'm the worst son ever.
"Well, I'm not exactly winning any prizes either."
Dammit!
"You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!"
He was mo... and what do I do about going to the bathroom?
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
Scott or Stiles?
Either.
"You know, the full moon's coming, Derek."
I'm aware of that.
These look comfortable.
- What's the matter?
"- You know, Frank."
You look terrible.
You should take a vacation.
I don't want a vacation.
"I got 18 years in, you know?"
I save up my time.
I put in my hours.
I'm eligible for pension in 6 months.
I don't want any vacation.
So what is it?
Get the deputy mayor off my ass.
"""Shrimpboats""?"
Him.
Yeah.
You couldn't handle him?
It was easy.
That's what I'm saying.
It was too easy.
Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love
What was that?
Milton and I are great Rodgers and Hammerstein fans.
"""When you walk through a storm, keep your head up high."""
It's not your signature on the probation report.
Now watch your mouth.
That was quite a risk you took.
The guy was wrong.
"No, Mayor."
I don't care if he is from New York.
Who are you?
I'm me.
And what are you not?
A sheep.
Right.
And what does a sheep go?
Marcus?
I love you.
Look.
"I love you, too."
"""I love you, Marcus!"""
Love you!
Look at him!
"While I couldn't accept the offer to become their child's godfather I did allow them to set me up with Angie, a rather beautiful coworker of Christine's."
"They had, however, being them, neglected to tell me one thing."
There's something you don't know about me.
Yeah?
Something exciting?
"I think so, yes."
I have a 3-year-old boy.
"I wanted to throw the napkin on the floor, push over the table and run."
Brilliant.
I love kids.
Yeah.
I like messing about with them.
Doing kid things.
I'd have been disappointed if you didn't have a child.
Why do you say that?
God knows.
Mainly because it sounded smooth and winning.
Because I love kids so much.
They're so lovely.
- [ Grunts ]
"Help, Smithers."
I'm sinking.
I'm sinking.
[ Gasps ]
Life... flashing... before-- [ Gurgling ] eyes.
You're fired!
Dance!
[ Laughing ]
[ Grunting ]
Dance!
[ Horn Blows ]
All right.
We're finally gonna stop those corporate pigs from dumping that nuclear waste.
"Oh, no!"
Our boat is sinking.
"It was I, you fools!"
The man you trusted isn't Wavy Gravy at all. [ Grunts ]
"And all this time, I've been smoking harmless tobacco."
"[ Chortles, Grunts ]"
[ Evil Laughter]
"I got a mink chamois, sir."
I hope that-- [ Gasps ]
"Oh, my God!"
Mr. Burns is dead!
[ Sobbing ] Why do the good always die so young?
[ Wailing ]
[ Gasps ] You almost killed me!
"- [ Grunts ] - [ Gasps ] Please, sir."
You'll catch-- [ Gags ] cold.
"Smithers, do you realize, if I had died... there would be no one to carry on my legacy?"
Due to my hectic schedule and lethargic sperm...
It's all clear!
"Shooters, with a magazine of 20 rounds, as you were, and a magazine with 30 rounds!"
"Shooters, you may commence fire when you see your target!"
"Shooters, it is time."
You're gonna stand.
What are you doing here?
"Uh, just, uh, checking for drainage problems."
Out here?
"Uh, you know what?"
"It's okay, 'cause, uh, I'm with septic."
He's got a ca--
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Is somebody out there?
Go.
"Go, go."
Give me your jacket.
"- Go, go."
"- Come here, come here."
Okay.
Go.
You are being read into the Have Blue program.
This is a top-secret U.S. government project administered by the Department of Defense.
You must have some pretty powerful friends to get us here on a Sunday.
To get us here at all.
We're not supposed to be talking about this to anyone.
Not even our wives.
They have people watching our wives.
You know that?
"- Yeah, why do you care?"
You only get to do a first date once.
It should be... fun and sexy and...
ask really good questions.
Ask him why he first decided he wanted to save lives.
"Ooh, ask him what his best surgery ever was."
I know how to go on a date.
Why is Meredith eating pot roast?
It's a show lunch for the mommy.
She's freaking out.
That ponytail?
It's gonna blow.
"Derek tells me you--you, uh, grew up right here in Seattle."
Are your parents...
"Mm, dead."
Mer's mother died last year.
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
And your father?
Oh.
"You know, I should go check on the patient who's the serial killer."
Who's here.
"Not killing people, so that's good."
- I should go.
- Yeah.
"Family isn't her favorite topic, okay?"
She's had a rough time of it.
- I didn't say a word.
- I know what you're thinking.
I was thinking...
It must be awful for you.
Treating a murderer.
Dad died a long time ago.
"Forget about the drive-bys, how are you supposed to meet anybody ?"
"Um, well, I did actually meet somebody, I think."
"I met this guy, and he's really cool."
-They got white guys at your school?
"-Um... no, actually they don't."
Shut up !
Look at me.
I want my money.
[Girl Crying] ldon't have it.
[Malakai] Shut up !
"Quit your crying, man."
[Girl] ldon't get paid till next week.
You wasn 't saying that when you was smoking it.
-l don't have it !
"-Well, you better find it somewhere."
- This ain't no lay a way plan.
- Hey !
"Hey, stop it !"
Come here.
"Where do you think you're going, huh ?"
Aahh !
Bitch !
"You ain't seen nothing, so don't say nothing... to nobody."
[Derek] I stole a bike here once.
- Why'd you do that ?
- 'Cause I didn't have one.
"- Oh, okay."
Good reason.
"- Well, it's not a reason, you know, I used to do shit like that, you know-- wild shit."
- With Malakai ?
- Yeah.
I don't get you two.
-
- It's true.
She took him in and soon they knew each other as only people can who've had a couple of sessions on the Ouija board.
-- (SHOP BELL) -
- Someone's trying to get through!
'Ey up!
It's Noddy!
Good morning.
What can we do for you?
That's what a person my age should be dressed like!
Not like this!
Call that dressed?
I put more than that on to go to bed in!
"Can we help you in any way, or is it t--too late?"
"Razor--sharp responses, you'll notice."
"Still, we shouldn't mock the afflicted."
Pity about his eyesight.
There's nothing the matter with his eyes!
He's wearing shades 'cause he's cool.
I should think he is cool!
His shirt's open to the kneecaps!
"We're over here, sir!"
He's Mutt and Jeff and all!
-
"- Here we are, sir."
-
- Get off!
-
"- Watch it, creeping up on people!"
-- (ROCK MUSIC BLARES OUT)
-
"- Watch it, creeping up on people."
Hey!
Enough!
Enough.
What do you idiots think you're doing?
Jackson!
Calm down!
"Mr. McCall, you wanna explain yourself?"
Stilinski!
You dropped this.
You and you...
"Actually, all of you..."
Detention. 3:00.
"Hi, there."
"Oh, I'll make an announcement, have Scott brought to the office."
"Actually, I came here to talk to you."
Me?
-Busy after school?
-Always.
"Well, unbusy yourself."
I wanna talk to you.
"Actually, I want to show you something."
I thought we'd gotten past the slightly rapey language.
And bring your flower.
We can't be in detention together.
I have a restraining order against these tools.
All of these tools?
"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
-I'm gonna kill him.
"-No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
"Uh, all right, Robert."
"Hey, stop this!"
"Granddad, stop!"
Listen to me!
We don't have to make the same mistakes!
We can learn!
"We're not niggas, granddad!"
"If I let you live, you are going to leave me alone, and if I see you again, I'm gonna..."
I'm gonna call the police and file for a restraining order!
But what about the fight tour?
!
"Yeah, you know, this didn't really go as expected."
"When you were the one getting beaten, Robert, it was fun!"
Deal's off!
Will you please go fuck with somebody else?
!
"Sure, Robert."
All you had to was ask.
I don't even know you.
I'm just the clone.
That's it.
I think it's finally over.
Let's go home.
"Hey, hey!"
One of you niggas call me an ambulance!
"Hey, Robert!"
"What y'all eating, Robert?"
!
"How come you never invite ya boy Stinkmeaner over for dinner, Robert?"
!
"That's fucked up, you selfish-ass, hungry-ass nigga!"
"Yo, so, you mean, like,"
"It's all right, Bobby."
We're here together.
"Go to sleep, Bobby."
Go back to sleep.
"It's all right, Bobby."
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
We're here together.
I think we could all use one of those.
Mr. Gordon?
Shall we go into the other room?
Let's go.
Get started on the clock.
"Stan and I had a brother, Bobby."
He was younger than either of us.
Not quite 7 when he died.
Stan and I were 12 and 14.
We lived in a big house with grounds that bordered a river.
"That particular day, our mother asked us to stay at home and look after Bobby."
We wanted to go swimming.
"What we wanted to do, Bobby wanted to do, naturally."
He idolised his big brothers.
"So we told him to stay in the house, and off we went."
He followed us.
We were pretty far out when we spotted him.
He was trying to...
To get to us.
He still is.
- You mean it's his...?
- Spirit?
Ghost?
"I don't know, Mr. Gordon."
"No, you listen to me, sweetheart, okay?"
"I am coming to Fort Lauderdale, and when I get there,"
"I am gonna find you and I am going to [Bleep] you so [Bleep] hard, you..."
Mmm.
I knew you were a bad guy.
This is where I come to be bad.
I'm a good guy. [Chuckles]
Ah.
"Good guy, bad guy, it's all perception."
Me?
I say I'm just a woman.
You say I'm exceptional woman.
- I never said that.
"- Yes, you do."
I see how you look.
"No, I look."
I don't say that.
"Yeah, but, you know, in my village,"
I'm just average woman.
Like fourth most attractive sister in family.
Bullshit.
Don't buy that story for a second.
Okay?
Yeah.
"You are, objectively, the most attractive woman in every village."
[Clicks tongue] Aw.
There are no absolutes.
"No, there are absolutely absolutes, okay?"
Vinyl?
Absolutely overrated.
Dr. Rob?
Absolutely super-duper rich.
- Eventually.
"But for now, we keep a low profile."
- No one knows who I am.
- The Salvatore brothers do.
And I wish to hell I could run into them.
They're the reason we were caught in the first place.
"So, uh, Matt, how do you like working here?"
"Uh, it's not that bad."
Wait staff tips out pretty good.
They can't keep a bartender to save their lives but...
I actually put my mom up for the job.
"How's that been, having Kelly back?"
"You know, same old Kelly."
"She's trying, sort of."
Kelly and my mom were best friends growing up.
That's how Matt and I first met.
We shared a crib together.
You're kidding.
"No, we've known each other our whole lives."
Whoo!
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Little Jen.
"- Oh, my God."
I know.
- It's big Jen now.
Let's have another one.
How many is that?
Ha-ha-ha.
Where are you going?
Bethanne and I are going out for a bit.
Hit the town.
Kick up our heels.
I don't have time for his crap.
- You think he made it up?
- I don't care.
- Why would he?
"- Wait, what does it mean?"
That I'm a bastard?
If Raziya's parents hear this they'll take her back to Brooklyn with the kids.
"I'm done for, don't you get it?"
Fuck!
Why did she keep these marbles?
What a moron!
Did she expect me to play on her grave?
Who saves marbles?
"Leave it, just go to sleep."
"I'll clean up, okay?"
"Mom, what did you do?"
What are you all dressed up for?
"Get down from there, it's dangerous."
From where?
What are you talking about?
"Doborobon, don't ask me and I won't ask you."
O-bo-kay-bay?
(Okay?
)
No-bo.
At least give me a hint-.
You're not 5 years old any more.
- Was that a hint?
- Was that a hint?
- Are you repeating what I say?
- Are you repeating what I say?
Do you know what this is?
"Kitty, don't lie."
You've got a tell.
That thing you do with your eyebrows.
I don't do a thing with my eyebrows.
- This came in a few minutes ago.
- Great.
Thank you for making an embarrassing situation even more embarrassing.
A dating service?
Kitty.
- You don't need a dating service.
"- No, I actually do."
I need a quick and expedient way to find...
- A husband?
"- No, Mother."
Not a husband.
"Sweetheart, there are other ways of fulfilling your physical needs."
- Electrical things...
"- Mother, no!"
Please!
Just...
- Somebody just kill me!
- OK.
If it's not a husband and it's not sex...
It's a beard.
Arm candy.
Somebody whose picture I can put on my desk.
Everybody in my office thinks the senator and I are dating.
"- Well, he is your type."
"- Oh, et tu, Mother?"
All right.
I'm sorry.
Just please continue.
Whoa!
"Hey, there's no one driving that thing!"
Ho!
Someone stop it!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Easy.
"Easy, boy."
You boys lose something?
- That was scary.
- Officer!
Good.
I've never seen such a thing.
Shouldn't we bring those boys in or something?
"Trust me, whatever punishment we give them, it's nothing compared to what's waiting for them at home."
"Those boys know if anything was to happen to that horse, if it got injured, the whole family would lose its ability to plow the field, make food for the winter."
So that's it?
"They're just gonna feel really, really guilty?"
It works.
Believe me.
It won't happen again.
"I guess growing up here, you know all this stuff."
You have no idea.
Where are we?
"Ohio, somewhere."
I miss Mommy.
I know.
Me too.
I thought I had improvised well.
"- That's right, sire."
Stop.
We repeat.
"Carlos, please."
"Sire, it is best to avoid any comment."
Sorry.
His Majesty?
Very well.
"Yes, I'll be careful."
"I care for you, do not worry."
"I think so, yes."
"See you, His Majesty."
Mr. Lloyd?
The Queen told me to remember them
To film the speeches from start to finish and to grasp the smiles.
Do we do it again?
"Sire, the press conference will begin at 11pm at Miniatiürk."
"His speech, sire."
The Prime Minister has made some changes.
I remember that Turkey's handshakes are energetic.
Stop.
Perfect.
"Now we can go, sire."
"Mr. Lloyd, can follow us."
It's really tiny.
The Atomium?
"Yes, it's a fiasco."
No.
"Well, that too."
The space reserved for Mini-Europe.
It looks like an extension of Turkey instead of the opposite.
Run a failed restaurant?
- She probably can't even cook.
- Her vagina insult cut me to the quick... but her crumb cake was like a cloud from heaven.
Yeah.
But it is cake.
"I mean, who needs cake?"
Not exactly the pillar of a meal.
Are you implying that your fish is more important than my cake?
I'm not implying it.
I'm stating as fact.
Really?
Ever heard of a birthday fish?
No.
Dad ever take you on a caking trip?
"Oh, no, he didn't."
[ Exhales ]
Just tell Miss Lohan that I have her dog.
"No, no, no, I'm not a stalker."
I am a fan though.
I loved her in-
- Hello?
Hello?
- [ Dog Growling ]
"Snazzy, the barstool was not put there for your pleasure."
There's a Jessica on line one.
She says that she's an old friend.
"Oh, no."
Not lameJessica.
She just said Jessica.
- Hello?
- Guess who's in town.
- You?
It's ridiculous.
Maybe it's a sign you have to keep it.
"No, Mum."
"It's not a sign, I'm going to sell it."
Again.
Are you serious?
Are you selling this car?
"Ah, yeah."
Sold.
Sorry?
I'm buying it.
It's... it's got rust.

Previously on The Fosters...
I gave the money to Ana so she'd change her story.
- You bribed her?
- I'll tell the DA.
"- I want $10,000."
- That freaking woman.
I could kill her.
You are gonna stay as far away from that woman as possible.
You saw Ana Gutierrez in an argument the night that she went missing?
- Is this the guy?
"- Yeah, this is the guy."
- Donald isn't my dad?
- Not according to the birth certificate.
Either that or you don't know what's funny either.
I... don't know what's funny?
"I'll have you know, at camp,"
"I was voted ""Miss Whimsy""."
"Why, was Miss Irony killed in a canoe accident?"

"Some physics reading, you know."
Okay.
"Say, uh, an amusing joke just came to me you know, out of the blue."
"Knock, knock."
Okay.
Who's there?
Who's there you say?
Nina!
Nina who?
"Ah Nina, she's right here!"
Please let me host that fundraiser!
No!
- Oh!
"Ben Littmeyer just called, he's gonna be a few minutes late for lunch."
"Oh, another lunch with Ben."
I see.
How funny for you.
"Well, would you like to join us, we could make it a threesome?"
I don't go that way Mary.
Fine!
"And last but not least, garlic gum."
"Oh, uh, Harry, how would you like a nice piece of perfectly ordinary gum?"
Okay.

That's a joke?

Yes.
I forgot my glasses.

Then get your glasses!
God damn it!
Now go!
"Sure, sure, ladies and gentlemen, of course you all want to see Nora again."
"Well, before we get started with the quiz show, here once again is Nora and the Pope dancers!"
Me again?
Yes.
Now what?
"It doesn't matter, just sing it again."
"Once again, from the top."
Everything gets to the point where I just say stop.
A lively hotel.
It's dinner time.
Everyone's dressed up.
The first guests are taking their seats.
And now we're going to the cafeteria.
If I were him I would do the same thing.
What's going on here?
We're having a going-away party.
It's probably for the best.
What?
That your brother takes a vacation.
You have company.
Just texting my girlfriends.
It's time for me to leave.
"Oh, It's only 9:00."
"We could have some coffee, watch a movie."
More cake?
"Oh, the cake was awesome."
"But really, I don't want to overstay my welcome, so, Dylan, do you want to walk me to the door?"
"Go ahead, Dylan."
Go ahead.
Of course.
What are you doing?
Ben has been waiting for hours.
"Oh, I doubt it."
You doubt it?
"Okay, let me rephrase that."
I don't care.
I don't care about Ben.
I care about you.
And I did see you first at that party and I am really smitten with you.
And I'm angry with myself for stepping aside for my friend.
You slept with Ben's wife that night.
"Yeah, I did."
"And it was a huge mistake, huge."
"But stepping aside, huger mistake."
He doesn't deserve you.
He's in love with Amy.
"He's always been in love with Amy, so don't waste your time."
And I hope you'll give me a chance.
"Good night, Robert."
"Good night, Cecilia."
BOTH:
I'll have to remember that.
Trevor?
Can I ask you something?
Should my lawyer be present?
Why are you always leaving me such generous tips?
- Do I?
- 20 dollars for coffee and pie?
And entertainment.
- Entertainment?
- You.
"Trevor, you don't have to buy my companionship."
"Sorry, I..."
It wasn't meant that way.
"If you really want to spoil me, take me to a movie sometime."
That's a deal.
"My goodness, there must be a hole in this glass."
I'll get it.
- You waited on me enough.
- Thanks.
It is the last door on the left.
Reznik.
I want you on the Swansea-lathe today.

"That's an irrelevant question, Reznik, I'm asking you."
Shit!

"- Thank you, Mr Furman."
- Goodbye.
- See you now.
"Hey, look who it is."
"Bombay Miller, you okay?"
"- Good, good."

"Hello, is... is Julie here, please?"
"No, there's no Julie here."
"Yes, Julie... a girl with dark hair."

You must have the wrong floor.
"I'm sorry, but I have been here before."
I can even tell you that the glasses are behind...
"Listen, it's not here, OK?"
"Marianne, did Mrs Courcelles get in touch?"
"Not that I know of, Your Honour."
I should have let her leave in her bra and panties.
Prepare a summons for indictment.
- I'm leaving.
- I am sorry.
She...
"She stopped by earlier, she left... an envelope for you."
- An envelope?
An envelope.
I can't recall where I put it.

Is oat grown in your area?
Your answer... yes.
"Beetroot, yes!"
"Rice, yes!"
"Tomatoes, no!"
There are no tomatoes?
What about fruit and vegetables?
"Yes, gladioli!"
"Tell me this, are you trying to be funny, saying there are no vines?"
Is that what you call homework?
!
"I didn't do it, sir."
Who did it then?
Maybe the Dad did?
Maybe!
You have to come to school.
The teacher wants a word with you.
"Come on, the change will do you good."
Carry on without me!
Where do you think you're going?
Hop on the back.
AUDIENCE LAUGHS
Do you have it on your mobile phone?
Do you...
Yes!
When you ring your mobile...
"Yes, yes, I do!"
What I'm interested in is how you got on in our reasonably-priced car.
Oh.
This is very embarrassing.
Shall we find out?
Richard's lap.
TYRES SCREECH
Here we go...
You're putting a lot of effort into this.
Knackered.
This is where he said don't brake.
I've got to.
Quite smooth... quite fast.
Ish.
And into the last corner...
That's a nice line.
Well.
We have the time.
And I'm afraid it's a sad day in Top Gear history.
And a sad day for Harry Enfield.
AUDIENCE:
No!
Richard Whiteley is the slowest man ever with a time of two minutes six seconds!
Enfield is going to be absolutely apoplectic.
His proudest boast to date was he was so slow and you've beaten him!
By miles!
"Frankly, your life is now ruined."
5th Army Cameras!
Turn that... thing.
Oh my!
"General, there was a small accident but we'll go on."
Continue.
We better go now.
I'm sorry about that.
"I'm sorry, we better leave."
The ambulance is on its way.
"You can go, Jimmy."
You are the winners.
-What's the matter?
-A transfer instability.
It may be only temporary.
Something's wrong.
"Yes, you're right."
It's getting smaller.
-Can't you do something?
-I don't understand.
I don't understand.
But the Doctor's in there!
-It's your codes that are doing this.
-This is unheard of.
"-Well, how do we get him out of this?"
-A fault in the computation.
But there must be something you can do to put him right.
Take the machine to the Central Register.
What're you going to do with it?
"The Central Register, quickly."
There may still be time.
The honour of Logopolis is at stake.
- Hey!
- Get this lion off of me here.
- No!
No!
You stop it.
This is my fight.
Do you understand me?
I'm sick of men getting in my way.
This is my fight.
You hear me?
- You hear what I'm saying?
"- Maybe we should leave these two alone, huh?"
Okay.
"We'll see you next Friday, huh?"
"""Beauty Versus the Beast II."""
"Come on, Brianna."
Here we go.
- You're not ready for this fight.
"- Oh, I have an idea, Dad."
Why don't you shut your fat little monkey face and hold the bag?
I'm gonna paralyze this bitch.
"Yes, Dad, I know the fight is in a few hours, all right?"
I'm trying to find my goddamn headband.
Is that okay?
Is it okay with you if I find my headband before I come down there?
"Is that all right with you, Dad?"
Jesus!
Why didn't we get the orange one like I said?
This one might as well be goddamn camouflaged!
"Oh, good."
Are you happy now?
I just punched a hole in my wall!
"Hot, maybe?"
Very hot?
What is this?
This is water?
- It's a mousetrap.
"-Heh, and this?"
My grandmother's earmuffs.
"Heh, look at them, lieutenant."
Everybody is a clown.
How do you expect to win the war mit an army of clowns?
We sort of hope you'll laugh yourselves to death.
Yes.
"Now, outside, everybody!"
Everybody out for the blankets!
- Clear out.
Here we go.
"-Hey, you too!"
Outside!
Get going!
"Hurry up, boys."
"Oh, that Schulz pig."
He knew where the radio was all the time.
"Whoever that stoolie is, he's sure batting 1000."
Now the guy I want to talk to is Sefton.
Has anybody seen Sefton?
"Cookie, you haven't seen Sefton, have you?"
"No, I haven't."
"Krause, you here."
"Hoffy, I'm very sorry about the mousetrap but the war news are very depressing anyway, huh?"
I might as well also confiscate the antenna.
American know-how.
"All right, let's hear it."
Get on the stage now!
Big Mouth...
"No, no!"
Here to collect the laundry money again?
- Stop!
- Forget about the money!
Forget it!
Wash my wife's underwear as well!
In that case...
Are you going to do it?
!
Yes.
But my big sister will not be happy.
I'll throw you out!
No!
Help me!
"Help me, please!"
"Wong Fei-hung, that's the end of your lion."
Sifu Tam!
"Sifu Tam, you have a visitor from the North."
A Northerner?

We've got a good reputation in GuangZhou.
Now you're a fugitive.
"We've been partners before, but now I want to stay on the right side of the law."
"White Tiger, you shouldn't cause any more trouble."
We were once like brothers.
Have this to tide you over.
"Look, I've got a few students working in the opera troupe."
Go and hide there until this case blows over.
Then we'll talk again.
"You can owe anyone money, but not me, or I'll destroy you!"
"I'll miss you, Son."
"I'm sorry, Dad."
- You're fired!
- What?
Fire me?
That does it.
You can never be my son.
- A little to the left.
- Huh?
"Oh, very well."
You can never be my--
- Eeeeeeee!
- [ Gasps ]
"Sir, try to land on Leonard's carcass!"
[ Sighs ]
"Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV... saying we didn't want you in our family..."
- but those were just actors playing us.
- How do you know?
"Because one of them hung out with me for a week, trying to get my character down."
"Yeah, me too."
That midget taught me a lot about his native Estonia.
"The point is, the real Simpson family missed you a lot... and we're really glad you're home."
[ Kisses ]
- I love you guys.
"- Right back at you, Son."
[ All Sighing ]
"And now I want you to meet your new brother, Hans Moleman."
"Cowabunga, dudes."

Who's this?
"- My father, rest his soul."
They've done fireworks for generations.
Mattia does them too.
That's why the explosives...
He's tops.
And this is forthe curtains.
And I thought...
But I'm a little sorry that you're not sleeping at my house.
Who'II steal yourwaIIet now?
I don't know how to thank you.
- How much?
- What are you doin'?
- We did it in friendship.
- We don't even know each other!
We'II learn to.
I owe you one.
The curtains will come later.
There's the sea!
I hadn't realized.
"One of these evenings I'II invite you to dinner at the sea, to thank you."
"Okay, this evening."
- But you're our guest.
"- I can't, my back..."
"Why, you eat with yourback?"
"Whitebait omeIet, cianfotta, cecata soup and soppressata."
"Stuffed anchovies, fusiIIi with meat sauce and white CiIentan figs."
- What?
- You have to taste everything.
Why just taste?
Let's eat it all!
"No, you killed a kid, you insane prick!"
(Groans)
I'm going to the cops.
With what?
A picture painted 400 years ago?
"I will find a way, I swear to God."
There is no way and you know it.

"Come in, come in."
"Fiona, welcome, welcome."
Where's your stuff?
"Oh, I'm not staying the night."
"Oh, you're very welcome."
"The old sofa bed might be a little bit cramped, and the place has had a health warning slapped on it."
"No, thank you, I just wanted to explain my position."
"Oh, nothing to explain."
"It's all done, isn't it?"
Told you he'd be cool.
Mum's given us so much shit.
"Well, you know mothers."
What I feel for your son is very sincere.
Great.
"So, mate, I've got your favourite here - burgers and chips."
"Is that OK with you, Fiona?"
"Oh, you're not staying?"
"Finnegan, would you mind grabbing my purse?"
I think I left it in the car.

"Oh, I think you're mistaken, Mr Wilson."
That's not mine.
- It is.
"Fixed the brakes, replaced the chain, cleaned and oiled the gears."
Added a nice new basket.
"Repaired your saddle, changed both tyres, refitted new inner tubes and... cleaned and polished your frame."
That must have set you back.
"The bill for parts and labour stands at you calling me ""Spencer""."
Oh.

Is Bob getting any work published at the moment?
A little local journalism here and there.
No new book on the horizon?
What are you gonna do?
Let me think!
I gotta think.
Who else has a cell phone?
Um...turn 'em off and slide 'em over to me.
"- Ray, it's in my coat."
- Go ahead.
"- What happens now, Ray?"
- I'm thinking.
"There's no time, Ray."
Charlie doesn't have that kind of time.
Okay...
I want you to call the FBI.
You know which one of these is yours?
The little flip phone.
This one?
What should I tell them?
"The FBI, Ray."
What should I tell them?
"Um...tell 'em I'm armed, and I'm gonna have to start shooting people if my demands aren't met."
"Oh, God."
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.
Just shut up!
I'm only gonna shoot you if they don't do what I'm asking them.
- Ray?
- What?
What demands?
What are you asking them to do?
"Tell 'em I wanna talk to the person in charge of their, um... you know, whatever they call it, their--their extraterrestrial project."

That was a nice one.
You idiot.
Tell me before you go firing that everywhere.
That ain't good...
"Give us some thought sometimes, won't you?"
Sorry about that...
I just wanna train and get stronger...
Really now...
That's exactly why I don't want you and Beerus-sama to meet.
Huh?
Who's Beerus-sama?
"Oh, I'm such an idiot, an idiot, an idiot."
You really were hiding' somethin' from me.
So that's why you were actin' so weird.
Is that guy a human?
He's not human.
He's a god.
He's on about the same level as the Kaioshin-sama.
And he's headed this way.
"But if he's a god, that shouldn't be a problem, should it?"
"He's a fickle and incredibly fearsome god, you see."
A fearsome god?
"He governs over the destruction in the universe, and... destroys planets and lifeforms at the slightest peeve."
How is that different from what I was doing?
And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group.
I agree.
"I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not."
"Well, Kenneth, just respect their privacy."
"I promise I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger."
I'm sure you will.
I just...
I just love television so much.
We all do.
"Liz, they want you and Pete on the 50th floor."
"Who, Gary?"
"All right, tell him I'll be up in half an hour."
"No, they said now."
"If they've got cookies up there, grab some."
"Ooh, and get them to pay for my samovar."
Of course.
I assume that's what we're meeting about.
What about Ray Romano?
Can you do Ray?
"[lmitating Ray Romano] Hey, aah, ho, Debra."
There you go.
My brother's tall!
[Normal voice] Right?
Are we in trouble or something?
No way.
Gary loves the show.
Pleased with the ratings.
"Right, of course."
They love us.
Where's Gary?
Gary's dead.
"No, he wasn't there."
He really was a bus driver.
It looks like he got sick and quit about a week ago.
And what is he doing now?
I don't know.
"If he's sick, where could he have gone?"
You look sick too.
You should go home and get some rest.
I'll take you.
"I'm not going to go home, I'm going to see my mother."
"Well, I'll take you there."
Pull yourself together.
Let's go.
No one's here.
Woman Come in.
Where's my mother?
She just stepped out.
Is she going home?
"She did say that she'd be going home, yes."
This is a nice studio.
It has your mother's mark on it.
When did I last see her dance?
Hmm...
It must have been just as the Pacific War was starting.
That's right.
"When the war got worse, she stopped dancing in public."
She was dancing with Kayama-sensei.
Your mother's dancing was beautiful!
"You've danced with Kayama-san, too haven't you."
"Yes, many times."
He took me to many ballet performances.
"You can't forget Kayama-sensei, can you?"
"- Yes, but..."
As soon as we arrive...
The Prime Minister will never accept her
First hear him ask him.
"Yes, but the Prime Minister..."
I hear things... \ It's strange.
This experience is like...
Like a gift.
"Here, among the people."
"I understand, sire."
"They're so welcoming and open, and..."
Here people do not have much.
Here people do not have much.
But I'm still...
That must be the Serbian border.
Let me do this this time.
Sire?
"You will not want the protocol to waste time, right?"
"No protocol, Ludovic."
"Carlos, take the camera."
Hello.
"- Passports, please."
Good morning.
Do the Serbian phones work?
- No phones.
How come the welcome concert?
- It is the Serbia In Ball dance campaign.
The state wants us to give a positive image of Serbia to foreigners.
Go for a walk.
You have a familiar look.
It looks like Miss Serbia 2005.

Yes.

The origin of the fire is near your neighborhood.
Can you climb the rooftops and give instructions to demolish the houses?
Trust me please!

No.
"No, no."

Thank you for coming.
We're grateful for the warning.
"Well, you should know that our people will be at the rally regardless, looking for the individual planning the attempt."
"Once word gets out Mr. Dellaman won't be attending the rally,"
I'm sure she'll be long gone.
"I hope that won't be the case, but unfortunately, you may be right."

I even went to the coffee shop.
Turns out she doesn't even work there.
She totally faked me out.
I don't believe this.
"How could you let this happen, Jerry?"
Yeah.
"You know, I'm glad you changed your mind."
"Oh, yeah, I'd much rather be in here than out there."
"I know, you can room with my brother."
He's just about your age.
"Oh, won't that be a lot of fun."
"Bob, will you take him over to my house?"
I'll join you later.
"You know, there are 200 girls waiting to meet you."
"Oh, and I just can't wait to meet them."

"What kind of school are you running here, anyhow?"
"It's a school for girls, and the reception committee is going to be here any minute."
I don't need no reception committee.
Of course you do.
Why should you be any different?
Because I don't think I need a reception committee.

How can you say that after what happened to you?

- It's not a big deal.

He's not.

"That's right, you don't."

So why didn't you?
"Because I don't want to be the freak for once, Dean."
I want to be normal.
So taking a beating -- that's normal?
Any word from dad?
"He called this morning, said he's going to be another week at least."
We weren't supposed to be here this long.
At least you've got Amanda.
She's cool.
"Dude, she wants me to meet her parents."
I don't do parents.
"Mr. Winchester, can I talk to you?"
Um...
I'll wait for you outside.
"Look, if this is about the fight, I didn't start it."
"Oh, no, it's not about the fight, Sam."
And... guess what?
- What?
- I'm done.
I've sewn myself up.
- Huh.
"- You did great, buddy."
I'm proud of you.
I can't believe I did it.
I'm so strong.
"Ooh, we're crossing into Virginia."
"Virginia is not technically a state, but a commonwealth."

"So, uh, you already moved the twins onto a booster seat, huh?"
Aren't they a little young for that?
They're four.
"Nikolaj is four, but we're sticking with the car seat as long as possible, but you know me..."
"I'm a ""safety at all costs"" kind of dad."
Mm-hmm.
"Sarge, I need to go to the bathroom."
We just stopped for gas.
I asked you if you had to go.
I didn't have to then.
So does this van have side-impact airbags?
Not in the back.
Oh.
Interesting.
No judgment here.
"Sarge, I have to pee now too."
Seriously?
"You, Diaz?"
"Look, I'll turn off at the next exit, okay?"

Just over there where the lounge is.
- Do you remember anything about a rabbi?
- I don't remember anything.
Do you remember talking to a rabbi?
Or do you remember a rabbi... giving a talk about Max?
I guess I was in too much of a shock.
You don't recall any of this?
- I was in too much of a shock.
- Mm-hmm.
Must have been that.
Because he was my best friend.
I know.
We all know that.
We were very close friends.
"That wasn't when my daughter put me in here, was it?"
- When did it happen?
- Nine days ago.
Oh.
So I was here some time already.
"Oh, you"
- I think you've been here for a few years.
- Pardon?
- I think you've been here at Baycrest for a few years.
- Was I here a few years?
- I think so.
I think so.
"Yeah, my daughter never had time for me."
"- Why do you say that, Claire?"
- [Mutters]
Because she went to business.
And I was home.
I'm not sure I should send Neil to the garage.
Those men sound like brutes.
I think it was just hijinks.
"What, three dirty men throwing a naked young boy into water?"
- The mind boggles.
- I never said Will was naked.
I thought you did...
Not quite the outcome I'd hoped for.
Neil's dad imagining me naked.
"When it comes to love, they say a gentleman never tells."
But I wasn't a gentleman.
I was a twat.
Guess who got a date with Charlotte Hinchcliffe?
- Donovan?
- No.
I bet it is - he's probably balls deep in her right now.
The answer... is me.
- No way.
"- Yes, way."
Of sorts.
- Of sorts way.
- How?
I've no idea.
"Honestly, and I'm not going to stop and ask her."
I don't know why she likes me but I'm going to do my best to keep it that way.
Sounds like a good plan.
- When is it then?
- What?
- Date.
- Friday.
- What we up to Friday?
- Same as every Friday.
He's my brother.
[ Breathing heavily ]
I knew you were a lost cause.
"Unlike your sister, you're weak."
"Good to see you, too, Larry."
How could you do this to her?
To us?
Do what?

This.
"Oh, that."
"Oh [scoffs] yeah, that."
You know what that means?
Huh?

"It's your fault, blanco!"
"If you didn't starve me, maybe -- Listen, freak!"

- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that I'm nervous.
- I'm getting scared.
- Doc?
Sorry...
Just hang on a sec.
- Mel...
- I have to get back to Nicole.
"Doc, the nurse says we got a green light."
He's all yours.
- Thanks.
- And Officer?
I've taken a strict inventory of Mr. Pike's injuries.
"There are detailed notes on every bruise, scratch, and cut."
OK...
"So if he ends up back here with a new injury, I'll know where it came from."
Get him out of here.
I don't see her.
"Stop, I say!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Cancel those shipments of wine, grain, straw!"
Cancel everything!
"- Dennis, here she is."
Griselda!

It's me!
"Dennis, it was always you!"
You's the one we was pushing for.
We'll have the wedding tomorrow.
This afternoon.
We'll get the bishop.
"Dennis, you're wonderful."
"Griselda, at last we can have the life we always wanted."
"My boy, congratulations."
We offer you our heartfelt thanks.
You have cleared the kingdom of a great menace.
I am happy to fulfill my promise and to bestow upon you...

To the palace!
Griselda!
I pronounce you man and wife.
Prince and princess!
Dennis!
Griselda!
Come on!
"Back then, they had no electricity."
The only light was fire.
Everything was dangerous then.
"Dinosaurs, mammoths, other tribes, but when the fire went out, it got dark and more dangerous."
"Since then, we associate dark with danger."
"Since then, we're afraid of the dark."
"They're dark, so we're afraid of them."
We won't tell them that.
So we split it up.
Who...?
"I'II take their statements, OK?"
I'II look around the backyard.
There might be some clues.
"Who's first, next?"
Go ahead.

You go Ducky.

"C,duIie had an income."
I want you to tell me that you know for a fact there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind!
Tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good!
You tell me that!
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
No.
Did you know my mother died recently?
"Yes, I did."
I'm very sorry.
Is Regan aware of it?
Not at all.
Why do you ask?
It's not important.
Good night.
"You know, I'm like in seclusion."
"No, I'm just exhausted from work."
-What should I say anyway?
-Just talk to your daddy.
Tell him what you've been doing and how you're feeling.
I hope you can hear me.
Can you hear me okay?
He's not going to answer you.
"Talk to your daddy, honey."
I don't know what to say.
"Well, let's see."
First we....
No....
Wait.
I don't know.
-Tell him about Washington.
-Okay.
"You see, we're in Washington now, Daddy, and...."

Here's your money.
What's wrong?
Nothing uncle.
People live their lives...
I'm teaching my life to live that's all.
Long ago I gave you an advice.
Forgo rangefinder your enemy with a smile.
I think you didn't learn.
I did.
I learned.
I also learnt that if you want to move ahead... pull down your opponent's pants.
He'll bend over and I'll hop over him.
And I'll win.
That's it.
Come on let's talk work.
There's a contract.
Let's sit and talk.
- Yes.
- You won't learn.
Let's talk business.
The job is from Home Minister Pradhan... and he's an old customer.
And the contract's ACP Thakur.
This boy recently arrived in Delhi.
And he tried to disgrace Ayushman's sister.
They need outside help so I had to come to you.
Uncle.
Is your information right.
Why?
What's wrong?
The boy looks decent.
I can't believe.
Sometimes innocent looking people... are the most dangerous ones.
And the Big Boss has accepted the contract... and that's it.
I'm sorry.
I can't right now.
"Hey, Meredith."
Petty Officer Brian Smith?
Yeah.
There's a whole ship full of people looking for you.
May want to put a shirt on.
You're coming with us.
Stay with her.
Stop!
- Look out!
- Whoa!
I said stop!
Hey!
I know a dead guy with bruises just like yours.
Look at it.
"Oh, is that a little tough to look at?"
"Here, how about this one?"
Maybe a closer shot.
I didn't do that.
It wasn't me.
Says the guy who just ran two blocks to get away.
"I can explain everything, all right?"
"Oh, you can?"
!
"Well, thank goodness for that."
'Cause finding you in the dead guy's girlfriend's apartment with your pants around your ankles doesn't exactly scream innocent.
"In my business, it's called motive."
Think I killed him for Meredith?
People kill for a lot less.
"I woke up around 6:00, and Brian was pounding on my door."
Said he and Caleb got into a fight.
I was trying to rescue a woman.
She's a doctor.

She's going to die.

What about Matak?
According to his office he's away on an official engagement.
"No, he's stalling."
He's just hoping nothing will stick to him.
See if she was arrested as well and get me on a flight to Khartoum.
I'm going to have to deal with this personally.

I have done all that I can.
For you and the other one.

He'd been in a car accident.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
I have to go.
(SINGING)
While i was on the trip you so graciously gave me
I found it again.
Only it's not in santorini anymore. it's in fiji.
At least he was last week.
You found my father?
Get in. let's go.
Why aren't you in europe?
I was in paris
But only to get your favorite macaroons
From pierre herm?
And germany?
To pick up your favorite falke stockings.
You know how i adore them.
What are you doing here then?
You were right.
I was a coward running away again.
But everywhere i went
You caught up with me.
So i had to come back.
I want to believe you...
But i can't.
You've hurt me too many times.
You can believe me this time.
That's it?
I love you too.
But can you say it twice?
No i'm serious. say it twice.
I love you.
I love you. mm.
There's three. four--i love you.

What?
But her apartment was under constant surveillance.
"They made sure nobody entered, not whether someone left."
"She was gone, when the replacement came."
I don't get it.
Why leave our protection and put herself in danger?
I didn't get it at first either.
Until this arrived.
What is it?
The Hiromitsu file.
It took our colleagues in NewYork sometime to find out who the pseudonym was.
"As it turns out, he didn't commitsuicide"
What are they doing out here?
"Well, patrolling?"
Who cares?
Maybe Matak has them looking for us...
CRAWFORD:

Now we have a plane to catch.

- I missed my house.
They knew how to be there?
.
- I can not trust anyone.
- You can trust me.
- Is this correct?
"Mike gave your name, Father."
I knew how good?
- She did not know.
- I listened to confession?
"Even if you listened, you paylaşamazdım, you know."
"- I have no time to play the game, Father."

"- All right, let's get goin'."
"- Hold on, hold on, hold on, Big Bob..."
I got to ask you a question before this all goes down.
- All the guards in Guantánamo are gay?
"- Fuck, no!"
Ain't nothing gay about getting your dick sucked!
You're the ones that's gay for sucking' my dick!
- What?
- In fact... creeps me out just bein' around you fags.
- But--

"God, his dick smells like shit, dude."
Holy shit!
- What the hell happened?
- That terrorist fuck bit my dick!
- Come on.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait a second!"
Should we?
I'm already dead.
I got nothing else to live for.
"[Hotch] Tracy, you need to tell him."
Tell me what?
What the hell's going on here?
He needs to know.
"Kaman, while you were in a coma,"
I found out I was pregnant.
Oh...
I didn't know what to do.
I thought you were gonna die.
"Oh, baby, I'm so sorry."
You're telling me... that's my son?
"[Hotch] Kaman, you don't want to do this in front of your son."
Put it down.
"Baby, if you don't do it for me, do it for him."
Don't you want to know his name?
What's your name?
Daniel Kaman Anderson.

I'm not looking.
Are you almost ready?
- Yes.
- You need any help?
- No.
- Okay.
"–Hey, hey!"
Everything all right?
Yeah.
Just a little spring cleaning.
Let's ride.
I thought this was about I.D'ing somebody.
"Actually, we're more interested in the kidnapping charge... that was filed against you in 1993."
That was a misunderstanding.
"–You were 35 at the time, right?"
–Correct.
–And your girlfriend was in high school?
–She was 18.
And you took her away on vacation for two weeks and never told her parents.
I know.
"In hindsight, it was just a bad judgment call."
But Amanda was an adult.
You're 17 years older than Marcy too.
"You like 'em young, Bob?"
Yeah.
They just...
feel right.
Did Kayla feel right?
I wouldn't know.
–I know how you feel.
–Excuse me?
What'd your partner do?
He's not backing me up on the shooting.
–If that guy costs me a promotion...
–He's not backing you up?
–After all I've covered for him.
–You covered for him?
–What did he do?
"Yeah, it's Ollie and Danny."
All right.
Never mind his eyes.
What about an airway?
Is he breathing?
"Do you copy, Ollie?"
What else have you got?
Is he conscious?
I don't know what to say.
"His eyes are open, but..."
"It's not the same thing, Ollie."
"Yeah, sorry about that, Kingdom."
We've got a multi-trauma.
Major head injuries.
"He's breathing, dazed, but conscious, probably shocky."
"Minimally responsive, compound fractures to the ribs, both tibia."
Fracture to both ankles.
Looks like his pelvis is fractured as well.
But it's hard to tell.
We've got multiple head injuries.
"BP is 78 over 44, it's going down."
"Respiration is, I'm going to say, 32."
- He's tachy.
- Heartbeat clocking 140.
Make that 150.
"All right, get a line in him, Danny."
Colour?
Saturation?
"His eyes are open and he's still looking around, but..."
There's Ollie the ophthalmologist with more eye data.
Got the line?
Line's in.
I've never seen either of these.
I'm so sorry.
You know I have no choice.
I have to order the release of the detainee.
"If you live, my daughter dies."
- We'll call Jenny.
- She'll stay on top of Haskell.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Why is your hand on my person?
"You, as a person of interest in this screwedup case, aren't going anywhere until I get answers."
Laura.
"Thank you, Jenny."
You'll follow him home?
You won't take your eyes off of him?
Cross my heart.
He's out.
"Down, girl."
Down.
I'm gonna sit by Mimi's bed in that hospital.
I'm not moving till she comes to and I.D.'s him.
Nico and a chick who should probably be committed... that's nothing new.
What's new is one who's worth the trouble.
Good luck at the hospital.
"Yeah, thanks."
"Welcome home, dirtbag."
"- Hello, officer."
- Ma'am.
Ma'am.
Is this Mimi's room?
"- She can't have visitors, ma'am."
- I'm a friend.
I'd like to be there when she wakes up.
"I love you too, baby."
"How could I possibly wake up a snoring bearlike you, girl?"
Where are you going?
God damn you.
I told you he was safe.
I'm so sorry.
I just fell asleep at friends...
Who the fuck are these people?
"I really am sorry, auntie."
They are nice people...
Your mom would kill us both.
It's already daylight.
"Asimple ID check, and you'd be caught."
Idiot!
You scared the shit out of me!
Take this...
It's from the photographer who took my pictures.
"Fine, whatever."
"Morning, mom."
He's still sleeping.
He stayed up all night studying.
"Sure, I'll tell him to call you."
"Hey, where have you been?"
I've been holding the room upstairs for you.
You have no clients left.
"Boss, I was at a photo shoot..."
"Today is the photographer, tomorrow it will be eitherfilms or dance..."
Let me explain...
"Son, you're betteroff as a Zenne."
Off you go...
"Cavit darling, should we also change the lights upstairs?"
Cunts!
They're paying plenty for it.
Company... attention!
Nick!
What are you doing over here?
Why aren't you with josie?
She got as sick of me as i got of the job.
She's all right.
Right wheel!
March!
There's plenty happening over there.
"Well, let's go in and tell uncle daniel about it."
He's awful homesick for news.
He's gonna get some.
"Captain, you take over the company."
"I ain't up on that army lingo, boss."
That's all right.
They'll do anything you say.
Right wheel!
March!
See?
Fours right in front!
March!
Fours wrong in back!
March!
"Uncle daniel... you'll be interested in knowing that some wall street fellas have posted a $50,000 reward for your capture and delivery to new york."
Oh... and beef dooley is out to get the reward.
Beef dooley?

"25,000 at 140."
I'll take that.
I'm taking all the gold that's being offered.
"Now, name your price."
"50,000 at 140."
I'll take it.
"100,000 at 140."
I'll buy it!
A million at 140.
And i'll buy that!
"The trading is closed for the day, gentlemen."
"I've found him, josie."
"Well, josie, here i am."
What do you want?
"Nick, is it true- what jim told me?"
That i'm fighting him?
Yes.
"Look, josie, do you think i'd have walked out on him if i didn't have to?"
I'm trying to save him from himself.
He can't win.
"He'll not only be hated, he'll be ruined."
And you'll make millions.
Yes... and it'll all be his if he wants it.
"Josie, we've both got to help him because he's after something that no human being can have."
Are you sure?
- I'm gonna eat in the car and then...
"- No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no."
"Give it, give it!"
Do you know what I was doing right before I almost died?
Exactly what you're doing.
Humoring a relative?
"No, no, scheduling my life down to the last minute."
"I mean, look at this..."
"""Call New York office... 4:17 P.M."""
Do you realize that everybody but us rounds up to the nearest five minutes?
"Today made me realize something, Mitchell."
"No, I don't want to be a 4:17 kind of person."
- Do you?
"- Yes, I do."
'Cause that phone call needs to be done by 4:23 so that I am not a dead man by 4:41.
Give me my phone.
- Nope.
Nope.
No.
- Give me...
Claire.
We're gonna do something together.
"Yes, take the rest of the day off."
- I can't do that.
"- Yes, you can."
I did!
"Yeah, 'cause you work for your father."
"- No, no, no, we need this, Mitchell."
"- Hey, come on, give me my..."
- We really need this.
"- Claire, I'm really swamped today, and I..."

"Indy, the torches are burning out."
"Go on, get out of here."
Hyah!
Sallah!
Hello!
Hello!
"Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?"
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!
"Thank you, my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here."
"That's right, isn't it?"
"Yes, we are very comfortable up here."
"So, once again, Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
You're about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find.
Who knows?
"In a thousand years, even you may be worth something."
Son of a bitch.
"I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr. Jones."
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place all alone.
"Slimy pig, you let me go!"
Stop it!
Marion!
Hang on.
Don't...
-Indy!
-Don't fall!
"Marion, I got you!"
I got you!
~ Sorry.
~ Dawson pawnbroker.
"A chance to get yourself a decent suit, John."
She died of leukaemia.
Left me her watch.
"~ I'll be with you in a tick, gents."
~ Thank you.
"What was your gran's name, son?"
Er...
I just called her Grannie.
I would've called her Glamorous Grannie.
This is a Rolex.
"Look, I-I just need the money."
"I'm sorry, son."
Mr Dawson has very strict rules about these things.
"I'm not sure that this really belonged to your gran, may she rest in peace."
"~ What are you trying to accuse us of, like?"
~ Being stupid.
~ How are you today?
~ Champion.
I'm sorry about the smell.
"The working stiff normally has all my sympathy, but this set of work-shy bastards, I could crucify."
I've got rats.
"We'd like to speak to Mr Dawson, please."
He's not in at the moment.
Perhaps I can help you?
Are you buying or selling?
Ah.
There is no Mr Dawson.
It's just a name I can blame when I have to say no.
"People can get, erm..."
What's the technical word?
I'm Eric Stoltz.
Alex is Watts.
Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones.
"Really, she's in love with Eric Stoltz."
So Amanda Jones is Conor?
I guess.
At first.
"Now men in general, but that's not the point."
The point is he's into me.
I knew there had to be some reason why he was spending that time with you.
I know.
It's so obvious now.
There are so many signs.
Signs.
Love signs.
You gotta tell me about the signs.
I love signs.
First they were small.
"At first when I called, he said, ""Good to hear from you."""
- Totally good sign.
- Right?
And then the next time I called he was with a woman but he took the call and we talked for a while.
- You know it was a woman?
"- Called her ""babe."""
"Okay, a guy doesn't leave a woman to go talk to another woman unless he's..."
And it gets more obvious.
"I mean, please."
There was no guy he was gonna fix me up with.
The fix-up was him.
No.
Yes.
He shows up without this fictitious Bill character.
"You just got out of juvee, and now you're talking about... going out there trying to start some more shit ?"
- [ Laughs ]
- That shit ain't funny.
"You act like you don't know who you are anymore, Derek."
And what's up out there for anybody who ain't you ?
"I'm still from this neighborhood, but you ?"
I guess that's what happens when a white girl goes to your head.
- Or gives you some.
"- Shut up, Lip."
Sorry.
I know what's out there.
"Ain't like you can't get past it, but you're too busy getting in your own way to see that."
"I had some help getting in my own way, didn't I ?"
[ Chattering ]
[Cheering]
"Hey, wassup ?"
What the hell was that ?
I was trying to block the ball.
Stupid bitch !
[Girls Yelling]
"Good going, Sara !"
Get off !
That's it !
"Nikki, back off !"
[ Chattering ]
"Oh, yeah !"
"Oh, yeah !"
"- Yeah, yeah !"

- [ indistinct Yelling ] - [Gunshots]
- [ indistinct Yelling ]
- What is this shit ?
Keep your paperwork clean.
"Jade, uh ..."
- There was one thing I want to talk to you.
- Tell me.
I do not want to do this anymore.
- What does that mean?
- I want out.
- What will you do for me does not work?
- I do not know.
I work in construction or something perhaps?
- Was funny.
"- Yes, people could not figure out exactly."
Now ...
So what about your little sister?
What about him?
Well ...
He can not look the same again now.
You know what?
"May look nice, but the right way to go Mike how much money you will earn?"
"Saatliği 15, 20 dollars?"
"Do not forget where you come from, Mike."
I'm very easy for your life.
But much more zorlaştırabilirim.
Become a smart boy.
Destroying a beautiful thing.
"Jump in, little sister, get new clothes."
And Mike ...
I have you with us and says otherwise.
I take good care of his nose.
"Angel, finished all the homework and dinner seven."
A very good girl.
"See you tomorrow, Mike."
"And, uh, jake's... (chris) all right, guys, first contestant is walking out,"
So the challenge has begun.
Please remain facing forward.
"Your first question is, ""who are you the least attracted to?"""
(gia) I need this rose really badly
Because I don't have a group that I belong to.
"I'm kind of, like, solo,"
So this rose is really important for me
To keep myself safe and to keep jake safe.
"That is a direct hit, and a point for you, contestant."
(bell dings)
Here comes the next contestant.
Who are you least attracted to?
That one did not miss.
(bell dings) on william.
Who are you least attracted to?
And now...
I'm here to kill Choi Eung-chan.
I am... the City Hunter.
Da-hye's own cafe latte.
It's so pretty.
You're now a real barista.
Right?
Nana.
Was it hard burying your father?
Your dark circles are hanging low.
Are they?
Cover them up.
"Hello, all."
Da-hye.
Nana.
Hello.
Then what?
- Who is he?
- I thought he was you.
Especially when we couldn't find you.
Then one of my men told me you were at Major Lescourt's funeral.
I thought it was a sick joke.
I almost fired him.
- But who is he?
- A good question.
Come on.
We are talking to witnesses.
Apparently he was being chased.
There's evidence he had been tortured.
His death was not an easy one.
"Here's the bag, sir."
This was found in the victim's pockets.
These matches are from the Hotel Chevre d'Or.
- Our men are there now.
- Let's go.
"Alain, walt."
This is not your case.
I'm not sure I want you involved at this point.
I am involved!
Did you see his face?
Are you coming or what?
"Monsieur Suverov, thank God!"
This man told me you were killed in a car accident.
"- Good morning, sir."
- You only had your hair cut!
Yes.
Mikhail Suverov.
Now If you want access to his room... why don't you ask Monsieur Suverov?
It's true!
- Skinny dudes...
- My sister married down.
Seriously.
"Oh, ""married down""?"
We were just having this conversation.
"""Married down""?"
"No, chunky is like marrying...sideways!"
"[ Laughing ] ""Sideways."""
Ferrara:
"Like, ""drag race"" to me means something totally different to you guys, I'm guessing."
It's true.
"And I'm guessing ""tranny"" means something different to me than it does to you."
"What does ""tranny"" mean to you?"
"""Tranny"" means the transmission."
Really?
I think we need to get you a drag name.
"Oh, no."
You're in San Francisco.
"I mean, everybody has a drag name here."
Ready?
Wait.
We're naming her miss Tess Tosterone.
"""Miss Tess tosterone."""
You know what?
That's pretty funny.
You know what?
You should come in and check out the view.
I really...
I got so many other calls.
"I really can't, but you guys have been great."
"Yeah, whatever."
What are you two zibs doing?
"You should be more careful with this, sir."
What the hell?
"Are you trying to lift my card, asshole?"
"Hey, he's not an asshole."
You're the asshole.
"My God, an American eagle."
"Go, go, go!"
He's coming!
- I know!
I know!
"- Go, go, go!"
"- I'm going, I'm going!"
"- Go, go!"
- Okay!
"- Turn, turn, turn!"
- I'm turning!
- God!
That did not go well!
I know!
I was there!
"His big hobby, his passion is darts."
- Yeah.
"- No, he's in a darts league that competes every Friday at a pub called St. James's Well."
Am I the only one who thinks there's something off about this job?
The only thing off is Maddie's focus.
"Give me a break, Max."
"Maddie, I want to make something very clear."
This job happens to be of special interest to the Doctor.
Max is just freaking out 'cause I had coffee and talked to some guy at a coffee shop.
"No, it's the way that you were talking to him that concerns me."
"You know what, Sal?"
- Okay...
"Maggie, you're being ridiculous."
"Okay, there is a man's footprint, a formal wear shoe, look at that."
"- All right, Mags, it's just..."
- [screams]
- You're dead.

"Oh, my God, Mark!"

- My larynx.

"Gingersnap, don't you ever apologize for your strength."
Got it.
Why were you in Emma's room wearing a tuxedo?
"Hey, man, I was just trying to sneak in and surprise my lady."
That's very romantic.
"Excuse me, I have to take a moment... [whispers] What's happening?"
'Cause that was beautiful.
"Hey, I have an idea."
Wanna play some games?
"One moment, Gingersnap."
I have to say something.
"Oh, Bruce, I have spent most of my life closed off to intimacy, protecting myself, but, since we've met, I've learned to open up and lay down my emotional weapons."
"I love you, babe."
I love you too.
You know what I love?
Games.

How can I leave your brother on his own?
Let me go.

Please excuse the drama.
Say hi to yourparents.
"Mom, come here."
"We leave and you stay here, OK?"
Promise to write!
Promise me.
"Call them to come back, right away."
"Kezban, what are you angry for?"
Aren't you the one who had Ahmet followed?
There is something fishy about the whole thing.
He said Ahmet is clean but I am sure he isn't...
Call the girl to come back.
There is no point keeping herthere.
Mom.
Someone's at the door!
Is Can Ozturk here?
Hold on.
You asshole.
Amoustache?
My lover likes it.
You ruined a good job for a fuck?
Something could have happened to you.
I've ordered an MRI.
"Don't be silly, Christine."
Only the Chief of Neuro can order an MRI.
You know that.
"That's not true, actually."
What do you mean?
I did it.
At 7:10 this morning.
I signed off on the paperwork.
Surely not in Steg's name?
How do I know what it looked like to the tech on duty?
"Come on, Brenda."
Kingdom Hospital Neuro can't grind to a halt because Steg oversleeps.
Don't look at him.
"Hey, Doc, you're losing it."
"What's up, Doc?"
You should be sterilized.
At least then you couldn't breed.
"Hey, you forgot something, Doc."
Maintenance.
This is where I work.
"Will you try to remember that, Mama?"
"Yes, Bobby."
"You're a bit of a crackpot, I guess."
But I'm very fond of you.
"- I have some work to do up here, so..."
"- Honey, don't worry about me."

You never did things like everyone else.
Why not?
Because that's you.
That's why you're my favorite daughter.
You're not supposed to say that.
I don't give a shit.
"I'm retired, I'll say what I want to."
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.
"Wait, wait, wait!"
Come here.
Stop.

They also cut out the cucumbers in there.
I was thinking that.
There was the biggest cucumber you've ever seen.
They cut that out?

How can it be end of story?
"I mean, whose hand is it?"
The one a bloke killed over the road.
Mrs Slocombe dragged the hand in.
OK?
"Three little words, Moz?"
999.
Three more.
"Fuck off, Kuldip."

- You used to dance ?
"Used to, as in don't anymore and no, I don't want to talk about it."
"So, is that why you brought up that rond dejambe attitude shit... because you don't want to talk about it ?"
It's really not a big deal.

We sent food there sometimes.
I can give you the address.
- Are you sure this is the address?
- I'm positive.
Now what?
There's no mother and no grandmother!
"This is Le Panier, right?"
You want to wander around aimlessly?
- Why not?
- We don't even have an address.
So what do you suggest?
- Why don't you check the phone book?
"- We did, when you were asleep."
Then look again.
I'm going to look around.
And ask people if they're Maurice Leon?

Uh?
Where are they?
The beach.
[Cicadas].
"Hey, how long?"
Has to be about at least 30mn before it gets back over here.
"Okay, we'll be back."
Let's go.
You remember when mom used to take us here to wait?
We start over in Galveston.
Just like she wanted.
It will be like ....
The Swiss family Wilson or something.
What?
You were all here?
Clark came to apologize to Grandma.
He found out about Grandpa by reading that telegram.
"But Father, you said..."
I'm sorry.
It was because I was stupid.
Hello.
"My son, Tateo, and my daughter, Minako."
I'm Clark.
How do you do?
"My son, Shinjiro."
My daughter.
They're adorable.
I'm so happy to meet you.
After August 9... let's all go... to Hawaii with Aunty.
My uncle...
Right here?
And this is... the monument built for the children who died on that day.
With these children... my uncle died.
Just where did it happen?
That's something we just can't find.
You can't find?
That day... the whole town was in flames.
And this place was filled with people who came here to try and escape from it.
But the school had also been burned.
The people were burned.
"Iron, everything."
These people are the classmates of the children who died here.
These people...
"Somehow, they scare me."
It's because... those are the people who witnessed the worst fear.
- What is it?
At our 3 o'clock!
New enemy!
New enemy closing in from dead ahead!
They're attacking as a team?
"From overhead, too!"
Incoming!
A Landing Castle...
"All units, brace for impact!"
Multiple Landing Castles...
Multiple Kataphraktoi...
Simultaneously!
He's made his move!
It's him!
Right.
It's too late for doubts now.
There is no returning from this place I have come to.
It was an uneventful morning... quiet.
"Instead of saving every episode of ""the bachelor,"""

"The kids had a Friday off of school, so we picked up Manny and went to our favorite pancake place..."
Relaxing.
"Mitchell, hi."
What?
!
"Oh, have him tell Cam"
I'll pick him up for racquetball in an hour.
I can't even hear him it's so loud.
-It is not possible!
-Following.
How you are called?
-Mukendi Ngalula.
-Mukendi what?
-Mukendi Ngalula.
What do you want?
A skull.
In order to have dinner tonight.
Take care well.
"Doctor, is a call for you."
Following.
It says?
"Hello, Laura."
"Yes, you tell me, you tell me."
"I assure it to you, one is the Disease of Addison."
You do not worry.
"If it is cured in time, it does not pass anything."
"You hear, is a human case."
"That poor man is counted everything to me,"
"He does not have family, not even it has Social Security."
"In agreement, agreement."
"It hears, Laura, now I have class, already you understand to me..."
"Yes, I understand."
This one case does not interest to you.
"Well, I will do that they enter position to him."
"You do not worry, I will not take to the clinic of Ciotti."
"In agreement, yes."
Goodbye.
"-God mine, I am bad."
-What happens to you?
I am bad.
They have flown over the White House.
It is an unbelievable moment down here.
People are going wild.
And Emily Cale is undoubtedly a beautiful hero of the day.
Emily Cale is a little hero.
This is an unprecedented moment in U. S. history.
That search you requested came back.
"Emily, can you believe how many people have seen your video blog?"
It's not a video blog.
It's a YouTube channel.
Howmany?
Seven hundred million people.
Daughters.
Jesus!
"Oh, my God."
Are you okay?
Honest Abe.
My wife got this for me.
For the inauguration.
Are you kidding me?
You got shot in the wa..?
What I'm telling you is that good old Abe took a second bullet for me.
Thank you.
Thank you for what you did for Emily.
"It's my sacrifice, right?"
"Yes, sir."
Yep.
"John, listen."
This isn't over yet.
Walker had no prior contact..
"with any of the terrorists, but someone else did."
"Wait, wait, wait."
I'm good.
All that wouldn't have happened if you didn't let her get under your skin.
You're right.
She's driving me crazy.
And I'm driving Anna-Kat crazy.
"Next thing you know, we've got a backpack full of cat heads."
- What?
- It's a medical term.
"No matter what my mother does,"
I'm going to ignore her and stay calm.
Or you can sit down and finally tell her how you feel.
"God, no."
I'm saving that stuff to say to her coffin.
"Angela, I really need you for Thanksgiving to be a buffer for my mom."
Mnh-mnh.
Too late.
I'm already Doris' buffer.
Ugh.
My parents are so grateful for all the money I give them on Thanksgiving.
- It's disgusting.
- I really need a buffer!
"Hi, everybody!"
- Hey.
"- Hi, Viv."
"Oh, my gosh!"
That cheeseburger is huge.
It's just the size that it comes as.
It's enormous.
"It's a normal-sized cheeseburger, Viv."
I love cheeseburgers.
I eat them all the time.
Sure you do.
"his passions, his pursuits?"
- He has a smart little pointer...
- Where is Allenham?
Nice little estate three miles east.
He is to inherit it from a relative.
Lady Allen is the name.
It's Col. Brandon.
I should go out and keep watch.
You're looking out for Willoughby.
You'll not think of Brandon now.
Come in.
"Good morning, Brandon."
- How is the invalid?
"- Thank you so much, Colonel."
Why set your cap at Willoughby when you've already made such a conquest?
I'll not set my cap at anyone.
- Lady Allen's nephew?
- He visits.
For he's to inherit.
He has a pretty estate of his own.
Combe Magna in Somerset.
I'd not give him up to a younger sister for tumbling down hills.
The man himself.
Come.
Brandon.
We know when we are not wanted.
Thank you so much for calling.
Marianne.
The colonel and Sir John are leaving.
Goodbye.
Thank you for the flowers.
"- How do you do, Colonel?"
"Yeah, I guess that's more fun."
You're still kind of weird though.
Whatever's on here might make that murderboard look like kiddie hour.
"Watch this. ‭Noah, we're gonna be late for school."
(LINE RINGING) Shh!
"Shh, shh, shh."
"Crescent Palms, your place to relax in Lakewood."
- This is Eddie.
How can...?
"- You think you're pretty smart, huh?"
I want to know who else you told about that storage unit.
- Who is this?
"- Oh, come on."
It's Noah Foster from The Morgue.
We talked last night.
"I told you already, I don't have anything else to say."
"(MUTTERING) Oh, that's nice."
Okay.
"Look, you're spinning out these conspiracy theories that just don't exist, man."
"Just wait for the camera to sync up, okay?"
And... we are syncing.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
We're almost a quarter synced.
What are you hiding?
We are almost there.
"Come on, come on, come on."
"Oh, damn it!"
It was just streaming only.
There's nothing on here.
"Uh, careful with that."
It's a bookend.
Very sturdy.
Take care.
Paul.
"Thank you, Lester."
"J, London's great, but I'm missing the New York skyline."
I hope you're well.

Fax this to Galliano's buttmaker's boyfriend stylist... in Monaco.
You freak!
- What are those for?
- We're doing a strain... on say gal shalls and Roxanne gave it 6 pages.
Come in.
- I have to talk to you.
- You want another raise?
"I don't get paid, I'm an intern."
I think I might know who the Yuri is.
Let's continue with the pedicure later.
Privacy.
Let's talk.
Delicious!
Good morning!
"Good morning, boys!"
"Good morning, good morning, good morning."
"Wow, are we silent!"
- Did somebody die here?
- Yeah.
Every dog has his day...
"It's obvious that, the way you two are dressed, you're not here..."
- to talk to me about fashion.
- I'm afraid we're not.
"Lieutenant Pathmark, you're under arrest for the insider trading... code 327B, for industrial espionage."
I always knew you were the Yuri.
You have the right to remain silent...
Wait.
"Is that going in my file, too?"
"Now we're not going to recommend you leave the school,"
Because ms.
Rinsky would like to handle this directly.
"Dear, I blame myself."
"When you acted out,"
I should never have banned you.
"I mean, I'm an educator."
I believe in second chances.
"Therefore, you are now the opposite of banned."
You're gonna be the new room mommy.
"You'll be in charge of the phone tree,"
"And the school's pets are gonna be yours on vacations,"
And every Tuesday and Thursday...
Crossing guard.
"Oh, come on!"
And please...
Get help with your drinking.
Brick needs a mother.
Will do.
"Let's go, frankie."
"Oh, my god, aunt Edie."
I can't believe you just sprayed that guy right in the face.
That was nothing!
I've been teargassed in the face!
What?
!
Why?
"Oh, we were at a jazz club, and some of the white kids"
Wanted to dance with the black kids.
"Oh, my god."
(TRAIN RATTLES BY)
Where is Cameron?
I haven't seen Cameron for two years.
I don't know what you expect me to tell you.
"No offence, but I think you do."
"So, you were at art school together?"
Well...
I was at art school.
He'd hang around the refectory.
"Sort of, you know talking art."
LUTHER:
Did he ever talk about this?
(LAUGHS)
Spring-Heeled jack?
Yeah.
About ten zillion times.
"Yes, it was his childhood obsession."
Spring-Heeled Jack's in the cupboard.
"Spring-Heeled Jack's waiting at the bottom of the garden, in the bushes."
He had to see somebody about it.
A psychologist or a psychoanalyst.
"Anyway, they teased him about it."
It made him feel like a freak.
"I suppose he was a freak, really."
Still is.
A freaky little freak.
Did Cameron ever hurt you?
No.
- Why did you hesitate?
- Because sometimes... he'd get this look in his eyes.
What look?
Like he wanted to.
"You were expecting a package that day, some delivery?"
Not that I know of.
"Groceries, cleaning, uh, a package?"
I really wouldn't know.
"See, Karl takes care of all that."
I see.
Would you like to ask him?
"No, never mind, it's...."
It's very remote.
"No, never mind."
Yeah.
Would you like some more coffee?
Please.
That's cute.
"Your daughter, she's the artist?"
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
"Incidentally, um you might ask your daughter if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings in her room that night."
"Look, he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room."
"Oh, I know, I realize but if certain British doctors never asked, ""What is this fungus?"" we wouldn't today have penicillin."
Correct?
"Well, when she's better, I'll ask her."
"-Yeah, couldn't hurt."
-Okay.
"Uh, in the meantime...."
That's okay.
"-I really hate to ask you this, but--"
-What?
"For my daughter, could you please give an autograph?"
Of course.
"Uh, where's a pencil?"
Right here.
"Come to think of it, that made me gag, too."
Okay.
Done.
[woman crying]
"Listen, crying in a women's dressing room?"
"Whoever it is, girl, big butts are in."
[crying continues]
That's Sophie's cry.
"I know, 'cause I hear it through the vent when she watches Nashville."
Sophie?
(Sophie) No.
Are you okay?
"(Sophie) It's not me, but I'm okay."
[sobbing continues]
"Sophie, why are you crying?"
When I heard what you said about the dresses...
It's just--
"It's almost, kind of like, you think I have bad taste or something."
No.
Caroline thinks you have great taste.
She does?
"Well, then she should say so."
Now.
"Well, Sophie, I think you have your own unique style."
"And I think... that I didn't hear the words ""great"" or ""taste."""
"Sophie, what do you even care what I think?"
Just say it!
"Sophie, I think you have great taste."
You do?
[Sophie laughs]
"Then, what are we doing sitting here?"
Let's go and get those dresses back!
Who the fuck asked ya anything?
I didn't even ask ya anything.
At least wait to hear what I'm going to say.
"All right, what?"
"Ok, what."
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?
What the fuck is this world coming to?
I can't believe this.
"A Jew broad, prejudiced against Italians."
"Anyway, she won't go out with me alone without her girlfriend."
So you come along for her friend.
See?
I knew it. I knew it.
What the fuck is wrong with that?
-When is this?
-Tomorrow night.
"I can't tomorrow night, I gotta meet Tuddy."
You could meet Tuddy.
You could fuckin' come early and then still go.
-Why do you always do this?
-Don't give me that shit.
What did I ask you for?
A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.
I'm trying to bang this fuckin' broad.
You wanna help me out?
I don't understand you.
She's fuckin' beautiful!
Her fuckin' family they live in the Five Towns.
"Shh, shh, shh, shh."
[Cat purrs]
"Oh, you seem to have the touch."
[Cat yowls] Ow!
Majique!
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
"Yeah, it's an occupational hazard."
I'm sure she didn't mean it.
"She's a good kitty, aren't you, Majique?"
[Purrs]
[Trunk slams] Hey.
Where's the body?
"First floor, room at the back."
- It's a little messy.
"- Well, what do you we know?"
"Uh, male, mid-40s."
Looks like somebody took a weed wacker to this throat.
Checked in three weeks ago under the name Nathaniel Adams.
"Clerk says he kept to himself, paid his rent, listed his home as New York City."
There was no sign of forced entry.
Maid discovered the body about an hour ago.
You weren't kidding about the weed wacker.
Looks more like a hatchet.
Except his head's still here.
- Who rolled the body?
- Nobody.
That's the way the maid said she found him.
"Well, this body's been rolled."
The pattern on the carpet matches the blood on his shirt.
That could have been the killer.
"There's no wallet, nothing in his pockets."
- No.
- Not you either?
Willy Kos... no.
I've never heard of that name.
Why?
Because she had his passport with her.
Stained with blood..
And forged.
You know nothing about this?
"No, how would I know with whom this crazy woman has associated with."
"I let her work with me out of pure compassion and good-heartedness upon her arrival from the East Zone, and for that I'm now interrogated!"
Hold on.
Bring the woman in here!
There's a possibility she might remember you.
- But what if she is dangerous?
"- What could she possibly do to you, Anna?"
"Don't worry, she's complety harmless."
My God.
She really is crazy.
Pauline.
Mrs John.
"Pauline, oh my goodness."
What has Bruno done to you?
Bruno?
Bruno!
BRUNO!
What is it?
Let me go!
Everything is like it should be.
"See, she really is insane!"
"So you recognize me, right?"
Did you beat me?
That was a f unny thing to say.
What was the matter with it?
He fell f or it.
Yes.
He f ound it easy to believe.
Martinelli's beach house fronted on the Gulf.
A big place he'd probably built with hot priorities and cold dice.
"All right, get out, quick!"
- Did they go f or it?
- They said they'd send a police car.
What time have you got?
Five to 9.
Hello?
Hotel Southern?
This is Mr. Murdock.
"Give me the manager, will you, honey?"
"Well, this was gonna be it. lf l got that letter, it was all I needed."
"If everything rolls on rubber, I'll be at your place by 11."
- Can't I wait down the road?
- No.
This is Operation Solo.
I don't want you hurt.
"By the way, where is Surf 3181?"
The penthouse at The Gables.
"You won't take any f ool chances, will you?"
Not any f ooler than I'm taking now doing that.
- Be caref ul.
- Sure.
It's funny how loud crickets sound and the way you feel.
"Funny, too, how a kiss stays on."
The way you can still taste it.
Martinelli was still up there.
Can you please tell me what's really going on?
"Nothing, Joanie."
It was fate.
"If Sophia hadn't sent me packing,"
I never would've met this adorable little equine shrinky-dink.
Those are our vows she's chewing.
Hmm?
"Uh, here."
There.
(sighs)
"Come on, Lemonade."
I'll take you back to the barn.
The trainer was nice enough to take her back.
"Evidently, this happens all the time."
"What she hadn't told me is the minute you take them off the ranch, they lose 40% of their value."
(yips)
Who are you?
This is Tank.
Tank's a Yorkie.
"Oh, my goodness."
"Hello, Tank."
I'm John.
"I was thinking about what you said, honey, and-and maybe this isn't about a horse; maybe this is about you struggling with Sophia getting older."
And so I got you a pet that's gonna stay little forever.
"Oh, thanks, Joanie."
"You're so welcome, sweetheart."
I love you.
"- (growls, barks) - (gasps)"
Seriously?
Bitches love me.
Did you get me a prostitute?
"- No, he's a dancer."
She didn't even bother packing her bags!
How she was fed up with my poor cop father!
And he with her.
It killed her.
She wallowed with those pigs.
"In their dough, their drugs, their shit!"
"Mommy, mommy, my mommy!"
I followed.
"They fed me, they dressed me, they beat me, but they never sullied me."
"I'm like her, I'm like her,"
"I'm like her, like her..."
like her...
I'm like her...
"Mommy, mommy... mommy!"
My mommy...
Now that I am King... and that the Queen is Queen...
"""Impossible"" is a French word."
I'll never marry you.
Leave the ending to me.
I need this money!
I need this money...
It's too swell.
Expatriation!
What is that?
"Oh yes, I forgot to tell you, the big surprise!"
Your mother's corset exploded.
"Ambulance, firemen, four nurses, two obstetricians."
"Nine and a half pounds on arrival, incognito for seven months!"
A triumph!
It's all your doing...

I'm trying something a little bit different.
I am standing right here.
Tucked in the mess of my own fear.
Far from fine.
In your eyes I seem to fall farther and faster
Than you have time to catch me.
From a boy balanced on his shoulders
Who can take on the stars.
Where were you from bedtime to dawn?
"Tucking me in, instead of ducking out."
Where are your arms when I just need them
To wrap around and hold me?
"I am standing right here, just as you left me."
I am begging right here for you to see me.
I will try and I will try.
I'll try to be whoever you need me.
See me.

"Right there in front of your fucking boy,"
I don't give a shit.

"You know, he's getting married."

"[Grimsby] Well, now, Eric."
It appears that I was mistaken.
"This mystery maiden of yours does, in fact, exist."
[Grimsby] A-And she is lovely.
"Congratulations, my dear."
[Eric] We wish to be married as soon as possible.
"[Grimsby] Oh, yes, of course, Eric, but, uh, these things do take time, you know."
"This afternoon, Grimsby."
The wedding ship departs at sunset.
Oh.
Oh.
"Very well, Eric, uh, as you wish."

Damien said you were a ball breaker.
"Well, Damien Scott talks too much and to people he shouldn't."
He knows he can trust me.
Please.
Please let go.

- Please don't hurt me.
"- I said, what's the count?"
"- Look, I haven't even done anything!"
What's the count?
Plus 18.
"Oh, you've gotta be kidding."
"Congratulations, Ben."
"Sorry, we had to make sure you'd keep the count under pressure."
Welcome to the team.
We didn't mean it.
"It's okay, Campbell, I cried inside that bag."

We're going.
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.

"I'll be in my room, Mike."
"Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada."
I brought the children to say goodbye to you.
I'm very happy for you.
I always knew you were too smart to let any of them beat you.
-Why don't you sit down?
"-No, I'm not going to stay long."
There are some things I'd like to talk to you about.
"Things that have been on my mind, changes I want to make."
"I think it's too late for changes, Michael."
-I wasn't going to say anything...
"-What do you mean, ""too late""?"
What really happened with Pentangeli?
-His brother came and helped him.
-I didn't even know he had a brother.
Where is he now?
"He's on a plane, back to Sicily."
All he had to do was show his face.
"It was between the brothers, Kay."
I had nothing to do with it.
I don't want you going!
"Not you, not the kids."
No.

You're the same Yoyo of 3 years ago.
You shouldn't even talk about it.

No.

That's why I come looking for you.

"So, where is he?"
I--
Oh.
I didn't hear you girls come in.
Oh.
"Uh, I was just doodling the way a depressed person does."
- Ha!
- How would you even climb up the Arch?
"That was a thoughtless, childish, moronic thing to do!"
"Okay, I'm-- I'm sorry, but... on the other hand, what reason do I have to live?"
I don't know.
Why don't you ask the Arch?
"No, I mean it."
"My kids are gone, I have no wife, even my parents have died."

All this happened because... some idiot had placed a scarecrow in the middle of the road.
I consoled her that it was not her fault.
But she kept crying.
We couldn't sleep out of fear.

"Who is it, Ashwini?"

I said we'd tell him later ourselves.
He doesn't eat Warthog.
But he loved it.
I asked.
"""Know what you just ate?"
"Warthog."""
"""No way."
"That was a Wiener Schnitzel."""
"I said, ""See how wrong you can be?"""
'Cause a Warthog doesn't have dark meat like our wild boar.

It's only a Band-Aid.
Did you see a little girl?
"If kids are wandering out of Paeds, Dr. James is going to be very unhappy."
I have never seen Dr. James unhappy.
There you are.
I've been so worried about you.
"Hon, stay on the lane, okay?"
I hate it when you run on the main road.
"It's October, in case you haven't noticed."
There's no traffic on the main road.
All the summer people went home a month ago...
God bless their pointy little heads.
"Well, still, it makes me nervous, so just stay on the lane, okay?"
- I suppose I could.
- Great.
"- And by the way, you were great."
- So were you.
- See you later.
"- Peter, what are you painting?"
I'll go with you ifyou go home.
Go home ?
"Get the hell away from me, you punk-ass bitch."
You're the one don't have the balls.
to walk away from this shit.
"I should have tookyour ass tojail along with mine, man."
"But you didn't, so you do not have to get in that car."
"Malakai, you are so much smarter than this shit."
I know what you can be.
I know what you're capable of.
Let'sjust walk away.
Walk away to what ?
"I'm not you, Derek."
I can't do nothing but what I'm doing.
"I can't go to Georgetown with a 1 0.0 G.P.A., operating on people, doing brain surgery..."
- or whateveryou're gonna be doing.
"- You can, man."
"- lf l can do it, you can do it."
- All I have is my respect.
Andthat's what lgotta go take care of.
"You wanna bail out on me, man ?"
That's fline.
But you can kiss my ass with all your future bullshit.
I know who the hell I am...
right now.
"Kai, man, wait, man."
"Let's go, man."
[CarEngineStarts]
Sara ?
Ready to go ?
Um--
Yes.
Yes.
Good morning.
Nozu Good morning.
"Hey, the performance in Tengeki looks like it's set."
Oh really?
Kayama-sensei is there.
Oh?
He's driving a bus.
Why?
What happened?
He can't dance.
He hurt his foot in the war.
"You know, his right foot."
Your feet are your career.
What's happened?
This was so sudden.
"He was such a good teacher, but everyone's forgotten about him."
I wonder what goes through his mind when he's driving his bus.
When my father was a student he lived at my mother's house and they supported him.
He was a hard-working and honest scholar back then.
He was blessed in many ways.
"Your mother was dancing ballet then, wasn't she?"
It's a strange combination.
It sure is.
Especially since my mother likes someone else.
Really?
My mother has been seeing someone since she was in her twenties.
But she had children with my father - me and my sister.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'd like you to put another cheque in for me.
Certainly.
Yes!
Ha ha!
Ooh!
I might have overcooked that.
Ha!
This is amazing!
Once more!
I am a driving god!
"It is a car fit for one, at least."
TYRES SCREECH
So the driving god sped off there at 5mph.
Track days are such big business that there are lots of companies making cars designed for the purpose - racers with indicators so they can go on roads.
This Palmer Jag is one of them.
"It costs £47,000, and that's a lot."
"Don't worry - there are lots of others, which are cheaper."
"# Hey, ooh-wooh"
# Wooh-why
# Hey he-ey... #
That's the stats.
"Now, let's see which is fastest on the track."
"# I don't know what to say, you don't care"
# Anyway
# I'm a man in a rage
# With a girl I betrayed
"# Here comes love, tastes like honey"
# You can't buy it with money
# You're not alone any more
# You shook me to the core
# You shook me to the core... #
Here are the cars in reverse order.
"In 5th place, the Lotus Elise at 1.28.02."
4th: the Caterham at 1.25 flat.
Eden of the East.
Hirasawa-san... users always complain about the system being down.
Don't let it get to you.
sweat and snot!
Leave the snot out!
what do we do now that we can't help Takkun?
I have a suggestion! why don't we change our HQ's location?
To where?
I set up our room at the university as a fallback.
The old Eden System is still in there.
that settles it.
What better place to save Vintage's butt.
Agreed.
It's from Saki!
I'm heading to the airport now.
Takizawa-kun is returning to Japan.
What the heck?
I'm afraid your journey ends here.
Hey...
What's this mean?
No. 01's launching a missile?
I need to know No. 01's target.
launch the remaining missiles.
Request accepted.
Noblesse oblige.
I pray that your plan to destroy and rebuild leaves you as our strongest savior.
Now I'm gone?
Juiz.
Juiz?
Did Mononobe-san manage to locate Juiz and launch missiles at her?
my request is still being carried out too.
Mononobe-san.
I'll read it to you.
"""Dear Karen, just a note to thank you for your cooperation"""
"""in helping to keep Bob here."""
"""I don't know what the school would do without him,"""
"""or for that matter, what I would do without him."""
"""I will return the favor someday."""
"""Gobs of love, Gretchen."""
"Why, that dirty double-crosser."
What did I tell you?
I'd do anything to help Bob go overseas.
So would I.
"Oh, I mean, I would like to help him out, too, 'cause he's a very nice fellow."
I have an idea.
"Look, how would it be if you and I wrote another letter to Colonel Blair's wife, and in that letter..."
"No, but we would change all the words our way."
No.
How would it...
"Oh, I know."
We'll have Gretchen phone Colonel Blair's wife.
"Say, that's great."
"Oh, wait a minute."
Gretchen would never do that.
And I have a sneaking suspicion that's exactly what she's going to do.
Here.
Huh?
Dormitory.
Okay.
Hello?
WOMAN:
"The time, please."
The time?
The time is exactly 7:57.
"No, a cash trail is very fucking bad for us."
- Oh.
"- Hey, hold on there, Hunk of the Month."
"If I'm going down, you're going down, too."
I don't know what this is about.
Good point.
Dan and Amy.
They're getting paid cash from the campaign fund to bring down the bill.
"There, you've been blooded."
So join the circle jerk.
Grab a dick.
Wish I could hear what you were saying over that incessant drilling sound.
- What are you doing?
Shh!
What cash?
What Dan and Amy?
Ben's paying Dan and Amy to lobby against the bill and now there's a cash trail and we're all incriminated.
But you're not.
"Oh, my God, now you are!"
Well done.
Now I feel a lot better.
"Did you know, Tom?"
"Ma'am, I am as shocked as you are."
"Shocked and disappointed, Ben."
"Ma'am, Moyes is voting yes."
Ruiz is voting yes.
This comes down to one vote.
We need Congressman Pierce.
My future depends on that dumb fucking elf?
Jeez... where is he?
I'm so proud of how brave you've been.
"I was looking for some lotion, but they didn't..."
Let's go.
"So, uh, what do you want to talk about?"
"Well, um, do you know my name?"
- Uh...
- It's Wendy.
Wendy.
- Wendy?
- Yeah?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Lot of homework?
"- Yeah, a lot."
You?
Yeah.
"Look, Cory, I know I've been forbidden to give you any advice on any subject ever again, so if there's any information you'd like to voluntarily offer about the current events of your life, I'm listening."
- How was my date?
- Yeah.
- I had a real good time.
"- So, what was your technique?"
"Look, I know you know everything there is to know about women and I don't know anything, so I did what I do best..."
I was real nervous and I nodded a lot.
Did she like that?
"I don't know, but when we were done,"
I asked her if she maybe wanted to go out again.
"She said, ""Yeah, I would."""
Cool.
- Cor?
- Yeah?
"So, how did you nod?"
"I mean, was it like this or...?"
(laughs)
Who's Danny Moore?
He's been talking about a beating on you.
Who is he?
- I don't know who he is!
- That kid you bumped into
- and then called a shortarse.
- That was Jay.
You'll have to go and knock him out now.
- Teach him a lesson.
"- If you see him,"
- tell him it's a mistake.
- I'm not getting involved.
He's from a hard family in Northwood.
His brother did time.
"Oh, Northwood?"
"Been nice knowing you, Si!"
"What's this, my dad's bigger than your dad?"
"What are we, 12?"
"- I think he is 12, actually."
"- You're not scared are you, Si?"
"No, it's just I'm not going to look cool beating up a kid."
- And you couldn't.
"- Yes, I could, can we just leave it?"
I'm not fighting anyone.
"Oh yeah, nice one."
Mature.
"Compared to Simon, my first day was turning out OK."
"After a morning of pretending cars were broken and overcharging middle-class women, we had bonded over a pint."
"Thanks, guys."
That was a much more civilised way to welcome me.
It's shame we won't get to do it again...
"Oh, no!"
Pack up the clothes.
I'll go get a bag.
Does she like Seo Yoon Jae that much?
What's with these clothes?
Is this a key to this house?
"No, it's not."
I wonder if it's a key to our newlywed home that we've signed off on?
What do we do?
Just be natural and answer the call real quick.
What?
-Hello?
"-Hey, Yoon Jae."
It's Se Young.
The doctor friend that you saw.
Do you know how worried I've been because I couldn't get a hold of you?
I heard you've been in an accident?
I found out when the hospital received your belongings.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Uh...
I'm fine now.
I thought so...
You were being weird earlier.
I'm coming over right now with your stuff.
"I'm close by, so I'll be there soon."
Okay...
She says she's coming here.
That's good.
I didn't think to get Yoon Jae's belonging because I was too out of sorts.
I guess she's bringing it back for you.
What do we do about Yoon Jae's job at the hospital tomorrow?
Do I have to go to work?
You can't do that.
"He tried to kill me, and I killed him first."
But you hid the body!
Why?
"Come in, Allison."
Allison!
I was never happier to see anyone in my life.
Are you all right?
"-Hi, Ted."
"-Hi, Allison."
"Mr. Partridge, I can testify about Lucas."
I saw him beat her.
"It will help, believe me."
We appreciate you coming for the trial.
-You're going to get her off?
-We're going to do the best we can.
But the jury decides on the one thing:
evidence.
"Now, it adds up to this:"
we have a murder and a defense that's too simple to be good.
It's open to attack from many sides.
"Selena, have you told me the whole story?"
I'm sorry!
There's no more to tell.
"Yeah, I'll take the dress shop before, okay?"
"Hello, Allison."
-You look well.
-With the drink in my hand?
Would you care for something?
I moved hoping I'd be left alone.
"-You haven't learned, have you?"
"-Oh, yes, I have, mother."
I learned to smoke and drink.
"Hmm, I see that you've been looking at the papers again."
Mm-hmm.
You want to tell me what's going on?
Okay.
Don't freak.
I got mugged today.
You got mugged?
!
"Not freaking, remember?"
I think someone's after the papers.
How do you know that?
Just tell me what happened.
"All right, since Mom couldn't help you with the encryption,"
I went to see Dad today.
Yeah?
He said that there might be something in the time capsule that could help me decode the papers.
Really.
It's--
It's under the bed.
Hello?
(Leo on phone) Angela.
"Hey, Leo."
I've been researching our artist.
He's got no money troubles.
No history of illicit or suspicious dealings.
He's clean.
Except for the fact that he was lying about something
"(Leo) Yeah, but what?"
Maybe it's time to have another conversation with Mr. Walker.
"I've already thought of that, but he's not answering his phone."
"I guess we're just gonna have to pay him a visit, then."
All right.
Admit what I did.
Lily's away on a trip with some friends.
I want to speak with her first.
"After that, I'll speak with the press."
"Hopefully, the fact that there's going to be"
A press conference will be enough
To keep mr.
Gerwin at bay for a day.
I'm gonna miss this place.
Regal man:
Excuse me.
This is for you.
Wow.
"You already have my, uh, $92.18?"
"No, it's just what you gave me yesterday."
I can't keep it.
I don't care what you say.
"You know, uh,"
I've only been doing this for a couple of weeks.
I'm not proud of it.
"It's just, uh, I haven't worked in a while,"
And I was hoping to get a little bit of money coming in.
"But the truth is, your $38 was all I got,"
"And, uh, I didn't set out to swindle little girls."
So you're not a prince?
why are you dressed like that?
Bridgette?
"When you're done with those, would you come help me"
"In the children's section, please?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Um, miss aiken,"
This is prince abantu.
"No cause for alarm, Robin."
"I feel fine, just fine."
"You see, Robin baby."
Now be a good little Boy Wonder and do just as I say.
"No, I will not submit to your treachery!"
"Trap Door, sweetie pie, you're needed."
"Wrap up Robin, my boys."
Ah!
"Very good, kiddies."
You're learning the business.
Ha-ha-ha.
"Now, is there anything I can do for you, Black Widow?"
"As a matter of fact, there is."
I have a perfectly devastating idea.
"Masked Muscles, you go back through the tunnel into my main web and have a little drink to the latest development."
"Ha, ha."
"- How does that grab you, doll?"
-Fine.
- Could we take Robin along too?
-But of course.
"No Robin, no Dynamic Duo."
- N'est-ce pas?
"- Ha, ha."
"Now, I imagine Robin is getting a bit heavy?"
"Boys, I'm sure the Bat-doll would like to get rid of him."
Better tie him up.
"Well, Bat-doll, perhaps you would like some champagne?"
I never touch spirits.
Have you some milk?
Milk?
"Oh, yes, yes."
"Oh, maybe Trap Door has some."
That's when they get into trouble.
H i.
M ind if I?
You might as well turn it off.
No. I like it.
This is hard.
We need to talk.
"When I was twelve, my mother gave me my sex talk, I'm not sure either of us has fully recovered,"
- Now that you and Jordan are--
- Oh my God.
"Mom, please."
Angela. I can accept that you have a boyfriend.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Fine.
A pal.
A male pal.
Whatever word you want to choose.
The point is...
"I'm your mother, and I don't think you're ready."
"- Mom, please."
- l don't think you're ready.
But...
I have to know if this is what's happening...
because I don't think that I keep you from--
"- Mom, I beg you to stop."
"- l need to know that you are using-- l mean, I remember how this feels, I do..."
but it's the times that we live in...
"- Mom, please."
- Honey...
"I know you do not want to think about these things, I know..."
- you think you are invulnerable...
- l don't think that--
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.
[alarm ringing]
It's a red light on the cooling system.
It must be a circuit breaker.
Restart the system.
I can't get a restart.
Hit the backup system.
It's no-go on backup.
Temperature increasing in the furnace.
- Get that coolant flowing.
- [phone buzzes]
- Furnace control.
- Control?
"You don't really think you're controlling anything, do you?"
- [alarm continues buzzing] - who is this?
"[victor] this is Dr.VictorGannon,"
It's the finest picture I've ever seen.
"They've gone, every single one."
Who have?
- Percy's pack of suitors.
So will he be OK?
- Yes.
The whole thing has disappeared.
Roly's in seventh heaven.
"Morning, Helen."
"Morning, James."
"- (Helen) Morning, Siegfried."
A quiet night?
"Yes, only one call and that was delightful."
I delivered six bouncing Labrador puppies.
"That's right, my boy."

Open 20.
"Mr. Stinkmeaner, do you understand what I've just told you?"
I'm a clone!
"Yes, created at this secret and highly illegal underground human cloning facility."
Why am I so old?
!
"Eh, what?"
"If you cloned me when you say you did, shouldn't I still be a little kid?"
!
The man who you are a clone of is Colonel H. Stinkmeaner.
He answered our volunteer recruitment ad on Blackpeoplemeet.
"A few days later, he died in a street fight."
Fuck him!
He dead!
I'm alive!
Motherfucker!
"He left you those clothes, that cane, and the glasses."
"He asked that if the cloning was successful, we relay this message."
"""Dear me, please go fuck with Robert J. Freeman."
I'm not going anywhere.
You're too important ?
It's not negotiable.
Get him an escort.
And start getting everyone into position.
Who knows when they're gonna come back again?
Jake?
Go ahead.
So they got their reinforcements.
It's a couple hundred men.
And another six of those deuce and a halfs.
"They're mobilizing now, so I say you got about 15, maybe 20 minutes before they're on you."
"All right, you get back here as soon as you can."
All right?
"Say, what do you know about a set of train tracks running alongside the river?"
Why?
What do you see?
"Hawkins, what's on the tracks?"
I don't know.
I can't see.
Hawkins...
Robert...
"Robert, disconnect it."
Hang on.
"Jake, you got a very large train coming from New Bern and they've got three cargo cars."
What's in them?
"I think it's men, and there's hundreds of them."
It's a whole set of reinforcement...
"Hawkins, what's going on?"
Talk to me.
"Jake, I'm on my way."
I've got to go.
I was once.
"But now, I am just a soldier and your loyal servant."
"Well, perhaps it is time we reacquainted you with your God."
ARAMIS:
"Yes, Your Majesty."
LOUIS:
We leave within the hour.
Why would the General's aide choose to meet somewhere like this?
That's a good question.
- Let's go see what's inside.
- D'ARTAGNAN:
I'll wait here.
(GRUNTING)
GRIMAUD:
Aramis is back in Paris.
What's going on?
He has been summoned back by the King.
"They are going on a pilgrimage, (CHUCKLES) to the Royal Mausoleum."
What about Porthos and d'Artagnan?
Marcheaux assures me they continued with their journey.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Perhaps it would be better to reconsider our plans.
No!
It's too late for that!
How many guards are with the King?
"Oh, Aramis, alone."
Then wait for them outside the Mausoleum and kill them both there.
(SCOFFING)
You...
You mean the King as well?
(CHUCKLING) We cannot kill the King.
We have to.
"You know, we just looked and we - Let me see."
I'm gonna ask.
- Where is the person -
"- Well, there's -"
- We've looked at
-We've looked at -
- This is Khedive Avenue.
That isn't it.
"Yeah, no."
"And we looked at the Bathurst, and that wasn't it either."
"- Well, it has to be somewhere."
- Let me see if there is a way of finding out.
- [Phone Ringing]
- It could be right down here.
- [Woman] Hello?
"- Um, one of the..."
One of the residents on our floor- her name is Ida Orliffe -
"She, uh"
- She -
Her husband's photograph apparently is hanging somewhere in Baycrest.
And his name is Herb Orliffe.
"Now, would you have any idea..."
We...
We've been down here looking for it... 'cause she thought it used to be hanging in the front entrance.
[Ida] I don't understand this.
[Indistinct]
Is there any way of you finding out where -
It's near the entrance as you come in.
It's hanging from the ceiling.
[Chattering]
- Might as well go and show her where she is.
- Yeah.
"I'll do the dishes, honey."
You run down to the drugstore and get me tonight's papers.
I wanna see what they say about me.
"Okay, I'll be right back."
All right.
Get all the papers.
[door closes]
[sighs]
98 pounds.
[bell buzzing]
For goodness' sake.
A person has no privacy around here.
Mr. de Mario.
Mind if I come in?
"No, of course not."
My daughter--
"I just saw her going down the street, so I know you're alone."
Yes.
"As a matter of fact, I am."
"To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit, Mr. de Mario?"
Pleasure?
I just dropped in to give you a little piece of advice.
What about?
About the murder of Clara Nash.
I don't know anything about that.
"Yeah, I know."
But you've got an overworked imagination.
Clara used to tell me how you liked to dream things up.
She thought it was very funny.
Only it might not be so funny now.
I've already told them everything I know... and I didn't tell them anything but the truth.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'm sorry.
There was nothing to be done.
She has moments only.
"We saved the world, Clara, you and me."
"We really, really did."
Will you go back... to your cloud?
No more cloud.
Not now.
Why not?
It rained.
Run.
"Run, you clever boy."
And remember.
It's Christmas.
Christmas Day.
And what about the Intelligence?
Melted with the snow?
"No, I shouldn't think so."
It learned to survive beyond physical form.
"Well, we can't be in much danger from a disembodied Intelligence that thinks it can invade the world with snowmen."
Or that the London Underground is a key strategic weakness.
The Great Intelligence... rings a bell... the Great Intelligence?
Doctor?
"I never knew her name, her full name."
"Oswin Oswald, junior entertainment manager, Starship Alaska."
Souffle girl...
Oswin - it was her.
"Run, you clever boy."
And remember.
It was souffle girl again.
"I never saw her face the first time with the Daleks, but her voice, it was the same voice."
Doctor?
"Aw, good-bye, precious."
"If it wasn't for my Ed's darned old allergy,"
I'd get one just like you.
(chuckles)
"- I'll see you later, Alice."
"-Okay, Trix."
"Now, listen here, I want to tell you something."
"I have got work to do, and I have to do it right now."
I don't want you getting it into your head that all I have to do all day long is just play with you.
So it's back in the box.
Okay?
There.
Oh...
Don't look so sad about it.
"Come on, we'll go in the bedroom."
(door opens)
"- Hey there, Alice."
"-Oh, hi, Ed."
Aren't you coming home a little early today from work?
"Oh, no, I been, uh, showing up to work an hour early."
- We're breaking in a new man there.
-Oh?
Been with us a week-- he's still wet behind the ears.
(groans)
"Say, tell me, Alice, has Ralph, uh, tried to get in touch... (sharp exhale)"
Excuse me.
Has Ralph tried to get in touch with y... (sneezes)
- No.
Bless you.
-Excuse me.
Has he tried to get in touch with you about anything today?
No.
"No, I'm not going to force my opinion on you."
Because no one has the right to control another person.
"Hey, medicine seller."
How did today's wedding go?
"Come here, come here."
"Cat, cat."
Come this way.
"Come here, come here."
No one else has come out since you went in.
Hmm no.
(female announcer) Previously on Angela's Eyes...
Where's the box?
What box?
(Angela) The Anderson family time capsule.
"Oh, you mean that thing that we buried with Mom and Dad when we were kids?"
"I came here to, uh, to wish you a happy birthday."
"Great, you act like this is a birthday present."
This is our family time capsule.
"This is a clue, Ang."
"You know, I could never keep track of how many shirts were at the cleaner's."
Maybe you should check.
See if I left any there.
Oh.
"[laughing] Oh, my gosh."
Are you kidding me?
Angela got some papers from an old Korean cleaner.
They're in a bright red folder.
And I want them.
"What the hell are you doing, Dylan?"
Nothing.
"Cut the crap, dog."
Anselmo called me.
"I knew the Mafioso had called him, but in this business, you don't trade names."
And I called Walter.
That's all there was to it.
I was doing Anselmo a favor.
Run caution lights all my life.
"This time you ran a red, and someone cut across the intersection."
A cop and a 6-year-old child.
That's with me forever.
That's not good enough.
Not good enough?
You think I don't know that?
"I hope so, John."
Scares me when you call me John.
Why's that?
Because I...
... Ithoughtaminuteago we were off to the White House.
I thought I could feel you come aboard.
The old menschkeit.
Horseshit.
Menschkeit is horseshit.
It's 1 20 years of graft and sweetheart contracts...
... featherbedsand inside information...
... andeverywherepeopleinpower gather to carve up the turf.
That's your menschkeit.
It's horseshit.
You know where you can put it.
Maybe spread it over the fields.
"If we cross our fingers, maybe a flower will grow."
It has.
Out of all this crap...
... youemerged.
I thought you forgot about us.
I haven't seen you here in a long time.
I'm not who you think I am.
"Well, when his family disappeared... there was a lot of rumors."
Some said they had gone back to Russia.
Others said there was trouble with their grocery in Little Odessa.
Russian mob controls everything in Little Odessa.
Maybe that's why he joined them.
- How old was he?
- Sixteen.
Forced to live on the street.
You gotta be strong to be a white boy growing up in this neighborhood.
Did he ever mention me?
Your brother's.
He kept it here all these years.
- Was he happy?
- Yeah.
"The last I saw him, he had matured."
Got real serious.
- But he had choices.
- What choices?
- He was alone.
- I'd have taken him in.
He was a strange boy.
You should go back to France.
What you find here could be ugly.
Did he ever mention someone named Alex Bohemia?
But there's a nightclub in Little Odessa called the Bohemia.
"Your vodka, Mr. Suverov."
"Excuse me, I'm looking-"
"Mr. Suverov, you have a phone call."
Follow me.
And they put me out in the streets.
"Well, child, that ain't nothing to cry about."
Look here.
"Here you got an apartment, right smack on the corner with the highest ceiling in Harlem."
'Look at that electric light.'
"'Why, you even got running water.'"
"Ah-h, child, with that smile you got everything."
"'Why, you're the richest gal in Harlem.'"
What do you care about being outdoor?
What will I do when it rains?
"If you insist on being inside, go in and tell that landlord.."
"[""I'm Livin' ina Great Big Way""]"
* You got a snap in your fingers *
Got that.
* And a rhythm in your walk.
Got that too.
* As the elephant say I'm livin' in a great big way *
"It's all the way you look at it, you know."
* Got a handful of nothin'
"Why, you're a rich millionaire."
* But I watch it like a hawk.
True mama.
"*Well, I'm doin' okay *"
*I'm livin' in a great big way *
Tell that to the landlord.
* I'm the salt in the ocean
* I'm the sun way up in the sky *
"Oh, no."
*I'm a Franklin D. Roosevelt *
*I'm a million dollars *
* Long as I got a snap in my fingers *
* Rhythm in my walk.
"This gun, found it from him."
"I think it's English, Chinese, Sir!"
But it looks like English.
Papa!
"Don't talk to him, he asked much questions,"
Sit!
Where do I sit?
On sofa or chair?
"On chair, There are lot of chairs,"
"Which chair, left or right?"
Lefts one.
Sir your left or mine?
"My metric's question paper, here."
"Here, on this chair."
"Really, you're such a daring man,"
"Thank you Sir, You come straight here."
"If I called you then you won't come, You were busy that's why I came her,"
"Anyway Sir, Shall we finish the work,"
Sorry Sir!
"Don't get me wrong, I am in hurry."
"I have to finish one more job,"
Mean?
"After finish my job, you'll go to finish for another job."
"Sometimes, I have to finish 5-6 jobs, I am kind of busy for 24 hours."
Marveles!
"Learn some, learn some, learn some thing from him."

"Are you all right, Esther-san?"

"Don't worry, the count is all right!"
"There was another girl here, named Seth!"
W-what is this?
This light is a mausoleuma grave- for all Methuselah's.
This island is a place for remembering the deceased.
Friends and family of the departed gather and reminisce for a night.
That is how funerals are in the Empire.
It must be difficult for him...
Being unable to attend his grandmother's funeral...
Your Lordship...
"Whew, security sure has gotten tight!"
What a pain!

Do you know where Radu is?

No idea.
"But if he's going to target Her Majesty, it would most likely be during tonight's funeral..."
He will come!
There's no question about it!
I'll go do my rounds again.
Don't worry!
I won't let him assassinate anyone!

I'm coming with you!
No!
-What shit are you talking about?
-Just stay away from the garbage.
"I'm not talking about what you did inside, you did what you had to do."
I'm talking about now.
From here and now.
-Why would I get into that?
-Don't make a jerk out of me.
Just don't do it.
Don't do it.
I want to talk about Jimmy.
Watch out for him.
"He's a good earner, but he takes too many chances."
I wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.
"Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy."
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.
-You got to watch out for them.
-l only use them for certain things.
I ain't going to get fucked like Gribbs.
Gribbs is 70 years old and he'll die in prison. I don't need that.
So I'm warning everybody.
"Could be my son, could be anybody."
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello to some fuck who was selling junk.
"That won't happen to me, understand?"
You're out early because I got you a job.
I don't need this heat.
"You see anybody fuckin' around with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?"
.
That means anybody.
-All right.
-Yeah?
Yeah.
Sheriff knows who did it.
I saw him going down to Peterson's a little while ago with some evidence some kid gave him.
He found it in an RV or something down there.
Those Peterson's will probably get that kid.
What kid?
"Some damn tourist kid, I don't know."
[Man on the phone] Yeah.
Yeah.
"You know, a sky pilot once said that angels carried messages up to heaven, Buddy."
He might tell him.
"Come on, don't cry anymore."
"[Buddy] All right, I won't cry no more."
"[Jim] Buddy, look here, you got to buck up and be a little man now."
"If Tater knows you was crying about him that way, he'd feel awful bad."
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, Miss Molly."
[Molly] ...how many people we should notify?
[Jim] I guess me and Buddy...
"Hi, Billy."
Go away.
"What'd you do that for, Billy?"
Now you've got yourself stuck in there.
- Just be quiet and go away.
- [phone ringing] [continues ringing]
It's the telephone.
Billy?
It's for you.
"I don't care, answer it."
"I'll tell you somethin', Billy."

You got a hollow door here.
It's made in Japan.
Find Mrs. Cole!
I need to talk to Mrs. Cole.
Mrs. Cole!
Has anyone seen Mrs. Cole?

"Mr. Hilliard is talking about the integrity of the story, saying he will play the scene as you wrote it or not at all."

I'm coming.
No.
Let me deal with it.
"Once Hilliard gets his hands on you, he won't let you go for hours, and I was rather hoping to do that myself."
"Careful of big boy,"
- it's got a bit of a wobble on it.
Don't-
- Don't lean against it.
- Whoa!
Nobody move!
- Buckley!
"Nobody move, stay exactly where you are until we have some lights in here."
Stay where you are.
Back.
"Back, please."
Everybody get back.
Please take the girls away from the stage.
"Mr. Brown, please take them away."
Almost dawn.
I'd rather be stuffed in a coffin.
I don't mind the shooting. I wouldn't give much if you couldn't defend yourself but jumping bail is another thing.
It isn't square.
I want you to go into town and stand trial on your own feet.
Clear yourself or take the consequences.
"That's the only way to work it out, Brock."
"When you've got something more to say to me, I'll be around."
"That was nice, that was fine."
-Take it easy.
-You can hurt him more than anyone.
"-You know that, don't you;"
-Take it easy.
I thought you were leaving.
I gotta think.
How can a man think without a little music;
-Jim here;
-Around someplace.
"-Out back, I guess."
-Where's Brock;
"Hello, Mr. McCurtin."
"-You tell them about the shooting, Brock;"
"-Oh, hello, Mac."
"Sure, I told them."
What's the matter;
Horton died.
-l figured he was too mean to die.
"-l can get you off, once more, maybe."
You must've had good reason to shoot a man.
"You had one, didn't you;"
Good reason;
"-Why, sure, the best."
-Better come back in with me.
Mike and I know this country.
- You don't.
"- No matter what you think, there's a missing chimp out there."
We can help find her.
"Captain, I'm afraid they make sense."
Our first responsibility is to find Sally.
"Well, ok, we'll release them."
"You guys better remember-- anything happens to Sally, you're gonna be responsible, you get that?"
"Believe me, Captain, we're just as concerned"
- about that chimp as you are.
"- Yeah, well, we'll see."
"Hey, no guns."

"Go ahead, Dad."
"Paula, we found the space capsule and Sally's spacesuit"
- but no helmet.
"- Well, Dad, where's Sally?"
"-Look, they're red on the inside."

She could have just been saying that so he'd have to marry her.
Got a lot to lose.
Harvard Law School's coming up.

A kid and an unmarried mother... could ruin everything.
I was gonna marry her.
What?
We were gonna elope the night she died.
- I don't believe it.
- Neither do I.
- Hilla broke it off with you.
"- No, she didn't."
"On the Fourth ofJuly, she told you she loved someone else."
"You fought, and she ended it between you."

Hilla.
In her diary.
"No, that wasn't me."
Not that weekend.
I was at a tournament in Boston.
That's right.
The kid won.
Brought back a real big trophy.
"Whoever she broke it off with, it wasn't me."

How do you know?
I was there that morning.
What information on the judge?
"That you get with $1 0,000 and a plane ticket."
Come up with it by tomorrow.
This meeting is adjourned.
Let us bring you in.
We'll put you in the Witness Protection Program.
"No, thanks. I got my own Witness Protection Program."
Morning.
The sharks are already circling.
Another Zapatti washed up.
They fished him out of the 79th Street Basin.
"Victim's hands were bound in a 3-inch chain, ship's chandlery type."
Forensics reveal blows...
... froma bluntinstrument.
Where have you been?
-Had a busy night.
-l'm sure you did.
He handicapped or something?
We believe he's of Korean descent.
My God.
North Korea and al-Qaeda workin' together.
This is bigger than I thought.
You couldn't wait?
You couldn't fucking wait?
We were about to have all the legal weed we wanted.
"You know, in Amsterdam, where we were going!"
"Thought you could get away with this, huh?"
"You thought that after 9/11 our national security was a joke, huh?"
Well... guess what?
What?
We knew you fuckers would be back.
- Holy shit!
"- But we're Americans, man."
- We love America.
We love America!
- Very much.
That's a convenient thing to say... after you try and blow up a plane filled with Americans!
- No.
"- No, we didn't do--"
"No, you see, you have the wrong idea."
My idiot friend here brought marijuana...
- on the plane.
"- Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey."
"Zip it, Hello Kitty."
OK?
I know your operation's funded through drugs.
No.
"This is typical government bullshit, sir. l--"
"- Hey, hey, hey."
"By the way Miss, did you know that Kayama-san is driving a bus in Ito in Izu?"
Kayama-sensei's doing that?
"Kayama-san was your teacher, right?"
He went from a famous dancer to a bus driver pretty quickly!
We're eating.
Would you mind waiting downstairs?
Sorry.
I'll talk to you later.
Do you think what he said about Kayama-sensei is true?
"Considering the source, I don't know how much stock you should put in the story."
Takao.
What is it?
I haven't seen you in quite a while.
May I?
There's a seat over there.
That's
- I see.
Your mother is on the second floor.
Did you know that?
Wouldn't it be better to stay away from people like Numata?
He's someone whom I've known since I was a student.
"He's helped me out, you know."
Mother!
Don't hang around with Numata.
He's so irritating!
He's trying to stir things up in the family.
That's not something you should say out loud.
He has the hots for you.
Takao!
Father is coming home tomorrow.
He sent me a letter.
Takao.
"Is this May, 2016?"
Yeah.
You're exactly where you said you'd be.
Do not get on that ship.
"If you do, you're all dead."
Says who?
"Says you, Mr. Rory."
You sent me.
I'm sorry.
Who exactly are you?
My name is Rex Tyler.
I'm a member of the Justice Society of America.
You were huckin' the ball around with your pals the other day...
"Say, uh..."
"What's the deal with your sweetie there, Squirrely Dan?"
"Well, I took her out last night."
- Where to?
- Outs to the chip truck.
- Fries and gravy?
- I had mine with gravy.
She had hers with salts and malts vinegar.
Do you know that salt and malt vinegar's a non-traditional way to dress your French fries in the United States?
What the fuck is wrong with them?
Like malt vinegar is not a staple condiment on tabletops in restaurants in the United States.
"Fuck, figure it out."
That's what I say.
"I say, figure it out."
"Got no vinegars on the tables, no Krafts peanut butters."
- WAYNE:
Figure it out.
- DARYL:
"I wanted a Searider, but my uncle wouldn't pop for it."
Your uncle like boats?
Who?
Paulie?
Paulie wouldn't know a cleaver from a fucking cleat.
"It was my dream, you know."
Free of the goombahs.
Run a charter in the islands.
Eddie was going to help me.
You and Eddie?
That's a strange marriage.
He was only going to find clients.
I'll tell you something.
"If I'd met him earlier, I'd never be in this mess."
If only Tino hadn't whacked Eddie.
Know why he was there that morning?
Santos wasn't there to take Tino down.
He was there to get information on the judge.
How do you know?
I was there that morning.
What information on the judge?
"That you get with $ 10,000 and a plane ticket."
Come up with it by tomorrow.
This meeting is adjourned.
Let us bring you in.
We'll put you in the Witness Protection Program.
"No, thanks."
I got my own Witness Protection Program.
Morning.
The sharks are already circling.
Another Zapatti washed up.
They fished him out of the 79th Street Basin.
How you doin'?
"Okay, why don't you just... put down the gun and tell me what's going on here."
Yeah.
He's come around three nights in a row.
This son of a bitch is stalking us.
- I'm John Klein.
My car broke down...
"- Let's let Gordon finish, Mr. Klein."
Two nights ago... at 2:30 in the a.m.
there's a bang on the door.
"I open it up, and here's this guy."
He says he wants to use the phone.
But there's something creepy about him... so I tell him to get lost.
"Last night at 2:30 on the dot, guess who's back."
You're sure it was Mr. Klein here?
I am absolutely positive.
it's Mr. Klein.
- Crazy.
This is...
- I am not crazy.
- I didn't say that you...
- So then what happened?
I warned him off my property.
"I used the word ""trespass"", and he still came back."
"You're lucky I'm a Christian, because I had the right to shoot you on my porch."
"He'd have to been inside the house, Gordon."
What?
Fine.
"So tonight I figured the dumb %$# might come back, and sure enough, there he is."
It´s Imposible.
It wasn't me.
I don't know what's happening here.
"That's why I don't get no mail at my house,"
- I ain't got money in no bank.
- He's got over 40 grand hidden.
"- Maggie, what the fuck?"
!
- Why don't you give Carlos money?
- ¿Tú estás loca?
- As a loan to get back the bodega.
- Maggie!
- This could be a way out of here.
"You heard what he said, he needs that money."
You were gonna give me that money to open my own space.
"Shut the fuck up, you're family."
Carlos isn't family?
He'll pay you back.
"It's my business, I can take care of it, okay?"
People buggin' out around me today.
"Later, bro'."
"You got a big fucking mouth, and I ain't got no money."
Where did you put them?
Where'd you put them?
"I'm tired of your fucking bullshit game, viejo."
Where are my fucking drawings?
Carlos...
I should be the one that would be making the questions here.
How many gallons of milk did you deliver today?
How many cases of aguacate?
Yuca?
- Plátanos?
Café?
- I don't fucking know.
That's what you should be worrying about.
Let's slaughter a cow!
"Baso, grab it!"
Grab its legs!
Come on!
I've cut off the head of the Japanese Governor-general
Wow!
What a party!
Sir Yoshimura
Whose wedding day is it?
It's Watan and Lubi's
Come!
"Have a drink with us, sir"
No
- No
"- Come on, have a drink"
No way
I don't drink the wine with your nasty saliva in it
"- Come on, have a drink"
- I told you that I don't want to
Your hand is all dirty with blood
- I invited you with good will
- You son-of-a-bitch!
You've soiled me with blood!
I offered you a drink and you hit me?
I'll beat you into senses!
- Stop!
- I don't need to reason with a savage
What is it?
Let's go look!
Hurry up!
I know what you said just now with a boar's head in your hand
Out of my way!
"You know, I didn't mean to bail on you fellas, but I've been waiting over six months to get into Canyon Valley."
"And let me tell ya, it was worth it."
I already lost 10 pounds!
In -- in one day?
"No offense, Sheriff -- 'cause you look great -- um, but aren't you the least bit curious as to how you dropped 10 in a day?"
"Well, to tell you the truth, Agent,"
I don't really give a flyin' fudge. [ Chuckles ]
"My husband, Doug, left me last year 'cause he said I loved cookie-dough milkshakes more than him."
Sorry to hear that.
Dean:
"Yeah, Doug's a dick."
You deserve better.
Thanks.
But he was right.
That was a dark time for me.
Whoever said you eat your pain?
Not me.
I guzzled it.
[ Laughs ]
Anyhoo...
I guess I just wanted to feel pretty again.
And Canyon Valley did that.
Only question is...
What are you doing here?
"[ Clears throat ] We're, uh, uh..."
We're undercover.
Yeah.
Sort of got that.
We think that there's a connection between Canyon Valley and the murders in town.
What kind of connection?
Suction marks.
[ Chuckles ]
"-You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?"
"-Yes, I am."
-Pretty close?
-Pretty close.
Did he talk to you about my party?
He sure did.
About my daughter?
"No, I didn't know you had one."
-He didn't mention her?
-No.
Oh.
Didn't tell you what she did?
He didn't mention her.
"Priests are pretty tight-mouthed, then, huh?"
That depends.
-On what?
-The priest.
Sure.
"I mean, what if a person, uh, came to you you know, that was a murderer or criminal of some kind and they wanted some kind of help?"
"I mean, would you have to turn him in?"
"Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, I'd say no."
-You wouldn't?
"-No, I wouldn't."
But I would try to convince him to turn himself in.
Mm-hm.
"And, uh, how do you go about getting an exorcism?"
I beg your pardon?
"If, um-"
"- If a person's, you know, possessed by a demon, or something how do they get an exorcism?"
I'd have to get them into a time machine and get them back to the 16th century.
I didn't get you.
"It just doesn't happen anymore, Mrs. MacNeil."
-l hate that it had to turn out this way.
-(siren wailing)
"Me taking care of the girl, me taking care of the police."
"What you need, what we're willing to offer, is a change of pace."
We have a station for you to look after.
Blackleg Miner.
One of the smaller terminals.
-England?
-Yeah.
"Far the fuck out, middle of nowhere."
Old American Army base.
Officially it doesn't exist.
"Unofficially, it's used to broadcast numbers to our European field agents."
-How long?
-Until your head is right.
You'll be babysitting a broadcaster.
"Civilian, right?"
"Yeah, cryptology specialist."
And one of the very few people who can process code at this level.
"You and another team, alternating shifts."
Three days each.
"You keep the station safe, you keep the code safe."
Whatever it takes.
Okay.
"Do the job, Emerson."
I don't wanna look like an ass for sticking my neck out on this one.
"'Cause I've got nothing left, nothing to keep you from the wolves."
0-7-3.
4-5-5.

katherine:
That's enough!
You've already said that over 30 times today.
Dinner is served!
What family education!
Grabbing the bigger piece.
How were you taught?
Always to take the smaller piece!
You got what your mother told you to get!
Couldn't find the Formula.
But I found this.
"On April 14, 7:00 p.m., the Emperor's godson, Hiroshima Tora,"
The Emperor's godson!
Will pick up the 'Beast' posing as Special Envoy from Chungking.
You want to know what he looks like?
Looks just like you!
What a coincidence!
You know what to do then?
You want me to pose as him?
Right!
What if the real thing turns up?
- He wouldn't.
- How come?
"Tomorrow, we'll get on the train 1 station ahead... ls it the right person?"
Why don't you ask himself?
Are you Hiroshima Tora?
People with hearing aids are usually deaf.
"From my past experience, he doesn't look the part."
Let's go to the other cabin.
It's him!
"Kidoo, get a bigger hammer!"
We haven't worked so well together for ages.
Who's he?
Aneesa.
Repeat after me:
Now tell us what you know.
"When my family moved to Washington,"
Fatimah was very envious.
She told me she hated Al Khair.
She wanted to run away.
That's why she sold the villa.
And what else did she tell you?
She wanted to come to America.
She said she was going to find an American and marry him.
Go on.
"And when she didn't need him anymore, she could stay in America."
She would be free.
It sounds like a washing machine.
The world's most beautiful washing machine.
"Oh, my back is killing me, Bud."
"Oh, I told you to stop lifting little baby A.J."
"Oh, yeah."
You stay at home with a 2-year-old and don't lift him.
Sorry for the delay.
It's been a madhouse here this morning.
How are you feeling?
"My gut's the size of a roast pig, and my ankles look like bolognas and my back feels like a Cuisinart."
She's been a little hungry.
"Oh, that's not hunger."
"Lieutenant Sims, you're in labour."
Now?
"No, I have four weeks."
"Well, I guess no one told the baby."
It is true.
I did say those things.
Get down now!
- Get on the floor now!
- Get in there!
Get him down!
I need an ambulance in here!
Get me an ambulance!
"- Come on, Todd, come on!"
- What happened?
"I don't know, one minute he was fine, then he started convulsing and he fell over."
"Come on, kid."
Come on!
He's dead.
"Don, he's dead."
CSI:
NY Season05 Episode13 Rush to Judgment
I was questioning him.
"He was getting agitated, then he started talking azy."
Then he started shaking.
Foam was coming out of his mouth and he hit the ground.
Don't worry.
Sid will get to the bottom of it.
Detective Flack.
- You mind answering a few questions?
- No problem.
"Don, don't you want to wait for a union rep?"
"No, no, no, no."
I'd rather take care of this now.
"Okay, you can start by filling out this incident report."
When did you first encounter Mr. Fleming?
Earlier today.
He was at wrestling practice over at Hillridge High School.
Detective Angell and I went by and asked him to come downtown with us.
Everything's the same as when Golly was here.
It looks the same... it smells the same... but there's this tiny hole inside me that wasn't there before.
It's like... like a splinter in your finger... only this one's right above my stomach.
"Harriet, are you okay?"
Uh-huh.
Something's... different.
No cats?
How can Harrison Withers not have a billion cats around?
They finally nailed him.
I will always remember that face.
That's the face you make when you really lose something.
"Uh-oh, Frankie took the truck."
Speak English!
"Oh, okay, you want us to speak English, huh?"
!
"Well, you are a jerk, huh?"
"I tell you, ""Don't take the truck."
"You smash the truck."""
"Well, you tell me now,"
"Mr. Wise Guy, was one date worth it?"
...we have people here shopping!
Yeah.
"Hey, all right, Grandpa."
"It's cool, right?"
"It wasn't a big deal, huh?"
"I knew you'd understand, right?"
Sometimes I think families everywhere are exactly the same.
Everybody get back to work.
"Mom, Dad, please?"
Grandpa!
Just calm down.
Too exciting.
Yes.
Don't you think you should be at home?
With your husband?
"Darling, I wanna go home with you."
But I can't until I know the results of those tests.
"Alexis, I don't understand it."
"I mean, what are you doing?"
"Are you still choosing between me and Galen, with me in second position?"
"No, Dex."
I love you.
"Oh, God, we went through hell to rescue Galen."
Can't you understand?
Can't you try and support me like a husband should?
I find it hard supporting my wife's apparent love for another man.
Wrong tense.
I loved him once.
But I'm frightened for him now.
"Mrs. Dexter, King Galen is asking for you."
Thank you.
"And I'm frightened for us, Alexis."
I'll see you later.
"Hello, Galen."
- Alexis.
- Mm.
I was so afraid.
But not for my life.
I thought I might not ever see you again.
No.
"Here I am, larger than life."
And you're safe now.
"Your life is safe here, Galen."
"This cursed revolution, if it hadn't happened, I would never have let you leave Moldavia."
"Thank you for coming, everybody."
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm sorry.
It's not every day my boss is chosen to be in a magazine.
Is he a good kisser?
"- Oh, my God."
Where's my dad?
"- Oh, he's running a little late."
"Would it be horrible if you just went and, uh, hung out in the kitchen for a little while?"
Then I can distract my dad somehow and...
"Alex, I got to tell you-- hiding's really not my thing."
"Could it be your thing for, like, five minutes?"
"All right, but I'm making a sandwich, I'm not cleaning up."
"Oh, excuse me, everyone, everyone."
"Um, my dad doesn't know about me and Scott, so let's not tell him, okay?"
Not that there's anything to hide.
"It was, like, one motorcycle ride."
It's always the motorcycle guys.
"Hey, honey."
"Oh, the traffic."
"Yeah, what are you gonna do?"
Hummus?
I wanted to see the look on your face.
Stephen... did you get it on tape?
"Dad, Dad-- you don't need to see the tape."
Here's how it went.
Surprise!
"Oh, my God."
This is so sweet.
"Ooh, hummus."
Was that cute or what?
Let's take a look at the tape.
"-You know, I should probably go."
"-Oh, come on, Golan."
How often do you get a night and a morning off?
-I'd stay for another.
-Okay.
--and the emotional response to love  is usually the result of a show of affection or favour.
"-Tom, can I use your phone?"
"-Yeah, it's right over there."
-I think we'd do really well together.
-Absolutely.
For a while.
"God, will you get past the cynicism?"
"I just broke up with somebody, baby."
I thought you forgot all about him.
Hello?
Al?
-Who are you with?
-Just some of the residents.
"I'd like to leave, but Sara's driving, and I don't want to be rude."
You want to come down?
No.
I'll see you when you get home.
All right.
You're ageist.
-That's what it is.
"-Oh, please."
Then what are you afraid of?
Breaking your heart.
"Running your ass into the ground, buddy."
Bollocks.
Why do you want to ruin this with domesticity?
"Because I've never met a braver woman and I'm deeply, deeply attached to you."
"California, here we come!"
"Dinoco, here we come!"
"Oh... oh... uh, I needed this."
Hello?
"Is this Lightning McQueen, the world's fastest racing machine?"
"Is this Harv, the world's greatest agent?"
And it is such an honor to be your agent that it almost hurts me to take ten percent of your winnings.
Merchandising.
And ancillary rights in perpetuity.
"Anyway, what a race, champ!"
"I didn't see it, but I heard you were great."
"Thanks, Harv."
"Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets for the tiebreaker thing in Cali."
I'll pass 'em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.
"- You let Harv rock it for you, baby."
- Right.
Friends.
"Yes, there's..."
"OK, I get it, Mr. Popular."
So many you can't even narrow it down.
"Hey, when you get to town, you better make time for your best friend!"
Break bread with your mishpocheh here!
That'd be great!
We should totally...
"OK, I gotta jump, kid."
Let me know how it goes.
I'm out.
What?
A minivan?
"Come on, you're in the slow lane."
This is Lightning McQueen you're hauling here.
- You worry too much.
"All our patients get VIP treatment, Bick."
God is blessed.
"- Hello, Arthur."
- Ah.
Owen.
I heard you were here getting your second cycle of temozolomide.
Yes.
"Yes, I finished my last fraction of radiation one month ago."
And look at you.
You look terrific.
"Well, uh..."
The therapy is working beautifully.
Uh... the last brain scan showed...
no tumor enhancement.
"- That's wonderful, news."
- Mm-hmm.
"- Now, is there any dizziness, fatigue,"
- No.
Weakness... seizure activity?
No to all three.
I feel like a new man.
"And if I, uh, may ask, h-how's the, uh, reconciliation going?"
"My son, Peter, he's forgiven me."
I plan to use every day I've got left to make up for the ones I wasn't here.
"Okay, now, as a fellow doctor, you'll be interested in this."
We have a new medication that we can add to your treatment regimen.
What is it?
It's experimental.
Valganciclovir.
The antiviral?
Mm-hmm.
"Relax, kid."
Nobody knows.
"Relax, kid."
Nobody knows.
They're going to find me.
They're going to find me.
I said relax!
I said relax!
"Here, buy yourself a lolly."
"Here, buy yourself a lolly."

The narcotic agent on my payroll's been tailing him.
The narcotic agent on my payroll's been tailing him.
It took me a year and a half.
It wasn't until he tried to hit my baby Stevie that I left.
A year and a half?
You leave your brains in a box somewhere?
He loved me.
Oh.
He told me so.
He just hit me 'cause I'm ugly.
You're not ugly.
You got a place to stay?
Yeah.
I found a cheap motel across from the airport.
"Cheapest place I could get, but... two or three nights working here, I think I can get a good place, move out of there."
And what if that bruiser comes looking for you?
He won't.
I talked to God at Kennedy Airport in New York before I left.
He told me that I have to live for my baby.
So I told him that I would kill anybody who tried to hurt me like that.
I don't think God is going to let Danny come near me again.
Dorothy?
Yeah?
I don't think it's gonna work out for you here.
I'm gonna have to let you go.
What?
I'm sorry.
It's just the way things worked out.
Help me.
What are you worried about?
I've known Frank Doss and Mr. Cannata for years.
"I'll speak to them, I'll explain things...."
It's gonna be all right.
Thank you.
"-Oh, BIanche."
"-Yes, it is, it is."
Or I wouldn't say it.
You just have to watch around the hips a little.
"I want you to look at my figure, you know?"
"I haven't put on one ounce in 1 0 years, stella."
I weigh now what I weighed the summer you left belle Reve.
The summer Dad died and you left us.
"It's just incredible, BIanche, how well you look."
Sure you wouldn't like another?
well....
"well, maybe I will just take one tiny nip more."
"Just to put the stopper on, so to speak."
"Now, don't get worried."
Your sister hasn't turned into a drunkard.
She's just all shaken up and hot and dirty and tired.

-You want it hot?
-ScaIding.

"-What is it, hon?"
There's only two rooms.
I don't see where you're gonna put me.
We'II put you right here.
What kind of a bed's this?
One of those collapsible beds?
-feel all right?
"-wonderful, honey."
I don't like a bed that gives much.
"stella, there's no door between the two rooms, and StanIey--"
-will it be decent?
"Let me talk to Pete, okay?"
"Oh, Pete got fired this morning."
That's so weird that you don't know that.
Jack Donaghy thinks he's gonna come into my house and mess with my show?
Hell no.
Jenna and I worked for years to get this show.
"You know, I moved from Chicago for this."
From Chicago?
I was in Scottie Pippen's wedding.
Now Donaghy is trying to steal it from us.
"He already fired Pete, who is a great producer."
He fired Pete?
He can't fire Pete.
"You know what, I quit."
He can suck it.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, suck it, Pete."
"No, you're not listening."
You're not a good listener.

But Liz said we were cutting the cat lady sketch.
She said it stinks.
Ouch.
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humour is universal.
I just don't think that I'm good in it.
Do you think I'm good in it?
I think this is your opportunity to go out there and prove everybody wrong.
What--what do you mean?
Who's everybody?
"The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said you had a weird eye--"
You mean this eye?
He was always joking
He'd imitate a horse when I needed cheering up
"An alcoholic, a hopeless drunk"
This is my husband.
Now he sells door to door
And this one
He's a millionaire with influence
Will he remember me?
What's wrong?

- What?
What did you dare say?
You heard me
You are completely crazy
I've heard that before
Don't touch me

It hurts
Let me go
Clementine?
"Well, you have your memories."
That's the best thing to keep.
Nobody can take that away.
Right?
"- Hi, Ida."
Is it okay if we come in?
- Yeah.
Vivienne is here to take you... to show you the photograph of you and your family.
Would you like to go see it?
- I'm going.
- Good.
Let's go.
Okay.
"So this is where you were thinking about the entrance, I think."
I'll show you this one.
- Okay?
- My husband's here somewhere.
"Yep, yep, yep."
"And, uh, then over here... this is Ben and Hilda Katz."
- Look over here.
- This is called the Ben and Hilda Katz Building... because they gave the $3 million to help start it.
- I knew that.
- So there they are.
And if the foundation... are going to have people here all the time who've done things for Baycrest.
So these were the first 64 people that were chosen.
And we just opened it the week before last.
- My husband's somewhere here too.
- Not on this one yet.
No.
We're going up in the auditorium to find him.
- And this is the Heritage Museum.
- Just a minute.
"we got ourselves an ""X-Men"" fan."
right?
and not like this.
people die.
And no self-promoting asshole in a fucking leotard can stop it.
- This is ice cream for bed-wetters.
- Logan...
Her nurse has been feeding her some grade-A bullshit.
I don't think Laura needs reminding of life's impermanence.
Didn't you say something about finding us a new ride?
Two more pills in one hour.
Give 'em to him.
Shane?
Joey.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Can't break the mold.
{\i1\cH80ffff}I tried it and it didn't work for me.
there's no living with a killing.
{\i1\cH80ffff}There's no going back from one.
it's a brand.
{\i1\cH80ffff}A brand sticks.
{\i1\cH80ffff}and tell her everything's all right.
{\i1\cH80ffff}And there aren't any more guns in the valley.
Who are you guys?
More cops?
'Cause I told the other guys everything that I... tracker.
You did your job.
Fellas.
Shit.
Knock yourselves out.
I'll tell you what.
Eight grand... new tires... and complete paperwork. if you can forget the paperwork.
they're bald.
Brother Ia...
"Vetoes to the excrement, you joke but there is something does not fit."
Clear that there is something does not fit.
"Lella is with you because your parents have money, have the bar."
"It is not truth, Lella is a good girl."
"In addition it does not matter, I want to me to Lella."
Heavy what with that Lella.
"In short, what you need she is a woman."
You love a woman for tonight?
"Yes, Yes."
We provided to him a woman for tonight?
"Yes, proporciónamela I want it, please."
How much money you have?
Money?
You have money?
Me no.
"Delay, hopes..."
I have a currency.
You do not worry.
"Sex is question of times and methods and if there are no them,"

-Young lady?
-20.000.
Put a hand on the heart.
"Ah, no."
"By less than 20,000 there is nothing no to do."
"Allow me, I am Dr. Cicchirini of the University Clinica..."
"Ah, yes?"
And what matters to me?
"One is a human case, a case that... only you can solve."
Créame.
It has come specifically to take the hair me?
I
- I have felt bad about this for ten years.
"In fact, the only reason I came to this thing tonight was that I hoped you'd be here so I could tell you that."
Well.
Thank you.
That actually means a lot.
Sorry.
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.
I'm free!
And-and things really are going well?
"Oh, yeah, they really are."
I married just the greatest guy.
And now you get to meet him.
Perry!
"Sweetie, over here."
I'm so sorry I'm late.
"Oh, my God, the traffic was vicious."
"Kyle, this is my husband, Perry Pearl."
Hi.
"Sweetie, this is Kyle Lendo."
Kyle and I dated in high school.
"- Well, uh..."
"- Ooh, my competition."
"Back off, mister!"
"Shh, here she comes."
Surprise!
"Considering that I don't know any of you, yes, it is."
"Okay, so today happens to be the 20th anniversary of the first day of third grade, which means it's also the 20th anniversary of the day we met."
"So to commemorate the most important day of my life,"
I got as many people from our class as I could.
I got the actual cook from the school cafeteria to make us fish sticks and Sloppy Joes.
"Yeah, well, I gotta be able to sleep at night."
Just came from the federal court house.
James McGovern is pleading out.
- How much time did he get?
- 18 months.
No one should have to choose between obeying the law and watching their child die.
At least the judge postponed his surrender date for six weeks.
Then he gets to bury Kyle before he goes to prison.
"No, John maybe not."
The NTCC moved Kyle up to the top of the list.
What about Amy?
She just went to the hospital.
Kid on a motorcye cracked up doing 140 on the B.Q.E.
Kidney's a match.
"Hello, John."
Where are you going?
Home.
Something happen to the kidney?
I don't want it.
- Why not?
- Kyle McGovern's gonna die.
We'd both have a kidney if it wasn't for me.
"If I turn it down, it goes to him."
You could die waiting for the next one.
I'll take my chances.
That's the wankiest idea I've heard.
You must be shell-shocked.
"Well, what are you-"
- Wankiest?
"Foolish, ridiculous, possibly even stupid."
I think that's the best idea I've ever had.

Addons Question 2:
Addons Which of other people's profiles often do you visit?
I do not know.
She didn't put poison in my cup.
"Well, Mrs Lightman didn't mention meeting you."
How come you've said nothing about it till now?
It's the truth.
"That woman poisoned you, so why on earth would you want to cover for her?"
She didn't do it.
Right.
Fair enough.
"I'm done here, George."
I'll stay here with Henry.
No!
Just leave me alone... all of you!
"Iris has motive, opportunity, previous, and what's more she's lied to us."
We've easily got enough.
"You've met her, Father."
Do you think she did it?
No.
But I don't know who did.
Why is Henry behaving so strangely towards me?
I don't know that either.
But let him rest.
Haven't you got an appointment this lunchtime?
"Mrs McCarthy, sorry I'm a bit late."
But I thought you were...
Inspector Mallory has arrested Iris Lightman.
And as Henry wants to be left alone...
The inspector's also arranged a car to drop us off in Cheltenham.
Oh!
"Oh, they're beautiful!"
That is very...
I'll just go and get myself ready.
There's no need.

What's wrong with him?
Has he had one too many beers?
I hear someone has failed.
The Dean has decided... to announce his name in public
"Hey,don't walk away from me."
All right.Stay here and talk to him.
- About what?
- About what happened.
- l don't know what happened.
"- You have,like,50 theories.Just pick one."

"""Emerson Hauser."" This was his case."
I think it's a quantum thing.
Imagine a water bug on the surface of a pond.
And he sees this twig sticking out of the water.
"When it rains,the water level rises."
"He thinks the twig is moving,when,in reality, the one dimension he's capable of perceiving is moving."
Not the twig.
"- You don't know what happened,do you?"
- No.
- Does anybody?
- Probably.
Okay.Pine street.

"$651,000.That's what, 55 years of back pay the government never gave you?"
They owe me.They stole my star.They took my pension.
Who are you?
"I wrote a book about Alcatraz,and pretty much everything in it is wrong."
You write about me?
- No.
- Why not?
I was there.I was important.The Warden said so himself.
"Gave me the royal treatment,him and his lady head-shrinker."
-I'm miserable.
I'm so hungry the only thing that got me through the last 20 miles.
Was thinking about shoveling in.
That big old bowl of mac and cheese and bacon.
She normally doesn't eat it.
You ate it all?
"Yes, but he dropped some on the floor and I threw it in the trash."
-But it's right on top so...
-Uh...
I ate that too.
This is the worst day ever.
I lost my Jesse and now I'm gonna be stuck.
At Malibu Community College without you.
And the only reason I'm going to get any mac and cheese and bacon.
Is if dad regurgitates it like a mama robin.
Hey darling don't worry.
I'm gonna fix this.
How about I make you a nice omelet?
What would you like in it?
My Jesse and an acceptance letter to Stanford.
And maybe some chives and salted mushrooms.
Coming right up.
-Miley?
-What?
Look you're not gonna go to Malibu Community College alone.
[Sobbing] You're right.
I'll be with Jackson!
"No, no."
You're not gonna be with Jackson.
You're gonna be with me.
What?
"Yeah, I mean, if you can't go to Stanford until next year."
"She did excellent in school, the Sisters said."
"Got good grades, was in every club."
"She was quitting drugs, you know."
She promised our priest.
What else you got there?
is that a diary?
Do either of you have children?
"Yeah, I got a boy."
"Are you close to him, detective?"
-Not at present.
-Something happens that's not right...
... youknow.
You know about your kids.
"-Yeah, I guess you do."
-l knew.
Even before I read this...
"... Iknewshewas involvedwith someone who hurt her, some married bastard."
"She tried 20 times to split up with him, but..."
... shewasweakbecauseofthedrugs.
"This time, she promised Father Kelleher."
"She was ready this time, and this bastard took her chance away."
Can we see this?
MCBRlDE:
"Here, read this."
It says it right here.
"""Mike says if I leave him, he'll kill me."
"He says if I'm going to call his wife again, he's going to kill me. """
She read to me from this.
She gave this to me.
"Look, listen."
"""l am definitely going to quit drugs."
"I am definitely going to change my life with Father Kelleher's help. """
"No, you haven't struck a nerve."
"Oh, for God's sakes, Adam, I knew the man briefly."
Is that it?
Or is it because it's me asking?
It's obvious Blake's told you he's disinherited me.
I assume he's also turned you against me.
"Adam, darling, it has nothing to do with you."
I did know Garrett Boydston a long time ago.
That part of my life is over.
That book is closed.
And I never re-read an old book.
Sorry.
Mary had a little lamb
"Little lamb, little lamb"
Mary had a little lamb...
Claudia.
What are you doing here?
"We're having fun, Mommy."
"- It's true, Sammy Jo."
I was just in the neighbourhood.
And I thought I'd stop by and see a little boy that I love very much.
"Oh, do you now?"
"Well, don't try and get too close to my son, you hear?"
"Danny, go see Marie and go play downstairs for a while."
But you'll come back again.
- Promise?
"- Oh, I promise."
"The fact is, Sammy Jo, that we're already close."
We got that way when I was married to Steven.
- While you were-
- I was what?
Too busy bumming around to take care of your own baby.
- You'll have to stall him.
- Me?
"I don't work here anymore, Andy, it has to be you."
You can do this.
All right.
"Uh, hey, Tom."
- What's up?
- Keith asked me to tell you to submit your debrief in writing this time.
He always debriefs me in person.
"Yeah, but he and Rebecca"
Are still going over case files.
"I guess it's taking them longer than they thought, huh?"
"Okay, thanks."
"Uh, tom."
"I texted you... about getting together to maybe, you know, clear the air."
There's no air that needs clearing.
We have nothing to talk about Andy.
"Agent Locke, uh, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Sorry, who are you again?"
Mariana.
Been here two weeks.
"Uh, look,"
I don't think Andy told you the truth about director Mullins.
What are you talking about?
Something really weird is going on.
I've been trying to reach him for the last 45 minutes.
Ben.
Where are you?
I need more time.
"Right, so CTU can track me."
So I can get the list and you can get the money.
"Ben, I am trying to help you here, but you have got to give me some room."
I've been staring at my phone.
I've been out of my mind.
I had to get out just to keep f rom going crazy.
- l just saw him.
- Tonight?
- About 10:00.
- Where?
We have a special treat f or you tonight.
"As a f avour, the lady who was our star attraction has agreed to give us the song she made the sensation of the South."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Coral Chandler."
I see what Johnny meant.
"You and Johnny, you were together all the time, weren't you?"
We f ought together.
And spent your leaves together.
"London, Paris, Rome."
"Me with a gal, him without one."
Just a picture of you in his eyes.
Where is he?
"Won't you tell me, where did you see him?"
- Let's dance.
"- Please, I want to know."
I wanted her in my arms when I told her.
My right hand on her spine would feel the shock.
She'd tested pure so far.
But so did another girl I knew.
Right up to the dollar point.
And it wasn't 4 million.
- Still wear the same perf ume?
- Tell me where you saw him.
"- ""She wears jasmine, "" he said."
- Please.
He called you Dusty. lt was a name he had between the two of you.
"Just-just give a good look at the dog, will ya?"
- Just give him one good look.
-I don't wanna look.
"A good look or a bad look,"
I'm taking him back to the pound!
- Now get out of my way.
-Come on.
"Just-just give him a look, will you, Ralph?"
You know what?
"I know why you're afraid to give him a look-- you're afraid that if you look into these brown, soulful, trusting eyes, that it'll do something to your heart."
Just look.
"Look into those eyes, Ralph."
"Look, look, look."
"Put him back in the box, Norton!"
-(pleading indistinctly)
-Put him back in the box or I'm gonna do something to you!
Get out of the way!
Open that door.
Open the door.
"Ralph Kramden, you've just lost your membership card to the human race."
I still say it's the best appetizer I ever tasted!
"- Pardon me, sir."
"-Yes, sir?"
I'd like to return a dog that my wife got here yesterday.
Let me see now.
It's a good dog.
"You, uh, say your wife picked him up here yesterday?"
- Yeah.
-What's your name?
Kramden.
K-R-A-M-D-E-N.
- I'll have to check the record first. -'Kay.
"-That's right, you don't."
You could have torn him apart.
So why didn't you?
"Because I don't wanna be the freak for once, Dean."
I wanna be normal.
"So taking a beating, that's normal?"
Any word from Dad?
[CELL PHONE BEEPS]
He called this morning.
"He said he's going to be another week, at least."
We weren't supposed to be here this long.
At least you've got Amanda.
She's cool.
"Dude, she wants me to meet her parents."
I don't do parents.
[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]
[STUDENTS CHATTERING]
"Mr. Winchester, can I talk to you?"
"Um, I'll wait for you outside."
"Look, if this is about the fight, I didn't start it."
"Oh, no, it's not about the fight, Sam."
"You know this assignment was nonfiction, right?"
"Yes, Mr. Wyatt."
"So you and your family killed a werewolf last summer, huh?"
"Why would you write something like this, Sam?"
It doesn't matter.
"As soon as my dad gets back, we're leaving."
-So you can flunk me if you want to.
-I'm not flunking you.
I'm giving you an A.
Aside from the werewolf is that really how you describe your family?
Yeah.
EZRA:
Josiah.
So you have any biblical parables on hand for unrepentant grifters?
No.
-Someone here to see you.
travis:
"Mrs. Standish, I presume."
-l'm Judge Travis.
-My goodness.
You are even more impressive than your reputation.
Yeah?
Well... .
My daughter-in-law believes that Mr. Wingo's charges may be false.
I wanna know why Mr. Wingo would cause...
... hisproperty to be discovered on you.
Well?
What will happen to me if I'm found guilty?
-Are you saying the charges are true?
-Definitely not.
travis:
"Madam, get yourself in hand."
Mr. Jackson's going on trial for murder.
I don't have any time for horseplay.
Mr. Wingo is adamant that you stole his property.
And you are equally adamant that you did not.
"I wanna know the truth, and I wanna know it quickly."
"Ezra, are you acting as my attorney or not?"
Not so long as you leave me in the dark.
"Ezra, take care of this."
I got a trial to convene.
Good day.
"My, my, my, judge."
Like John Garfield in Body and Soul.
Exactly.
John Garfield.
"People tell you that, Father?"
Do people tell you you look like Paul Newman?
Always.
"Well, you know this director who was doing the film here Burke Dennings?"
I've seen him.
You've seen him.
You're also familiar how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
"Father, what do you know on the subject of witchcraft?"
"From the witching end, not the hunting."
I once did a paper on it.
Really?
From the psychiatric end.
I know.
I read it.
All of this desecration in the church do you think this has anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe.
"Some rituals used in the black mass, maybe."
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?
In a fall.
Let me tell you how.
"And please, Father confidential."
"Burke Dennings, good Father was found at the bottom of those steps leading to M Street with his head turned completely around facing backwards."
Didn't happen in the fall?
It's possible.
"-Possible, however--"
-Unlikely.
Exactly.
Saeko-san loves chocolate more than anything else.
That's why I will make chocolate that can make Saeko-san happy.
Saeko-san.
I know everything that Saeko-san likes.
High cocoa chocolate.
Strawberries.
Caramel ganache.
Orange peel.
Rum soaked raisins.
Light green pistachios.
Bright red kirsch soaked cherries.
Ah.
Does this silence mean that she's touched?
"No, it was a miss?"
Souta-kun.
- Yes.
I'm sorry.
I can't accept this.
- Eh?
Because this is totally serious chocolate.
Eh?
Ah.
Did you think I'm a really serious guy?
"A guy making chocolate is really weird, right?"
"But, you know, my family is a cake shop, so making this sort of thing is no big deal."
"So, see, there's no deep meaning to this or anything."
There's someone I'm going out with.
Huh?
"- After Christmas,"
I got back together with my ex-boyfriend.
"Since he likes to travel around, I'd been neglected,"
I thought it would be fine when Souta-kun confessed.
So if that bug hitched a ride on Aldo's body...
We need to call Booth.
"Uh, Brennan said Booth's busy."
"What, too busy to hear about this?"
"Trust me, it's important."
(crickets chirping)
Sergeant.
It's been a while.
"Yeah, too long."
I wish it was for a different occasion.
"Yeah, me, too."
"Who killed him, Seeley?"
"I don't know, Dave, but I'm gonna find out."
Need my help?
"No, I'm good."
"But either of you two, uh, ever hear from Aldo before he, uh, went missing?"
Not me.
He wasn't easy to find.
"All right, well, if you hear anything, just let me know."
"It's my job now to take care of things, okay?"
"Sure, Booth, we'll sit and wait for that to happen."
"You know what, Ted, I'm not here to get into this with you right now."
This is about Aldo.
Guess that's what it takes-- one of us dying before he comes around here.
"Oh, come on, Ted, you know he had nothing to do with Father Clemens' murder."
Yeah.
What did Booth do to help him stay alive?
Not enough.
We all could have been more in touch with him.
DAVE:
He's the reason that we're all home.
"At least for me, I'm grateful."
Then who...?
A shadow stealthily approaches Agwarda!
What are the secrets hidden in the lowest levels of Agwarda?

"Penalty, Ms. Hitomi!"
You sure you want to do it now?
Yes.
"But things are starting to heat up now, so it may be too risky to talk to her."
And that's why I need to do it.
"Now, as our true enemies draw nearer, we need her help."
All right...
Don't worry about what may happen.
Do what you need to do.
The heavy fog that has set in over Okinawa Prefecture and the Amami Islands continues to hover after 4 hours.
All flights into Naha Airport have been cancelled until further notice.
Ryoko Sugi...
"Boy, this is so degrading..."
Mom.
- Birthday celebration.
- Whose birthday?
"Mom, you're missing the best part."
"Guys, Peter's here, and I need to help him with something outside just for a minute, and then I'll be right back, okay?"
What's he doing here?
"It's Dad's birthday, for fuck's sake."
Dinner's almost ready.
"Lupita, set the table."
You have hands.
Do you know he's a DEA agent?
- Huh?
Who's a DEA agent?
- That Peter guy.
Get the fuck out of here.
"I saw him leaving here and he had this jacket on that said ""DEA."""
"- Shane, stop making shit up."
- I'm not.
D-E-A could stand for a lot of things.
"It was the same kind I see on the news when they bust people, the exact kind."
- What exactly did he say to your mom?
- I don't know.
"When I saw him, he was getting into his car."
He looked really mad.
"He's mom's boyfriend, isn't he?"
I really have to get back.
I didn't mean to interrupt your celebration.
I just don't like the way our last conversation went.
- I was upset.
"- I know, and you had a right to be."
- I'm sorry I went behind your back.
- I want to be with you.
"Okay, okay, I'll tell you."
Mind your blade
I want it for my Master.
He's wounded
Who's your Master?
Is it Thunderstorm?
Shi Zhengzong
"Hey man, let go of me!"
How did your Master get hurt?
My Master is so unfortunate
While he was asleep...
Someone covered with blood suddenly came in
Blood?
"Y es, he was stabbed here"
He knew martial arts
Have you heard of anyone who was stabbed here and didn't die?
Who is that man?
"My friend, why're you so rude?"
Release me first
"Oh, my waist!"
T ell me quick!
"Y es, yes!"
That man was covered by blood
But he could still survive!
My Master asked him what happened
And he tried to chop him up
I sensed something was wrong so I kicked him
"Go on, speak"
"Okay, it so happened that I kicked him"
Right on where the knife was stabbed
The knife plunged in two more inches
He gave out a loud cry!
"What ""regulations""?"
"Lockout devices must be in place during the cleaning and maintenance of all heavy machinery."" OSHA, 1989."
Yeah?
Write your congressman.
And hurry that up.
"Congratulations, Reznik."
Youjust made my Shit List.
She's copping his joint.
"He starts telling' her ""baby this"" and ""baby that"", chatting' her up like motherfuckin' Barry White."
"Tellin' her what he wants to do, and how he's gonna make the coochie feel and all that."
- That's right.
- So dig.
"She's stops, she looks up at him with these big puppy dog eyes and she's all: ""that sounds good puppy but me no have no coochie..."""
And the brother's like:
"""Say what?"""
And he looks down and sees that she is really a he!
"Man, that's bullshit."
You telling me the ho's wearing a thong and the fool can't tell the difference?
"She had a tuck job, man!"
"Come on, Jonesy."
You know how they do it!
- You might.
I don't.
"- Yeah, wathever..."
"Ei, Reznik?"
You up for some cards tonight?
Can't.
Got plans.
Shit.

"What's up with you, man?"
You used to be all right.
This young man has departed from our midst.
"The Lord gave, the Lord bath taken away."
Let us pray.
Come in.
"Just put the coffee on the table, please."
-You're Sarah Beth;
-Yes.
Your--
-Please sit.
-There's no need for that.
I have something to say and then I'm going.
-How did you know I was here;
-l have a room at the hotel.
The clerk told me.
I'm not gonna let you hurt Pop anymore.
He can't stand any more.
"Maybe you couldn't hurt him, even if you tried."
"Maybe there's not anything that can hurt him, not after Brock."
I hope so because nobody can stand any more.
Even him.
So maybe the pain's over now.
Unless you've brought him more.
Have you;
What do you want of him;
Nothing.
I came to help Brock.
I didn't know he-- l didn't know until the train was almost here.
"I'm not even going to see your father, Sarah Beth."
"I might try if I thought I could make up a little to him and to you for all the years, but I know I couldn't."
He tried to tell me how he felt.
How the grass was somehow godly to him.
He tried to tell me and I didn't hear.
"- Yeah, but you're not looking at me."
That's 'cause I don't wanna see your silly grin while you pitch.
"Now, continue."
"Look, Teague has breakaway speed to spare and durability."
"( chuckles ) Now, that is one lethal combination."
Lethal?
That is an interesting choice of words when describing Kisan Teague.
Let me ask you this.
Do you think he's a good person?
A good person?
I believe he can be.
"Besides, who are we to judge?"
We all sin.
"I'll answer for you, Charles."
"He can be a good person, but he chooses not to be."
How's Kisan any different than dealing with Sutton or Jared?
"We don't need any more distractions, Charles."
- We need a title.
"- And Teague can help us get there, sir."
- I really believe that.
"- The answer is no, Charles."
"But it was a very impassioned pitch, so je vous remercie."
"Means ""thank you"" in French."
- ( intercom beeps )
- Woman:
Jason Antolotti on one.
- ( beeps )
"- Good morning, Jason."
I'm here with Charles Greane.
"Larry, Chuck, let's talk Teague."
"- Way ahead of you, J. Been trying to..."
"- Go on, Jason."
"Well, I guess you can't have cake today."
What if it's my leg?
"Claire, I guess I'm picking up the cake myself, because you didn't answer my messages."
Claire:
Grawr!
Gr-a-a-awr!
"Hey, Claire, are you having fun at the Gym Town?"
"As a matter of fact, I am."
"This is my new friend, Charlie."
"He loves dinosaurs, and tomorrow we're both gonna have pink eye."
"Hi, Charlie!"
Can you go and find the negligent adult that brought you here?
"Oh, do you have to go so soon?"
He smells so good!
"Yeah, you're like two sniffs away from a felony."
(sighs)
What is going on?
"I gave Phil such a hard time for being too emotional about Luke's graduation, but I think it's hitting me more than I want to admit."
I know.
It happens so fast.
Luke used to love coming here.
Today he gave us a Rolls-Royce.
The one outside is yours?
I thought I was gonna be able to meet Mr. Burt Reynolds!
You're lucky.
"When Manny goes, you still have Joe."
"Yeah, but it doesn't make it hurt any less."
We just have face it...
They're not boys anymore.
They're men.
"Luke has a job, and he's dating."
He can serve on a jury.
"""Hey, Jay Pharoah!"
"""Agh!"
"""You the best, nigga."
"You... are so amazing."""
"And I get sad, you know?"
"'Cause I see entertainers who I think deserve that type of notoriety, and they don't get it."
Like Trey Songz.
I think Trey Songz should be a lot bigger than he is.
You know what I mean?
"He's one of the only entertainers I know that can sit there, eye-molest your girlfriend, while you watch helplessly, and there's nothing you can do but be like,"
"""Yo, that's Trey Songz."
He's eye-molesting my woman.
"""I'm probably gonna sleep with her, and that's fucking awesome."""
"Matter of fact, give me a female volunteer out of the audience right now."
I'm gonna show you what he does.
You?
You wanna come up here?
"Come on, Karen, get up here."
Come on.
This way.
"Here, sit down."
You look happy as shit.
"""Hi, everybody!"""
"Okay, if you don't know who Trey Songz is, this is what he does, he be..."
"¶ Whoa, whoa, ah."
¶ Yeah.
¶ Look what the girl done did to me ¶
Ooh!
You're a little too into this shit.
"All right, it ain't that type of party, ma'am."
Thank you so much.
Peace.
"- Rick, stop him!"
- Hey!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
[ Man ] What's the matter?
It's not cold.
"[ Woman ] Bobby, it's cold!"
"Come on, Diane."
[ Woman Screeches ]
"[ Man Talking, Indistinct ] [ Both Laughing ]"
[ Bobby ] What's the matter?
[ Diane Screeches ] Bobby!
"Oh, I'm gonna get you."
No.
It's cold!
"[ Bobby ] Come on, Diane."
Let's go swimming.
[ Screeches ]
[ Giggling ]
"Diane, you're gonna be at sea before Jessie even realizes you've left the club."
Jessie doesn't scare me.
"Well, if it's Dutch--"
"It's you, Bobby."
"Diane, I love you, and I'm gonna marry you."
That's what scares me.
"All of this is just-- It's all too good to be true, and I just keep thinking that something's gonna happen to spoil it."
Like what?
I don't know.
That's because nothing's gonna happen.
"In two hours, we're gonna be married, and you'll be on the boat to San Diego."
"And when I join you next month, we're gonna have the rest of our lives to raise beautiful little girls... just like you... and nasty little boys just like me."
"Bobby, if something did go wrong, you wouldn't ever forget me, would you?"
Will you just stop it and listen to me?
Where's the server?
It's the Isis foundation.
It's 3rd and Broadway.
It's a 10-minute drive.
I'll come back for you when I'm done.
You're really bleeding.
I guess... trying to take on one of Lex Luthor's fembots doesn't make me the smartest icicle in the freezer.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get us out of here.
Is anyone out there?
!
Is anyone in there?
!
Help!
Can anyone hear me?
!
- Jimmy and Lois here?
"- Not yet, but Jimmy's message said he already sent the files, I was about to get started."
I got a message that Lionel left for me in his vault.
I think I know why he was killed.
He was trying to protect me.
Lionel did say something terrible was coming.
There's something on earth that can be used to control me.
Control you?
"As in ""do my bidding,"" like some sort of puppet?"
What could possibly pull your strings?
I don't know.
"But whatever it is, it takes two keys to unlock."
"When I went back to the Daily Planet tonight, there was a key in my desk."
Lionel left it there for you.
Where is it?
Lex took it.
- Are my little chickies still hungry?
- Yes.
Peep.
"Okay, worm check."
Open up.
Are there anyworms left in there?
You live next door to me.
"- No, I don't."
- I saw you moving in.
You have a white dad and a big brother.
Your whole family lives in one ofthose little apartments?
Do you all have to sleep in the same bed?
My mom lives somewhere else.
You should get a Hide-a-bed.
During the day it's a couch... but at night it folds out into a comfortable queen-sized bed.
You want to be a little bird and get a littleworm?
Just lie down and peep.
"Peep, peep, peep."
Are you following us?
"Yeah, quit following us, Peter Swersey!"
"If you don't stop following us, I'm gonna scream!"
"Ifyou take another step towards me, I'm going to kickyou in the throat!"
"Hey, come here."
Ask her if she likes bologna.
What are you putting?
"I asked herwhat kind of ""bossom"" she had."
- It's probably a man.
- Why is it a man?
'Cause everyone just makes stuff up on these things.
It's probably a man pretending to be a woman.
So picture a fat guy with a little wiener.
"- What's a ""bossom""?"
This is called a rock.
Rock.
Good.
That is a tree.
Rock.
Tree.
Get it?
That's right!
My own giant robot.
I am now the luckiest kid in America!
This is unbelievable.
"This is the greatest discovery since, I don't know, television or something."
I gotta tell someone.
"I should caII-- No, they'II panic."
people wig out and shoot at something big like you.
Wig out.
It means crazy.
"You know, Iike... ."
"No, no!"
Don't do that!
That's the stuff that makes them shoot at you.
"Two nights ago, at approximately 1 ,900 hours, sat com radar..."
... detectedanunidentifiedobject entering Earth's atmosphere...
... losingcontactwithit2 1/ 2 miles off the coast of RockweII.
Some assumed it was a meteor or a downed satellite.
But Washington received a call from someone...
... whoreportedan actualencounter with the object.
"This is no meteor, gentlemen."
This is something much more serious.
We can't call Ripley's Believe It Or Not because they wouldn't believe it.
And... .
It's getting dark.
"With three kinds of heat, you can cook a turkey... in 22 minutes."
Wow.
That is impressive.
The people upstairs think so.
That's why they promoted me.
That's why they sent me here to retool your show.
"Retool what, now?"
I'm the new Vice President of east-coast television and microwave-oven programming.
That sounds like you program microwave ovens.
I like you.
You have the boldness of a much-younger woman.
"Lee, does my face look bloated to you?"
"When I played that lady rapist on ""Law  Order,"""
guess what the makeup guy put on under my eyes to take the puffiness out.
Hemorrhoid cream.
[Laughs]
"Miss Maroney, I have the cat wrangler here for you."
"Oh, is it that horrible little..."
Hi.
Hey.
Greta Johanssen...
short for Lugreta.
Hi.
Great to see you again.
You too.
I'm here to introduce you to the feline actors you're gonna be working with tonight.
Okay.
This is Poppo.
And this here is Captain Boots.
Hello.
Would you describe yourself as cat-competent?
"Oh, yes."
Thanks.
Bye.
What's up this evening?
- It's Friday.
- Aren't you going home?
- Don't you have to go North?
- It's already Friday?
Then I'II see you on Monday.
silvia?
Surprise!
"Hi, little guy."
- See?
There's ciaparatt.
- Who's ciaparatt?
"We invited a few friends, Iet's go."
tell us about the hell you're going through down there.
"Just looking at them, they seem normal, but in reality they're dark, stocky."
No one's in the office in the mornings.
"About 11:30 they show up, at 2 off to the beach."
"With that heat, no one wants to work."
Do the women wearG-strings undertheirbIack dresses?
- And hygiene?
- They're dirty.
There was the start of a cholera epidemic!
It's endemic there.
Tomorrow I'm taking you and Chicco forvaccinations.
"I've already had them, the Red Cross came, you don't fool with cholera."
I worked in the South and I have wonderful memories.
I fell forit!
"My dearbrothers, I've brought you a small gift."
"The ""big tit"" of BattipagIia."
That's five kilos.
"You hear a great deal about the tempo of this city, its speed, its pace, its driving heartbeat."
"Perhaps it's true, for visitors."
"But I was born here, I live here, and the only pace I know is the pace of my own life."
The only beat I hear is the beat of my own heart.
"For me, and for millions of others, New York is home."
"The days follow each other quietly, as they do in most places."
"Only rarely does any one time stand out so that we remember it and say,"
"""That's when everything changed."
"""After that, nothing was the same. """
"There was a time like that in my life, three days."
I remember a summer evening in Gramercy Park.
"-Evening, Mr. Bourne."
-Good evening.
-Mrs.
Bourne.
-Good evening.
Must be Thursday night.
"Bran, every Thursday we have this mad dash against time."
Why?
So we won't have to rush.
I'm never late for dinner with your mother.
It's a matter of principle.
"-Jessie, darling."
"-Hello, dear."
-On the dot.
-As always.
"-Horace, good evening."
"-Hello, Brandon."
The first of the season.
-The flower I love best.
"-Hello, Hannah."
"-Thank you, Brandon."
(mutters)
Smells mighty familiar.
Krammar's Delicious Mystery Appetizer!
"All right, where is she?"
- Where is she?
!
"Alice, come out here!"
-Uh... upstairs on the phone.
"Upstairs on the phone, huh?"
Today was the most humiliating day
-I've ever spent in my whole life.
-Really?
How would you feel if you gave your boss dog food to eat?
"Terrible, unless my boss is a cocker spaniel, I tell you."
Dog food!
It's a miracle I wasn't fired.
"I know who did it, too."
Alice's mother.
"She come over here to cook me a tidbit, that's what she did."
"She don't care what Alice gives me to eat, just as long as Alice can scrimp and save and live around here in the lap of luxury!"
"Those ain't the facts, Ralph."
Those ain't the facts.
"They're not the facts, huh?"
Then why would we have dog food around the house?
And in our ice box?
!
"What, have we got a dog or something?"
"Ralph Kramden, you have just reached the first plateau!"
What are you talking about?
!
"I'm not talking about it, and I'm not saying it."
Just put your nose in that bedroom there.
None of them fit.
I'm not paying for it!
I didn't say a thing.
"Jimmy was so pissed off, he didn't even say good-bye."
Stop with those fuckin' drugs.
They're making your mind into mush!
Ya hear me?
I'll take 'em back.
I knew my Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.
"And since I was going to see them later in the afternoon, to pick up a delivery I was pretty sure I'd get my money back."
"Oh, my God."
"When I finally got there at the hospital to pick up Michael, his doctor wanted to put me in bed."
Jesus Christ!
What happened to you?
I almost got into an accident driving' over here.
And I said I was partying all night.
"No, I'm fine, doc."
Get over here.
Let me check you out.
"He took mercy on me, gave me Valium and sent me home."
"Now, my plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up Karen."
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?
Right in front of us there.
I think it's been following me all morning.
-Get the fuck out.
Are you nuts?
-l'm telling you.
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.
"That's teenager for ""okay."""
"Now, you see what happens when you..."
"Oh, God, I do sound like that."
(cell phone chimes)
Yes!
"Thank you, God!"
You passed the evaluation?
Close enough.
I'm on probation!
- Congratulations.
- Wow.
- Probation party!
- What did you do to turn it around?
A lot of things I'm ashamed of!
"Waitress, a round of hot water and lemon for my friends!"
"Previously on ""2 Broke Girls""..."
"I am choosing to take this disaster as a sign, and while they're rebuilding this place"
I'm gonna go surprise Randy and try to rebuild us!
"Fine, use my car, but I'm going to be driving it."
I'm coming with you.
I finally got the gas pedal extension where I like it.
I'll just call AAA.
Cool.
"Later, hater."
"Wait, you're really leaving?"
Who leaves someone on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere?
"My friend, Sloppy Joe, has a one-engine plane."
He might be able to fly y'all all the way to LA.
"Well, that's a wrap on the first day of filming here in Austin, Texas."
So Randy's not in Los Angeles?
He's in Texas?
With an remarkable result.
Imagin this.
"On larger dose, nicely wrapped and shipped to Winston Churchill!"
"Do you understand, we are whats left!"
We are the nations backbone
Or to put it like this.
With our beloved leader.
"""We have alot riding on us, to win the war"""
Sunshine?
"Protection of power plant, and the damms in Southern Norway."
Stop the germans from destroying to much.
Your in charge.
"Poulsson second in command, -"
- Skinnarland as radio operator.
"The rest you choose yourself, congratulation."
I though you wanted to get back in the field.
"If you want to stay here til the war is over and then go back to see your wife and child, thats ok.."
Off course not.
The war is not over.
"-Thanks, sir."
-Bravo.
You wont miss the fish.
No fish with this colour in norway.
No!
", i dont want it"
Its likely very beautiful there this time of year.
Its allways beautiful.
Do you know what i miss the most with Norway?
The View
-Whereever you look.
-Yes.
Starting to be a very long time ago.
It's so depressing.
I thought your friends asked you to live with them.
In a postwar building
On a street that's not even numbered.
It's lettered.
And its big selling point is that it's above a falafel stand.
"All right, well, listen, hey, I gotta go."
"There's no v.I.P. Area,"
But there's a nice set of bleachers.
Blair?
"You probably don't remember us,"
But we met you at your mom's fashion show.
"Uh, yeah, of course."
Hair band girl.
I never forget a good accessory.
We're celebrating.
We just got the most amazing apartment ever.
"You would totally approve- prewar, doorman,"
And the best part-fauchon is supposedly opening up next door.
Can I ask you something?
What do you think about falafel?
Ew.
Isn't that the kind of food paralegals eat?
I never thought I'd see Blair Waldorf
On the upper West Side.
Unless...
"Oh, my God."
Are you transferring to Columbia?
I hope so.
N.Y.U. Is so beneath you.
I- it's true!
I'm a Columbia girl now.
Let's go for a walk.
"Oh, thanks."
It's this dumb cane.
Do you want to ruin
It's this dumb cane.
Do you want to ruin something for me?
Do you want to ruin something for me?
Maybe that would cheer you up.
something for me?
Maybe that would cheer you up.
"Oh,no."
Maybe that would cheer you up.
"Oh,no."
"Imean,Ibelievealot of"
"Oh,no."
"Imean,Ibelievealot of really dumb stuff, you know,"
"Imean,Ibelievealot of really dumb stuff, you know, like pop rocks and Coke?"
"really dumb stuff, you know, like pop rocks and Coke?"
That's dangerous.
like pop rocks and Coke?
That's dangerous.
"You know, and the moon landing?"
That's dangerous.
"You know, and the moon landing?"
Never happened.
"You know, and the moon landing?"
Never happened.
"And also the Illuminati, I--"
Never happened.
"And also the Illuminati, I-- I'mreallynotinthemood"
"And also the Illuminati, I-- I'mreallynotinthemood right now."
I'mreallynotinthemood right now.
"You can't touch me, Sheriff!"
I brought my attack dog with the built-in force field.
"Well, I brought my dinosaur who eats force-field dogs."
"Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!"
"You're going to jail, Bart!"
Say goodbye to the wife and Tater Tots.
"You saved the day again, Woody."
You're my favourite deputy.
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
"Come on, let's wrangle up the cattle."
When the road looks rough ahead
"And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed"
"Round 'em up, cowboy!"
Just remember what your old pal said
"Boy, you've got a friend in me"
Yee-haw!
"Yeah, you've got a friend in me"
"Hey, cowboy!"
Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
Big and stronger too
"Come on, Woody."
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
"It's me and you, boy"
And as the years go by
Whoa!
Whoa!
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see It's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
All right!
And who are you?
"Please say, ""sister."""
I'm Noah's girlfriend.
"Boy, it is so nice to see there are still good guys in the world."
"Hey, well, you found us."
Wow.
Lana.
Yeah.
Damn.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
"I hope not, man."
"If you're thinking what I'm thinking, you are a horrible person."
Yeah.
"I mean, there's no universe in which you can go after a man's girlfriend when he's lying motionless in a hospital bed."
Yeah.
Let alone pulling out his IV bag and banging her over his lifeless body.
Wow.
That was on the tip of your tongue.
Hmm?
"Dr. Maxwell, can you come in here for a moment?"
I need to talk to you about something very important.
This is slightly uncomfortable for me to talk about.
Is it about the surgery this morning?
I swear that kid's nose just looked like that.
I want to friend Riley on the Facebook.
"It's just ""Facebook."""
"Oh, I know, but Riley seems to take it pretty seriously."
Would you be willing to friend me and possibly connect me with your friends?
"But, you know, the cool ones."
Okay.
I guess I could do that.
Great!
"Where does he get the balls, all right?"
To tell America's greatest city to drop dead.
- That's just it.
He never said that.
"The Daily News said he did, but he didn't say it."
"- Oh, I don't care."
"You don't, as leader of the free world, tell this city, I mean, this great city, which by the way, gave more of its sons and brothers to every war, you know, since we kept the British from"
crossing the Hudson River.
"- Not accurate, but I get your point."
- How-
"- How do you tell a whole city of New Yorkers to drop dead, all right?"
New York is the greatest city in the world.
- Paris is a better city.
- He's right.
We got nothing on Paris.
- I wish I was in Paris right now.
- What's so fucking great about Paris?
- Shut up.
"- Their cheese, their bread, the way they kiss, eau de toilett."
Cancan.
Pete:
Hey.
- Everything's better.
Pete:
"Hey, hey, hey!"
You fucking playing backgammon over there?
Close that shit up.
We don't do that here.
You heard me.
"Close it up now, and get out."
Horace:
Get outta here.
- Mikhail's back.
- Bring him to me.
How can I bring him in when I've got my hands tied behind my back?
Let me deal with him my own way.
This is not a democracy.
You do what I say.
You understand?
Mikhail has caused no trouble.
"If FBI had the list, believe me... we'd have major war with Italians, with everyone."
"If he is here, then list is still in France."
I will convince Mikhail to take proper course of action.
"So, bring him to me."
I meant no disrespect.
I'm just worried.
Remember when you told me about Goradini talking to the FBI?
And Pietro?
And Andrea?
"I took care of them for you, Dimitri."
But Mikhail is different.
I know you feel like he's your son.
"Yes, Dimitri."
- is this also Mikhail's place?
"- No, my friend's."
Mikhail and I used for come here to escape.
You looked comfortable with that gun stuck in that guy's neck today.
That didn't scare me as much as when you tried to drown him in the Jacuzzi.
I lost it.
Sorry.
How long you been working at the Bohemia?
About a year.
I used to dance.
Nightclubs.
"Big, big jackpot on Monday."
Garfunkel?
"Yeah, I'm probably the biggest Garfunkel who ever lived."
"I mean, after all I've done for her."
"You know, I give her money almost every week."
But doesn't she work for you?
"That's not the point, exactly."
"Adrian, Natalie is a human being."
"Now, all this attention can throw a person off balance."
Especially if it comes suddenly and unexpectedly.
"You know, I once wrote a book on body language and it spent all of three minutes on the best-seller list."
"Now, I was very young and I'm sorry to say I became a bit of a diva."
I didn't like myself very much.
"So, now, you're on her side."
"The question is, why aren't you on her side?"
Why aren't you happy for her?
Natalie is your friend.
Maybe you're afraid she doesn't need you anymore.
Maybe you're afraid of losing her.
Or maybe I just feel insulted.
Insulted?
What I do is hard.
I am out there.
I am sweating out every clue.
I am putting killers behind bars.
What does she do?
What does she do?
91.
Number 91.
91.
Number 91.
91.
You like it?
Mm-hmm.
"You know, it's funny--"
Yo.
Yo.
"I thought you were out with Sandra, the waitress."
"Sondra, the coffee server."
"Oh, well, maybe I'd know how to pronounce her name if you'd introduce me to her."
Stop it.
"Well, that's funny that you mention that."
What are you doing tomorrow?
Uh...
"Meeting Sondra, the coffee server."
"in what, uh, two years?"
Three.
"But, um..."
"She might be someone special, so it's important for me that she meets you."
"All right, bring her by."
"Oh, by the way, Grandfather called."
Lunch is at 12:30.
Day after tomorrow.
Does the guy have to have a birthday every single year?
"Come on, Jerry, you're the one that's always talking about letting go of the past."
He did the best that he could when we were kids.
That's easy for you to say.
"You only defend him because he likes you, and he loves hearing about your work."
Grandpa likes you.
[laugh] Wow.
It's amazing.
"And ironic,if I may say, what a bad liar you are"
"Okay, so maybe he likes me a tad more."
But that's only because you remind him so much of Dad.
Addons Then came Max.
He has destroyed more than 30 sites.
Addons like to work hard with his hands.
"You do not kill Max, is not it?"
You do not kill Max.
"You kill the wrong people, stupid."
Addons you kill the wrong people.
Addons But do not worry.
One to capture the real Max.
Addons soon.
Addons And he will suffer.
"Addons Now, where are we?"
Addons Alan was very funny.
"Addons We all know this is nepolitico and, but you, Jo ..."
Addons you Inga what do you do?
Addons Enough ...
You look.
Addons - really like to see ..
- I'm drunk.
Addons I hereby apologize for anything.
You become pregnant.
Addons A pathetic excuse for your life miserable.
"But even so self-centered, to see my son die?"
Addons
- What have you done with my daughter?
- Meriþi not a girl.
Addons The only thing you should do it the waters and the panic button.
You killed my mother.
Your family and pilot and the innocent people you killed.
Addons you sweep the floor with my daughter Lucy.
Addons This is a service of destruction for the people.

"They kill the celebrities first, and then they fuck 'em in the butt."

There are cops always in this club.
They're probably just arranging an engagement party or something.

"-Body breathing - [Gig] Goodevening, Officers."
- What can I do for you?
- Are you the owner?
"Yes, I am."
Gig.
"Gig, do you know a guy by the name of Jerry Green?"
He apparently is known to come in here.
"Yeah, Jerry the bookie."
Comes in here all the time.
"Has he been in here lately, because, I mean, nobody's seen this guy around for a while."
"Ah... about a week ago, I think."
Huh.
Back to back
Sacroiliac
Spine less movement
- And a wild attack
- You wanna get back to this?
- Maybe ask another question or two?
"- Yeah, yeah."
Where... do you find girls like that?
"I mean, who'd do that kind of stuff?"
"Well, you know, it's remarkably easy."
You'd be surprised.
"These two, I believe, we imported from upstate New York."
- (Stephen) Yeah.
- So he predicted Jerry Lee Lewis's career.
(laughter and applause)
- (Alan) He foresaw it in a prose poem.
- (Stephen) He foresaw it in a poem.
"Called ""Great Balls of Fire"", or, ""Goodness Gracious""."
"- Stick to ""Great Balls of Fire""."
That's what...
- A meteor.
- His theory...
- (Alan) Cigarettes.
- What's the theory?
The theory?
- (Julia) Relativity.
- The big bang.
- (Stephen) The big bang.
Thank you.
- I'll give you a point.
Well done.
- (applause)
Edgar Allan Poe believed that all matter had once been concentrated into a single particle which then expanded to fill space - a theory not accepted by science until 1931.
"""Eureka"", his prose poem, goes on to predict the general theory of relativity, parallel universes, and the structure of the atom."
Pretty good going for a poem that doesn't even rhyme.
You know the word rhyme?
There's no word that actually rhymes with the word rhyme.
- (Alan) Lime.
- (Julia) Time.
Apart from those two.
- Slime.
- Three.
- Grime.
- (Rich) Orange.

"And anyway, sir, it's after 6:00."
It requires a jacket here.
What about him?
"Hey, didn't I tell you to make all the deliveries in the rear?"
Right.
I think I understand.
How much is it to join your little club for an afternoon?
Don't even try it.
"I was gonna buy you one drink, as a courtesy, at the club."
"Now I want you out right now, or I'm gonna throw you out."
You and who else?
Me.
- Get me a drink.
- Coming right up.
Thanks.
That's all right.
I just didn't wanna see you kill anyone.
"Besides, I need your help."
I gotta find her.
She used to work Hotel Street.
What club?
Wiki-Wiki.
Wiki-Wiki?
I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon.
He can be with any girl he wants!
There you go.
"Feel better, p-pal?"
What am I supposed to do?
I can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.
"I mean, Wendy says she'd never leave me for him, but what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings?"
"She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl."
This is all so crazy.
"I mean, really, how could my day get any worse?"
"No, no-- no, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it!
"No, fuck off, I'm not doing it!"
"Aw, jeez, you're no fun."

- Hey.

- Hi.
"Hey, Bridon!"
Hey.
"Hey, kid, over here."
"Hey, uh, listen..."
"You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do,"
"I think you need to, uh, ease off a little bit."
Huh?
"Yeah, look, I know you think the kids in school like you, but actually they're all getting really annoyed."
- They are?
"- Yeah, you don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but take it from me, you're driving everyone crazy."
I don't blame them.
All that singing and dancing-- I can't stand it.
You don't like doing it?
It just isn't me.
"Trying to get it together, but we got a little problem."

They're already too big in Vacaville.

"Well, we have to find out."
But how are we gonna-- [phone rings]
Damn it.
Let the machine get it.
Hello?
Any closer to finding Gus Walker's killer?
How did you get this number?
"Come on, Special Agent Henson."
Why do I even ask?
You really should consider using me as a resource on Walker.
I don't need you as a resource.
"Well, for, uh, someone with no leads, you're quick to throw away free information."
What could you possibly know that I don't already have?
Something I'm unwilling to share on the phone.
Meet me at King Street Lounge in ten minutes.
"I'll be gone in 15, along with the info."

I have to go.
But what about-- And don't go anywhere.
"We're gonna work on this as soon as I get back, okay?"
Okay.

It comes with this.

"Lee Yoon Sung,"
My father...
Please forgive him.
I'm sorry.
Kim Young Joo.
Kim Young Joo!
Kim Young Joo!
"If you want to see the classified documents, come to the Seoul junkyard"
- City Hunter.
"Father, why did you do that?"
Why did you have to lie and tell Kim Yong Joo to go there?
This Republic of Korea Prosecutor wanted to know the truth...
I was just helping him.
Do you know?
"The person who killed the innocent Kim Young Joo... is no one else but you, Father."
"Even if someone commits no sins, that person can die at anytime."
Just like my colleagues did.
"Now, that Cheon Jae Man will die by my hands."
Let's go!
So you want to smuggle your way out.
The punk who's smuggled himself out knows what that feeling is like.
You get used to me.
You funny.
- You...
- In here.
What's the status of your crew-served weapons?
"We have two 81 s, four 60s twelve .30 calibers, three on each wall."
One 4-deuce.
"Besides crew-served, we have six M-79's."
No .50 calibers?
I'd give an R and R in Bangkok for the smell of a .50.
KIRBY:
"You hear that, sergeant?"
"- Yes, sir."
- Know where there are any .50's?
MULDOON:
"No, sir."
Neither do I. You better tell Sergeant Petersen.
I almost forgot.
Captain MacDaniel needs corrugated tin.
- It's been hard to come by lately.
- Sergeant.
"Yes, sir."
I know.
"""Tell Petersen."
"Tell the scrounger."""
Petersen!
What happens if Charlie hits this camp before you get it completed?
"If he does, and he's too strong for us to handle we have 3 LZs within 4 clicks to send 10 choppers each to reinforce us."
One is by that shale cliff you saw on your way in.
And the second is to the west of here near a deserted Montagnard village where some of these people used to live.
"The third is to the north, near an old bridge."
What if Charlie overruns the camp?
In here!
"Joey's in trouble, Ray."
"Ray, let's just break the fuckin' thing down."
Got it.

"His father is serving a life sentence for murder, murdering an ex-girlfriend... with a sawed-off shotgun back in 1988."
The New York Times is quoting one friend of Royster as saying... that the guy had an IQ of 160.
I need your help.
They're tryin' to kill me.
- Who?
"- ""Who""?"
My friends tried to kill me.
Ray Donlan tried to kill me.
Shit!
Holy shit!
Speak of the devil!
"Freddy, forget it."
I don't get this.
This doesn't make any sense.
Why'd they get Superboy off the bridge... to bring him back here and kill him?
Ray had a plan... and it got very fucked up.
"You awake, Freddy?"
I feel like shit.
Fuckin' allergies are killin' me.
Hey.

Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
I have to go.
We have to go back to Brussels.
"Come on in, Victoria."
Then she is the mayor of this beautiful village.
"Well, I have no other choice, so I'm the mayor."
It is a big responsibility because I love these people and I want them.
I want...
That they are happy.
It is difficult to understand what happiness is.
It is not conditional.
You can not say:
"""I will be happy if I have this, if..."""
"When you say 'if', it means you're not happy."
"That's why we're all happy here, hear 'yes'."
"I heard from somebody here in this beautiful country,"
She did the stuntman.
"Yes, I was the stuntman coordinator, but it's just one of my professions."
I'm black karate belt and I have the fourth level of Shotokan.
I have...
I'm a diving instructor.
I was the first Bulgarian to cross the Swim Channel.
Do you know where the Channel is?
Between England and France.
But  I...
I've never seen a mayor and bare feet.
"Occasionally, when I go to the capital,"
I put my sandals or shoes.
That's all I know.
And you have mules.
And you're not kicking them hard enough.
It's ridiculous.

The first shot involves Toxie.
Toxie's late.
It takes two hours to get his makeup on.
"And even if he's supposed to be there at 5:00,"
"And all of a sudden it's 6:30 or something and there's no Toxie,"
"It's, like, major."
Because then we know the first I can't get off until like 8:30.
INTERVIEWER:
"Lloyd, do you have a word of the morning?"
"Uh, a lot of very, very bad production."
No actors.
INTERVIEWER:
"What are you doing, Sandy?"
I'm making this guy a Toxie double.
INTERVIEWER:
Why?
"Because supposedly Dave-- unfortunately,"
His costume takes a while to prepare.
"So they want to get this shot done, so--"
One just wasn't enough.
They're using--
INTERVIEWER:
Are you gonna be able to tell
That's a different guy?
We have a great editor.
[Laughs]
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
-Don't follow me.
-Gyung Joon...!
-Leave me alone!
-Gyung Joon...
-Why?
Are you scared that your precious Yoon Jae is going to be seen as a ruthless jerk?
Are you going to cry again?
"Then before I do more, leave me alone and go."
"I'm sure you're upset after hearing those words, so how can I go and leave you alone?"
Don't pretend that you're worried.
You're just like my uncle!
"You're worried that I'll always stay in this precious Yoon Jae's body, right?"
"Just like my uncle, you don't like me and are burdened by me, so why are you pretending to worry?"
Gyung Joon...
"I told you the more things are like this, the more I'll do things my way."
Da Ran!
Yoon Jae...
Did you just shove my sister?
Why are you yelling at my sister?
Choong Sik...
It isn't something for you to get involved in.
Just go.
He was being weird to you this morning at school.
I came to see what was going on...
And it's a good thing that I came.
Yoon Jae...
I really didn't take you to be like this.
But you're weird...
Yoon Jae!

-Grade school or high schooI--?
"-Hey, Mitch!"
-Coming!
"Gracious, what lung power."
I teach high school in AurioI.
"well, what do you teach?"
What subject?
-You guess.
"-well, I bet you teach art or music."
"well, of course, I couId be wrong."
You might teach arithmetic.
"Never arithmetic, sir."
Never arithmetic.
I don't know my multiplication tables.
Nope.
I have the misfortune of being an english instructor.
I attempt to instill a bunch of bobbysoxers and drugstore Romeos with a reverence for Hawthorne and Whitman and Poe.
"well, I bet some of them are more interested in other things."
How very right you are.
Their literary heritage is not what they treasure above all else.
But they're sweet things and in the spring it's touching to notice them making their first discovery of love as if nobody had ever known it before.
-Sorry.
"Oh, excuse me, excuse me."
-Have you finished?
"-Oh, yes."
"Yes, I have."
"-Wait, wait."

Turn on the light above now.
"Oh, look."
We've made enchantment.
"-Three bullets, mustache."
"For the public opinion, and in agreement with his family, he was called Juve."
Why did you hide me the truth?
I had given Monsieur Havard my word that no one would know the truth.
And I kept to my word.
Why passing up for dead?
To better track Fantomas?
Exactly.
I learned that Lady Beltham had fled to England.
I knew Fantômas would join her.
So what?
I crossed the Channel: unfortunately he had just left for Canada.
And you have changed your face.
Yes.
To start again at the same level.
"Not without difficulties,"
I got introduced to this band of hoodlums that you know.
People who may work for Fantômas?
That's right:
"Cut-Nose, Gas-light, Mother Toulouche."
Because... they began thieving again.
"Fandor, Fantomas is back."
"Why not arrest Nibet, Nose-cut"
- and the others?
- No.
"No, they are small fry."
Small-time criminals.
No.
"I let them act freely and thanks to them,"
I'm sure that I will find Fantômas.
But for now...
"""Tail-hair"" I am, and ""Tail-hair"" I will remain."
It's the name they gave you?
Everybody knows everybody.
"Do you grow pot, Mr Trimbole?"
"Do you grow pot, Mr Trimbole?"
"Now, you wouldn't be asking me that if I was Mr Jones, would you?"
"Now, you wouldn't be asking me that if I was Mr Jones, would you?"
You're welcome to search my place.
You're welcome to search my place.
I've got nothing to hide.
I've got nothing to hide.
I've never been in trouble with the law in me life.
I've never been in trouble with the law in me life.

"Terrans, Methuselah's, and all of the Empire follow her lead."
"Education isn't limited by birth or wealth, as it is in the Outer World."
Terrans and Methuselah's are all equal before Her Majesty.
Equal...
The two races coexist before Her Majesty's absoluteness.
That is why the Empire is so prosperous and peaceful.
But what if something ever happened to the empress?
If anything ever happened...
it would spell the end of everything.
Esther!
Are you hungry?
You haven't eaten for an entire day...
"Oh, now that you mention it..."
Let us go buy something to eat!
Where could that Seth girl have wandered off to?
!
Honestly!
Who's there?

"Looks like you've completely recovered, Ion."
R-Radu?
!
"Nice to see you again, Ion."
Impossible...
You're supposed to be dead!
Dead?
Don't be silly.
Then how could I possibly be standing here?
Have you set me up yet again?
!
You've already killed my grandmother and framed me for it...
Is that how much you hate me?
Sorry!
Can we finish it off now?
Shall we do our work here or... some where in private?
"Papa, he's asking your choice, You would like to die here or... inside in private."
Whom you're working for?
"Virus Autos, I gave you my card,"
"Viruses Autos, It seems a foreigner gang,"
What's your Boss name?
"Mr. D.M. Pipot, Mr. D.M. Pipot,"
Why this pipot wants to kill me?
"Actually Sir, your... to kill, you say kill, Why he needs to kill you?"
Then why you came here to kills me?
Sir I... not kills Sir!
K I L L kill.
"You add S with every English word, Sir, that's not right, Sir!"
"It's Papa's S, he will add where he wants."
Why you want to kill me?
"Sir, why I should I kill you?"
"You're joking, Sir."
"Papa, don't talk to him, kill him otherwise, he will kill us with his questions."

He's dead.

"Excuse me,"

This is not fair.
"You know I have to go for another work, and you have ruined my face."
Where is Bathroom?
She was asleep on the couch with the door open.
"I couldn't stop myself, Beth."
She'd lied to me.
I picked up an ashtray.
I hit her.
I couldn't help it.
I hit her and hit her and hit her.
That's very interesting.
It explains a lot.
"- You're trespassing, Lieutenant."
"- Take it easy, Perry."
I have a warrant here.
"Mr. Sandover, you understand that anything you've said to me that might have been overheard by Lieutenant Tragg--"
What difference does it make?
I killed her.
"I have to tell, Mr. Mason."
"I killed her, yes."
And then I put a necktie in her hand.
She was always playing with neckties.
It was Enos's necktie.
"Thank you, Mr. Sandover."
"But suppose you tell us all this down at headquarters, eh?"
"Now look here, Tragg--"
"It's too bad you didn't check sooner with us, Perry."
"You see, when this guy struck her,"
Lita Krail had probably been dead for over a half an hour.
The doctor found the bullet in her heart.
[Tragg] My warrant is for Mrs. Sandover... for murder.
"Well, that's-- that's it, Perry."
"I did go out there, but I was with Lita only 20 minutes or so."
It was sometime after 11:00.
When did she call you?
What is this?
Ow'
"Yeow' Oh, ow, ow, oh'"
I think I'd better go see what Louie is up to.
"Come out, you little pipsqueak, and fight like a man'"
- Louie'
- Ow.
- What are you doing?
"- Well, I-I-I wasjust, uh, uh, uh--"
"I'm sorry, madame."
"You know, Eric, perhaps ouryoung guest might enjoy... seeing some ofthe sights ofthe kingdom."
Something in the way ofa tour.
"I'm sorry, Grim."
What was that?
You can't spend all your time moping about.
You need to get out.
Do something.
Have a life.
Get your mind off--
"Easy, Grim, easy."
"It's not a bad idea, ifshe's interested."
"Well, what do ya say?"
Would you like tojoin me... on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?
"Wonderful' Now, let's eat before this crab wanders off my plate."
"Come here, boy."
"This has got to be, without a doubt... the single most humiliating day of my life."
"I hope that you appreciate what I go through foryou, young lady."
"Now, we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you."
"Tomorrow, when he takes you for that ride, you gotta lookyour best."
"You gotta bat your eyes, like this."
"You gotta pucker up your lips, like this."
"You are hopeless, child."
- Let's sign the papers.
- You're using good judgment.
We'll go right up to the office.
"Alright, we can rehearse Miss Chummy now."
Aah!
"(Commodore) Mr. Ganz, Mr. Ganz?"
We may as well adjust our little business now.
The understanding was that I was to receive 10% if you recall.
"Uh, 10% of the show."
"No cash, Commodore."
"Oh, but confounded, sir, I insist upon the cash."
I'm not putting money into plays at my age.
"Well, if you'd prefer $1500 to a possible fortune it's alright with me, Commodore."
"Uh, Regan?"
"Yes, Mr. Ganz."
Has Bryson called about the ticket buy?
- 'Bryson?
'
- Yes.
He was to call and make an offer for a block of seats for six weeks.
"Uh, let me see, um 300 seats at four dollars, uh, $1200."
"Multiplied by eight, uh, $9600."
"Multiplied by six roughly, uh, $58,000, uh..."
"Pardon, pardon me, Mr. Ganz."
"On, ahem, on second thought"
I may take an interest in the show for my percentage.
I'm not in need of cash at the moment and it may offer me a bit of diversion.
"Well, now you're talking."
"Come along, Commodore we'll fix you right up."
- Are you alright?
- Mm-hmm.
"Oh, I feel fine."
"Fine, I'll give it to you straight."
His daughter's letter?
"She's dead, Neil."
- When?
- January 2006.
Then what's this?
If his daughter died in January... how could she have written this letter in June?
This means Natasha Malhotra is the killer?
"But, where is she?"
- You?
- Good evening.
How did you get in?
Through the door.
I'm sorry... is there something wrong?
Yeah.
"I prefer the next piece, it's a... a lot more dramatic."
I don't understand.
Five years ago...
Samara Shroff joined Kabir Malhotra's empire as his executive assistant.
He didn't know her.
But...
Samara knew him very well.
"Because she was, his brother, Iqbal Chand Malhotra's daughter."
"Isn't that right, Natasha?"
Natasha?
"Mr. Menon, is this a joke?"
Mr. Kabir Malhotra was dying of cancer.
And your father was his legal heir.
Making sure that it stayed that way was crucial.
And for the past five years... you were doing just that.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Mr. Malhotra wasn't aware that when he was telling us the truth... it affected someone else... a lot more.
I went through all your papers and completely organized your life for the next two months.

"Home, Work, Ritchie or Personal, and I devised this dot system to indicate priority."
"I think you're, uh, really going to like it."
I may be wrong.
What are you doing?
"I'm sorry, but this situation with Jeff is getting more and more complicated."
I need the board.
I need to chart what our family tree would look like if Richard married New Christine and I married her father.
Okay.
Let's put it on the board.
Okay.
Write my name in the middle of the board.
Yes.
"Now write Richard next to me, and connect us with a line."
A broken line.
Thank you.
And then put Ritchie underneath us.
Yes.
And then put New Christine next to Richard.
And write...
P...
Pa...
Papa Jeff up there.
That is correct.
"Now draw a line from New Christine up and across and over to me, and..."
"Oh, my God."
I'm Ritchie's grandmother.
Where should I put me?
"Oh, who cares?"
Just go next to me.

Maybe we could explore this in more detail.
Maybe over coffee.
I'm talking about a hero detective and his widow's pension.
Why don't you wait in my office?
"No, I don't think so."
I'll expect to hear from you in the morning.
"No, no, that's wrong."
It won't go away unless you do something about it.
This is a crisis that could derail us.

How late was Colin here?
About 5:00.
We were just having fun.
He never even mentioned his girlfriend.
What about this boy?
You ever seen him?
The victim helped us with this sketch of her assailant.
I don't know.
He looks like he could be 100 different people.
"Miss Sennett, can I have a word?"
You ever go to Throb?
Or Cushion?
Sure.
What about way back when Cushion was called Class A?
"No, but I hear it kicked."
Mmm.
Legend's always better than the truth.
My partner and I are after a group of burglars working the club circuit.
They target people like you and Colin 'cause you're young and famous and it's easy to track when you stay out late.
Not much left of him.
It's gonna take 24 hours to get the DNA they got from Lau's body processed.
Harry?
Kalim intimated that Freddie Lau was going to be killed.
"- Kalim, owner of the Pleasure Palace?"
- Yeah.
Fenchurch's boss.
He hinted that someone was trying to muscle out Freddie but Freddie wasn't listening.
Maybe the two murders are connected.
"Kayleigh's murder was so precise - no DNA, they drop her in the Thames."
Freddie Lau's body is just dumped in an alleyway.
It's sloppy.
Check out the CCTV in Soho the night Freddie died.
We might be able to pick up his movements.
I've got a croupier to find.
"You're a hard man to track down, JC."
I need your help with something.
"Get lost, Harry."
It's my down time.

Ah-ah!
"The tall guy the other night in the casino, the one that got chucked out - what's his name?"
"- You can't do this, Harry."
- This is just a warm-up.
What's his name?
The one that was screaming for Freddie Lau?
"All right, stop."
His name's Kevin Grey.
He used to be on the staff but he got chucked off a couple of months ago.

They tied him to a tree brought his teenage daughters out in front of him and disemboweled them.
Then 40 of them abused his wife.
And then they took a steel rod.
Broke every bone in her body.
Somewhere during the process she died.
PETERSEN:
These people need better medical care than we can give them.
NIM:
Where is Colonel Kirby?
PETERSEN:
L'll find him.
[NIM SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
Colonel?
We got 3 people who can make it if we get them to a hospital.
My sources downtown are telling me they know who ann is.
L.A.P.D. Just identified her prints.
"We have got to turn her in now,ron."
Who's the homicide a.D.A. On duty?
"William matthew byrne,jr."
Ouch.
Byrne's tough.
"If we turn ann in now, byrne will be the trial d.A."
When does his shift end?
6:00 a.M. Then it's j.D. Keller.
Maybe we should wait.
"Hey,i am not afraid of byrne."
I'd rather go up against keller.
"Keller loves the media so much, he'll tip his trial strategy"
Just to get his name in the paper.
We'll know what he's gonna do in court before he does it.
"After he hit me,i landed here in the corner by the bed."
"He was here between me and the door,"
"And the cart was right here, where i grabbed the knife."
How?
Show me.
I just swung and ran past him.
So you had to use deadly force because he blocked your retreat.
Excellent.
Who's doing the investigation?
"It's a wobbler-- L.A.P.D.,"
Beverly hills p.D.-- Joint jurisdiction.
So they'll be fighting over who gets to make the arrest.
I love it.
Turf battles between cops always help the defense.
"The l.A.P.D. Will really want this one bad,"
So arrange to turn her in to the beverly hills p.D.
-No longer with us.
Is a better place next to the ...
Carmen.
"Carmen, wait!"
"I do not want to dip your feet, my love."
I'm not your love.
"See, what I said Carmen it will leave only one stick."
"Get out, I'm just Carmen."
"Ramon, it's unbelievable, everyone came."
"Least the guy who stayed behind, it was cold."
He is not here.
You're a great friend.
"Thank you, friend."
"Do not look at me, had nothing to do."
"So, it was love, thank you."
He thanked the penguin wrong.
"Hello, how are you?"
-I knew.
Small-Erik health.
"Well, all friends present and assembled we will not rest until they are all fat."
That's right.
The funniest sound I've heard
I could not understand a single word  isnowspreading throughout the land
I still can not understand
Isaidandthenpartner what is the name  notdareto tellme the same thing
yourownmusic I can not understand
But has a sound that makes me dance like crazy
"I bring a lot of fish, my courtesy."
"Shows how to do it, brother."
Who is that guy?
"Call him the insect, he's fantastic."
Let me repeat I told you before ...
Yeah.
"Theywere throwing rocks, John, just rocks."
[Quiet Chuckle]
"They don'tthink I feel, but..."
I feel too much sometimes.
Ljustcan't letourwhole policy be dominated by our sentimentality.
You're doing the rightthing.
Don't let'em shake you.
No.
"You know, it broke my heart when Harold died."
- Thatwas a long time ago.
- Yeah.
I think that's when itstarts...
when you're a kid.
The laughs and snubs and slights you get... because you're poor or Irish orJewish... or... just ugly.
Getoffthat.
That leads nowhere.
Butyou should offer condolences to the families ofthose kids.
Sure.
I'd like to.
I'd like to offermy condolences.
But Nixon can't.
[Man] Enraged student groups across the country... are calling for a general strike tomorrow... to shut down the entire university system until the Vietnam War is ended.
"[Nixon] Oh, this is nothing compared to Venezuela."
"When I was vice president, Ike sentme down there like a blocking tackle."
They threw rocks.
Broke out the windows.
Almostoverturned the car.
"Read Six Crises, Bob."
"- I did, sir."
"- Boy, Patwas brave."
[Indistinct Chanting]
[Chuckles]
"I'm not an account, honey."
I'm a woman.
[Ticking]
That's right.
Louis Samuels.
Rockville Center.
"[Kojak] When you get home, the officers could keep you outside for a little while."
"And I may have to call you again, ask some more questions."
"Other than that, I'm terribly sorry for what happened."
And thank you very much for putting up with me.
Evacuate his house and the business if anybody's there.
Right.
Rockville Center.
Right.
"Lieutenant, everything's in the works."
[Sportscaster] ... a line drive headed for right field.
Mike Lum is back to the wall.
He can't get it.
It's off the wall.
"Staub rounding first, headed for second."
"Lum gets it back in, and Rusty Staub has a double."
It's 10 of 11:00.
And the Mets are still playin'.
I thought they were playing this afternoon?
"No, it was a twi-night doubleheader."
What time did the first game end?
"I don't know for sure, but it couldn't have ended before 7:00."
"Lieutenant, I just remembered something."
You asked about advertising earlier?
"About a month ago, Mrs. Holder specifically mentioned that her husband worked for some sort of agency."
- Did you hear me?
Good as gold.
"Menu, sir?"
- A lemonade.
- You and your lemonade!
Rubbish!
Have some champagne!
Then you'll see what life's really like!
"Play my favorite song again, boys!"
A round for the orchestra!
When a man's 30 years old
He has life
At his feet
Later his hair grows gray
And he lies flat on his face
What's the point of being 30
And letting money go unspent
Slave away and all the rest
And end up with nothing
No!
We only go around once in life
"We get one chance at girls, schnapps and beer"
"Yes, let life's big moving van come"
"Adieu, Berlin"
We're driving on
To the orchestra!
We'll now announce the prizes for the three most beautiful bathing suits.
"First prize, a set of fine china, goes to Miss Clarissa Gordona."
"Second prize, a crystal bowl, goes to Miss Anni Behnke."
"Third prize, a travel bag, goes to Miss Schulz."
"Mieze, I have something else to tell you."
Watch out for Reinhold!
He's the most dangerous of all.
He just wanted to know when they were coming to Hawaii.
Why?
"Okay, Sofia, Dawkins has this guy Craig right now and he's gonna kill him."
The only way we can prevent that is if you tell us exactly what Dawkins said to you on the phone this morning.
He said something about a big payday.
Then asked me for my car.
Dawkins is driving a 2010 silver Chevy Malibu.
Car's got a vehicle recovery system.
- Can you track it?
No problem.
Ready.
"VIN number's two, niner, whiskey, niner, alpha, alpha, seven, niner, two, eight, one."
Give me 10 minutes.
"Hey, I pulled Dawkins jacket."
You guys gotta see this.
This guy's rasp sheet reads like a grocery list he's checking off.
"In Boston, he's jacking cars."
"In New York, he's robbing ATMs."
Then he graduates to full-on bank robberies in Cleveland.
"Cops there suspected him of murdering his partner, name of Paul Stark."
"Five million dollars they stole together, never found."
- Look familiar?
- That's Craig.
So no wonder he doesn't take Dana.
He doesn't care about her money.
He wants the 5 million he stole with Paul.
Craig.
- Kono?
I got him.
They just parked outside Pacific Rim Bank.
I watched you die.
Heh.
"As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps,"
"I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance."
"Oh, really?"
I'm from Playskool.
And I'm from Mattel.
"Well, I'm not really from Mattel."
I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout.
You'd think they'd never seen a new toy before.
"Well, sure."
Look at him.
He's got more gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.
Please be careful.
You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.
"Hey, a laser!"
"How come you don't have a laser, Woody?"
It's not a laser!
It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.
-What's with him?
-Laser envy.
"All right, that's enough!"
"Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy."
-Toy?
-T-O-Y.
Toy!
"Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is ""Space Ranger."""
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's preschool toys present.
"Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?"
"Mr Lightyear, now, I'm curious."
What does a Space Ranger actually do?
He's not a Space Ranger!
"He doesn't fight evil or, or shoot lasers or fly!"
- It'll look great on you!
It's a real guy-puller.
Do you know how many times I've been fucked in this dress?
Every time I go out:
"Whoa, someone's there."
- Champagne?
"- I just need to get organised, OK?"
Whatever.
I'm going out.
What about the washing up?
This is not a hotel.
Careful you don't start sounding like my mother.
I could have tried harder to find Johan.
"But hey, he was the one who knew where I lived."
(light classical music)
"Obviously, this was just another adventure of his,   and I wasn't crying over him again."
If it could be a bit more...
"Good, hard, honest work can take your mind off anything."
I'd designed the costumes for a small play that was a huge success.
"One night, this French guy was visiting the theatre."
...at the end of Act II I fell down the stairs.
Everyone was laughing.
- This is Pierre Gaultier.
- The top name at the Palais Royale.
"This is Miss Olsen, who plays the captain's first wife."
- How lovely.
- It's an honour to meet you.
- And who is this lovely creature?
"- This is Anna, our costume designer."
- Enchanté.
"- Nice to meet you, too."
Mr. Gaultier is artistic director at the Palais Royale.
That is nothing.
"I broke a chair, and I had a few words with him, that is all."
Don't you feel that you could be in trouble over Somers?
The way you talked about him over the phone to me--
Of course not.
That is not the trouble that worries me.
But you admit you are worried.
Don't make your lawyer's talk with me!
"Axel, have you been able to locate Edie Morrow?"
Who told you about her?
Lisa Pedersen.
Lisa is a snoop!
Listen to me.
This is not how Axel talks about people.
And yelling at his friends.
"That's all right, Axel."
"If you'll just explain the background of all this, perhaps we could help you find Miss Morrow."
If that's the thing that concerns you.
Ja.
"Ja, it is."
"And just one thing you must promise me, Mr. Mason."
"If you do find where Edie is, first tell me, not them."
Mr. Mason?
"Perry, this is Mr. Hadley."
"Sam Hadley, the furniture man."
"Oh, yes."
You were one of the bidders on the Norstaad Shop and trademark.
"- What can I do for you, Mr. Hadley?"
- Plenty.
"I was just talking to Axel on the phone, and he tells me that you're going to resolve this mess that he's got into."
"Are you assuming that now Mr. Somers is dead,"
Axel will sell his trademark to you?
Marybeth?
Two-bars has been here all morning.
He went over the place from top to bottom.
You got to do something about Eddie's pension.
They're going to reduce it.
What about the Police Memorial Award?
The precinct says it goes to the next of kin.
"Well, this piece of brass isn't here to give me any award."
"$40,000 in cash was found in Detective Santos' strongbox here at his summer cottage in Ulster County."
Emergency Service Unit workers...
Frank?
"Yeah, I'm up at the cabin."
They found the money.
Good work.
I'm watching it now.
What is the connection to the deaths of James Bone and Tino Zapatti?
"What was Santos doing with $40,000?"
The mayor understands the implications of the discovery in Ulster County  but would like to stress that these are implications only.
Can you believe this shit?
We never set foot in that dump after Eddie's father died.
- It's full of hornets' nests.
"- Yeah, busy hornets."
"Never in our life did we see $4,000 cash much less 40."
There's only 2 people know that's not Eddie's money.
You and me.
Who is this?
Vinnie Zapatti.
I can get you out of this.
"I can get you the pension, the medals."
You want them?
"Sure, sure, I want them."
Good.
-I probably won't even tell you.
-And you call yourself a friend?
The central computer has assessed our information and has found serious problems.
Planet Earth is heading for catastrophe.
Serious problems...
What do we have to do with it?
That is we have to stay hear and solve them.
"Cursed, fucking job!"
What's their problem?
Everything is in order here.
We described it so nicely for them.
"How it works, how fantastic it is here on Earth."
Unlikely.
"You don't understand it too much, you're a junior substrate, but I know different."
The computer is always right.
"-I'm so glad, Martin."
"-Me too, Yirinka."
Doctor Yansky?
You have been chosen as a representative of the election committee and...
-So Doctor Yansky will be really pleased with that.
-We can't do that to him.
He's such a decent man.
Who do we have next?
A Joseph Vanyerka.
"Excuse me, do you know where Mr. Vanyerka lives?"
Joseph!

"A previously unknown comet appears in space, threatening Earth with impact."
Goes to court tomorrow.
"If you don't give me the name of your source,"
- it's gonna get tossed.
- Bullshit it's gonna get tossed.
I already admitted to you I took part in it.
It's not enough.
Why is that not enough?
You got my word.
We got no corroboration of your word.
What's to say you didn't make up this whole thing when I came in here?
Then go to the goddamn prosecutor
I went to seven years ago.
She's got it all on record.
I thought she didn't pursue this case.
Then you didn't hear me right.
She pursued it.
She just didn't want to see it through.
Ask her if I'm telling the truth.

Chief!
"Pawan, why aren't you in school?"
I'm sick
Sick?
But you don't look like sick
Did your teacher beat you?
I raced a Japanese kid and I won
And the kid was crying
"The teacher blamed me for bullying him, so he beat me"
Can I have another one please?
I'll win the race on the sports day
Those Japanese kids can cry their balls out when they watch me getting awarded
"Chief,"
I hate the Japanese
Chief Mouna?
My grandpa said you were a hero when you were younger
Your grandpa said I was a hero when I was younger?
I'm still a hero.
Does he know that?
"Chief Mouna, will you take me along next time you go hunting?"
"Pawan, where is your hunting ground?"
Chief Mouna!
I'm alright.
"Just a little bit tipsy, that's all"
What the hell?
Hanako!
Look what you have done!
How many times do I have to tell you that you cannot drag these logs along?
I rang the doorbell.
"Didn,t you hear?"
I brought your dinner.
Can I help?
No need.
Sit down.
"The gas will be hooked up tomorrow, so you,II be able to cook for yourselves."
Water.
Wine.
"It,s not working."
Excuse me.
There.
"You,re on TV."
- What will we do tomorrow?
"- You,II see."
"Here,s a mattress."
The bedroom will be ready tomorrow.
This afternoon the model couple moved into their happy new home.
"We,II follow this fascinating experiment closely over the next six months."
"Tonight all of France wonders,"
",Who are you, CIaudine and Jean-MicheI?"
","
"We,II try to answer with a few images."
"CIaudine is 25, a keypunch operator at a maiI-order company."
"She,s Parisian."
"Jean-MicheI is 29, from Thonon-Ies-Bains."
"In middle management at a Iarge marketing firm, he earns 3,220 francs a month."
"He,s dynamic, athletic, conscientious, and likable."
"Married two years, they plan to have their first child in the model Apartment, and they,ve received special leaves of absence for the duration."
"We,II let our couple settle in."
"We,II check in again tomorrow, and throughout the experiment."
"Good night, CIaudine and Jean-MicheI, and good luck!"
"What are you doing, sir?"
If what I want doesn't happen I'll kill both of you
"Shiva, he killed Nitin"
"Yes, I killed him"
"Run, Maya"
"I waited for 2 years for this day, Shiva"
You cannot escape from me
Tell me where you have hidden Nitin
Grab him
"Shiva, don't"
I don't have time
My plan has to succeed
Aiyo!
Must keep this clean
This place looks abandoned
Look at the cobwebs
First check if he is breathing
"No, madam"
I did it for the welfare of the students
"How can you justify a murder, sir?"
Who is he?
He is Sridhar Our school teacher
Who is he?
He is Rangasamy
Correspondent of Alamelu school
What are you doing here?
Came to meet madam
Who is this?
Ravikumar the new teacher
I didn't kill him to get you caught
"Don't spare him, Shiva"
Oh God!

- (Laughing)
- You know the purse I bought in Paris?
- Yeah.
Bill Edward's tonsils.
(Hank) Mommy!
Daddy!
"Daddy, come with us!"
We're gonna see the medicine man.
"- Maybe you can learn something, Daddy."
- l wouldn't be surprised.
Anytime he starts wearing you out - l haven't enjoyed the market so much.
- l never thought of it that way before.
- What?
I'm wearing Johnny Matthews' appendix.
What about the boat trip?
"It took two boys, one girl, and two sets of twins, didn't it?"
And Mrs Morgan's hives.
(Laughing)
- How are the acrobats today?
- Wonderful.
Watch that kid that goes clear to the top there.
- l'll see you later.
- Yes.
All the way home we'll be riding on Herbie Taylor's ulcers.
And Allida Markle's asthma.
Now if we could just get four cases of seven-year-itch we could retire.
"0r if Mrs Yarrow's really gonna have triplets, we could completely redecorate the house."
What would they say if they heard us?
0ne of the reasons I came to a place like Marakesh is so we could say things like that without everybody hearing us.
I'd like to say something where nobody could hear us.
This is the safest place.
"Thank you, friend."
"- Thank you, my boy."
-(chuckles)
- A toast.
-Thank you.
"It just goes to prove, what I've always said, every dog has his day."
Thank you very much.
"Morning, Mr. Marshall."
"Hello, Kramden."
What can I do for you?
"Mr. Marshall, I have a million dollars in here."
Then you must have had a mighty good day on the bus.
Oh-ho!
"Ha, ha, ha!"
Very good!
(chuckles) Very good!
"Well, it's like the men say, Mr. Marshall, you're a good guy."
All the fellas say the same thing:
"they say you're a guy that likes new ideas and a fella that you can come to and get advice, sometimes even financial assistance. (chuckles)"
"Mr. Marshall, I have here a fortune."
"My wife made a whole bowl of this last night, and I scooped some up to bring it over as a sample."
And there it is.
What is it?
An appetizer.
The most delicious you've ever tasted in your life!
- Appetizer?
"-Sure, an appetizer."
People go nuts over appetizers.
"Walk into any supermarket-- all along the shelves, they got jars of appetizers."
But the difference is that this is something new and different.
"That's what the people go for, something new and different."
This is delicious.
"And Lil Wayne be looking at him from the back, he be..."
"""Yeah."
"What you doing on the ground, lil nigga?"""
¶ What you on the ground for ¶
¶ Weezy F baby.
¶ Please say the baby.
¶ Ridin' with your bitch.
¶ Got keys on the lady.
¶ Bitches and strippers.
¶ And strippers and strippers and bitches ¶
¶ Bitches and strippers and money ¶
¶ That's all I talk about.
"""Yeah!"""
"I like Lil Wayne, but we all must concur in this building this evening."
"That man look like a big-ass cricket, don't he?"
It's like he call girls in the club like this.
¶ Come here baby.
¶ I wish I could chirp every girl in the world ¶
¶ Young money yeah
"I'm just saying, man."
"What Wayne has done is he's brought a lot of people together musically, and that's what we need, baby."
'Cause discrimination is the deterioration to our nation.
Huh?
"All I'm saying is you white, I'm Black."
That don't mean we can't sleep together.
It just means the baby gonna look like Barack.
That's all the hell it means.
"If you're Asian, we can make Tiger Woods."
"If you're Spanish, we can make Victor Cruz."

I'm Amy Juergens.
I thought you got married to Ricky Underwood.
"Yeah, I did."
Then how come your name isn't Amy Underwood?
"Well, actually, the name Underwood, either."
It's totally lame.
"Yeah, it's gross."
Amy Underpants.
Who needs that?
Not you.
Not after being a teen mom and everything.
Not that Yurgens is any better.
"Uh, it's ""Juergens."""
"Yeah, but it's really Yurgens."
Amy Yurgens?
"(IN GERMAN ACCENT) Yeah, Yurgens didn't wear underpants and that is how she got pregnant."
(CHUCKLING)
"Hey, maybe I could be friends with you two."
Yeah.
"You know, I've been dying to ask you how you got pregnant."
"You know what sex is, right?"
"Hey, so it looks like your little mentoree made some friends."
Now we don't have to hang out with her.
"Well, that's not very nice."
I thought you said you were sick of hanging out with her.
No.
"Not sick, really."
Just...
"I really think that she should make some friends of her own, some girlfriends, instead of just hanging out with Ethan, her new boyfriend."
"I don't think she should even have a boyfriend, especially Ethan."
You sound like an old married lady.
"And I remind you, you pretty much hung out with Ben the entire time you were pregnant and forgot about Madison and me."
"it gives me pause, Lutie, to see him."
There's such a lot of recklessness under that crazy charm.
There's a danger in him and a kind of violence.
it's hard for me to keep my hands off.
"Sometimes, when he looks at me as we pass and it's never more than a flick of his eye i feel that he must know something and that he must hate me for it."
i understand Sarah Beth graduated last week with high honors.
Sarah Beth Brewton.
Hazel Sawyer.
BRlCE:
They tell me she'ii be home soon.
"i wonder how Sait Fork will seem to her now, after her years of schooling."
BROCK:
"Pardon me, ma'am."
"I'm, uh, looking for a little sawed-off, freckled, ugly runt of a girl."
I'm looking for a handsome young gentleman.
"Well, you found what you're looking for, but how about me;"
You went and changed on us.
"-Oh, Brock."
"-Hello, Sarah Beth."
Where's Papa;
Papa.
Papa.
"Good to see you, Sarah Beth."
"Oh, I might've known you'd be like this, both of you."
-Like what;
"-Oh, good-looking."
"A couple of years do a lot for a young lady, don't they;"
"Well, what did you expect;"
"Of me, I mean."
"Not as much as we got, eh, Brock;"
"Not half. I don't know, though, looks stuck up to me."
-Probably won't like our town anymore.
Wow!
"I couldn't help wondering why, with all the money that Ward Fowler makes, he could owe Claire Daley that much."
And then it hit me.
"What hit you, sir?"
Coffee?
Thank you.
Did you happen to see a show last August that had to do with a man who was being blackmailed by a woman?
"Oh, yes, sir, I did see that show."
Yes.
He shot her.
Exactly.
Why would Claire Daley blackmail Ward Fowler?
And then how?
"That's where I'm gonna need your help, Lieutenant."
"Have you, by any chance, checked with the Toronto police by now?"
"Yes, yes, as a matter of fact, I have."
I thought maybe you had.
And they told you...
They told me that Charles Kipling was an alias.
And that's when you decided to have
Ward Fowler's fingerprints checked with the FBI?
"That is absolutely right, sir."
You're amazing.
"Yes, it turns out that Ward Fowler's real name is not Charles Kipling."
It's John Snelling and you're a...
He's not a Canadian.
He's an American.
And he went to Canada after he deserted during the Korean War.
There you are.
There's your motive.
How would it look if America's favorite detective were known to be a Korean War deserter?
Or hadrt that occurred to you?
"[Taterbug] No, he don't, and you nor nobody else will put that kid in an orphan""s home."
What do you think of that?
"[Jim] Well, what are you going to do with him then?"
"[Taterbug] Well, I would-- well, doggone."
Quit this pen-pushing job and get back to work with self-respecting range-bred fellas ought to be doing.
"[Jim] What've you been up to, Taterbug?"
[Taterbug] Seen in the Abilene Cattleman's Journal calling for cow hands over in the Dusty Bend country.
And I answered it.
And there's a job waiting there for both of us.
"[Jim] But I'd rather be dumb than be an old, fussy fossil..."
You going to eat these chips?
No.
Okay if I...?
Sure.
Thanks.
[Jim] yes.
And you're dead set on the kid being educated?
"That Stoneset Trail Company is no place for a kid to get his schooling', is it?"
"Besides, I'm tickled to death right where I am."
"[Taterbug] Yes, you are."
"Say, old time, will you watch the office for a little while?"
I want to run out and throw him a little hay at darts.
"[Taterbug] Well, at least he's got horse sense."
That's more than you've got.
"[Jim] All right, crab."

Balls.
"Hashtag, balls."
"Hashtag, balls."
"I don't know if it's time for self promotion, but, uh... the EP is out right now on SoundCloud, did you--"
"That's why, look, I like lyricists."
"That's why, in my spare time, I watch battle rap."
"Oh, yeah?"
Since when?
"Well, since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia."
All those things they taught me at Harvard.
"Mrs. MacNeil, since the day I joined the Jesuits I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism."
Not one.
"Yeah, well it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed."
And needs an exorcist.
"Father Karras, it's my little girl."
Then that's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Why?
I don't understand.
"-To begin with, it could make things worse."
"-Oh, how?"
"Secondly, the Church, before it approves an exorcism conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted."
That takes time.
"-Yeah, but--"
"-Meanwhile, your daughter--"
-You could do it yourself.
-No.
I'd need Church approval...
-...and that's rarely given.
-But-- Uh....
-Could you see her?
"-Yes, I could."
"I could see her as a psychiatrist, but I--"
"Oh, not a psychiatrist."
She needs a priest.
"She's seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world, and they sent me to you."
Now are you gonna send me back to them?
"-Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?"
-You don't understand--
"Well, yeah, but she looked so beautiful in it."
She wore it in front of you?
"Of course, but you're missing the point."
"Grandma was so happy, and I was happy because she was happy."
I don't understand why you didn't keep shopping until you found dresses in both your sizes.
"No, no, no, no, no."
I was happy because she--
But isn't that the point of mother-daughter dresses--
To get the same dress?
"Yeah, but--"
Gosh.
Who knew grandma was so selfish?
I am so glad you're my mom and not her.
"Okay, I'm done."
There's no way I'm telling her.
So I stayed in the play and just... (Clinking)
Fudged the truth a little bit.
(Frankie) Wow.
Busy night.
"I've gotta go to the bank and the cleaners, and I should probably go to the drug store, 'cause I've had this headache for, like, five days."
"It's not a throbbing, like, ""wah-wah"" headache, you know."
"It's more of a dull, constant ""eh,"""
"so I'll probably be gone 2 hours, 45 minutes."
Hey!
It's Brick's Uncle.
"I'm here for, uh, grandparents and special friends day."
You've gotta be kidding me.
"Uh, th-that was last week."
Th-they're taking a test.
Now is really not the best time.
"Oh, no, it's not the best time for me at all, but I'm here, so how does this work?"
"What, do they, uh, sing me a song, give me a cupcake or somethin'?"
I'll reimburse you at first opportunity

"Go, start digging!"
"--Dig where, Pavel Ivanovich?"
--Dig dirt on me.
Maybe you'll find some.
How long have you been working on these?
About a year.
Can you show these to your friend at Gotham Comics?
I can... but I'm not going to.
But you just said they were good.
"So is ""The Hulk,"" but I don't have to like it."
"Your drawings are technically fine, but it just shows that you can copy well, and they've got no soul."
"I've known you for two years, we've had a hundred conversations-- about comics."
"You are a passionate dude with deep ideas, so I'm looking at this and thinking, ""ls this all you've got to say?"""
Aliens from Jupiter want to enslave the women of the Earth?
Yep!
You dumb motheftucker.
"Cans go in the blue, green is for paper."
- What's going on?
- I ain't touching those hands.
How did it go this morning?
"David totally dug my shit, man."
He might send something over to Gotham Comics.
That's excellent.
Check it out.
It's the Brunswick Monster.
- How much did you pay for that?
- What does it matter?
I predict this ball is gonna add 15 points to my game.
Friend:
Now all I got to do is get to Vegas.
Vegas?
"The Amateur World Classic is next month, it costs 3,000 to enter, but get this... the purse is a hundred grand."
"I don't know, Mick..."
three grand?
Aw...
"Gracias, mi amor."
"Stop joking about this, please."
"For most people, Fantômas is nothing but make-believe."
Nobody was able to put a name on the man behind the mask.
I have the feeling you forget the death of
Juve in his last battle against Fantômas.
It is true that our famous Police officer was horribly killed.
Buried beneath Lady Beltham's hotel.
Yes.
A dirty death...
but it will perhaps have been useful.
Useful?
How?
Because it proves the existence Fantômas.
Because it forced him to disappear.
"Curiously, it is in dying that Juve has kept Fantômas from doing harm."
So what do we do with Baroness de Vibray?
"Could we not suggest that Dollon was heir to his will, or something like that?"
"Hello, yes?"
Yes.
"It's for you, Fandor."
Thank you.
Yes?
Jacques Dollon just hung himself in his cell.
Thank you for calling So the murderer hanged himself?
"My little Fandor, the murderer is innocent."
"What are you talking about, Arsène?"
We just brought a letter with the name of the Baroness de Vibray on the back.
I read it discretly before bringing it to the procurator.
I copied it.
"""Mr Procurator."
The Barbey and Nanteuil bankers made it clear that I'm completely ruined.
I have no family.
Frank Lloyd Wright was too cantankerous to love.
Mies van der Rohe wasn't you couldn't talk to him at all.
Corbusier was mean.
"But Lou, now, there was a man."
"All my buildings don't add up to what his three or four buildings, because he, when he did get a client-- however he ever got any clients is a mystery, because artists don't get jobs."
"Every time I've tried to do art,"
I've ended up with a-- make much less.
"Nothing to be ashamed of, naturally."
I do it the other way.
I do it by numbers and-- and public fame and all that.
But Lou did it by being an artist.
"He'd sit and work on art , see?"
And I always wished-- I think he did too;
"wished he knew me better, and I always wished I knew him better."
(Kahn) Why?
"(Johnson) Well, you know, there's some things that don't go into words."
"It's animal attraction-- his mind, really, because his person-- to look at him wasn't much a pleasure."
(Kahn) It wasn't?
(Johnson) It couldn't be.
"See, he was so scarred."
"Funny, he never talked to me as directly as he should have."
Who?
Lou.
"He never came here, though?"
Didn't he ever come here?
To the glass house?
"That's strange, cause I built it in'49."
Possible.
Possible.
Do you think Lou would have liked this house?
No.
Why?
- Right in back of us.
- What?
- Yes.
- Here.
They were staring at us in front of the hotel too.
"Jo, will you please stop imagining things."
(Whispering) I'm not.
Good evening.
You must think me awfully rude.
I've been staring at you since I saw you at the hotel.
"- You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway?"
"- Yes, I am."
I knew I was right.
"I'm Lucy Drayton, and this is my husband."
- How do you do?
- We're Dr and Mrs McKenna.
My wife tells me Mrs McKenna appeared at the London Palladium.
We hardly ever see a show now.
Edward is such an old stick-in-the-mud so I have to console myself with your records.
I must admit I love em.
I'm not one for this terrible be-bop.
- Thank you very much.
- When are you coming back to London?
"- Possibly never again, professionally."
- 0h.
- Don't say you're giving up the stage.
"- Well, temporarily I am."
"It's just that I'm a doctor, and a doctor's wife never has much time."
"What my husband is trying to say is Broadway musical shows are not produced in Indianapolis, Indiana."
We could live in New York. I hear that doctors aren't starving there either.
It's not that I have any objection to working in New York.
It's just that it'd be hard for my patients to come from Indianapolis for treatment.
Get me an interpreter.
I want to make sure she wants to stay.
If she does?
I'll see what I can do.
I'm looking for Joe nassurn.
My name is James mooney.
I work for legal services of Pittsburgh.
Does Joe nassurn live here?
Do you expect him back?
"If you see him, tell him that his niece kalaya is at the allegheny children's shelter, and to call me right away."
Jeremy.
What's up?
Where's your mom?
She's in with your dad.
You're stuck here till they're through?
My mom is into us having some time together.
Wants to take me shopping.
"The kleiner automotive group doubled their sales to $58 million in the 4 years following the highly visible angry penguin ad campaign,"
"Liz hetherington has won the atta-- the manno and every regional and national advertising award in print, television, and radio."
I tried to buy Liz's company a year ago.
What's different now?
Right.
"Well, she's been very impressed with the growth of your company over the past year and sees this as a, uh..."
Strong synergistic opportunity.
Let's get some numbers going.
Great.
"Mr. mooney, right?"
Right.
"I'm Joe nassurn, kalaya's Uncle."
But earlier you--
I didn't know who you were.
I had to check you out.
Whoever doesn't think before talking will surely accept their punishment
I fell asleep.
How long did I sleep?
Plenty of time.
I didn't want to wake you up
What are the noises?
I have no idea
"Look, they are nicely shaped"
That's right
Attention
"İbrahim, these..."
These sculptures are the gift of his Majesty for me
Don't you like them?
"No, not that"
But what will my mother think about them?
"My Sultana, if you allow me I'd like to introduce someone to you"
Who?
Malkochoğlu
It is a great honor to meet you
"I wanted you to meet to Malkoçoğlu Bali Bey, my Sultana"
"He's a very brave, valuable Bey"
He brought the sculptures to here
So that's you
I heard nice things about you
How are you?
"We are praying for your health, my Sultana"
"Daye, keep an eye on Hatice"

Iwon't get to see her frequently
I charged Nigar.
She'll always be there

This is my little room in the house.
Isn't that just the creepiest thing ever?
"For the first few nights I was here, I came in every night and I opened the door and I was like, ""Jesus."""
"I thought there was somebody in my room, but it was just me."
"""Oh, it's just me again."""
I'm pretty sure this is the only job that I wasn't sacked from.
"If there's any customers around any nice-Iooking ladies, I just pop out a few piano skills."
"And just try and impress while in my glamorous Toys "" R"" Us uniform."

"We were just messengered the photos from the shooting... including the Polaroids of you and Paul, they are adorable!"
I'm just dissapointed that Paul missed my cue.
I gotta get the guy out of my head.
- I need some mental floss.
"- Sweetie, take a thought shower."
The important is that Editor Chief knows your triumph...
- and put you on staff.
- I guess...
You're going with me to pick up stationery from the colleaguer.
I've got to get this down to the messenger center by 6.
I'm totally going.
I'll just do a quick e-mail and we're off.
"We'll go to ""II Cantenore"" and... and celebrate the end of your life as an intern slash slave."
"Hold on, I got another call waiting..."
"- Cornelia, have you seen Jocelyn?"
- Who is Jocelyn?
Pink!
The beauty is that he got a bony campaign with Calvin Klein...
- She was swallowing everything...
"- I'm sorry, have you seen Jocelyn?"
- The intern?
Absolutely not!
- Thank you.
"Jocelyn, I hear you got to do the Las Vegas shoot... com Roxanne."
Am I green or what?
"Oh, yeah!"
I'm so excited.
I see Resin found herself a new boyfriend.
Get a room!
- What about Paul?
- He's over Sabrina's heels.
"Because when I go, I go."
JIMMY GUFFAWS
The little mashed potato monster's on his case.
"OK, Paul, I can tell you Anthony Joshua is not on our list."
THEY SIGH
But Joshua won his big fight against Vladimir Klitschko at Wembley.
"But the weird thing was, no-one seemed to know what the fight was about."
"Normally a girl, innit?"
"OK, all right."
"Fingers on buzzers, one more to go."
"OK, what do you think?"
David Beckham.
"David Beckham, what, you think he's very popular?"
"Well, everyone loves him."
He's getting more and more handsome by the day.
It's like a disease he's got.
"You've been cured, I see!"
Yeah...
"You knock 'em up, I'll hit it..."
I mean...
Aw.
You're a very handsome man.
"No-one's denying it, they're just reassuring you."
"Let's have a look at David Beckham talking about his tattoos, in this enlightening clip from 2000."
"What is this, David?"
It's a new tattoo I'm thinking about having.
I wanted a new tattoo for ages but I just couldn't... not think.
"I've known what I've wanted because I wanted something to do with Victoria, Victoria's name."
And I think it'd look...
"We've both agreed it'd look a bit tacky if I had ""Victoria"", just in English, down there."
So I've gone for Arabic.
Why?
Do you think you have any enemies on the city council?
"Well, there is that rich jerk, Roger Frank, who hates me and wants to destroy me."
"Wait, you don't think he turned the council against me?"
"It did seem weird that you were impeached just days after you were fired, so I called your old company, and it turns out they just signed a new, huge client-- Dustybear Financial."
Guess who owns Dustybear Financial.
Roger Frank?
!
He's behind every bad thing that's happened to me!
"Well, except for Bobby leaving."
"Well, it may be a coincidence, but you know that golf club in Georgia that hired Bobby?"
Guess who their wealthiest member is.

Thanks to our Paşa
May god bless you.
Long live our Paşa
Shame on all of you
Are you renting your tongue for a few coins?
I've been all over town and I've seen it all day.
I was cooking dinner that night.
I had to start braising the beef and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with gravy roasted peppers string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets that were cut just right that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.
So I was home for about an hour.
My plan was to start dinner early so I could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want.
Then get the package for Lois to take to Atlanta later that night.
I kept looking out the window and saw that the helicopter was gone.
"Michael, keep an eye on the sauce."
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.
"I asked my brother to watch the sauce, and Karen and I started out."
"Oh, God. I see it."
"-Look, it's right there."
-Damn!
"Yep, that's it."
We gotta get to your mother's.
"See, I told you."
It's funny.
-lt's not the end of the world.
-We're going to your mother's.
Tell your mother not to touch anything outside of the house.
Nothing.
Couldn'tve gone to your mother's house?
You had to come here.

"London's late, the army's broke, and we owe the lads two months' wages."

"- Do without, sir."
"You borrow, Richard."
From a bank.
Our banker is Nathan Rothschild of London.
Nathan's brother James runs a banking service from Viennna to Lisbon under Boney's nose
"Ten weeks ago,"
James set out from Vienna with the bank draft.
"He was to travel across France, across the Pyrénées, and into Spain and make a rendezvous at a place called Casa Antigua."
James Rothschild never turned up.
- But...
- Don't!
Don't tell me James is a banker travelling across a country at war.
James is no clerk.
He's done this before.

"Episode 1x12 ""The great Cappie"""
Transcript:
"Kasius, Allysiah, HorcKs, AkaZab,"
Here you are.
I guess we should talk strategy.
"You, don't worry."
"This afternoon, I'm gonna pick up a ton of copies of TGG."
In the blink of an eye...
"Mrs. Collins, you have a call on our house phone."
It sounded urgent.
..the wife of a US Senator vanished...
She have any enemies?
She teaches second grade.
You have any enemies?
But before they can find out where she is...
- She's gone missing before.
- Twelve years ago.
"Not only did Sara disappear, but the story did, too."
..they left to find out who she is.
Her name's Nicki Johnson.
12 years ago I asked her to marry me.
I never saw her again.
"Now, the mystery is just beginning to unravel"
It's Jessica.
- Your ex-wife ?
- I don't understand.
They've never met before.
"Jessica Nevins, the Senator's ex-wife is considered a person of interest and investigators are attempting to locate her."
"Daddy, what is it?"
What aren't you telling me?
It's Amanda McNeal.
The wife of Curtis McNeal.
He was the mayor of Atlanta.
"Killed back then, kept on ice until now?"
It's a prayer card.
"24 hours ago, Sara Collins, wife of Senator Jeffrey Collins, vanished."
"We're here at the home of Senator Jeffrey Collins, who is about to issue his first public statement since his wife's disappearance."
I'm concerned about Judy Nash and her allegations of marital difficulties.
She's fishing.
Notan operation so much as an organic phenomenon.
It grew.
Itchanged shape.
It developed appetites.
It's not unusual in such cases... thatthings are not committed to paper.
Thatcould be very embarrassing.
I sawto itthatmy name was never connected with any ofthese operations.
- Dien.
- [Gunfire]
- Trujillo.
- [Birds Chirping]
Lumumba.
Guatemala.
Iran.
Cuba.
"It's a shame you didn'ttake similar precautions, Dick."
I'm interested in those documents that put your people... togetherwith the gangster elements.
- I'll hold the documents.
"- Kennedy threatened to smash the C.I.A., into a thousand pieces."
You could do the same.
I'm notJack Kennedy.
"Uh, your agency is secure."
Not if I give you all the cards.
[Sighs]
I promised the American people peace with honor in SoutheastAsia.
"Now, thatmay take time."
"Two, maybe three years."
"But, in the meantime, your agencywill continue... atcurrent levels offunding."
Current levels may not be sufficient.
"Well, the president will support... a reasonable request for an increase."
And me?
"Of course, you will continue as D.C.I., Dick."
It's the parenting.
That's what the hell it is.
"Now, parenting, now I'm not gonna get cliché like every other Black comedian, get on this stage and say you should whup your kids."
"'Cause honestly, I got whipped, and I'm halfway retarded, okay?"
But what you should--
And whupping your kids is not really a good thing to do right now.
Look at Adrian Peterson.
Now what did he really do?
"Okay, he hit his son with a switch."
That's it?
'Cause my mom hit me with... anything she could find.
One time she fucked me up with a Ninja Turtles umbrella.
I couldn't even watch the series anymore.
"Every time the theme music came on,"
I just started having a breakdown and shit.
It'd be...
¶ Teenage Mutant--
"I'd be, ""Ahhh!"""
"And you know, I was a little mischievous when I was a little kid."
"Okay, you know, my pop got me too."
"You know, he in here."
He got me.
"He got me, man."
This one time he beat me in front of the church with drumsticks.
And he was the drummer.
It wasn't even a whipping for him.
It was practice.
"As soon as he was done, he just got back on the stand and just kept doing the same shit just like this here."
"I said, ""You learned that here first."""
"""I'm gonna need some royalties for that shit, you know what I'm saying?"""
It's all good.
"I love my pop, man."
Angela´s mother and I went out last year. lt´s over.
"And when it ended, she never told me she was pregnant."
"She calls a month ago and tells me she has a baby and that I´m the father, and that she´s in trouble and she can´t handle it."
I was afraid to let people find out.
I was afraid it was gonna mess us up.
- But you told Chloe.
- Chloe and my sister have been helping me.
She´s a good friend.
Excuse me.
"Chase, you wanted me to let you know when Angela woke up."
- Thank you.
- Sure.
"Kim, I´m just as confused as you are."
"But all I know is that I love you, and I´m falling in love with Angela, too, and I need to make this work."
Go on.
Hey.
- What´s happening with Nina?
- They´re getting something.
The connection between Alvers and Nina might be deep.
You better hope she´s not spinning your wheels cos she can manipulate our protocol.
- Tony knows what he´s doing.
- Fine.
I need to get together with Chloe.
I need everything she´s got on Amador.
- Not yet.
"- Ryan, you´re wasting my time."
I humoured you with the physical.
"We both know there´ll be trace amounts of opiates, but enough is enough."
Rae Plachecki from the inspector general´s office is here to talk to you.
- This is not the time.
"- Actually, it is."
"You´ll talk to her, then we´ll evaluate whether you can go back to work or not."
"They're justsoft, chicken-shit faggots."
They don't have the long-term vision anymore.
They justwantto covertheir ass and meet girls and tear each other down.
"Oh, God, this country's in deep, deep, deep trouble, Buddy."
"I have to see this through, you know."
Motherwould have expected no less of me.
"I'm sorry, Buddy."
"I justwish you knew how much I love you, that's all."
"Ittook me a long time to fall in love with you, Dick, but I did."
And it doesn't make you happy.
- You want them to love you.
"- No, I don't."
I'm notJack Kennedy.
"They neverwill, Dick."
"No matter howmany elections you win, they neverwill."
[Murmuring]
"Gentlemen, the president."
"All right, gentlemen."
This is our last damn leak.
It's no way to run a goddamn government.
We're going to prosecute the hell outof Ellsberg and any else who wants to leak.
"And, uh, that means anyone ofyou here who crosses the line,"
"I'm personally going afterthem, okay?"
The permissiveness ofthis year is over.
The belts are coming off and people are going to go to the woodshed.
'Cause the governmentcannotsurvive with a counter-government inside it.
I know howtraitors operate.
I've dealtwith them all ofmy life.
It's neverthe little people.
Little people do not leak.
"It's always some, uh, smooth son ofa bitch like Ellsberg."
"You know, the Harvard Hebrew boys... who leak."
- Where´s Richards?
- He´s waiting.
Let´s bring him in.
(Michelle) Send Darren in.
"Nina, I don´t think you´ve met Darren Richards."
He joined us after you left.
"Hello, Darren."
Don´t take it personally.
He doesn´t talk much.
"(Rae) Something´s not connecting up for me, Jack."
"You weren´t in with the Salazars until early February, but the first time you started using was late December."
That´s six weeks of shooting up for the benefit of no one.
Am I missing something?
I was trying to pass as ajunkie.
I wanted to be prepared.
"- What do you mean, prepared?"
- The Salazars lived in the drug world.
"If I couldn´t handle the narcotics, they´d have known I was a cop and killed me."
- l needed to be able to handle it.
- That makes sense.
"But in January, when you were injecting, you didn´t have a meeting on the books."
- lt could have been a year for all you knew.
- What are you saying?
I am trying to establish evidence that you did drugs as part of your cover.
"If I submit this, it´s not gonna hold up."
What do you want me to say?
!
I did drugs to get in with these people and I got in with them!
"No matter how difficult it´s been, I don´t use any more."
"Look, I´ll write it up that way and maybe it´ll fly, but I think you´ll have a problem because you never told anyone, not even your partner."
That´s suspicious.
"Rae, you know my history."
Everyone finished?
Can you believe Kenbo's learning to write?
He's smart and good looking
Good bye
See you tomorrow
Clinic
Isn't he going to inherit the martial arts academy?
"Yes, his father was a grand fencing master"
A samurai teaching kids to write...
It's not right
You... should investigate
He may be have ties to Kira
I warned you about this
"Even scattered, it's risk y with too many of us in town"
"All right Not to worry, it's nothing"
Though I can't heal much more than this
"Soza san, is this the first time you've met Kichiemon?"
Yes
I'm Kichiemon
I'm Aoki Soza-emon
"Soza san has come from up north, to avenge his father"
I see
"Revenge, huh..."
"It's been over two and a half years now, with no leads..."
"Two and a half years, I'm sorry"
But why here?
Any special reason?
These places often shelter strangers
A good place to seek my enemy...
Strangers?
"Master Aoki, what do you do for fun?"
Fun?
... arepowerlessto stopit.
Imagine what that must be like...
... havingtostandthere and watch this grievous harm...
... bedoneto yourlovedones .
And you're powerless to stop it.
I would kill that man.
You.
You would kill that man.
But Obediah Jackson could not kill that man.
Not until 20 years later.
When Obediah Jackson saw Jonah Catchings again...
... herememberedall that he had suffered...
... athisvicioushand and once again felt the sting...
... ofMr.Catchings'abuse.
Can any of you declare you would have acted any differently?
I believe the answer is no.
"If ever any man deserved to die, Jonah Catchings was that man."
For all that he imposed on Obediah and his family...
"... doubtlesslyonmany, many others."
And just as surely...
... IbelieveObediahJackson deserves to live.
I believe that...
... asstronglyas Ibelieve in God's eternal love.
"When you pass judgment on this man, Your Honor..."

"Josiah, you silver-tongued devil."
These are photographs of Patton's Allied invasion force in East Anglia.
The Germans think there are only two possible places for an Allied invasion of Europe.
And they're right.
"From East Anglia here to the Pas-de-Calais, or from the south coast of England to the beaches of Normandy."
Operation Overlord has decided on Normandy.
Then what is General Patton's army doing in East Anglia?
There is no army.
These planes are made out of plywood.
We did it to fool the Germans.
The man who took those photographs knows it.
"Consequently, he must also know that we intend to invade Normandy."
"Find him, Godliman."
It could cost us the bloody war.
"Well, sir, if you were at this station and wanted to get out of the country, you could go to Holyhead or Liverpool or Glasgow and then catch a ferry to Ireland."
He wouldn't risk Holyhead because of the passport control.
How about Liverpool to Belfast?
A car across Ireland and a U-boat on the coast.
You're talking about our 11.45 Marylebone to Inverness.
"stopping at Stafford, Crewe, Liverpool..."
Liverpool.
That's where he'll get off.
You're right.
- The 11.45 left on time.
- How do we get on it?
- You could stop the train...
- Yes.
Get us a plane.
"- Yes, sir."
"- Come on, Billy."
"- Fancy a game of poker, mate?"
- Why not?
We're stopping again.

I had a marriage proposal
Did you like the groom?
When we gave snacks They asked for liquour

My dad smacked and they ran away
Why did you inform him?
We didn't inform
-Kanmani  Senthil informed them
-Fortunately nothing happened to MLA
-Else it could have been a big problem
-MLA died

"Yesterday afternoon, our European sections intercepted a..."
a German communiqué that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.
"-Now, to Cairo..."
"-See, over the last two years, the Nazis have had teams of archaeologists running around the world looking for all kinds of religious artifacts."
Hitler's a nut on the subject.
He's crazy.
He's obsessed with the occult.
"And, right now, apparently, there's some kind of German archaeological dig going on in the desert outside of Cairo."
"Now, we've got some information here, but we can't make anything out of it, and maybe you can."
"""Tanis development proceeding."
"""Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra."
"Abner Ravenwood, U.S."""
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.
"Just what does that mean to you, uh, Tanis?"
"Well, it.."
The city of Tanis is one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark.
The Lost Ark?
"Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant."
The chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments.
"What do you mean, ""commandments""?"
You talking about the Ten Commandments?
"Yes, the actual Ten Commandments."
"The original stone tablets that Moses brought down out of Mount Horeb and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing."
Any of you guys ever go to Sunday school?
"Well, I..."
"Oh, look."
The Hebrews took the broken pieces and put them in the Ark.
"When they settled in Canaan, they put the Ark in a place called the Temple of Solomon."
In Jerusalem.
Where it stayed for many years.
"Until, all of a sudden, whoosh, it's gone."

Maybe Shiv has finished him with his power
"""Till I am sacred, nobody can harm my husband in anyway."""
"""Fighting continuously with Lord Shiv, when Jalandhar became..."""
"""...weak  tired, it was natural for him to get worried."""
Shri Hari was also serious and worried by Ma Parvati's queries.
Mother Lakshmi asked him the reason of his worry.
"""Swami, what is your worry?"
"-Devi Parvati has put me..."""
"""...in a religious dilemma?"
"-What is that, Swami?"""
"""Don't ask me, it is better to keep quiet now, you will learn..."""
"""...everything when the time comes, Devi?"""
Please tell me what is your dilemma?
-Don't be stubborn.
"""l am only requesting you, Swami."
"-Don't do that also."""

Watanabe-chan good work here what's that?
this is a calming cactus and it matches mine matching?
"Shing Kwun, you've never thought that I'll be here to avenge my foster father's death"
He still has the energy to use the Shadow Finger!
How?
You've never dreamt that
I could unblock my pressure points at the last moment
"Let me tell you, I've been practising hard in the past 30 years to beat and overcome all your techniques"
I've studied them all very carefully and know how to open up the pressure points
I see that this is the end of the Ming Cult
"Chang wu Ji, I failed to kill you 1 3 years ago but today"
I'll kill you with my Shadow Finger
Only Jiu Yang kung fu can tackle it
It's a pity Jiu Yang kung fu has been lost for century
I think you'd better accept your death
"But before you die you will see one big incident in the martial art world and that is my palm strike killing the 7 devils wait, if you want to kill them you have to have my permission why?"
I haven't been wounded by your Shadow Finger
You've practised Jiu Yang kung fu
Yes I did long ago
Don't run
"Shing Kwun, don't run"
Shing Kwun... where's he?

Come...
Let's go
These two hiding in burrow and trunk... are the villainous pair
"They, the River Dragon, Fire Demon Lui, ...and Golden Demon are Man Tiankuei's henchmen"
They are so-called Five great fighters
Golden Demon has been killed by me;
But Lui's fire bomb is the most difficult to deal with
After you met with hero Tseng... did you run into him?
The seven of us escaped to a village and ran into hero Tseng and his men
We were about to tell... hero Tseng what had happened... when Lui and Golden Demon came with their men
Hero Tseng
"Brother Gau, just the few of you?"
Where are all the others?
They were all killed
Somebody's here
Could it be...
Retreat...
We had been taken to jail and... following day sent over to the execution ground
They were all killed one by one
I never even dreamt that...
I could escape
They were all killed
That means... so many heroes have sacrificed their lives but still don't know where Prince Kang is confined
Not really.
"Like, uh, Teddy Roosevelt, T.R., rushing up SanJuan Hill."
"Small event, but dramatic."
People took notice.
"Yes, well, they'll take notice, all right."

"I mean, you see these bums, you know, blowing up the campuses, burning books and so forth."
"And they call themselves, uh, flower children."
I call them spoiled rotten.
"Yeah, I mean..."
- Come look at it?
"I don't know what that is, but an archeologist might."
"To me, that is absolutely man-made and, um, obviously old."
"Yeah, I agree."
I totally agree.
"We should, we should get an opinion."
"Becausethisso-called""hatch"""

MartyandRick's decision to bring in anarchaeologistto examineit is a prudent one.
We're not done here;
"we-we need to figure out what's going on, but, Jack, for right now, you're done-- nice job."
Canada has certain requirements for archaeological excavations.
"Thishatchcouldbe significant, archaeologically, so we want to follow the rules, so we bring in an expert."
We're not sure what this thing is.
"So,that'sonereason to make sure we'redoingtheproperthing."

That was not a pleasant job and you did a nice job.

How long has Jazz Fest been going?
Do you know?
"I think it was, like... 1969 was the first Jazz Fest."
Jazz Fest was supposed to happen originally in the 1960s.
"And George Wein, who produced the Newport Jazz Festival and Folk Festival, civic leaders in New Orleans brought him down saying, ""We want you to do that here in New Orleans for..."" You know."
"And he came down, he's like, ""Can't do it."""
I've wanted to do a festival in New Orleans for many years.
It was very difficult in the early days 'cause it was before the Civil Rights bill was passed in 1964.
I came down there as early as 1962 and tried to get them to understand that they couldn't do a festival with the laws they had on the books.
"He's like, you know, ""Until these hotels will allow Duke Ellington and Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie to stay in their rooms and eat in these restaurants, it's not gonna happen."""
"It took, you know, 10 years before the city became completely integrated."
Have you been to every one of 'em?
Almost all of 'em.
How many times have you been to Jazz Fest?
Every year.
- Of your life?
- Yeah.
"First time I played Jazz Fest,"
I think I was four years old.
The horn was taller than me.
I've been knowing him since he was that tall.
His name is Trombone Shorty 'cause he's been playing it since the trombone was taller than him.
We used to hustle in Jackson Square for tips.
We just wanted him to stand there with the trombone.
"Because it was so cute, people would tip us out."
"And then he actually started to, like, learn how to play, you know?"
I remember my mom telling me the story...
Bo Diddley was on the stage and I was playing the parade part.
All I could do was play one loud note...
"""Blamp!"" I was playing that note, and my mom was like,"
"""Shh!"
"You're gonna get us put out of here."""
That is why I am asking you to marry me
But you don't listen at all
Don't kid with me
I am not going to get married
I may love someone
Don't spoil your life with love affairs
-I won't be taken for a ride
-Listen to me

Mayshe have the Midas touch.
She also said that she'll have fouintains and baths built.
Look for a place for them
Did she ask it from you?
Exactly to me in person.
In person!
She told me to analyse the neighborhoods and find places
"My Sultanas are very pleased of my services, mashallah"
"Oh gosh Mashallah, Inshallah"
Amen.

Dreams I know can never come true
Seems as though I'll ever be blue
"Who, means my happiness"
"Who, would I answer yes to"
"Well, you ought to guess who"
No one but you
"By 1946, Judy was one of the studio's most valuable assets and made a special guest appearance as Marilyn Miller in the Jerome Kern biography, Till the Clouds Roll By."
"March on, little doagies"
"March on, down the trail"
One of Judy's biggest hits was The Harvey Girls.
"The film was so big, in fact that there wasn't time for this extraordinary production number in the final film."
"Here are Judy, Ray Bolger, Cyd Charisse, and a cast of hundreds in a never-before-seen ""March of the Doagies. """
We don't know where we're goin'
But we're on our way
"March on, little doagies"
"March on, down the trail"
"March on, little doagies"
Till we're past the last fence rail
Belittle me!
What are you talking about?
For my self-made disconnect from those who wanted nothing from me but to further their own petty feelings of self-delusion.
Then you reinforce the degree to which I saved myself from future disappointment by cutting myself off to the extent that I did!
Do you hear yourself?

"And of course, the frustrating thing is to want to focus your energies on something that, well, at this point in my life, should be something of an opus."
A culmination.
Right
Could we swap seats?
I don't feel right sitting here.
I'd rather not sit in a pupil's chair in my own office.
"We can both sit over there, or we can both stand."
(SIGHS)
I've had years of this shit.
How long did yours take?
Something like two years apiece.
"Oh, God, I used to be faster than that."
"Two years would be humiliating for me... (CHUCKLES) Well, for anyone."
"I didn't mean it like that, but you get the idea."
(EXHALES) This could be so big for me.
"Instead, I'm suffering here."
More than you could know or I could possibly explain.
I just don't see anything clearly.
I'm trying to do my best here.
Hello
How's the training?
"Boss, it's great, don't worry"
Boss...
"Good, any problems?"
"Very good, he'll surely win"
Boss' car was passing by and he insisted on coming up to see you
He has also brought you some chicken essence
Keep it
"Alright, I'm leaving, I've to go for a meeting I'll see you out"
"Don't work too hard, understand?"
What's the current situation?
"One to four, that Kong Yuen Sang will lose lf they had not known he's practising real hard the stakes would be 8 times higher"
He'll definitely lose
"One to six, get them all"
Alright
Asia Pacific World Free Fighting Champion final round will now begin
"The winner of this match will win $40,000 and will represent the Asia-Pacific region to fight for the final Championship to be held in New York"
When match begins Kong Yuen Sang starts his attack
A right hook
Ah Mut Sha is unable to retaliate
"Ah Mut Sha is now retaliating, right fist  a left kick"
Ah Mut Sha is pressed down by Kong Yuen Sang
Ah Mut Sha can't do anything but to hold Kong
The referee is separating them but Kong wants to continue with the fight
The experts here tonight are the Champion of two successive years
"Ah Mut Sha, nicknamed Crocodile King who is very experienced and fights fiercely"
"His challenger is... a Chinese-Thai, Kong Yuen Sang"
He is a rising star in Hong Kong
The two of them are still fighting and have not been able to get the better of each other
A right hook
A testing straight punch
Let's just have a drink.
Alright.
I'll be back.
- Slow.
- Yes.
- Slow.
- Yes.
What are you doing?
We can drink with our clothes off.
At least our tops.
Let's do it when it feels right.
It feels right to me.
"Okay, then I'll show..."
I'll show you up to here... so can't we just stay like this and just talk?
No!
You've changed all of a sudden.
Humans are like that.
Then undress up to there at least.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Why are you undressing?
Let's just do it once.
Do what?!
Just once...
Come this way.
Look.
- This is funny.
Really!
- Let's just do it once.
Look.
Can you buy some more liquor?
We've drunk all.
"You, don't tickle me!"
Don't tickle me!
Don't tickle me!
I'm going to kill you.
I have to start from the toe...
"This won't do, you make me laugh."
Put on a serious expression!
Serious!
I bought some!
This way.
Oh!
They're made in China.
I can't trust them.
They're okay.
"If you're nervous, I'll use two."
I don't use any Chinese products even at home.
- Wait!
- Now what?
The buttons can't get ripped.
Wait.
Let me catch my breath.
I'm breathing so hard I think I'm going to suffocate.
You're really nervous.
Can't we just have a drink?
You want me to go buy some?
We can have it delivered.
No.
I'll go buy some.
Delivery's expensive!
Just have it delivered.
No.
I'll just go out and get some..
- 30 minutes?
We can get there before he arrives.
How can we get there in 30 minutes?
Don worry.
"Oh, just leave it."
It won't explode.
- It probably will.
- Really?!
"Oh, no."
Why is it so loud.
Who is it..
What the hell?
What's he doing here...
How?
- Don't open the door!
"Hey, why is he here?"
- He happened to call I told him you're here.
- Go home and fight it out!
- Crazy bitch.
Hurry up and leave.
Do you know how many days you've been here already?
- My husband told me to send you home.
- Crazy bitch.
Tell him I'm not here.
You're crazy.
Hurry up and come out.
- Hey!
That man might kill me!
- Then beg him to kill you first!
"- I beg him to do that, he might really do it!"
- Then beg for your life instead!
Whatever!
"Yes, sure."
"No, father."
Mother has told you not to play flute.
You just keep quiet.
Can't you see sir is going to pay us a big amount.
"C'mon, sit down."
"- Yes, go ahead."
Father!
Father!
- That's it?
Are you done?
Pasha sir!
I'll play flue.
Let me rest for some time.
"No, father."
You will not play flute.
I'll play it.
"Pasha sir, I'll play flute."
Will you play flute?
"C'mon, go on."
Ramu!
Your wife died.
Father!
"No one understand the language of flute, my child."
They only understand the language of stick.
Only of the stick.
"C'mon, I'll teach you my language."
"You name is Jaikishan, right?"
- Yes.
"But I'll call you only Kishna, you know why?"
Because you play such nice flute.
From where did you learn it?
- Do you have an superstitions like that?
- No.
"- So it's fine, then?"
- Yes.
It's fine.
"I'm here, abi."
Cross the ball!
Pass the ball!
Fuck your mother!
Told you to pass the ball.
Don't swear at my mom!
- Get out!
You're not playing.
- No.
You're opposing me?
Fuck off.
Take that back.
Take that back.
"- What's your problem, bro?"
- Take that hand away.
"Lay a hand on that boy again, I'll rip your hand off."
"- They are just joking around, abi."
- They won't joke around from now on.
No one will raise a hand against this boy again.
No one will make him do their stuff from now on.
"- Abi, it's not a big deal."
- It is a big deal for me!
It is a big deal.
"What is going on, brother?"
What is your problem?
"You are my problem, dick heads."
I ruined my youth not to be like him.
I will after we do it once.
I feel so refreshed.
Thought I was gonna die.
"The dumber they are, the stronger they are."
What did you just say?!
What?
Are you yelling at me?
"I mean, what did you say?"
I said you're good.
I heard what you were saying.
Dammit!
I did you a favor.
What did you say!
You did me as a favor?
What a crap!
Where did you pick up such bad manners?
Don't you think you're going too far?
You're feeling pretty mighty all of a sudden.
It wasn't good because you were good.
It's because I was born sensitive.
"Still, aren't you being too hard on me?"
"Alright, brat."
Such pride...
If you only studied like that.
Dammit!
"Okay, okay."
Enough!
A man doesn't get pissed off over such things...
Let's do it later.
Let's just talk now.
- About what?
-What painters do you like?
"Hey, a daughter wants to talk to her dead mother."
- She is just being a good daughter.
- It's her business.
"If this makes everyone uncomfortable, I'll go there by myself."
- You'll walk there yourself.
Good idea.
- Add.
This is too much.
Do you have a heart?
"Hey, if you don't want to go with me, Get out of the truck."
What did you just say?
Read my lips.
I won't go.
I'm not going either.
"Ood, Add, where are you going?"
Come back now.
I won't.
What is this?
I'm not going.
"Since you have picked us up and raised us, you never did this to me."
Who is she?
You've just met her.
She's a liar.
Why are you serious with a whore?
What the...
Don't ever say that again.
I don't want to cause any more troubles.
I'll go.
Hold on.
"Shut up, you two."
Don't ever talk to my woman like that.
I don't like it.
I go to my post abroad tomorrow.
It's for a year.
Why didn't you tell me?
Let's meet and talk.
- Let's talk later.
I'm busy.
"-Wait, don't hang up."
- Wait...
-What do you want?
I'm sorry.
Call me later?
Here.
30 dollars.
Have you had lunch?
"If you haven't, would you like to eat together?"
"I'll treat, to thank you for everything."
You look like a young miss.
Isn't that your guy?
Bastard.
He told me he was away on business.
Where are you going?
"You can't be too happy right now, let's go for some fresh air?"
I don't understand guys like him.
Definitely not my type.
What's with the sunglasses?
They don't even suit you.
-Wait here.
I'll be back right away.. - I thought you were buying me lunch.
- Oh...
I didn't recognize you.
Hello.
- Don't pretend to know her!
- Show- off.
I'll just get a job probably.
As if someone would hire you!
"You really sucked at high school, didn't you?"
"If you didn't study in high school, you should at least study at college."
Going after housewives!
And what kind of name is that for a chat room?
"""Welcoming Dumpy Housewives"" Weird taste!"
Miss Dewdrop.
I think I'm just going to go home.
Why?
To go study?
No.
You're disrespecting me and I can't stand it.
Let's eat first.
Fine!
Okay.
But we're only eating.
"Well, of course."
What else can we do with that thing...
Total mental castration...
My thing is fine.
"- Hey, why are you getting in?"
- Huh?
I have to go somewhere.
Take a taxi or walk.
There' no taxi here.
That's your problem.
Close the door!
You drive me crazy.
Really.
I was just kidding.. Get in.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Why did you climb up?
"Aren""t you ashamed?"
Why to feel ashamed in doing my duty? show me your baskets!
Hey!
You want to seize our baskets!
The basket contains fishes and not gold!
I know you all very well!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
"What are you doing? constable, what are you doing?"
Are you mad?
Yes!
You have spoiled the fishes!
Now who will buy these fishes?
"Not just these fishes, I will cut open all the fishes in the oceans.. ..to check whether gold is hidden in it or not!"
Why are you after our fishes?
Go and check the fishes in the oceans!
Fine!
I am leaving!
I am leaving!
"Why are you screaming? seema, why are you running away from me?"
My friends have told me so many things about you.. ..that now I am afraid of you.
What did they tell you?
"- I won""t tell you!"
It will kill me!
Tell me!
What do your friends say? sit at a distance!
More! - oh God!
So what?
Things are expensive!
Don't you have a job yourself?
How much can I make?
How about Moon?
What can he do?
I won't count on him.
Go to hell and don't ever come back! 你干嘛挂啦?
What are you doing?
Why begged him for his money?
I'll have money next week.
Thank you very much!
I don't want your dirty money.
What do you mean my ditry money?
You think his money is clean?
"Don't worry mon, I'm different now."
You can ask Ms.Lee.
I thought you said you'd go back to school.
Did you do that?
You're the same as your father.
Are you OK?
You may go home after 10 mins...
When will she come back again to further consultation with a doctor?
I'll call and inform you.
Make your daughter have a rest.
Hi there!
Your daughter got a stroke?
Stroke yourself.
Let me remind you.
You played me last time.
Don't ever try play tracks with me!
Pay!
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You made my plight bad.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
My heart is yours.
I promise you.
My heart is yours.
I promise you.
I understand your intentions.
I have already studied the book of heart.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You made my plight bad.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
People only cast evil sight.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Good!
- Good!
Good!
- Good! sheikh has sent the diamonds for us!
Give it to me!
I will deliver it to Tiger singh in switzerland.
These diamonds are mine!
"Don""t forget that!"
My sweet love!
Hasan!
"Don""t deceive sir!"
Why are you inviting trouble?
"lf Tiger singh found out, he will not spare you!"
Get lost!
Hey!
"Don""t aggravate the matter!"
Will you... will you listen to me?
You can ask for my life.
Because now I will not be able to live without you.
Kishan!
You...
You... surrender yourself.
"Sacrifice makes love immortal, Kishan."
Love is a test.
"And those who fear it's result, their love is just a pretence."
You may be a criminal in the eyes of society... ...but you are a true man in my eyes.
And I want to show this to the world.
- Radha!
Kishan!
Show them that even your heart is full of love.
You too can feel pain.
You are a true person.
I'll do as you say.
- Kishan!
Radha!
Don't cry!
"Don't cry, Radha."
Now that I've got you... ...I don't even fear gallows.
I'll surrender myself.
Kishan!
I'm proud of your love.
And I'll always be proud of it.
- Radha!
"Kishan, promise me that whenever you'll return... ...we'll meet at this place."
Near this temple.
- Sure!
If I'll come back.
"Don't say that, Kishan."
- Yes.
- Or are you protecting someone?
No.
Or are you carrying the can since you don't got much time left?
- No.
"- Tell me, who wanted this from you?"
- Who are you protecting?
- I killed Ferhat.
Brother.
"Hey, brother."
- What's your problem?
- What do you want?
We just wanted to wake you up for breakfast.
"Okay, thanks."
You were on duty again last night?
You didn't sleep.
Was it hard last time you were in jail as well?
What is it to you?
Whatever man.
"Hey, what is this?"
Did it again?
You did it again?
You washed my pants with the letter in it?
Why don't you check it before?
What am I gonna do with this now?
"- I am sorry, abi."
- Fuck your apology.
When are you gonna stop being stupid?
You're the one who shouldn't have kept your letter in your pockets.
Fuck you.
Eat your breakfast.
Do it like he does.
Today...
I'll sell all my flutes on half rates.
Now leave your hopes for me.
And take care of yourself.
Doctor has warned you not to play flute.
Doctor only identifies our disease... ...but not our pain and poverty.
"Shanta, you are my life."
I can't live without you.
Don't say that.
Yet our Kishan has to grow up.
He has to study and be a good citizen.
"Yes, okay, Shanta."
I'll not play flute.
But at least I can sell them.
"C'mon, Kishan, today we'll sell all the flutes."
"Ramu, come here."
Come!
You won't get anything by playing flutes.
Mr. Pasha!
My wife is very sick.
I'm in need of money.
Do you want money?
Take this money.
Take it.
Buy all my flutes and give me the charges.
Flutes?
What will I do with your flutes?
Play some tune!
Your favourite one.
The one that expresses love.
"Yes, I'll play it too."
I'll play all the tunes.
Look there.
Gods are bare-bodied.
Like this.
They're never fully covered.
"That's your wedding photo, right?"
- Yes.
Wearing that traditional attire.
"So, did you only wear a traditional attire.. ..since your wedding?"
"No, right?"
- No.
See.
That's our older image.
"Conch in one hand, mace in the other."
Where are yours?
"lf I keep holding them all day, won't my arms hurt?"
Think.
"Actually, our latest photos haven't been updated on Facebook."
"People still use the older ones, and we let them."
We don't have a problem.
- Let them.
- That's enough.
You're boring me now.
"Get out, leave."
Mahadev!
- Mahadev!
- Only you can hear and see me.
"Yes, coming."
Coming.
Mahadev!
What happened?
"What happened, Kanji?"
See him.
"Hey, why are you going away like that?"
What will you lose if you stay with me for some more time?
Oh God!
Did you get wet again?
Take this and dry yourself.
Pandarta?!
The train has no scheduled stop here.
Why did it stop?
- How should I know?
Then why are you sitting there?
Go and find out.
Oh!
My ring fell down.
This is a valuable ring.
You should not lose it.
Keep it.
This is the ring your father gave the first time.
Keep it.
Bananas!
Apples!
Salutations sir.
Why did the train stop?
The water is going over the tracks.
It may take about two hours to recede.
Please come and sit in my room until then.
Idiotic rain!
"Hey, ring up uncle and find out how father is."
At the same time ask him to send some vehicles.
We cannot stay here a long time.
Who is he?
"- He is Badri, son of Dasanna."
"He has so many people around him, is he such a big shot?"
I'm asking you to leave.
Please.
You got the newspapers?
What does it write about us?
"Look, I'm asking you, please, don't open your mouth no matter what they ask you."
"Okay, Kadir Bey."
Don't you worry.
- And Kerim has just went out.
"- Yeah, I saw."
"- ""They admitted they money""  - Fatmagül better not see this."
Good morning.
"- Fatmagül, don't read it."
- I agree.
This is sweet.
This will reduce all  the cheering to nil.
- You see how the tide has turned.
- That's right.
Just you wait...
Let's go to the hospital and visit my yenge then.
That's what we're doing right now.
- You're gonna talk to her today?
- Nope.
I won't... until she comes and apologizes to me.
You're the man!
- What are you doing here?
- Can we ask you a few questions?
"- No, you can't."
- Just a few.
"Look, we said it all at court."
You are helping them by doing this.
"But you took the money and  set up a business with it, didn't you?"
"No, no."
I need to go.
I'm sorry.
Ms. Eom!
What is this money for?
Here is today's weather forecast.
Heavy clouds and showers are expected tonight.
How was it?
Was it okay?
Too slow.
It'll be night and raining by the time you finish.
"And smile, won't you?"
"Good, good."
Su-eun!
Let's do it again.
I can't hear you.
"Once more, please?"
I'm your only sister!
"So you're clumsy, aren't you?"
"You're a lousy artist, but your face is well-drawn."
I didn't know we had such a cutie in our park.
Oh?
This...
How did you know it was mine?
"Is there any other artist around here, dummy?"
It's all smudged.
Tell me it's a very important painting for you...
You could've just thrown it out.
But thanks anyway.
Damn!
You punk!
"I was going to be generous since you're cute, but..."
"Well, I'll let you off this time Today is your lucky day."
"That's right, I'm crazy."
You must have suffered living with a crazy woman!
Do you think I have nowhere to go?
There are men everywhere.
"Hang up, moron."
"Dammit, it's a mountain."
Man...
I'm at the top.
I guess I have to go down.
Bring me some money.
Why?
I got caught at a motel having an affair.
"By My husband, of course..."
He brought the cops.
The moron got those errands people to follow me.
"They took my bag, too."
I don't even have a damn coin.
Who?
College what?
So what if he's young.
So you're bringing some money or not?
"Listen, bitch, if you weren't gonna come, what's with the twenty questions?"
"Bitch, you said you were jealous of me having an affair, too."
Bitch...
Being a friend means to help out in times of need.
Bye!
Hey could you lend me about 50 dollars?
Me?
"If you have some money, Lend me about 50 bucks."
30!
That's all I've got.
I'll pay you back
There's delay but not denial.
"Just like I came here, to help Kanji bhai."
Help me?
I found out about your condition.. ..only after I brought the house.
"The court case, lost your shop.. ..and your wife and children too."
"Kanji bhai, don't worry."
You can stay here.
"ln return, I will only use your things."
"Television, fridge, etcetera."
"Fine, but remember.. ..one day I will buy this house back from you."
So be it!
"I mean, I promise."
He's a nice man.
- Something you said.
"No, just.."
Cheers.
Calls himself God.
I think he's drunk.
"Thank you, for letting me stay in my own house."
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I will sleep outside on the terrace.
And you can sleep wherever you want.
It's your house.
Thank you.
Goodnight.
"And yes, the light switch is at the back."
Switch off the lights before you go to sleep.
Another power failure.
No. you switched it off.
"- No, I didn't."
You're drunk.
- How much?
10 rupees.
Bring this bag also.
- I am already carrying two bags.
Why dont you give it to brother-in-law?
He is already carrying the burden of the family.
You bring it.
- I will bring it.
"Have you understood, uncle?"
They say I am not securing marks and you dont have job.
"Sister, where are you going?"
Those brinjals are fresh.
You wait here.
- Is it necessary?
What happened to these people?
Uncle!
- What is it?
Do you like that girl?
"I have told you about a girl, Do you remember?"
She is the girl.
Who?
That train beauty?
Yes.
Will you do a favor to me please?
Take your parents out from here.
"Ok, I will do that."
Will you buy me a chocolate?
I will give you as many as you want.
Mom!
- What happened?
"Mom, the chips which you kept out for drying.. ..will be spoiled in this rain."
"Sister, Why are you still standing here?"
Ah.
"I mean, don't you have an original vampire to worry about?"
"Ah, ah, ah, do ten more of those."
You're going to want to buff up if you start dating this one.
Self defense and all.
What is your problem?
Your doctor vervained me.
And then she bloodjacked me.
What?
"I mean, when did you even see her?"
When I went to the hospital to accuse her of killing her ex-boyfriend.
"Which, by the way, very sensitive subject."
"Damon, what the hell are you doing, huh?"
Why are you mad at me?
I told you I'd handle this!
I proved your theory...
Diagnosed psycho case.
You're welcome.
Why are you doing this?
Stop moving.
"Jamie, let me go."
"Jamie, he needs help."
- Jamie!
- Bonnie!
Bonnie!
What the...
These chains aren't strong enough.
You need to leave.
Run!
So?
She didn't tell me where the coffins are.
The vampire showed up.
"No, let's take him right in."
( suspenseful theme playing )
"Is he gonna hurt me, Frank?"
Maybe a little.
"But you're a brave boy, aren't you?"
"Will you stay with me, Frank?"
"Yeah, sure I will."
( dramatic theme playing )
"Yes, yes."
We're at Dr. Garber's office now.
"No, no."
I don't think it's serious.
Probably nothing but a simple sprain.
We'll take an x-ray at the hospital to be sure.
We're going over to the hospital.
Why don't you meet us there?
"I-I know you're busy, but-but this is Saturday."
"All right, then you can just stay there."
It's only his son.
DR. GARBER:
"All right, young man, let's test that ankle."
How does it feel?
Okay.
Fine.
We'll have that arm fixed up in no time.
Would you want me to go with him?
"No, don't bother, Frank."
You can take the car back.
Dr. Garber will drop us off later.
"Then you'll tell me about it when you get home, huh?"
Frank... thank you.
You having trouble?
"Look, there's a crime here and the guilty ones will get their punishment."
- And you?
"- I said ""anyone guilty""."
We told everything to a friend of yours.
All right?
"Kerim Bey, what did you do with the money?"
Bought this car?
I'm wasting my breath with you.
You're a waste of time!
"Kerim Bey, please!"
"I'm sorry, Usta."
They are in front of our house as well.
- They are everywhere now.
- But that's a bit over the top.
What did I tell you before?
All I care about is my business.
- I don't want this in front of my shop.
- You're right.
"You're right, but it's not like  I'm calling them to come here."
"What the hell, man?"
- Damn it.
- Kerim...
This won't go on.
It's so troublesome to have you here.
"I promised your dad, but... ..."
I can't continue with you any more.
What did you promise to my dad?
- Don't go and tell the man now.
"- No, I just want to now."
Did my father tell you to give me the job?
I'm sorry...
I have a daughter who is to be married.
We're done.
Great work.
Great work.
"We are B.A.P, great work."
We're finished.
Now I'm going to hurry back and wash up to go to sleep.
I'm not sure if I did well.
But tomorrow will be a better day.
PEACE!
We're done.
See you tomorrow.
Bye bye.
Before we start shooting
I was going to get something cool to drink.
But I ordered some napkins.
- Where is this?
- This is the 21st century.
- There's a soup stain here.
- This is the 'it' item for 21st century.
A boy from 21st century.
Something unbelievable has happened.
Something that should not happen...
We were supposed to film here.
But there's a problem.
So we have to film the next scene first...
So we have to head to the hotel right now.
Let's go to the hotel!
None
"It's huge, there's a pool!"
How many rooms are there?
The water's too hot.
The cost of one night's stay so much.
I cannot stand it any more.
I will marry you tomorrow itself.
Why do you look like that?
I am giving you time only till the marriage hour.
You must change not only your mind ...
That will never happen.
- It will happen.
Never.
Cant you hear?
Dont you know the fate of Ravana who kidnapped Sita?
Open your eyes atleast now.
Hey Ravana!
Get ready for the war.
Change the story.
Are you Rama?
Take the nuptials from Sitas neck and give them to Ravana.
He will tie them.
Are you mad?
Why will Rama remove Sitaa nuptials.
"Hey, remove the nuptials."
"- Sir, it is a sacrilege."
It is a sin.
Did you see this?
The power went off.
This is a bad omen.
What nonsense?
Inquire what happened.
Maybe lord Rama has come.
"Hey you, come here."
Did you check everything?
Yes we checked all the fuses.
Now check the transformer.
I'll be 'the last but not least Snow Maiden'!
"And I will, I beg your pardon, be Santa."
Then that makes me the Christmas tree.
That's right!
"And we will decorate you, and dance the round dance around you."
"What will we dance, I beg your pardon?"
Ooh!
The round dance.
"The boa's home is Africa, ln Africa he lives, -"
"So cute, and slim, and ever-green, Just like the summer leaves."
Why - green?
Because I'm a Christmas tree.
You won't make a Christmas tree.
And why is that?
Why won't he?
A Christmas tree is prickly.
And he is soft.
A Christmas tree has to have needles.
Ha!
We can stick needles into him.
"Oh no, don't stick needles into me!"
The parrot is right:
I won't make a Christmas tree.
Then we don't have a Christmas tree?
But we have the Snow Maiden and Santa Claus.
We don't have Santa Claus either.
Santa is cold.
"And the elephant - there, feel him - he is warm."
We'll freeze him!
There!
No!
Please don't freeze me!
Leave no one behind.
All of us.
Do you feel better now?
Did I seem like I wasn't good before?
Did something happen with you and Madam Noh?
You looked so fierce just now when you were talking about her!
I've never seen you like that.
You looked like a stranger!
Something became very precious to me without me realizing it.
But I thought I had lost it.
So did you lose it?
No.
"Fortunately, I didn't lose it."
That's good.
Then you should reconcile with Madam Noh.
You said she was like a mother to you.
"In my opinion, she cares very much for you."
Yes.
I should go.
You should go now.
I should keep my promise.
"Oh, your name!"
What's your name?
My name is Chang Hui.
Chang Hui?
You can't say it out loud.
You can't say it in front of anyone.
And you can't call me in public.
Can you promise me this?
Then why did you tell me?
Because I wanted you to know what it was.
If I know that you know my name... ...
My father asked me to protect the plants.
My fathers will surely kill me.
There's no need for that.
Because there's something going to happen to you.. ..after which you will die of shame.
What did you say about us on the phone?
Ghost.
Witch.
Today we'll make your plight such that.. ..you won't be able to face the entire neighbourhood.
What do you mean?
I mean..
Kundan.
We mean.. that day we pulled your father's loincloth.. ..and today its your turn.
"No, Kundan."
"Kundan, I would be left with no clothes."
It's okay.
"- Mala, please tell them."
"Kundan, be careful."
Kitchen Kumar is very delicate.
Kishen.
Give me this cloth.
No!
"Mala,"
Where are my roses?
Where are my roses?
The roses were drying.
So I made a paste out of them.
Where's the paste?
I..
I.. it was mother's anniversary.. ..so I fed the paste to mother..
"No, to the bull."
If it was mother's anniversary.. ..then you should've fed the paste to the cow or the bull?
The cow.
Wait !
[ Groans ]
"Well, safer than a tube sock."
[ Sighs ]
"- Okay, that-- That was good."
- Yeah.
- See you at dinner.
"- Uh, yeah."
I'll see you at dinner.
"So, Finch, this is your plan ?"
"You know, I don't think girls are into the whole mini-golf thing."
"Kevin, I'm sure that they're not."
"Actually, there is one small matter that I need to ask for your cooperation in."
"- In the spirit of this whole pact, you know ?"
"- Sure, what do you need ?"
"Whatever you hear about me, you agree."
And tell all the boys the same thing.
"Look, I gotta go."
Sixteen minutes round-trip.
"You know, Finch, it's-- it's senior year."
"I mean, don't you think it's time you learned how to take a dump at school ?"
When was the last time you looked at the facilities in this school ?
[ Murmuring ]
- [ Grunts ]
- Excuse me.
"Uh, that's Paul Finch, right ?"
- Yeah.
"- Well, you've seen him in the locker room, right ?"
"- Uh, yeah."
"- So, my friends, they want to know."
Is it true ?
"You know, that he's... equipped."
One wrong step from your side. ...can harm your daughter's honour as well as life.
Your enemy Jackie.
"Damodar, tell him something."
Have patience!
Your anger can risk her life.
"Before that I'll kill all of them, Damodar."
She's my daughter.
"She's not only yours, but all of us' daughter."
Give this to me.
Come to your senses.
"Aunt, reason him something."
Don't play with the laws and trust me.
After all I too have some duties towards this family.
I'll bring Radha back.
You please control him.
I'll call the police.
God!
What has happened?
Pasha!
Today you've challenged me.
I'll not spare you and your son alive.
IG Shreekant!
Now you'll understand my language.
"Well done, Jackie!"
You are lying.
You are not a police officer.
"Listen, try and understand."
- You are a liar.
I don't want to hear a word from you.
Get lost!
"Otherwise, I'll kill you."
I said leave.
Hello...
I obtained permission for each one of you.
"There is not going to be any restrictions on the number of visitors, despite Mustafa's illness."
What illness?
We all know why he is here!
Okay...
Duriye..
Metin didn't say anything.
"That is, he is just saying it is protocol."
My son!!!
My son...
Son...
Son....
It is time for medication..
"Mustafa, son.. where are you going?"
We came to see you..
"Look, Asiye is here.."
Yasar is here...
Your mother...
Your father...
"You say that, but Mustafa doesn't recognize you."
We are going
My son....
How could they do this to you... how????
We... ... are such a burden to you..
If only Kadir could get out.. ... we won't stay...
"And, you won't even let us do any work."
We just sit around.
You are not a burden to anyone.
I am going to ask you something...
Are you not comfortable here?
Is the place too small?
- What are you guys doing here?
"- Come on, shoo, get lost!"
"- All right, all right!"
"- All right, time is tight."
Let's begin.
You there.
Read.
- Why me?
- Because I said so.
"- ""How to hold a costume parade."""
- Get to the point.
- The director... advances...
- Advances what?
"- Can't see, it's faded."
- Hand it over.
- That circular looks really old.
"- Old, yes."
"Obsolete, no."
I might add.
You know what I mean?
- The director announces...
Announces!
"""Attention, let the costume parade begin!"""
- Attention!
Let the costume parade begin!
Music!
- You got it!
- Get closer!
"You, out of the way!"
"So there is no chaos tomorrow, we'll divide the square into sectors."
"Children separately over here, and adults over there."
Slogan chanting can be done by the support staff.
Go.
"Please, I need this job."
You're fired.
"Look, give me another chance."
You're fired.
"Parker, hello."
You're fired.
Why?
Dogs catching Frisbees?
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?
Boss.
Not now.
The Bugle could show another side of New York for a change.
"We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah."
We need page one.
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you...
Still not now!
I pay you because that psycho Spider-Man will pose for you.
He won't let me take any more pictures.
You turned the whole city against him.
A fact I'm very proud of.
Get your pretty little portfolio off my desk before I go into a diabetic coma.
"Is your wife, she lost her checkbook."
Thanks for the good news.
"Please, isn't there any of these shots you can use?"
I need the money.
Miss Brant.
Get me a violin.
"Five minutes to deadline, Jonah."
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Must've gotten up really early.
I'm sleep deprived right now.
"But since it's our MV, I'm anticipating a good outcome."
And it's really fun.
I'll be sure to enjoy it.
Peace.
"Right now, we're in NY to film MV. on some bridge."
I don't know where this is though...
Him Chan is already shooting first for the MV on this bridge now.
This is my background scene.
It's awesome.
our solo shoots are over.
We'll film a lip sync all together as a group.
Lip sync like an image cut.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Step back a little...yes.
A chatting scene.
Cut.
What's wrong with us?
"Now, what you do with this coffee is,"
Drink it in a sentimental way.
"Put it down, and pet it once like this."
And try touching the coffee cup here.
This one here?
"You know, something like this."
Put your coffee cup to...
"- You know what I mean? - oh, this one?"
"- No, no."
- Then this one?
Then touch that cup in front of you.
You're thinking of the girl that's supposed to be with you.
[phone rings]
[celestial choir]
woman:
[softly]
I love you. man:
[softly]
I love you too.
"[man coughs, gags]"
[triumphant orchestral finale]
[boat horn blows]
man speaking native language:
You need to have a pee.
Tai-Chan.
"If you don't pee, you can't watch TV, can you?"
Hmm?
Hey.
Here we go.
boy:
Why do you have lots of hair growing? man speaking native language:
Because I'm a man. boy speaking native language:
What about women? man:
"Women don't have hair, not as much."
[man speaking native language]
Say good morning to mummy. boy speaking native language:
Good morning. man speaking native language:
Here's the incense. boy speaking native language:
I don't want to. man:
"Daddy will do it alone then, Tai-Chan."
"Tai-Chan, here, sound the bell."
"When daddy has put the incense in, you can sound the bell."
[bell rings]
Not yet.
I'll take a beautiful picture.
Stop smiling.
"Now, here we go."
Do you know where he is going?
Maybe New York or Paris.
Maybe we should make them meet before he leaves.
You know why none of the Dwarves hooked up with Snow White?
They couldn't tell her how they felt.
Not one!
They were all ashamed of being dwarves.
In fact...
"In fact, Snow White had a thing for short guys."
"When the Prince dismounted from his horse, he was goddamned... uh really short."
"This is a secret, but actually he was the youngest."
"The eighth, who was adopted away."
You know why the bitchy queen died so miserably?
She was tricked by the mirror!
"When you look at your sweetheart, you don't look with a mirror, you look with your heart."
What's all this about?
It doesn't suit you.
It's too heavy.
Hi!
What are you doing here?
I have something to say.
What is it?
I'll tell you later.
- Can't you say it now?
- Later.
"Oh, I better go."
I'll call you then.
I'll be waiting for you!
Hello.
And when it comes back to me--
"And believe me, mate, it fucking does, that madness."
"I mean, when I hear, you know, the--"
"The roar of the stadium on match day, yeah, all the lads calling me down... ...to get pissed out of me fucking tree."
When I think of that... ...I think about getting back into it.
"And Shannon and Ben, they remind me."
There's more to life than all this.
"Get all those juicy details, mate?"
- Writing it all down?
- What?
- You fucking journo cunt!
- Oi!
Oi!
Oi.
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- He's fucking undercover!
- Don't tell him nothing!
"- I said, are you sure?"
What?
You already knew.
"All I know is he studied journalism, right, at Harvard."
But he's dropped out.
We found his journal.
Full of stories about all of us.
That's just a fucking diary.
Ned saw you at the Times with a couple of journos.
That was my dad.
He's the journalist.
You knew that.
"His old man's a fucking journo, and you knew about it."
"- Look, that don't mean nothing, Bov."
- You what?
Thank you.
Good day.
"Oh, I wish I didn't come here."
"Don't say that, I'm glad you are with Sami Amca today."
Sami Amca.
- How is Kuzey?
Is he well?
- He's alright.
- How is his morale?
- Make a guess.
Everyone has their own problems.
- He's not sick or something I hope?
"- No, thank God."
But he's not in good spirit either.
Don't worry you.
Look...
"He will be out soon, anyway."
The toughest part is over.
How do we know that?
The other man's case is a different one.
There's something about this place.
It fills me with hopelessness.
"No, don't say that, Sami Amca."
Try to think good things and good things will happen.
Kuzey will be free after the first trial and we all welcome him.
He will be with you in your nikah.
"Inshallah, did you give him the letters?"
I left them with the warden they need to control them first.
- Of course.
"- Okay then, let's go."
"""Every soul will taste death"""
"Kazım Beyefendi, in his last trip... ... asks for two things from you, our dear community."
"Cemre, you're back in your old neighborhood."
We'll see each other more often now.
- Don't say words that you will regret.
- Go to hell.
"You're nuts, girl."
I'm telling you.
Bye bye!
What are you doing?
It's so not like you.
Why do you even argue with her?
She does this just to annoy you.
And you swallow her bait.
She says Sami Amca insisted.
It's her who is dying to go there.
"Mom, sometimes I want to jump down her throat."
Let me tell you beforehand.
We can't give you February 14.
We're fully booked that day.
"Oh, what is on 14th of February?"
Valentine's Day.
Everyone wants to marry that day.
That's why.
"Okay then, give us any day that is available."
Not the 5th of the month though.
Kuzey's trial will be on that day.
How about 4th?
"No, let's do it after 5th."
So that Kuzey will be with us as well.
Of course.
13th of February is available.
But since 13 is considered unlucky... ... people don't want to marry on that day.
What is unlucky about 13?
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
I saw.. and along with that inflation.
It affects each and everyone.
"Don""t cry."
Because of this..
"Because of this, l never got married."
I never got married. keep a close watch. stay awake.
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister. keep a close watch. stay awake.
You are asleep.
And the enemy is alert.
Wake up. otherwise you will be in trouble.
Hey!
That country will be robbed.
"That country will be robbed, where the guards go to sleep."
Where the guards go to sleep.
The green signal has been given.
Jamal Pasha has the goods.
Leave immediately.
31 1 .
3 North.
7.
"lt""s gold worth 5 crores."
- I will leave immediately.
No!
"The goods won""t be delivered through the port."
Already the police are after us. so what?
The police are in our fist!
"Don""t talk nonsense!"
I am happy that I could fulfil my promise.
I won't survive for long.
I might not live until your release from prison.
"But I pray that... ... you get back your son, Suraj."
From Ram Prasad Saxena.
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun... you are the apple of my eye
"The easterly brings hope, like the birds soaring in the sky"
"God willing, some day, you will fly with the clouds"
"And some day, I will be envied for having mothered you"
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun
It's ready.
Take it.
"What are you looking at, son?"
- Nothing.
I think that... you should come along with me.
I?
What will I do there?
This the happiest day of my life.
Won't you come along on this day?
Your mother and Renu will be accompanying you.
You will have to accompany me.
- I told you that I'm not coming.
All right.
If you don't come along I won't go either.
You shouldn't fuss.
I'm ready.
Let's go.
"- Renu, she is accompanying us."
It is your responsibility to get her ready.
I'm waiting in the hall below.
A cheater!
"Today, before Damodar arrives... ...I'll tell you everything true."
What do you want to tell me?
Go on.
"Actually, I'm..."
I'm not your would-be son-in-law.
A charade has been played with you.
And I'm forced to play a role of fraud son-in-law.
"Actually, your would-be son-in-law is someone else."
Who's he?
- Today's race winner.
Jackie!
- No!
You can slap me or kill me.
I'll get the punishment of my deeds.
But this is true.
Mr. Bharat Singh has thrown a big party for Jackie's victory.
And Jackie and Radha are also taking part... ...in a stage program of that party.
And you'll be made a chief guest of that program.
I would like to see this truth.
I'll attend the party.
I'll definitely go.
Has father come here?
Radha!
I don't want you to sing with Kishan in the party.
There'll be a big confusion.
I'll sing.
"- Radha, father has come to known everything."
And no one else other than you could be there behind it.
"No, Radha."
I promise you.
I'm yours only.
Who is Rajesh?
My best friend!
"My school and college""s friend!"
"No matter how much I praise his friendship, its less."
ls that so?
You have never mentioned Rajesh before.
How can I mention him?
He has joined the police force!
"And I am just working in the shipping company. seema, when you are in front of me, I forget everything."
"Now don""t talk too much."
And come with us for a picnic!
Picnic?
- Yes!
How can I come for the picnic?
He is coming after a long time.
"He will feel so dejected if he won""t find me here."
"Good luck, sir!"
Good luck!
"lt""s the sign of your promotion."
"This is the first time that this jeep""s tyre has got punctured."
Rao.
"- Yes, sir."
"Don""t talk nonsense."
"Take out the jack from the jeep. sorry, sir!"
There is no jack!
There is no jack!
"Take out the spanner. sorry, sir."
"We don""t have that too."
"Take out the screw driver. sir, we can take out the screw."
"But it""s difficult to take out the driver. otherwise who will drive?"
"Rao, I am fed up of this!"
"How does your jeep work? sir, it""s a police jeep. lt works on its reputation."
"You don""t fear the public."
"You don""t fear your parents."
At least fear the police.
ls it a crime to love?
"Hey, lover boy!"
Why do you love openly?
Think about the people!
"What happened, constable Rao?"
You both too come here!
"What happened, constable?"
"Don""t ask!"
lf I had not come on time today then.. ..your image would have got tarnished!
This ruffian was going to kiss your daughter!
"What""s the harm in kissing?"
Young people should indulge in kissing!
- Yes! shut up!
lf my daughter starts giving free kisses.. ..then who will give me dowry?
"Look, Mr. Rao."
"lf you can give me 4000 gm gold, then you can stay! otherwise leave!"
"You don""t worry, papa! l will load you with gold!"
"Don""t trust this ruffian!"
"Look, if you want to get your daughter married.. ..then get her married to a decent, reputed, educated guy."
Even if he is of my age.
"This is something to ponder over! sorry, sir!"
I am one minute late.
1 minute late.
- Yes.
I got to know 1 minute prior. oh!
"Then it""s a great loss, sir!"
"ln this one minute, I could have.."
At this age?
"- Yes, sir!"
"On February the 4th, when the trial is over and you are free."
"I will hug you so tight, that... ... no one will be able to untie us."
Take care until that day.
I love you so much.
I love you so much.
If you want to be my girlfriend then you won't hold a weapon again.
- Zeynep.
- Let us go.
I said let us go.
Do I stick it in here?
We'll leave a row empty.
Then we'll add 4 rows.
Okay.
- Am I doing alright?
- You're doing wonderful.
"""Don't wait for me tonight."
"It's impossible for me come."""
"Now do the turns, and finish the crossed parts."
- How does it look?
"- It looks beautiful, canım."
The idiot dropped it at the house when he was fighting Kuzey.
I forgot that I kept it so that it wouldn't get lost.
Then I found it again in one of the boxes as I moved to my new place.
So I brought it  thought maybe it's something important.
You did well.
This was my father's.
Atilla Sinaner's.
He had bought this specially to give it as a present to Güney.
That fool couldn't hold onto it.
- One more?
"- No, I will go."
- Where?
Let's hope the best for them.
Amin.
"I told them, they shouldn't come all the way back here."
"So, I'll just have what will be delivered to Kuzey."
And I'll take it to them.
Boot licker.
That's good.
You thought well.
"Actually, Sami Amca wanted me to present at the jail as well."
"He said, it would make Kuzey very happy even if I'm just waiting at the door."
"But, I'll see."
Where did Sami Amca say that to you?
In your dream?
"Cemre, what are you talking about?"
Silly girl.
"I got used to it, Gülten Teyze."
This is just a sample of our dialogues with Cemre.
I bet you took a day off from work for this.
"Dear, why don't you go and put the cookies in the oven?"
I got some other stuff to do as well.
You don't worry about me.
"- So give me what you have, and I'll take it to them."
"- No need, I'll do it myself."
"What, are you going too?"
Come on...
"But mom, it's not ready anyway."
What should I do?
- Rush it while Zeynep is poising over me?
"- Well, I can't wait, if it's not ready."
"Also, she might put it into trash or change my letter."
"I won't take the risk, thanks."
"Okay, Cemre..."
So sorry
But
I'll buy tuna sashimi if you come.
The best kind
The best!
I'm dying for fresh tuna
I'm sorry
I'm really sorry
She never went out once with us in over a year
She's a Hikikomori
- She doesn't shut herself at home - Someday she will
"- We're having tuna, right?"
"- No, sausages"
You can't mess with tuna like that!
Come on!
I want tuna!
The best!
"I'll buy tuna, then!"
"A big can, that is"
Roll it around
"Happy birthday, Sweetie I sent a gift"
What Mom?
- A husband - What?
I signed you up at a marriage agency to meet men
You didn't have to do that
How's work?
When will you become a magician?
It's just a part-time job
How's everything there?
Good
Great air and nice people
It's so beautiful here
"I don't think you have any, I don't seen Corel draw ."
"You know, I don't think that we focused."
"In that case , I mean Painter, which is actually used for children's publications."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah, we haven't, I don't think that we ."
"Oh, no."
You do have .
I can tell with the others as well.
"Uh, I missed the update, so you do have essential training in teacher twelve, not four, this came out the,"
"February, the fifteenth."
Yeah.
"So I do, I did have not."
All right.
And we.
"Yeah, I just realized that, I'll have to go back take a look at that again."
"And we have um, finished shooting, um."
"Uh, course the shooting with the Nikon D800."
So that will come out in November.
"Oh, November."
"Okay, great!"
"Yeah, yeah."
"So you can spend your um, your holidays."
Watching movies.
Okay.
Exactly. .
"Uh, that's good."
That's good.
That's good.
"Um, okay. ,, ."
"Uh, do you have any questions for me or anything that you would like to add that you feel would be particularly helpful for us as we look at 2013?"
Um.
No.
Bye.
Excuse me...
My brother?
- What's the matter?
- Where is he?
Tell me what's wrong.
I talked to the doctor and he told me everything was okay and he was stable in a coma.
Was his condition serious?
I haven't been told anything about a transfer.
"Shit, Malena."
- What's the matter?
- Son-of-a-bitch!
You son-of-a-bitch.
What is it?
I feel fucking fine.
What day is it today?
September 10.
"2001, right?"
"I mean I didn't sleep til 2007 or anything, did l?"
You were out for 2 weeks.
You know what?
I have a feeling things are going to get better from now on.
"Shit, this is the 21st century."
We can learn from what we did wrong in the 20th.
"Starting tomorrow, the world will be a better place."
Trust me and you'll see.
"Pablo, there's something I haven't told you that you should know."
THE APPEARED
We are just doing future value of annuities.
"And I'll show you now, why this is such a cool thing."
"And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to do two examples, both for future value of an annuity."
And whats the other thing we do?
"They say Budyonny thought of that, honest to God!"
Here they come...
"And now, the fair-haired Josie!"
Never shall I forget
That wondrous night -
Our two hearts pledged
To a future bright.
You laughed at the fears
That did harry me...
You promised... that night...
To marry me.
"The night flew by, the night flew by,"
The morning brought a leaden sky.
"Night again, night again,"
"This night, alas, a night of rain."
"That night is gone,"
That night is gone.
I cannot believe
That all is over...
The romance is ended.
Sing some more!
More!
Dance for us!
"What's so funny, you apes?"
So you caught the kid.
"Your pa was quicker than you, wasn't he?"
Didn't hurt yourself?
"Come on, let's have some kvass."
You think that Sidor Lyuty's heart don't ache for you war orphans?
It aches all right.
But in times like these we can't help having orphans.
Know how many of my pals your pa did away with?
What has happened to my son?
I've often told you not to join the Air Force.
You are my only child.
By God's grace your life was saved today.
If anything happens in the future what will I do?
Wasn't I right?
"Mother, nothing has happened to me."
Go home and make offerings at the Lord's temple.
And this also won't happen again.
- Quiet!
You speak as though you know what will happen.
God bless you!
Who is she?
The doctor has forbidden me to speak in excess.
You tell her.
I am Renu.
My father is a retired jailer.
Oh!
So you are Renu!
He had written to me about you.
"But, whatever he had written was not sufficient."
Do you know what the doctor has said?
He said that unless we marry soon I won't get better.
Oh God!
I'll go and fix the wedding date right away.
"Yes, of course."
I have selfish motives.
Once you are married you won't risk your life so readily.
Touch mother's feet again on my behalf.
Touch my feet when you are my daughter-in-law.
Vandana!
You!
Once I've asked my senior here
You will be sorry.
"Miss Mu, under the circumstances earlier..."
"You had no choice, and needn't worry about your oath"
"I've sworn,"
I can't take my word back now.
"If you don't like me,"
"I will have to kill you, and then I'll kill myself."
Do you want to be my husband?
I'm willing to marry you.
"Good day, my master."
Good day.
Master?
What kind of a master are you?
"It took us a while to locate you,"
let's go back to the palace.
I was about to bring Miss Mu to meet my parents.
Go ahead and tell them first.
We've found our master.
What kind of a master are you?
Be patient.
"After we've reached the bottom of the hill, you'll know when you see my welcoming party."
Who are you?
"We had a deal earlier, remember?"
"After we've reached Dali city,"
I'll tell you the details.
Senior.
Where's Tuan Yu?
Senior.
"Tuan Yu has killed the Red Python, sucked up its blood, and has now acquired ""Red Dragon Soul"" style."
I was no match for him.
What?
God always supports true lovers.
Let's see how much he supports us.
Now you go.
Listen!
My mother had given this locket to me in my childhood.
Radha!
"""You are my love, my dream-boy."""
"""You are a Hero of my love story."
"You are a hero!"""
"Yes, Damodar!"
"Uncle, Jackie has surrendered!"
- What?
"""You can take away my youth..."""
"""But return me my childhood's innocence."""
"""Ever since she has returned, she's silent."""
"""Wonder what could have happened in these 16 days."""
"""That young boy... and this young girl."""
"Aunt, stop it now."
"Since yesterday, we've cried enough."
Don't make her cry more.
Why would I do that?
Society will make her cry when they'll refuse her alliance.
"Sister-in-law, I'd suggest you to get her married... ...before the matter becomes public."
"""That paper boat..."""
Radha!
- Yes.
It seems you are hiding something from me.
"Yes, sister-in-law."
I'm carrying a burden in my heart.
Sister-in-law.
I can't hide anything from you and brother.
I want to share everything with you.
"Then, we're all going out"
I have stuff to do at home I'm sorry
No exceptions this time
That was strong
I have to do the laundry and feed my dog
"That can all wait, can't it?"
My dog goes crazy if she misses a meal
"Then, let it go crazy"
I'll be there in spirit Sorry
"No, you'll be there in person!"
"If it isn't your parents' funeral, be there"
"- She'll never come - This time, she will"
- Bet $100?
- Sure
That's fascist
Fascist?
Me?
I just wanna take the whole crew out!
That doesn't make any sense What's with you?
I don't want to go
You have to
- No - Why?
Not everyone likes to drink
Then don't!
Drink Coke instead!
How can I drink Coke with beer in front of me?
Looking good
"Okay, fine"
I'll go
But I act out when I'm drunk
"Me, too"
I can drink 7 bottles of Soju
"Welcome, sir."
You can go to bed.
I will attend to my guest myself.
"Of course, sir."
Good night.
"Wow, this place is super."
You like it?
I can't believe it.
Cemre must be stupid to leave this place.
"Yeah, and she left for another stupid person."
She turned her back on me because of stupid Kuzey.
"""My daughter, Cemre..."""
"""... if you are reading this letter..."""
"""... that means I gave my last breath."""
"""And that I left this world with a great guilt of conscience."""
"""Last time we spoke you said you didn't want to see me again."""
"""You were rightfully angry at me."""
"""I didn't have much to say back then."
"As don't have now either."""
"""After all those years, I know it is too late to--"""
"Okay, I'll read it later."
Thank you for coming here.
- It was my job.
- You did your job successfully.
Kazım Bey...
"I don't know what he told you and in what degree, but... ..."
I have never asked anything from him... ... for neither myself nor my daughter.
- I know.
- As I told him back then as well... ...
I wanted to Cemre for myself.
And that's the best thing I've ever done.
"No money, nothing could match it."
Do an interpretive dance with an accordion.
"And the best of you, the most worthy..."
"Tell me, friends, who do we call the most worthy?"
- Those with a good discipline.
"- Good, who else?"
- Who leave nothing on their plates.
- Who sleep during nap time.
- Who gather grass for rabbits.
- Very good.
"And so, the most worthy ones will be allowed... ...to join the circle of champions wearing masquerade costumes."
- Is showing magic tricks a talent?
- A talent.
"- Okay, I can show the ""flying queen"" card trick."
"- Good stuff, good stuff."
Only no cards.
"Kids, everything goes: magic tricks, art installations, pantomime..."
It's all good.
"Eat, eat."
- Mitrofanova!
"So, are the rumours true?"
- And Comrade Mitrofanov is coming as well!
"- My daddy is coming, too!"
"- You eat, eat."
Don't you know the rule?
No?
"All right, children, let's remind him the rule."
All together now.
- When I'm at my plate  all talks can wait.
- Nap time!
"- For them, but not for us."
"- Come on, come on."
"- Hey, guys."
Don't mind him brother.
He is still a child.
His mind works like a child's mind right now.
"As a matter of fact, his mind doesn't work at all..."
I will take his mind in such a way that...
"And he is like this not because of his mind,  but because of electic shock and drugs..."
"Hey, pal..."
Let it go...
Come on...
My brother!
"Yaw Mustafa, see, you make us happy by splitting his head open..."
"Come on, my ram, don't leave us..."
Why don't you say something?
I am going to burst now.
"We went there, sat with him."
We saw him.
His treatment still continues.
Don't jerk me around...
I see Aslan Bey...
He is worn out...
"Take me there to see him, please..."
For God's Sake...
I swear...
"Ok, Bahar Hanim, we go one day."
"But, please be quite a little bit."
I mean... we don't want people to hear it.
"Just a minute Asil, my brother..."
"When Bahar Hanim visited Mustafa in the hospital,  didn't he have a fever and then went into coma?"
"If we take her there, maybe he will remember something."
Eh?
Isn't that possible?
I am his medicine.
You will die in my hands!
But I swore I wouldn't get involved with you again.
"I said leave me, leave!"
I don't use any opportunity .
I don't look at anyone's wife or girl either.
Put this in your goofball head.
Did you get me man?
EPlSODE 5 - Leave me !
What can you do man alone?
"Come on, do it!"
"Mira is my friend and whenever I want to be with her, i will be ."
Got it?
Now get out!
Don't dare to come here again!
What's going on here?
Nothing...
"I came to thank him for helping in the club, but... alas..."
I forgot that we don't talk the same language with our friend.
"It'm not at fault, but I'm sorry for disturbing you.Good night."
What did we talk with you Yaman?
This man came to my door.
What's his trouble with you?
"It's okay, nothing."
"- If you're right you will tell what happened, why do you keep quiet?"
We've solved it already .
There is nothing to tell.
"Come on Ender, anyway we have more important things to do, let's go and talk with Faruk."
Come dear...
Subtitles brought to you by Ebb and Tide Team @ Viki
Thank you.
"What is it ,dear Ender?"
"As soon as you heard ,did you also come to ask for your money?"
Admit Rajesh in the hospital.
"Boss, where is Jaggu?"
- I have killed him.
And you saved this enemy?
Have you decided to kill your men? - shut up!
The one who locks horn with Tiger singh.. he will be killed.
Do you know war has started in lndia?
This is the golden chance to become rich.
"Gold""s price is going to increase four times. so we will return to lndia today itself. come on."
"To save lndia, donate generously for defence fund."
"Today lndia needs gold desperately. kaka sir, we too need gold desperately."
"Mr. Anwar, come."
- Greetings. come.
"Have a seat. kaka sir, luckily there is a war."
And war is a good chance to make ourselves rich.
And our country is ready to pay any price for gold.
"That""s the misfortune, Mr. Anwar."
I am telling the truth.
I would have given you the gold.
But what to do?
"I don""t have the gold. kaka sir!"
You will get the gold.
Fix the deal with them.
Mr. Anwar!
We have gold worth 7 crores.
What price do you quote?
I am ready to give double the price! - okay!
"But we need opium, cocaine, marijuana."
Where are the goods to be delivered?
Near Lakhaidi island.
Bring the gold.
And take your goods.
"Find out what the favor she asked the official, and make sure it gets done."
I can't have another man have a flower that I can't have.
What's going on?
"The people you asked to help you, they came looking for you."
Really?
Sir!
Sir!
She's nowhere to be found!
She's disappeared!
Disappearing to where?
That doesn't make any sense!
"If she fell to here, she couldn't even manage herself properly."
"Now, are you aware of who you are?"
Who are you?
Don't you remember me?
We have seen each other in the palace grounds.
Don't worry.
You'll be safe.
I'm Seol Hye...
I was a colleague of your brother.
Brother Chun-Soo asked you to take care of me?
"Yes, that's right."
"After these events, he himself came to see me."
I think it will be difficult for Dong-Joo.
I'm sorry for delivering such news.
Forgive me for making such a hard request.
No.
I'm so grateful that you've come to me for help.
"If she's his sister, she's like my sister."
"Now, what can I do to help?"
Everything you need is in here.
"If Dong-Yi doesn't make it outside the city, then help that child stay alive."
Look at those dorms you've got!
Look at all those lawns!
Plumbing!
Television!
Gas cooking!
Greenhouses!
Flower pots!
Activities!
Children.
"You are ""masters of this camp."""
You are!
"What is required of you, my friends?"
- Dis-cip-line!
- I expressly forbade swimming to the island.
But Inochkin ignored the rules and did it anyway.
- They all probably have whooping-cough there!
- No they don't!
"- Quiet, third troop."
"- Try to be more like the second troop, will you?"
Who can guarantee now that Inochkin isn't infected?
Who?
"And it's not the first infraction from him, either!"
On his first day here he started fighting with sticks!
And after him everyone started doing it.
Even girls!
"At night, under his blanket, he lit a flashlight and started reading a book!"
"And everyone else started, too!"
And today he swam to the island!
"What now, is everyone going to swim to the island, too?"
What next?
Do we start jumping across the river?
And that's not all!
"I mean, I agree, but... aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone..."
-with your lacrosse stick or something ?
"-Oh, sure."
Sure.
"You know, I know what people think."
"It's like,"
"""Oz, he's just this kick-ass lacrosse player."""
"You know, I also play football, by the way, but that's, like,"
"- that's not all that I am, you know ?"
"- Of course, I didn't--"
"I mean, it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that."
You ?
You think I don't get that ?
"God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend... that people say, ""Oh, look."
"There's this Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss."""
Yeah.
"So, like, what else do you do ?"
"Well, the same things you do,"
Iike hang out with friends and stuff.
- Why ?
What do you think I do ?
"- Oh, l--"
I just realized that I don't know anything about you.
- I was interested.
"- Oh, well, what do you want to know ?"
"You know, stuff... about you."
All right.
"Mom, I'm home !"

Before the test begins we're going to determine hand and leg preferences.
Ready?
Can you kick the ball to me?
Ready?
I'm going to bounce it to you.
Now use one hand and bounce it back.
"Oh, nice job!"
The first thing we're going to do is use this pencil and I want you to take this car and draw a line and stay inside the row all the way down to the house.
Take your time and stay inside the row.
OK for our next activity
For this one we're going to take this paper and you see this line?
Fold it on the line just like this.
Can you do this one?
OK and now a big line right down the middle.
OK.
Do you see this square?
I want you to use this red pencil and draw the same shape in this square down here.
Just like that one.
Kona Ranga Rao becomes crores Ranga Rao.
I am placing my daughter in your hands.. ..you should make her a star and change my fate.
Do you have a five star cigarette?
Dont say anything else.
My stomach is about to split.
"Yes, my difficulties have become a joke for you."
Tell as what they are.
There are two matches.
One girl is very beautiful.
She likes me too.
But she does not have any money.
The other girl is average in looks.
But she is very wealthy
What is there in money?
You are lucky to find a girl who likes you.
Marry that girl who is not rich and you will be happy.
You are what I call a friend.
Now tell me the address of that which girl.
Give me water!
Someone close to you is remembering you.
Why do they remember even when they are close?
"Because they are close, they will remember.. ..either when close by or when far away."
Is that so?
"Hey, these people are getting very close."
It is better that we go away.
"Hey, Mr.Ranga Rao!"
Oh!
My father!
Where is your father?
There.
Near that scooter.
- Is that man your father?
Come and dance with us come on ... purge your demons!
How long are you going to stay drunk?
How would you prefer me?
Perhaps riding in the head of my four legions to meet him in battle?
For yet another victory celebration?
A true king is not a coward!
I am not a coward
I am merely a fool in exile with no place to hide except my wife's country
Enough!
Enough!
Everybody out!
Out
Be well
I trusted you
I believed in you
"I, l believed in your strength"
Could I have misjudged you?
You misjudged yourself
It may be your nature to see victory in defeat
"But it's not mine, I fear...l fear..."
I fear I can lead no more...
I should have died...l should have... where's my sword?
I had a sword...
I must die...
I must die with honor My men believed in me...
I must have it...
Stop it!
Give me my sword!
Give me my sword!
I must have my honor!
This is no honor!
ls this how you want them to remember you?
How could you have come to that conclusion?
I'm telling you that I don't dislike you.
Being with you isn't easy but I'm just saying I don't hate it.
Thank you.
I really thought that you hated me.
"Ever since high school, I have only liked you."
I don't know anything about Sartre or Nietzsche .
And I can't even cook.
"And I'm not glamorous,"
"But still, I'll try my best."
I'll know to always try my best .
Really?
I'm looking forward to it.
What?
You getting smarter for me...
I'm looking forward to it.
Okay.
"Since the midterms are not that far away,"
That confession...
I'll make sure of it with the test results.
Okay?
Midterms?
But I hate exams.
Is there anyone who likes exams?
"Then, can I get a C?"
C?!
What are you talking about getting a C.
Then C+?

Thank you.
You even walked me home.
It's like a perfect date.
It won't move.

"O dear, keep that pan aside."
I will burn myself into ashes.
Will you keep it aside if I tell you?
Have you not told me to do so?
- Let us go out.
It seems son-in-law is going to do something.
Let us not disturb him.
Come on.
"O my dear, is it ok for you if I die?"
It is burning!
Where there is a will there is a way.
"Bhadra, Ranga Rao came to see you."

"- Hey you, come here."
"Sir, Bhadram sir!"
You are my God.
Please save my daughter and me.
She is my only daughter and I brought her up as a doll.
Even my master is also looking her as a doll.. ..but he wants to see her in his home.
He is ready to give 10 lakhs if you accept this marriage.
When crores are coming who needs lakhs.
"I will first use him to finish Venkat, then think this matter."
"My God, 10 lakhs?"
Where are they?
"Here, take them."
"Sir, God has given me an extra tooth but not extra intelligence."
I would have realized your heart if He gave me that.
But I am unfortunate.
This marriage will not happen.
Why is that?
"Every idiot wants to marry my daughter.. ..Sir, I am not talking about him."
"He is pure gold, I am talking about that fellow.. ..who trapped my daughter in the name of love."
"I won""t let this happen! seema.. leave with the child."
"No, shekhar!"
"I won""t leave you alone!"
I will die with you!
Move her from the way!
- No!
Leave me!
Take her away!
- Leave!
I say leave!
Bhuta singh! shekhar!

Gold from all over the world comes in lndia.
"And lndia""s gold goes abroad. kaka sir, syndicate has come to an end."
"Now for which party do we have to deliver this gold? kaka sir, he is dim-witted."
"Till the time he doesn""t.. ..understand everything he won""t work."
"You explain to him. sher khan, the enemy country is paying double for the gold."
Got it?
We will earn four times the profit through international means.
Meaning they will buy weapons with this gold.
"And use it against us in the war. - sher khan! sher khan won""t do this derogatory act!"
"And he won""t let anybody do this!"
I tell you to obey my orders!
- lmpossible!
"This gold is our country""s wealth! our country needs it desperately!"
Some good waltz.
People could waltz.
Back when the older people...
Square dances.
I even knew how to square dance.
Not good.
"By any means, but that was one of the things that you did."
There'd be somebody who could square dance.
Uncle
John did.
That'd be Kay's grandfather.
Uncle John - last name?
Uncle John Gallagher.
And the step dancing - Who would be playing for the step dance?
That'd be Jule and Pat and they'd just
"liven it up, you know..."
Remember any other songs that they'd play?
No.
But the whole family would be there.
Things like that went on in the family. ...
The families were involved in all that kind of stuff.
The Gillespies?
"No, I meant, say you had 3 kids."
"You went with your 3 kids, and one would fall asleep, 3 years old, and the other would run him home or something like that."
It wouldn't be just the - you have to be 18 to go in there.
"Okay, it would be the whole family?"
Sure.
"Yeah, that's great."
It was a good time.
A good time growing up here.
"Riding horses, skiing behind the horses, skiing behind the Model As, the cars."
Sliding down the hill.

Take this over.
- What's up?- It is declared.
And?
I failed.

Next exam will be... of the next class's .
What?
Gotcha !
Why you..!
You almost got me frozen here!

"- I can't believe I passed it!- I'm so happy to hear that, congratulations."
"- Shall we celebrate it tonight?- Okay, talk to you later."
I shouldn't hold you more.
Laters.
"- Teas are on me!- He got frozen, lost his tongue for a moment."
- Naughty you.- Then he tried hard to comfort me.
- You scared my son!- Who wanted the teas again?
Number three.
"Easy, I'll spill them."
- We should let Kadir Bey know about it as well.- Of course.
You call him then.
Fatmagül..!
I'm busy right now.My börek is in the oven.
Thank you God.
Your hala will finish the school next year.Be successful like her.
"But he will finish his school without any break, right?"
- He will go to school and study hard.- Yes.
"I'm so happy Fatmagül.I hope we can celebrate the day... ...you graduate from university,all together."
"And I said, why me?"
He said but you're future because it's so immaterial.
"So, let's talk about asteroids."

Friend:
Who's that?
Tenant:
"Its my landlord, Pearl."
I'm really late on my rent.
Friend:
I'm getting out of here man. she is nasty.
Tenant:
"No No No,"
"Please, you need to stay."
"Do you have any idea, how many people from this town he took under his wings and gave jobs to?"
And Selim...
His father-in-law is a parliament member.
Now why would a reputable and popular family like that want to ruin all their reputation?
Why would they get involved in an incident like this?
It makes no sense!
It's absurd.
"Besides, Selim got engaged the night of that incident."
"He spent the whole night with us until he joined his fiancée, and..."
Don't make me talk more...
"That's why, you better listen to me and accept that ""everything happens for a reason""."
Forget about what happened...
Forget about Fatmagül.
Hey dad.
"Okay, I am on my way."
"OK, I'll be there."
Mustafa...
Stay out of trouble son.
"Good day, Mr. Prosecutor."
It's Lawyer Munir Telci.
Sorry to bother you this time of day.
Are you in your office?
"Yes, I'll visit you to make a complaint."
"Yes, did you see the local newspaper?"
"Yeah, don't ask."
Yes.
I'll be there soon.
Just leaving home.
"OK, thank you."
See you soon.
"Mom, Ebe Nine is here."
Mithat Bey.
You've stood strongly on your feet till today.
"You should keep the same stance from now on as well.Better, happier days are awaiting you."
"No one can take them away from you.Very soon, girl."
Your exam results will be announced soon as well.
We will get your good news.You will succeed even more than that Fatmagül.
"My dear, don't let anything pull you down."
Please.
Let's go now.
"And then, the baby rabbit... ... in tears, apologized to his mom."
- Are you asleep?- No.
"Okay, good."
"Then, his mom said to him, ""My son..."""
"""Lying is a very bad thing,"" she said."
"""Children shouldn't lie."""
"""No matter what, they shouldn't lie,"" she said."
"""They shouldn't lie, even if their mothers wants them to,"" she said."
"You are lying to me as well, now."
I know what you said isn't written here.
"- It is written here son.- The Baby Rabbit's story is different, I know it."
"Oh, this is the other *baby rabbit*'s story though."
Which is much better if you ask me.I think it is very good.
Children shouldn't lie.
They should never lie.
You don't lie to me either.Okay son?
Okay then.
Let us sleep now.I'm sleepy.
"Daddy, fireworks were so beautiful, aren't they?"
"They were beautiful, son.Very beautiful."
Close your eyes now.
Sleep well.
"Kerim, come on.It's late."
Good night.
Now Bhadram wants to take his revenge on us.
He wants me to repay all the debt I took from him long ago.
"If I cannot, then he wants me to marry my daughter to him."
It is better for me to hang myself than giving.. ..my daughter to him.
But I did not do it because of you.
What can we do now?
There is a way.
That producer is still waiting with money .. ..in his hands.
If my daughter agree to act in his film.. ..I can give that money to Bhadram.
How can I ask her to act in these circumstances?
"Dad, I will act in the movies."
Clear the debt with that money.
Let me wipe the blood off.
It will go in few days.
May be from that producer.
Hello producer sir!
Greetings!
"When will you give me the advance, sir?"
Do you want me to come to Warangal?
Warangal?
We are moving out from Warangal.
Good bye to you Warangal and good bye for Bhadranna.
"O rain, do not go back having droppe d from the eyes."
Stay with me like the showers and the lightning.
Why did he go away having raised love in my he art
If you want to come will I stop you?
Hey!
Venkat is here!
Venkat!
It has been a long time.
- How are you doing?
Let us go and see what happens.
Relax.
The man I'm really smothering isn't really my father.
Dr Benson used to be the chef medicine still that great rapport with the nurses
Actually Carla totally gets me.
That's why I've been systemically trying to drive her away.
You ever see that therapist I recommended?
Not yet.
No!
"Shortness of breath, dizziness, problems urinating?"
"No, No, No. is it a problem if it whistles?"
"Oh, you're making that so much easier."
Are you sexually active?
"Oh, it's active."
Alright.
Rare dry spell in the margin.
Okay time for the physical
Okay.
Time for the physical.
Cold hands.
Suck it up.
"Elliot exam was frightening, reminiscent of when my older brother used to beat the crap out of me."
See.
That wasn't so bad.
All done.
I'm still puking every hour.
My fever's pretty high but you're sure it's okay for me to be out of bed right?
I don't know.
"Look, Dr. Benson wasmy mentor so don't that annoying thing."
What annoying thing?
You know when you talk.
Come on that's a little-
See there it is.
"Habibe Hanım, I've brought your ointments."
Habibe called me and said she wouldn't be home.
"But brought them anyway, as I'm on my way to Galip Usta."
I thought I'd find someone in the house.
You shouldn't have.
Because we don't want your medicines from now on.
No one wants your cures in this village anymore.
- Why not?
- You know what your son did.
And you let him get away with it.
Kerim didn't do anything.
So what they say is right...
You're shamelessly denying it.
Look...
You don't know what really is the case.
"- That corrupt family, the Yaşarans are behind it."
"- Get lost, stop slandering people."
I am telling the truth.
It's me who's telling you!
It's me!
I healed your wounds for years!
I swear on everything I know and I believe in.
They put those pisliks crime on my son!
You're still protecting that bastard?
"Leave, now!"
And never knock on any door in this town again.
"If you don't want to be as lowly as her, you should never talk to her again."
"If you were our Ebe Nine, you'd have let them put him into prison."
- You let him get away with it.
- That's not true.
- That's not true.
"- Either way, no body wants you here anymore."
Except for the stabbing pain in my side.
"So he was up all night with the high fever, cramping and crying"
Dude!
"My bad, punching the wall all manly and angry like, you know what I mean."
See you later buddy/
Poor Bambi.
Don't worry Carla will take care of.
Make sure he gets submitted right away.
"On the bright side, it will be interesting to see what it feels like to be a patient."
You know people die here.
You are a good friend.
I do what I can.
Can I have your stuff?
So did you talk to any girls last night?
"Babe, I'm a attractive man."
We both know this.
It's just a burden you'll have to live with
One of many
JD talked some girl up
"Really, are you gonna call here?"
Not right away.
"Alright, showtime."
Clear out I can check him out.
You're examining me.
I don't want you to see my unmentionables.
I've seen underwear before.
"Actually I use the word ""unmentionable"" for my genitals as well."
68 year-old man respiratory distress and tightness in-
Save your breath.
"Hello, dad."
Never thought you'd call me that again after I left.
Dr. Cox!
Why do you wish to know?
No reason
"I fear for his safety, that is all"
"I'm sworn to protect him as well as yourself, Your Majesty"
"Thank you, Rufio"
For your loyalty
There were supposed to be only six legions!
"lmperator, we must withdraw"
"Have you lost your courage, General?"
It's not a question of courage
These are Roman soldiers
It's not right for them to have to fight their fellow countrymen
"We fight to win, Commander?"
We fight to win!
Charge!
Anthony!
Get Olympos!
We must get Caesarian out of the city now!
"Caesarian, Caesarian!"
You're going on a trip
"A beautiful ship is going to take you to lndia, a land of many wonders"
Aren't you coming with me?
"No, Mama has to stay here"
Are you going to die?
No
I don't want you to die!
I don't want to go!
What news?
We couldn't stop them...too many!
Octavius is coming!
You must go my son
You know why?
I'm a public official.
I feel it's my responsibility to be as frank as possible
"You know, if this truth thing catches on###, I'm gonna be out of a job. are you going to continue having sexual cooper, even while she's still working for you?"
We've never had sex
Yeah right
No really it's true
I want you to listen to me.
I'm gonna say this again.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman Ms. Cooper.
It's almost lunch time Paul
How are you feeling
Get out.
I'm over you
"You know, you want it"
"I've got a perfectly good egg salad sandwich, all right?"
It's got everything you want.
Except meatballs
"Okay, you're fine."
Don't even think about it
Put it out of your head###
Meat
Ball
Shut up
All of you shut up
"Look, sir, this is an easy fix."
All you gotta do is go back out there and tell them the truth
I told them the truth
"Yeah, but it wasn't the truth they wanted to hear, so to them it's a lie."
I lied? it's only a lie if you don't say it.
Say what the truth
Whose truth
Theirs
"Evenin' sirs, welcome to SPACE hooters!"
The finest in tit related eatin' and drinkin' this side of the galaxy.
Can I start you boys off with somethin'?
Maybe a Tatooine Titty Twister or a Dagobah Dirt Bomb?
Just the bottle service.
Bottle service coming right up!
I have a bad feeling about this.
I think it's just early.
What?
The guests are Jedi?
I know trouble when I sees it.
Believe you me these boys is covered in it.
We're screwed!
You know the Jedi reputation.
"Listen, we have to get them out of here."
Peacefully.
How are we going to do that?
"I mean, we can't just kick them out."
"Whatever you do, do not piss these guys off."
Is it normal to make us wait this long?
Relax!
I'd like to try their hot wings.
I'm actually hungry.
"You boys expectin' ladies, or is this just a sausage festival?"
Not that there's anything wrong with a sausage festival.
Say sausage one more time.
Sausage.
Let me guess.
The Jedi were perfect gentlemen... ...paid their bill in full... ...and left with no fuss.
No!
They skip out on their bill!
They steal from the cash register!
"I'm sorry, No Ri."
This is nothing.
I'm already used to it.
"After Eun Jo got admitted, everyday is fun."
I can learn from Seung Jo hyung.
And I have laughed a lot because of Ha Ni noona.
I wasn't intending to be funny though...
"Okay, let's just rest for today."
"When your fever goes down, I'll teach you again."
Yes.
What is his sickness?
It seems like he has a problem with his heart.
"Oh, I see."
"That little kid has to get shots, take tests, and eat bitter medicine everyday."
He can't even do everything he wants to do.
There's no use in your crying.
That's right.
"If it was you, you could have done something to help him."
What can I do?
You're a genius.
"So if you put your mind into being a doctor, you can easily do it."
"So, it would be great if you could be a doctor, so you could heal many people like No Ri."
Everyone would be grateful towards you.
How does it sound?
"If you tell me to become a doctor, does that mean I have to become a doctor?"
"Yeah, please do it."
It's a really good idea right?
Well...
Being a doctor is best for you.
Baek Seung Jo wearing an all white lab coat...
I want to see you like that.
You're incorrigible . . .
You go ahead.
I'll bring your baggage.
"It's okay, abi."
I got it.
"- Give me one of them, if you want."
"- It's okay, you go ahead."
The fridge is full of food.
And I had the house cleaned yesterday.
Have a nice time in there.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
No one can bother you here.
Good bye.
"Call me, if you need anything."
And I bring it to you.
- Bye bye.
- All right.
So... ... guess this'll be our home for a while.
Just ours.
[Music]
I miss her smile.
She had an amazing smile.
"One time, I remember she had just gotten her braces off, and she thought she was for sure that she was going to go work for a toothpaste company, and be one of those people that had their smile on the toothpaste box."
[Music]
The morning of November the 10th was just a regular day.
Alex didn't have to be at school till 9:30 because of her college classes that she was taking in high school.
"So, Katrina and I went on to school."
"When I left, I just called her name and said, ""I'm leaving!"""
"And she went, ""Wait a minute!"""
"And she came running out of her room, and she came up there, and gave me a hug, and pushed her hair back"
"like she did every day, and I kissed her on the forehead, and said ""Be good today."""
And I left.
This is what I'm afraid of. woman:
That my husband will leave me for another wife because of a lack of you know what. child speaking native language:
Divorce.
Divorce.
How awful! woman:
I fear loneliness. man:
Not waking up one morning... and nobody finding you for a week.
That'd be interesting. woman:
Losing someone you love.
"That's why I find it very hard to really, really connect with someone."
"Because, what do you do when they're gone? girl:"
Because what if God isn't real?
"I believe in Him, but what if God isn't real?"
"And we're just going to lie in the ground, dead forever? woman:"
"And that's what I'm afraid of, being in this grave."
"Life is so freakin' short, you know?"
man:
"Dying, I guess."
[animal bells ringing]
[thunder rumbling]
[dog growling]
[man speaking native language] man:
The dogs are frightened of thunder. man speaking native language:
"Yeah, they're scared. man:"
"Vasya, we need to find some fireworks somewhere."
"Because in autumn, wolves will come. man:"
We need to hurry home.
It's going to rain!
all:
3...2...1... [cheering]
man:
Welcome to The Love Parade.
"Anyway, I don't want to focus too much on that."
You can play around with that if you like.
Minus this whole thing evaluated at 0.
So what's e to the minus 0?
"Well, e to the minus 0 is 1."
Right?
That's e to the 0.
"We have a minus 1, so it becomes plus 1 times-- now, sine of 0 is 0."
"Minus 1 over s squared, cosine of 0."
Let's see.
"Cosine of 0 is 1, so we have minus 1 over s squared, minus 1 over s squared, times 1."
So that is equal to minus 1 over s squared.
"And I think I made a mistake, because I shouldn't be having a negative number here."
So let's backtrack.
Maybe this isn't a negative number?
"Let's see, infinity, right?"
This whole thing is 0.
"When when you put 0 here, this becomes a minus 1."
Yeah.
So either this is a plus or this is a plus.
"Let's see where I made my mistake. e to the minus st-- oh, I see where my mistake is."
Right up here.
"Where I factored out a minus e to the minus st, right?"
Fair enough.
"So that makes this 1 over s, sine of at."
"But if I factor out a minus e to the minus st, this becomes a plus, right?"
"It was a minus here, but I'm factoring out of a minus e to the minus st."
So that's a plus.
This is a plus.
"Boy, I'm glad that was not too difficult to find."
So then this becomes a plus.
And then this becomes a plus.
He's sailing into a trap!
Pull back!
Octavius!
Boarders!
"Your Majesty, you must go below"
Drive them back!
Fight for your Queen!
Force them back!
Where is Antony?
We must find him!
"His flagship sank, Your Majesty"
He might still be alive..
"Forgive me, but he can't survive that"
"Octavius will be searching for you, my Queen"
I can't leave him here I must do something!
You must save yourself while you can!
For Egypt!
Antony!
"Take out the purple sails, have them ready to hoist before Alexandria"
Our victory sails?
"You heard me, now do it!"
"As you wish, Your Highness"
Exactly as I wish
Place the garlands on the bow
On the masts as well
And have the men ready to sing a victory chant... before we sail into Alexandria
I shall not allow my people to see their Queen in defeat
"lsis, my mother don't turn from me now"
Don't turn from Egypt
No!
No!
It's over now
I paint the rhinoceros
"Si, you have sad eyes"
"And big lips, melting over the hot sand"
With one tear
"Yes and in your tear, another face"
"The Christ face, yes"
"For the zillionth time, Dad, I'm an adult."
You don't have to stalk me.
"Georgia, I said I'm dropping you off."
"Now, just take off that shell and get in the car."
"Dad, my costume is the business."
I don't want it to get crushed.
"You look fantastic, love."
I just don't want you walking around the streets on your own.
Do you have any idea how long it took to get this right?
I have to make an entrance.
What's that?
And what are you supposed to be?
An obese leprechaun?
Anyone can see I'm a stuffed olive.
Stuffed is right.
"What happened to you, Ellen?"
You were supposed to come as a cocktail sausage.
"Well, my mum said no, her being a vegetarian and all."
Jas?
Cheese and pineapple stick?
"Well, the cheese made me look fat and yellow washes me out."
I didn't know how to be a vol au vent.
But we said we'd all go as hors d'oeuvres to be original.
It was supposed to be a laugh.
But boys don't like girls for funniness.
"- Sorry, Georgia."
Whatever will happen will happen.
I don't care anymore.
Then everyone will know that it's an arranged marriage and you took money for it.
This and everything will be revealed to public.
And then not even my uncle and Münir Abi can save us.
Then we'll all end up in prison.
Kerim...
Do you have any idea what it means to go to prison as a rapist?
Who do you think is responsible for the news?
"Hey, could it be your Ebe Nine?"
Who else could have gotten suspicions and spoke with that newsman?
- Maybe it's Galip Usta.
- Of course...
- Galip Usta is good friends with Newsman Ahmet.
- And he hates us.
I bet it's your Galip Usta told him everything.
I bet it's him.
"Oh, Kerim..."
Don't know...
Maybe it's someone else.
"I mean, it can be anyone."
There were mixed thoughts regarding the incident.
- So it can be anyone...
"- Anyway, it's okay."
It doesn't matter now.
We need to be careful from now on.
"If they reach you and try to make you talk... ... you shouldn't give them anything, no matter how hard they try, you understand?"
"Or else, we will all be toast."
It'll ruin us all.
- Who is it?
- Vural.
Don't answer it.
Just run away.
Just run.
Don't ask why you're going to get the eight pages; just go get them.
Don't play it at night.
You will... you'll die.
Don't play it alone at all.
Or in the dark... you two.
"(Finebros) And finally, will you ever play ""Slender"" again?"
- Probably not.
- Never.
"- God, no!"
- No!
Maybe to see if it has the same effect.
"Maybe if I'm, like with my friends in broad daylight, yeah."
Yes.
I am going to go play it.
Yes.
"Yes, I will."
"I know, for some reason, I'm gonna end up playing it again."
"Curiosity is gonna get the best of me, and I'ma play it again."
"Thanks for watching ""Teens React."""
"If you liked the video, make sure you give it a thumbs-up or the Slender Man might get ya."
"Make sure you subscribe, or I'll send Slender Man after you and your children."
"If you're scared of Slender, just listen to this joke, okay?"
What do you call a shoe made from a banana?
A slipper.
Ha!
"I'll see you next time, unless Slender Man gets me."
"(feigning scream, chuckles)"
Ajahn Brahm:
"Okay, I did notice there's a few people with sore throats who've got coughing, so to make it nice and peaceful during the talk can we all cough in unison at the beginning"
[laughter] and have it all done away.
This is Brooklyn.
My last solo filming remains.
It's raining so much right now.
I'm filming a piano scene today.
I hope it comes out well.
"This piano has been with me since the days of ""I Remember""."
Do you remember?
This piano from the gun shot scene and raining scene.
"It's returned for ""Coffee Shop"" as well."
Wearing a white t-shirt and sneakers.
That's my ideal girl.
ls there any girl who looks good in a white t-shirt and sneakers?
The staff has a harder time for this shoot.
"I just need to rap, but everyone else... is out of breath."
The fountain suddenly burst.
All the sound equipment is in there but the fountain suddenly burst.
lsn't this the beauty of filming?
Hey that dog is taking a bath.
He seems happy.
Look at him drinking water.
We're done.
I'm done filming.
Him Chan and Jong Up were supposed to film here too.
But the NY weather is not good today.
It's cold and raining a lot.
"Unfortunately, we have to stop filming."
So everyone has to go to the studio for group filming.
There's more working than playing in NY.
But I'm still happy.
When else could I come here?
We just talked about our taste for music and dancing.
He says I have very good control.
Let's do it again.
- All right.
Last and final tour of the lmperial Drama and Comedy Theatre soloist.
What markets there used to be in those rich lands!
And now?
Nothing but freedom.
Got to pull in your belts under the new chief.
Orders are to trade and be jolly.
No peaceful sleeping these days.
"I'm telling you, my dears:"
Empty your storehouses before you have them emptied for you.
"Come and see, Granny!"
It's our last performance.
I'm just passing through.
I'm leaving tonight by the last horse.
"Back home to Odessa, city of songs and chestnuts."
"I'm Buba Kastorsky, Maker of original songs."
"I sing my songs, I think, alright."
"I sing to the left, I sing to the right,"
The public always finds My songs a delight.
And why so?
Because...
"I'm Buba Kastorsky, Maker of original songs."
"There's rumours afloat, The old women say"
You can hear the cock At break of day:
Cockadoodledo!
"I'm Buba Kastorsky, Maker of original songs."
"I see my cow, Nyurka, and a piece of paper on her horn."
"It said: "" Here's your cow, Aunt Darya."
Don't fear.
"We'll get the bandits! """
Their sign is the cuckoo's call and the cock's answer.
"You're in love with him too, Doe Eyes!"
Just drink.
Please forgive me for not accompanying you today.
I ran away.
So you shouldn't have come with me anyway.
Can you guess where the tea leaves are?
Here.
I was watching the whole time.
- It's no fun playing with you.
- Let me do it again.
"I've become a bit strange, haven't I?"
But I feel really at ease.
"You're drinking too much, aren't you?"
You should only be drinking from crystal clear streams.
It's because I'm so happy to see you!
"Now that we've spent some time, we should take our leave."
Just stay a while longer.
It feels like olden days when I'm with you.
It feels like Gil Dong is with us like olden days!
"When I'm with you, I'm so happy because"
I can talk about Gil Dong with you.
"I thought you'd forgotten about him, but it seems you haven't."
I shouldn't think of Gil Dong.
I forgot again.
Stupid!
"Even though Gil Dong is dead, we should still remember him from time to time."
But I shouldn't think about him at all.
Because... then I can't go on.
I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't eat.
I couldn't stop crying.
I saw Gil Dong everywhere like it was a dream. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I kept calling him to go with him.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But he would just vanish.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"May it be easy, dot com.."
What's up?- you tell me..(the news comes from you).
What?
I am saying news come from you.
Anyhow you follow the two sides.
"What are you saying, man?"
"I'm saying anything... whatever, what can i tell you.."
"What kind of a girl are you, man?"
How do you play with everyone separately?
"Look here, you, what are you bullying around?"
"While your best friend was living a tragedy last night, you went to hang out with the others."
How was it?
Did you have fun at least?
"Whith who did i go, i don't understand?"
With Hale and others...Now you blackbirded to Mira for atonement....
Congratulations.
"I'm looking, even there is no Sun to have affected your head.But firstly, last night I was at home all the time ."
We talked with Mira by phone until this morning.
"So ,this night you were not with Orkun and others?"
First repair your head...
Unbalanced!
Well balanced!
(Stable) !
"Yaman, where?"
"I am going to the other side to my neighborhood,I have things to do on the reeve."
Jump in..
"No, thanks, the bus is coming.."
"Come on, get it."
I was going to piano lesson.
I could not stay at home.
"I wanted to get out as soon as possible. get in, i 'il drive you, and we can talk as well."
I will get out by the metro station.
"Duriye Teyze, I swear..."
You should have seen it..
"He aimed at the most vile, problematic person in the garden..."
Oh Gosh...
Unbelievable...
"Yasar dude, have you seen what your brother did?"
Good job...
"You are raising a child there, it seems.."
Why didn't you play long donkey and five stones?
The man has gone...
My husband has gone...And you don't even care...
My son has gone...
"It is only Narin who can do something about this, but... the Doctor is not going to say anything to her, either."
Give that to me...
You go and bring the cold meals from the downstairs.
Stuffed grape leaves and beans...
Asiye!
Go away!
Don't spill your poison here...
It is easy for you to say go...
You didn't see Mustafa in the nuthouse.
"But, I did."
I wish I were blind and didn't see him in that condition.
He is finished Hatun Abla.
They ruined my husband!
"Not just me, he doesn't even recognize his parents."
He looked at us as if he was a five year old kid.
They just don't diaper him; it is that terrible...
"We took old pictures there,  thinking that they may help him to remember..."
He only recognized Narin.
He pointed at her with his finger.
He has kept only... ...Narin in his mind.
"Until then, that name did not exist."
"And so, the name ""christian"" was made to name Jesus's disciples."
"Christian, in its true form, it is the disciple of Jesus."
Jesus's follower.
But Jesus wants followers?
He wants disciples?
Of course!
The last word before going to the heavens was:
"""Therefore, go and make disciples."""
The last thing He said!
"Normally, the last words of a man is the most important thing, the legacy he will leave."
Jesus said:
"""I have been given all authority"""
"""in heaven and on earth."""
He begins with this.
Matthew 28.18.
"""I have been given all authority"""
"""in heaven and on earth."""
"""Therefore, go and make disciples"""
"Of where? ""of all the nations."""
From all places.
"""I want disciples, in all places,"""
"""of all nations."""
How to make disciples?
He answers:
"""Baptizing them in the name of the Father,"""
"""the Son and of the Holy Spirit,"""
"""and teaching them"" what?"
"""To obey everything I have commanded you."""
"""And surely I am with you always,"""
"""to the very end of the age."""

"Not only my gun, even my brain hits right on target."
No one can cheat me.

You have to strike a deal of diamonds worth 100 million. . . in the swimming pool of Hotel Blue Diamond.
It will be done.

You had to come at 1 1.
- Ask your daughter.
"She woke me up at 12, then how can I come at 1 1?"
Who asked you to run away with my daughter?
Where did I run?
I took her slowly by rickshaw.
I had to pay a fare of Rs.
7 0.
You still haven't paid me that money.
Why should I pay you?
Did you ask me and elope her?
Does any lover of the world . . . ask the girl's father when he is eloping his daughter?
It has become a routine with you.
You eat breakfast and come late to work.
Breakfast?
"Since I have married your daughter, I am eating grams."
of course if they go well as I hope.

Why are you thinking?
Leave it to Faruk to think .
"Yasemin, please bring us some coffee."
Let mine be quite strong please!-Of course.
Tell the captain to prepare the ship for the weekend.
Don't let anything be missing.
"I will invite my friends.- Good ,sir."
"Yes dear, now i'm listening you."
We must do this work before the switch sockets come.
Look!
Master!
I will change my clothes and will go.
"Okay, take your money..(pay)."
What money is that?- It's your pay for the week my boy.
Is that so?
- Were we going to make you work gratis?
May God make it plenty (way of thanking )- Use it with happiness &amp;gt;Thank you.
Hypocrite.

"Your Majesty, Seong-won prince is here to see you."
* 5 years later *
"Your Majesty, Seong-won prince is here to see you."
I haven't seen you for a while.
"Where have you been, my brother?"
I've been wondering without staying in the same place.
"Your Majesty, I'm afraid you look so ill."
"I haven't been well for a few days,  but seeing you is making me feel much better."
How is the world outside of the palace?
The weather is cold enough to have fruits on the  trees and the colors of autumn are beautiful to see.
Your people are taking chrysanthemum flowers to make wine...
"This is happening often, recently."
The royal doctors don't know the reason either.
It's just very frustrating.
He will get better soon.
Your highness need not worry so much.
"You left so sudden, I was worried."
You worried about me?
My thoughtlessness made you both worry.
I'm just glad you come back healthy.

Dance with Fatmagül.Go ahead.
"# I withheld my eyes,# Kept my words quiet."
"# Scattered my ashes,"
It's been so long since I last danced.Was never good at it.# While my flame is alive.
Just leave yourself to the flow of the music.
At least good things like this also happen in our life.
Enjoying this night despite everything... ... the best way of fighting our enemies.
- This is our second dance.- The first one was a reluctant one.
I was excited that day at least as much as today.
"They were beautiful that day, but...Your eyes are even more beautiful now."
"- Mustafa where are you?- I am outside, what's up?"
I'm told you didn't come to work all day.I got worried.
I had some matters to take care of.
"Good then, I was afraid of you and Kerim getting at each other again."
- Nothing happened just yet.- What does it mean now?
Nothing.
I mean don't worry.
- There's nothing I should be afraid of then.- Nope.
"- Alright, good then."
See you later.- Laters.
Damned bastard!
He is acting all bravebecause he knows we depend on him.
"My hands are tiedGod damn it, I can't punish him right now."
We need to remain calmuntil the trial.
How dare he do that to me!
No way Reşat...
I don't think this could be true.
- I expect anything from him... - But not from Meltem.
I don't believe that Meltemwould do such a thing.
But it's the picture that I'm
looking for today.
"Okay, so the row picture."
"All right, so I'm in three dimensions, x,"
y and z.
And I want to take those equations one at a time and ask --
and make a picture of all the points that satisfy --
let's take equation number two.
If I make a picture of all the
"points that satisfy -- all the x, y, z points that solve"
"this equation -- well, first of all,"
"the origin is not one of them. x, y, z -- it being 0, 0, 0 would"
not solve that equation.
So what are some points that do
solve the equation?
"Let's see, maybe if x is one,"
y and z could be zero.
"That would work, right?"
So there's one point.
"I'm looking at this second equation, here, just, to start"
with.
Let's see.
"Also, I guess,"
"if z could be one, x and y could be zero,"
so that would just go straight up that axis.
"And,"
probably I'd want a third point here.
"Let me take x to be zero,"
"z to be zero, then y would be minus a half, right?"
"So there's a third point, somewhere -- oh my -- okay."
Let's see.
I want to put in all the points that satisfy that
Quick recovery.
Thank Godyou're good.
Who's in?
He would not say who it is.

"At your command,sir."
"Mr. Mahir,Did you see who shot you?"
"Yes, his faceis engraved on my memory."
Can you describe him?We'll find it for sure.

Where is my tea???
"Off, what a difficult situation!!!"
"Eh, they are going to be sorry even more, Ibo..."
It's not that easy...
"Don't say that, Seher... it is a pity for everyone."
Wasn't it a pity when they were doing it???
Let's hope we are not guilty of anything...
"See, how they have been torn to pieces.."
I don't think they will be problem free until Narin forgives them..
I doubt Narin will forgive them..
"Inci, I have been calling Narin, but she is not answering her phone."
"Harun went to Ankara... she shouldn't stay there by alone by herself, She should come here, Inci Abla."
"Okay.. relax.. perhaps she is in the garden, has some work to do.. She will come when she finishes her work."

Say hello to him when you see him.
I will go to him on the first opportunity I have.
I'll tell him.

Burning Desires Part Two
[Questioner:]
My whole life I thought I wanted to get married and have a child and live happily ever after.
[Mooji:]
"Yes, Yes Yes.."
[Q:]
Ok?
And it hasn't happened.
I've been in and out of relationships.
And I'm getting older.
"And I still believe I want to find this man, who is going to make me happy and I want to have a child with him."
And I want to live happily ever after.
"And then I find this man, and then I'm finding his faults."
And I don't know if I want him anymore.
I don't know if I want his child.
Because I'm looking for something else.
And I've been doing this most of my life.
[M:]
Yes.
"Some,something. ..It's good, It's good to say"
"It's good to say, because I don't think you're not the only one, Ok?"
[Laughs]
[M:]
Ok.
"So, like this, it's good to speak it out."
"Because then you send, it out again in to the empty, in to space."
"And what is clear, is that this is not actually bringing any happiness."
"It is a sort of like a promise, promise, a sort of something, and keeps you on the move, you see."
But you're aware of this now.
You're aware of that.

So the total preface has less than 300 words.
"They say each paragraph of the preface, and there's 2 of them, has fewer than 150 words."
So the total preface has less than 300 words.
So we could do the same logic.
So that means that the total is going to be less than what?
The total is going to be less than the original number of words plus the preface.
"So it's going to be less than 2,600 plus 300."
"It's going to be less than 2,900."
"Then if you divide both sides by 25 to get the average, 25 goes into 2,900 really four more times."
That's rightŁż
The average is going to be less than-- let me make sure
I'm getting that right.
"So 4, 25 goes into 2,900."
"1, 25, 40, 1, 25."
Then we have 150.
25 goes into 150 six times.
So we have the average is less than 1/16.
So statement 2 alone is sufficient.
"Statement 2 tells us that the average of the words per paragraph is less than 116,which is definitely less than 120."
"So statement 2 alone is sufficient, and statement 1 doesn't help us much."
I'll run out of time.
See you in the next video.

Today's Episode
Vanilla Sugar
"Here, in this little pot, I'll show you."
"There's all the vanillas I save,"
That I let drying.
Moustache:
The smell is amazing!
"Everytime I make something with vanilla bean, I wash it if I put inside the milk or the cream."
"If I didn't put, don't need to wash."
"Then I put it beside my stove and leave there for a couple of days, it'll dry."
"When it dry, I save inside this little pot here, I close it, I let it quite closed."
"When I have the enough quantity for making the vanilla sugar, I make it."
For the vanilla sug...
Moustache:
And what is the enough quantity for making the vanilla sugar?
This is what I'm going to say right now!
"For the vanilla sugar, we will always need the sugar and the vanilla."
SUGAR &amp;amp; VANlLLA
Only.
Nothing more.
Moustache:
"Wonderful, it makes sense."
It makes sense.
And then what happens?
"In this case, here I have 15g of vanilla."
So I need 150g of sugar.
"In other words, we always need 10% of the sugar's weight in vanilla."
So: there's 200g of sugar?
I'm going to use 20g of vanilla.
Moustache:
Wonderful!

"Just like I told you, we heard about a fight and we saw this man, it looked like he was gonna kill the other guy"
What was the reason behind the fight?
He told us he thought the man was gonna rob him
The guy who dad hit was a thief?
"No, he wasn't"
We searched him but found nothing
"Just like you can see, he looks decent"
"Yeah he looks decent and not like a thief, what's wrong?"
I've noticed that there's something weird about your dad
His speech pattern is odd

Yeah he has Alzheimer's

"Cat's like, ""Fuck that shit!"""
"Even though the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker does absolutely nothing, the B and A buttons still work."
"Yeah, you plug the regular controller into it,"
"So while you're standing on the thing, you still use the B and A buttons like normal."
"So even if it did work, what's the point?"
"If I'm holding the controller anyway, why not just use the controller?"
"It blows my mind, it's like, what were they thinking?"

Take it easy!
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

- Welcome Yasar - Thank you.
How nice that you've started cleaning here.
This place is important for Guzelyurt.
There aren't many places like this that people can use.
"I love this place very much, too."
How is your brother?
"In fact, I came here for him."
I am going to ask you something difficult.
My brother doesn't recognize or remember anybody;  my mother... my father... me... his friends... no one...
It must be because he is taking a lot of medicine.
They say so...But they say he shut himself off completely and doesn't talk at all.
He doesn't even eat.
The doctor says that visitors whom he knows will be helpful but...
"He only recognized Narin, from a picture."
It will be very helpful if Narin visits my brother.
"Well, what do you want from me?"
"Doctor Bey, we can't ask Narin this."
"If you ask her as a doctor, maybe she would be convinced."
"How could you ask me something like this, Yasar?"
I've already been involved enough in your family affairs.
And I've paid the price for this greatly.

"It's a bad business, attacking by sea"
"lf we really mean to defeat them, we should do it the Roman way strike quickly, by land!"
"Octavius has us blockaded inside the gulf, General"
We have no choice We must fight our way out
"But General, it's full of dangers"
"The enemy is upon us, comrades"
Prepare your stations
It will be decided here

And I have planned a surprise party for them.
Everyone must be thinking looking at you.. ..that why isn't her husband begging on the streets.
You look like Zhaveri Bazaar's showroom.
It's better than looking like an antique piece in the flea market.
How much does she love me?
Enjoy the party guys.
Go on!
"Excuse me, get me a drink please."
I should do all the work.
"Uncle Bhikhu, were mom and dad always like this.. ..or did this happen after marriage?"
They were sworn enemies.
Their marriage was the second biggest mistake.. ..in the history of mankind.
After the atom bomb.
When actually it wasn't their mistake.. ..but your grandparents.
How is that?
They're dead and all that's left of them are their pictures.
But they still don't like staying next to each other.
Your grandpa Rai Bahadur Dhyanchand.
No one ever took his advice nor was he brave.
Especially before your grandma.
And your grandma Bholi Devi.
She wasn't innocent or a Devi.
Wonder why they got their children married.. ..and sent me here as the dowry?
"""If I had wings, I would soar high."""
"""I would show you the anguish in my heart."""
"Here he comes, the great two-in-one."
Two-in-one?
"- Yes, Kundan Lal."
I am grateful to them

It's the end of year presidential elections and I'm here on the streets... ... to see what citizens really look for in their next presidential candidate.
Someone who is honest and knows how to communicate
I hope that someone who is successful in their field will run.
Someone who is proud for this generation and can blend in with today's values.
If you had to nominate someone?
Announcer Gong Jung Han?
"Gong Jung Han, the announcer."
"If i had to choose, Gong Jung Han."
Do you think he'll really run now?
"If he does, we should vote for him, right?"
We should know what kind of person he is before choose him.
It's ridiculous to vote for him just because he's our next door neighbour.
Gong Jung Han is Jo Ara's Husband.
They're such a lovebirds.
"If her family happy, then wouldn't the nation be happy too?"
Do you think Jo Ara is good?
I'll start the car.
"Honey, please keep our country safe today."
Let's see.
What's this?
Why is this out?
Are you tempted?
Thank you for buying.
My husband was the biggest help before the publication of my book.
He gave up his own study room for me.
And even my son all the way in America helped supervise me writing.
I write this without any exaggerations or lies.
I wanted you all to hear my true voice.
Which part should I read?
And we brought it all to bankruptcy.
"Of course, all the creditors - We tried to get our members their money back."
"Ten cents on the dollar, and they did."
Some of it was interesting.
How did you and De meet then?
I flew down on a Thursday and caught the Friday and Saturday and when I came back I picked up a case of some Irish whiskey.
I knew that a bunch of friends of ours were having a St. Patrick's Day party.
"So we flew in, I grabbed a jug and went on over there and she was making some salads or doing something like that."
She was looking pretty good.
One thing led to another and that was it.
"She had a background on the island, with her family?"
"She knew some friends, that was it."
The friends that she was at...
Maria [?] was married a guy from here.
And different people
They all went to school.
These were the nurses.
They were having a party.
"She wasn't there, but it was the people that she graduated with."
There was a bunch of them that used to stick together.
[?]
"Cole, Donald Cole's wife,"
Ellen [?].
She was one of them.
"So was De a nurse, too?"
"No, she was an executive secretary."
"She hung out with some Beaver Island nurses, and that was her only connection?"
"Yep, she'd never been to the island."
But then she went to Detroit.
I was sparking her for about a year but I wasn't
looking for that ring yet.
But of course she went to
What do you think about Poly's look ?
Shocking ?
"Samia: "" It's pretty """
Aren't you shocked ?
"Mark: "" No, not at all """
Who is more shocking ?
Poly or Gaga ?
"Mark, Samia: "" Gaga, of course :P """
"Poly: "" We give our messages in many different ways """
Why are you having this shocking look ?
What you want from this ? being different ? or gaining fame ?
I want the world to talk about me ? and my look ?
"Poly: "" For me, If I was or wsn't a singer, that's what I want to wear """
"Poly: "" that's I express myself , and of course it'll get you fame,but that's not what I'm looking for"""
You go out with this look with your friends ?
"Poly: "" Basically , yes """
"Poly: "" sometimes I wake up not feeling like wearing any wigs, but that's how I express myself """
Poly:
"""Or I will feel like I'm Strangled, This is my loudest voice """
"You wear like this, to express an idea with your voice ? what's that idea ?"

This number line counts by tens.
We have two hundreds; there's the number two hundred.
"Five tens, hmmm... there's different ways we can do that."
Let's just count by tens.
"Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty."
"Five tens and three ones; not three jumps, but three small ones."
"One, two, three, and we're at two hundred fifty three."
Let's try two hundred fifty three again because there are a number of ways we can do this.
"Again, our number line is counting by tens."
"We're going to start at two hundred, but this time instead of five tens,  let's do one jump of fifty."
"So, we're at two hundred fifty."
"We need three ones, one, two, three, and we're at two hundred fifty three."
"In this lesson you have learned  how to show numbers on a number line by thinking about hundreds, tens, and ones."

Have a nice trip.
[THEME MUSlC]
[INAUDlBLE]
My Damn Channel Live.
"It's me, Beth Hoyt."
It's a big Wednesday show.
"We have not one, but two special guests for you today."
"We've got Julie Klausner, author of the book, ""I Don't"
"Care About Your Band,"" and host of ""The Hit"", and one of my favorite podcasts, ""How Was Your Week?"""
"And if you've listened to ""How Was Your Week?"" Then you've heard the theme song by funny man and indie punk rock legend"
"Ted Leo, who's also here."
"We're going to be playing lots of games, including another round of Fuck, Marry, Kill."
You know how it goes.
"Three names, you know."
Give us some suggestions for that in the chat.
We'll use them.
"First, though, I want to talk about chairs."
I will come with you to Rome
But I want something in return
"Anything, I can be very generous"
Let my son rule Egypt
"Not for the moment, no"
Then let me give Antony an Egyptian burial
"Here, in this place"
"Then I will come to you as the Queen of Egypt, bowing to the might of Rome"
Very well
I'll need time to prepare
And the emblems of my office?
"Of course, you can have them I have no use for them"
I have what I want
Make sure she doesn't harm herself
"Wait for me, Antony"
I won't be long
Where is our Queen?
What have you done with her?
"Why weren't you here to protect me, Rufio?"
"I regret that it was not possible, Your Majesty"
We need to be alone to pray
Away from Roman eyes
I'm afraid I can't allow that
You should know our ways by now
Don't you trust me?
I've trusted you all these years
Where is our Queen?
What have you done with her?
We want our Queen!
We want our Queen!
"Open the doors, Your Majesty!"
Open them now... or I'll have to break them down!
This is step 2.
"OK, what is this?"
"In the figure above, three wires are braided."
"That is, by starting in the order A, B, C--"
"OK, so this is A, B, C-- and then the order changes to B right, because the yellow line is B-- A, C."
"And then we get B, C, A. Right?"
"There's just the order of the strings, left to right."
"Or the braids, or the wires."
OK.
"That is start with the order A, B, C, the outer left wire is brought over wire B, right?"
"This is brought over wire B, to the middle position forming the order shown in step 1."
"Than the outer right wire C, this one, is brought to the new middle position shown in step 2 and so on."
Alternately bringing each new left and each new right wire to the middle.
"At what numbered step does the braid first repeat the original order A, B, C?"
"So what you do is, you first bring the left over the middle, then you bring the right over the middle, then you bring the left over the middle, then you bring the right over the middle."
"So at step 3, what do we have to do?"
So step 1 we brought the left over the middle.
"So we went from A, B, C."
You essentially switch the left and the middle.
"And then step 2, you switch the right and the middle."
"So step 3, we switch B and C again."
Because we're back on the left-hand side.
"So you get C, B, A."
"And then step 4, you're going to switch to the right-hand side."
Step 3 we switched these two.
"Now step 4, we're going to switch these two."
"So you get C, A, B."
"Then in step 5, we're back switched on this side."
"So then you get A, C, B."
"And then step 6, you're going to switch to the right-hand side again."
"So you get A, B, C."
"So by step 6, we repeat."
Really?Tell whether the allegations are true !
"You stole a truck,didn t you?"
"Okay, I understand... we have decided tobring Mahir Karato trial,"
He will remain in hospitaluntil it recovers and then we will take himto prisonuntil the next hearing.
You can go out .
"I could startwith the caseyou were talking about with Mr. Prosecutor,"
So Icould prove...
For this person who is on trial for murderand risks to be sentenced to death...
What? ?
Who do you think you are ?Huh?
Who do you think you areto be able to search for such an important case?
"One of the most important figuresin this country, was killed... killedMy friend and colleague..."
"Do not you ever playwith something about which you have no idea,and want to prove ityou are smart!"
Do you understand?dont Do it again!
Did you knowState Prosecutor?
Do you have any ideawho could kill him?
You with your level of knowledgeyou want to solve it ?!
"Boss,we have not found it yet."
"We've searched,but nothing. he fellinto a black hole!"
He fell!- And then what?
"But we""il find him"
"he can not escape. you will turn everything upside down until you find him,don""t you?"
"Behold, the warrior, you find Ibo or I'll kill you all."
"Now I have somewhere to go,I leave you all to worry about it ."
"All right, boss."
Brother...once again we go back...
Feride hasclose all the doorsfor me and my father...
"She'll hang my father,and throw me in jail..."
"Feride has decided,I know that."
"We'll find a way,do not worry."
"There is no moreno way,bro..."
Just one...
"Well, when the Bradley went down, I flew the guy named Don Hanson."
He was a pilot... coming here all the time.
He had a nice Cessna-180 and the first day...
I have the radio in the basement now.
"Every year, the guy that owns Zenith, it was a fish dock."
Him and my grandfather become really good friends.
From like 1920s or right whenever they started.
"Every time Zenith made a new radio, come out with a different model he gave him a free radio."
He came up in the summer and gave him a new one.
There were Zenith radios with their eyes and everything all over.
And I got the last one.
"Says ""Made expressly for and stolen from"
"Jim Gallagher."" My grandfather's name."
"But anyway, we'd listen to it all night."
We could hear them search and stuff.
"Another uncle of mine, Jack Colton, is in Charlevoix."
He's going to have his 90th birthday here this fall.
He was the exec in the [?].
"And when the call came in, he just took off out with half a crew."
The indicator that tells him it's [?] was painted on both sides.
The engine.
I've been in the basement of one of them
They have different settings.
They're diesel electric.
You go up to like 10 is wide open and then you can push a button and get it up to like twelve.
They went out like that.
Emergency power all the way to Gull Island.
"Those gales, you know nasty."
But the next day I flew with Don and they plowed the runway and just about started to ... up to about that part of the runway.
And it was just slush.
And we took in - As we were getting close to it
The Bradley?
"They say I look like, well, an actor in the movie Seediq Bale!"
And Power Station (a Taiwanese indigenous band)
I feel happy as long as I can dance.
I feel happy as long as somebody is watching me.
I am happy as long as my customers are happy.
I love the feeling living in mountains.
Also I am quite interested in my own cultures.
Every single ceremony gives me another different feeling.
Since I began to work as a guide
"Of course, I started to have some students, five or six,"
Which made me so proud!
"And then, after the typhoon Morakot, I got more students."
"Like Wen-Feng, who became another new guide."
This is what delighted me the most.
So that we can pass down Tanayiku to the next generation.
"My child seems interested in my job, too."
Because sometimes he is with me when I am working as a guide.
"And then, sometimes he told me, ""Mum, you are so great!"""
"And I feel, ""Wow!""......"
Am I really as great as he says?
When the guests like what I cook and eat them all
Then I feel happy
I must try my cooking out
Let's check it out
This is......
"Uh, salt!"
"Haha, this is the spoon for salt"
Hahahahaha
Happiness is......
Perhaps because they live in cities
So they come here for leisure.
To forget about all the pressure of days
I tried a little college.
Picked up a job.
Which was dumb.
I was making about five hundred with my flight pay in the Air Force...
Took a job for a hundred a week when I got out.
I would...
I'd go there for seven years and...
Driving truck where now?
"Oh, just a laundry truck all over Western Michigan."
"We had all the Kroger stores and all the Spartan stores under contract, with aprons and towels, and..."
With Richie Gillespie?
"No, with Richie O'Donnell."
"One of the drivers got hurt, and he knew I was looking for better pay."
And I'd always bonded with him and I went there
I drove there for 7 years.
"I got there, there were 32 drivers, and when they got laid off they were down to - I think it was either 9 or 11."
Synthetic stuff.
"Synthetic smocks, table covers"
"Restaurants quit using cloth napkins and cloth table covers, and the fancy banquet covers, and that was our main business."
"The guys retired, and they'd just never fill them in and never did, and never did."
"So, 7 years later, I was..."
I went to... a year and a half and got a big layoff there.
"'75, I think it was."
What were you doing for Steel Case?
I just worked the shipping department
I was in shipping - file shipping.
"And when I left there - I was laid off from there, and of course, Steel Case always called back, back then, back in the 70s"
I couldn't get a job.
"I was working 3 jobs, $2.50 an hour."
Bartending on weekends for the Amvets.
Because they wanted a guy there Friday and Saturday.
Mowing grass for another guy for $2.50 an hour.
"July 24, 2010."
"It's nearly midnight now, and I'm running out of time to make this."
"I worked all day long, on a Saturday--yeah, I know."
The sad part is...
"I spent all day long hoping for something amazing to happen, something great, something to appreciate this day and to be a part of it and to... show the world that there's something great that can happen every day of your life, in everyone's life."
"But the truth is, it doesn't always happen."
"And for me, today... all day long, nothing really happened."
I want people to know that I'm here.
I don't want to cease to exist.
[thunder rumbling]
"I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that I'm this great person, because..."
I don't think I am... at all.
"I think I'm a normal girl, normal life."
Not interesting enough... to know anything about.
But I want to be.
"And today... even though... even though nothing great really happened, tonight I feel as if something great happened."
[thunder rumbling]
[water dripping rhythmically]
man singing:
I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
I want to reach the greatest mountain.
"Climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach"
"When I know what's in store, raw love."
"Life, a day at a time, my love."
"Life a day at a time, don't know."
Love.
Life in a day and life in a day and life in a day and life in a day...
I want to drink from the clearest water.
"When I take their sum, I get positive 4."
So I can rewrite this equation here.
"I could rewrite it as x plus 7, times x minus 3, is equal to 0."
"And now I can solve this by saying, look, I have two quantities."
Their product is equal to 0.
That means that one or both of them have to be equal to 0.
So that means that x plus 7 is equal to 0.
That's an x.
Or x minus 3 is equal to 0.
I could subtract 7 from both sides of this equation.
And I would get x is equal to negative 7.
"And over here, I can add 3 to both sides of this equation."
And I'll get x is equal to 3.
So both of these numbers are solutions to this equation.
You could try it out.
If you do 7-- negative 7 squared is 49.
"Negative 7 times 4 is minus 28, or negative 28."
And that does indeed equal 21.
And I'll let you try it out with the positive 3.
"Actually, let's just do it."
"3 squared is 9, plus 4 times 3 is 12."
"9 plus 12 is, indeed, 21."
Let's do a bunch more examples.
Let's say I have x squared plus 49 is equal to 14x.
"Once again, whenever you see anything like this, get all of your terms on one side of the equation and get a 0 on the other side."
That's the best way to solve a quadratic equation.
So let's subtract 14x from both sides.
We could write this as x squared minus 14x plus 49 is equal to 0.
"Obviously, 14x minus 14x is 0."
This quantity minus 14x is this quantity right there.
"Now we just have to think about what two numbers, when I take their product, I'm going to get 49, and when I take their sum, I'm going to get negative 14."
"So one, they have to be the same sign because this is a positive number right here."
What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ... but I was getting younger than everybody else?
I was born with some form of disease.
Voice:
What kind of disease?
BP:
I was born old.
Man:
I'm sorry.
BP:
No need to be.
There's nothing wrong with old age.
Girl:
Are you sick?
BP:
"I heard momma and Tizzy whisper, and they said I was gonna die soon."
But ... maybe not.
Girl:
You're different than anybody I've ever met.
BB:
"There were many changes ... some you could see, some you couldn't."
"Hair started growing in all sorts of places, along with other things."
"I felt pretty good, considering."
Ed Ulbrich:
"That was a clip from ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."""
"Many of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story, but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film, the main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt, is completely computer-generated from the neck up."
"Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body."
We've created a completely digital human head.
So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project.
This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.
It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.
"Now, this movie has floated around Hollywood for well over half a century, and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s, with Ron Howard as the director."
We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.
But that was some of the stuff.
"There's a lot of routine stuff, a lot of fun."
Different countries.
50-something countries I got into.
"You can see just, some of them listed and..."
"Bangkok, Tokyo, got all that stuff over there in Vietnam"
Different things.
Fun.
I almost stayed in but there were some conflicts and I didn't...
Conflicts with - ?
"At home here, little things were going on."
"If I had stayed in, at Staff Sergeant, I had orders direct from headquarters from Air Force by name."
They were going to ship the first squad of 130s over to Vietnam.
And I was the instructor.
"And there was another guy who just - he had probably 5 or 6 years, he was just a little more than me, and he would have been the NCOlC in charge, and I would have been in charge of instructing and creating the instructions."
"As soon as I put my foot there, the job called for"
"Master Sergeants, both jobs."
"And the Air Force can fill them with one rank less, if they didn't have a Master"
Sergeant.
"So they guaranteed me Tech Sergeant, so I would have been in the Air Force four and a half years, and would have been Tech"
Sergeant.
"And, hell, this guy was retired with that."
"But, maybe I wouldn't have come out of Vietnam either."
But that wasn't the reason I got out.
Different things were going on at the time.
So about what year did you get out?
The end of '64.
The end of August.
I was just in for four years.
Two thousand hours flying time and another... other airplanes too.
"When you got out, where did you come to?"
I went to Grand Rapids and stayed with one of my sisters.
The guys haven't finished the cake.
The was 1 whole piece and and one piece already bitten
The birthday party was interesting and joyful!
INTERESTlNG AND JOYFUll!
When the guests left the pupil was alone and he started to think
First he thought:
"""Where should I look to?... yet... to all the sides: upwards and downwards, in breadth and deep down to the left and to the right, forward and backwards expands a pointless space of our arythmic efforts and claims"
"So, which side sould I look at?"
MOTHER
THANK YOU
MOTHER
THANK YOU
MOTHER.
Mother gave 1 rouble to the pupil.
"And told him to buy 3 packs of milk 16 copecks each and 1 long loaf of ""RlGA"" bread, if there will be one."
AND WHAT IF THERE WON'T BE ANY???
"Then, buy a half of any ""black"" (rye) bread, but a fresh one!"
The pupil has done everything as the mother told him.
"He has bought 2 packs of milk and a half of ""Borodinsky"" bread"
"Since the ""RlGA"" bread WASN'T THERE!!!!!"
When he came home the pupil has given the purchase to the mother and the change left from 1 rouble
But not all of it!
The mother has allowed him to keep the copper coins
The pupil took a place near the window and started to think
First he though:
"""Twelve per night!?"
"Around 100 - 120... """
Then he thougt:
"""The circle is outlined."
"And nowere to go..."""
"""But if to think properly, the is always one correct solution"""
"At the same time other voices are persistenly saying, that YOU are not alone here."
You divide by something is the same thing as multiplying by its inverse.
So I'm multiplying by the inverse of 1/4.
"So this is going to be equal to-- well, we could divide the numerator and denominator by 2, so the 4 becomes a 2, the 2 becomes a 1."
"5 times 2 is 10/1, So it's just 10."
Part B.
Or let me do every other one.
C. 5/11 divided by 6/7.
"Once again, this is the same thing as 5/11 times the inverse of 6/7, so times 7/6."
"And so we get, this is 5 times 7 is 35 over 66."
And that's in lowest common form or simplified form.
So E.
Let's do E.
"E, we have negative x over 2 divided by 5 over 7."
"Once again, this is the same thing as negative x over 2 times 7/5, which is equal to negative 7x over 10."
Think you're getting the hang of it.
Let's do part G here.
We have a negative 1/3 divided by negative 3/5.
"Well, this is going to be the same thing as negative 1/3 times the inverse of this, times negative 5/3."
I just swapped the numerator and the denominator.
So this is going to be equal to-- the negatives cancel out.
A negative times a negative is a positive.
1 times 5 is 5.
3 times 3 is 9.
Let's do one more.
Let's do I.
Part I. 11 divided by negative x/4.
"Once again, this is the same thing as 11 times the inverse of this."
"The multiplicative inverse of it, times negative 4/x."
"And if this confuses you-- actually, I shouldn't write multiplying."
That looks just like an x.
I should say this the same thing as 11 times negative 4/x.
"Or you could view this as 11 over 1 times-- you could even view it as negative 4/x, which is equal to minus 44/x, or negative 44/x."
"Okay, I worked for Pioneer"
"Hybrid International, out of Adair, illinois."
I worked under plant breeder Dr. Mark Hoffback.
And I reported to Bruce Edson.
He's a senior research associate for Pioneer.
And my project was related with nitrogen-use efficiency corn hybrids.
"The field that I worked with was flooded out not once, not twice, but three times."
And if you there today there is only soybeans that high.
"In other words, we had to contact other research stations around the Midwest and go"
[Text on screen:
"Josh, student intern]: to their nitrogen-use efficiency plots and collect our data."
"So I went to Marion, Iowa; Princeton, illinois; and Johnston, Iowa, which is Pioneer's world headquarters."
And I collected my data from their locations.
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
So what would you say is the most exciting thing about your internship this summer?
Josh:
"The most exciting thing was to work with very smart, intelligent people that know a lot about the maize or the corn crop."
"And most of all, their passion about it."
They really
like what they do.
And it made me like what I do.
Learning from those people is worth more than the paycheck every week.
"Or most importantly meeting those people for down the road future references, for possibly a job after graduation."
Beth Seaton:
That's great.
Thanks a lot for talking with us.
Beth Seaton:
Hi Bill.
William Bailey:
"Hello, Beth."
Beth Seaton:
They said he was a geek.
"Some kids had told him he was worthless, to go hang himself, and I think he got to the point where enough was enough."
"Tonight, a tragic situation."
"A Perkins boy, just 11 years ago, believed to have been desperate enough to take his own life."
This is an awfully complicated and difficult issue.
"Kids will be kids, boys will be boys."
They are just cruel at this age.
"Here what we get is, nothing's wrong, we didn't do anything, everything's fine."
"They punch me, strangle me, take things from me, sit on me."
Give it to him hard.
He is not safe on that bus.
I have been on that bus.
They are just as good as gold.
My voice is not going to fall silent.
I will go to my grave until a difference is made.
"We reached out to parents who have lost kids, parents of kids that are being bullied all over the world, and it took off like wildfire."
All it takes is for one person to stand up.
Be the difference.
"Go out and find that one child, that new kid standing over there by himself."
Be willing to stand up for him.
Everything starts with one and builds up.
"Eventually, we have an army."
"If we all do it together, we will change the world."

I was an average street magician
Famous magicians all have their special tricks
Doing magic with doves and cards
Real stories.
You married the whiny bitch.
"Well, we made them up but they'll remind you of folks you know."
Speaking of horse c*ck
This seriously hurts my titties.
Mine too!
She has a condition.
She does.
It's so wet!
A Series of Unfortunate People
We're gonna need back up.
The walls are closing in on me!
Now.
"Maybe it's in their eyes, ""So amazing, it truly is""..."
"Maybe it's their smile, ""look at that smile, how can you not love this guy?""... whatever it is, ""it's great to see all these kids smile""... these cheerleaders sparkle."
"""It's a gift, it is a gift, there's no other way to say it."""
Patty Mitch is the head coach of the UW Platteville Cheer and Stunt Team.
"The team has 30 athletes, but this year, she brought on eight new members called Sparkles."
"""They are a part of our team."
"They are collegiate cheerleaders as far as we are concerned."""
The Sparkle Effect is a nationwide program that helps children with disabilities become cheerleaders.
"""These kids, you know, they have the same feelings, desires, and dreams as all other kids, and all they want is to be included with everybody else."""
Kim Adams is Devon's mom.
"She was hesitant at first because Devon is in a wheelchair, doesn't speak much, but Devon couldn't wait to put on the orange and blue."
"""I came home and said, 'Devon, do you want to be a cheerleader?' and he smiled from ear to ear going 'yeah!'"""
And Devon wanted to join the team for just one reason.
"""Number one: girls."
"He has got every girl on his team wrapped around his finger."""
"""Let's go blue..."" Lincoln Murphell joined up for a different reason,"
"""because I wanted my dream to come true to become a cheerleader."""
"She tried out for a team in her hometown of Dubuque, Iowa but she was told she wasn't strong enough to participate."
"""That made me sad."""
"In 2002, she starts conversing online with a man named Jim Price."
"They meet, fall in love, and marry."
"He just got me right from the very beginning, and we laughed all the time, and he just was my best friend."
"When she was and Jim were together, it seemed like that was gone."
That didn't matter.
All the baggage of the memories that she had were what kind of put away.
"For a few years, she had doctors to help her, a husband's who adored her."
"Then two years after the marriage, tragedy."
"Jim, a diabetic, died of a stroke at the age of 42, another day relive in full pain over and over again."
And we could say time heals all wounds.
It doesn't for her.
"Her best friend, Wendy LaVoy."
"I think Jill's brave, and I think she has a lot of courage."
And she's my hero because of it.
I don't think she knows that.
She will.
"Before we go, she brings something for me-- an article from almost 40 years ago."
I was in my 20s.
I have no memory at all of this.
"Oh, my gosh."
I think you were working at the White House.
"Oh, good grief."
I was working at the White House.
"In her book The Woman Who Can't Forget, she says she's trying to learn to live forward."
"Inspired by her husband, learning to laugh at her difficult gift."
"What's so great about Jill is Jill will call me on any given day and she'll say, Wendy, do you remember what we did 20 years ago today?"
"I'm like, you're kidding, Jill."
I don't remember what I had for lunch today.
Little cerebellum--
"At the same time, the doctors hope she'll help unlock the secrets of Alzheimer's, of genius, and the way all of us remember."
"I don't want to go too crazy here, but it could-- revolutionize is maybe too big of a word-- it could profoundly influence how we think the brain stores memories."
All right.
I called you.
"positive thinking , greeting to you long time could not see you !!"
Alsalam Alykum
"MY Fmaily , Sudanese family i""m comming today to present a wonderful tons to you ! about sudan , my country i""m gonna talk to the world wide about kindeness , graveness and sudanese generosity"
"let""s all talking about sudan to the worldwide"
Scientists are still mystified by how we retrieve our memories.
Each one of us has about 500 trillion synapses in our brain.
"If we could access all of them, it would be like having an entire Library of Congress in your head."
So could solving the mystery of Jill Price and her memory turn us all into living libraries?
"Once again, Diane Sawyer."
"As we now know, Jill Price has a unique brain that can, in effect, relive her life day-by-day, including watching the TV shows she loved."
I tested her memory with random clips.
"This is ""All in the Family."""
Can she guess which episode from a few seconds?
You ain't ugly.
1975.
"She had her baby on the 22nd of December, 1975, and this was right before."
She's right.
"By the way, she once helped work on a retrospective for CBS."
"Like, ""Who shot JR?"""
"And I would explain what was going on, and when it happened, so it is useful in that respect."
What was the date of that episode?
"""Who Shot JR?"" was on March 21, 1980, but we found out who shot JR on November 21, 1980."
[GUNSHOT]
And I could tell you what I was doing in both of those instances.
"The final episode of ""M*A*S*H""?"
"February 28, 1983, and I could tell you what I was doing that day, and it was raining that day too."
And what about theme songs?
[MUSlC PLAYlNG]
"""Rockford Files."""
We brought one to try to stump her.
"Sister, are you gladyou'll see him again?"
No.
Why is your faceso sad?

There is no waythat the patient can get out of bed he just gained consciencehe should not be moved.
This is what we willexplain to the court
"Come to my office,I will give you the necessary paperwork."
Son...will Mahir be able togo to the hearing? no mrs.
"Feride, did you talkto Ms. Nihan?Will she come?"
For today's hearing willneed to have very strong nerves!
"That son of a bitch will not appear today,doctors would not allow it."
"I still think it's better this way,this time he would not has tostand in front of you and make youeven more nervous."
"Feride, are you okay?Can I do something for you?"
Or are you just upsetfor the hearing?
"See you at the hearing,Turgut."
Mr. Attorney!
"I heard that Mahir Karawill not attend the hearing,do you think it's a good or a bad thing? my dear"
"This is our favor,Of course, because a pencilwill be broken today! we will revengeSuleyman's death today!"
Mahir Kara will not comeand no one will be influencing the decision Feride!
"Where is the son in law will he not come god , god"
"Feride ,If you can stayand give you support."
"No need for that ,Turgut ."
I Will do the in your caseMrs.
Judge?
What a fate !
"Mr. Erda , please the defendant should not speakwithout permission!"
Let's start with the procedure .
With your permission .
Do you want to say somethingin defense of your client ?
Ma'am .
"Judge , defendantaddress is known ."
"Accepts all chargesand admits that he forged official documentsand is fully prepared accessed all hearings,for that matter please defendant Mahir Kara wos brought to trial,but not in a prison."
"Mr. Erdal against the accused Mahir Kare was not only raised the accusation for false identity you will judge him, because of fraud too."
He was also chargedthat is included in the job of weapons smuggling .
Mr. Mahir stoletruck full of bullets!
But I ..
Mr. Mahir !were you that nighton the scene?
Mrs. Judge did read fileI gave you .
Prosecutor Turgut was trying to set me upand cover up his dirty work .
"If you continue with these accusations ,I will raise charges against youfor false accusations and humiliation of the Court"
and you will have to dealthe third case.
Is there any eyewitnesseswho sawthe scene that night ?
"Then someone accused Bulent Tyrjaki ,Your brother in law , and a case full of bulletswas found in his shop ."
It's a trap !
"And you can have a dossierand your brother in law too ,filled with charge!"
"All fabricated lies, ma'am."
Judge !
"We reject all allegationsand declare that we are not guilty ,Mrs. Judge ."
I thought you came to meand said that you werethere that night ? is that correct ?
Have you beenon the sceneor not ?
"Yeah , I was , but .."
I wasfor a good cause .
"Jack had a bucket in his hand, a chicken under his arm, and a pitch fork and a rope at the end of which there was a goat."
"And Jill said, I am feeling very nervous."
"Jack said, Why? I am afraid you may have your way with me."
I am alone with you.
"He said, What do you mean?"
I didnt do anything and my hands are full?
"So she said, You may put the pitch fork down, plant it in the earth, tie the goat to it, put the chicken down and put the bucket over it, couldnt you?"
(Laughter)
"And in the process of holding a relationship, the first moment of meeting the expectations may be common."
"But as every step that we take in life, the expectations may become different."
"Because these expectations keep changing in people, they are not consistent and they cannot be."
One person may be consistent with the same expectation throughout their life; another persons expectations may be changing because his perception and experience of life is changing.
Now relationships become great conflict.
(Applause)
A while ago an old client contacted me.
He was having some trouble at work and he was asking me for coaching
"It was in the early days of August, he was telling me he had some time issues, but I agreed,  so he sent me a message asking me,"
"""Can you make it on Tuesday  at 20 and 8 minutes?"
"The first thing I thought was,  ""At that time of the night?"""
"Plus, he was cynical, he asked for 20:08."
Couldn't it be at 8:30? or 8:00?
"Fine, I forgot about it."
"Ok, I texted him"
A week passed away.
"Next Monday  I sent him a confirmation message,"
"""Where do you want us to meet?"
"""At the office..."""
At that time in the office?
8pm?
Generally they're closed.
"Fine, Ok I tell him, ""I'll see you tomorrow."""
"Automatically he sends me a message,  ""Tomorow?"""
You don't see me in the hood
It's cause I'm doing this man
"Niggas, I'm still grinding, (yeah... )"
"I'm still hearing those sirens,"
"I'm still getting chased by those lights,"
Only the light's mine and my mic's on
"And my time is none because I'm writing more,"
"And I ain't here to meet a soul in this buisness,"
"I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this, (for sure... )"
"And I can't let y'all derail me man,"
"I got young Kobe, homie, you gotta let go of Obie"
"Cause Obie be back, (ain't goin' nowhere man... )"
We got them craps going on
"And that yak going on,"
"Soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin',"
"It's whateva, put that on the chedda man,"
"But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Ivene time,"
"Chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out,"
"This is it my nigga, this what we boast about,"
Now I'm here so shut your motherfuckin mouth
And show me love bitch...
"I just wanna love you for the rest of my life, (I dont love you bitch)"
"I wanna hold you in the morning, (Ha)"
Hold you through the night (Hahaha)
"I just wanna love you for the rest of my life, (We wanna love alcohol, we wanna love guns, )"
"I wanna hold you in the morning, (we wanna love money)"
Hold you through the night. .
(Ha) (we don't wanna love bitches though)
"There's a certain mystique when I speak,"
"That you notice that it's sort a unique,"
"Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep,"
"And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat,"
"Even better, just sweep."
You know what I mean?
(Laughter)
And I am energizing myself  while I am doing that.
"I don't know whether it is helpful, but I think finding times during your day, standing in the copy room... (Bell) (Laughter)"
Thank you brother.
(R. Brady) One bell.
That's fine sometimes.
"Sorry, I'll go a little more faster."
"So, I think there are ways to ... (Laughter) (R. Brady) Outline the summary."
"Okay, thank you."
(Laughter)
(Bell) (Laughter)
"(R. Brady) Thank you Jon, I think this brings up a question that many of us have, which is if we bring mindfulness into our classroom, will there be less time for the other things?"
(Laughter)
So the answer is no.
Katherine Weare is a professor at the Exeter University in UK.
"She has been very involved in social  emotional learning, creating curriculum, and more recently, has been involved  with the creation and evaluation of the .b (dot-be) Mindfulness Curriculum which is developed for secondary students in England by mindfulness practitioners who  are teachers in secondary schools."
"- (R. Brady) So, Katherine ..."
- (K. Weare) Thank you.
Thank you for inviting me here.
"As you get that I am from England,  so I hope you'll understand the accent."
(Laughter)
It is great to be here and looking at these great crowded people can make you feel quite jumped-up really about yourself and feel you are very important  to be sat on this stage.
I went home once after a do like this and I said to my son- he was in the kitchen-
"""I had a great time."
"Somebody came up to me afterwards and said, 'I could listen  to you talk all day'."""
"He said, ""Only because we don't have to."""
(Laughter)
"But I am afraid you have to, for 7 and half minutes, whatever I have left."
"Like everyone here, I have a mindfulness story and it is very similar actually, to some of the earlier ones."
"I was sailing along as a very successful, in inverted commas, academic."
Stop!
"Do not come any closer, Young Miss."
I cannot reveal my identity due to reasons untold.
Then at least tell me your name.
"What is the use of revealing my name, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;when we are like two leaves flying by in the wind?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let us just remember each other by our fragrances in the moonlight.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
But I don't smell anything.
Do not come any closer and ignite the explosives of love in my heart.
But I don't have any fire on me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The light in your eyes is enough to light any fire in a man's heart.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Now that the fire has been put out, I will bid you farewell like the wafting smoke."
Are you telling me to be like fire and go out?
Alright then.
"I'll go. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Farewell, Doe Eyes.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
What did you just say?
I...
I mean...
Do you know me?
No.
"But didn't you just say, ""Farewell, Doe Eyes""? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;No, I said ""Farewell, Goggle Eyes""&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; because you looked like you had bad eyesight."
So you may go.
"In any case, thank you."
I'll repay this favor in the future.
I am Heo Yi Nok.
I sell medicine in front of Merchant Wang's store.
"By the way, I have great eyesight!"
Don't worry about me!
"He hasn't seen her in a year, and yet he can't say what he wants to her."
Wait!
I have a request.
Forgive me for sending you away without showing you my face.
But I cannot reveal myself to you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But I know I will think about you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Please take care of yourself. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm sorry for sending you away like this.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I will not be able to show myself to you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But even so, I will always think about you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I hope that you'll be safe.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Farewell...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stupid girl.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Farewell, Young Miss."
"I want to go to him, Brij let me go!"
"The album was recorded at the Vortex Jazz Club in an afternoon on 4th November 2010, in London, UK."
The music happened spontaneously.
Nothing was premeditated.
"We are affectioned to songs and structures that are born free, but balance themselves out."
Sometimes I'm playing something and I tell myself:
"""I got out of this place!"""
Nice is the water
Nice is the landscape and nice is the possibility for us to be there.
Exactly.
Sometimes we arrive at a place and we really do!
Wow!
Wow!
It was great!
"It was a cool sound man, wasn't it?"
"Yes, I feel it, great!"
Cool!

Alright welcome back.
A little new idea for you here and this one applies to learning and most certainly would threaten to turn our current educational system on its head.
What's unclear is whether it's good for America.
"A California school called the Khan Academy is reinventing traditional teaching by giving students lectures that they can watch at home on their own time, re-watch them if they'd like and then having them do the homework when they're in school in the classroom."
Salman:
"By removing the one size fits all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self pace lecture at home and then when you go to the classroom, letting them do work, having the teacher walk around, having the peers actually be able to interact with each other, these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom."
What's your business here?
Does your son know he's ill?
Does he know what's wrong with him?
How..
And so the the story begins
"City dweller, successful fella"
Thought to himself oops I've got a lot of money
I'm caught in a rat race terminally
I'm a professional cynic but my heart's not in it
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit
Caught up in the centuries anxiety
"Yes, it preys on him, he's getting thin"
"He lives in a house, a very big house in the country"
Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills and piles up analyst bills in the country
"Oh, it's like an animal farm lot's of rural charm in the country"
"He's got morning glory, life's a different story"
"Everything's going jackanory, in touch with his own mortality"
"He's reading balzac, knocking back prozac"
It's a helping hand that makes you feel wonderfully bland
"Oh, it's the centuries remedy"
"For the faint at heart, a new start"
"He lives in a house, a very big house in the country"
He's got a fog in his chest so he needs a lot of rest in the country
"He doesn't drink smoke laugh, takes herbal baths in the country"
Says she's come to no harm on an animal farm in the country
"In the country, in the country"
In the country
"Blow, blow me out  I am so sad, I don't know why"
"Blow, blow me out  I am so sad, I don't know why"
"He lives in a house,  a very big house in the country"
Watching afternoon repeats  and the food he eats in the country
This is SlSTAR
The title song is more  mass oriented song
"In one words, it's like intensity"
"I think it's wanting love, so I think it's loneliness"
I thought it had a lot  of colors to it
Every one of us has  our own part in it
It's a little bit different from the old songs
There are a lot of point  choreography on stage
"For me, I have dance with  a male dancer"
"When Bora is dancing, magic powder comes down"
"For Dasom, she uses  stick and hat to show"
Musical side of the song
We are together again after  a bit of Unit activities
And it's really great to  come back with regular album
We all have very different  colors of our own
You will get to know each members better with the song
Please love us
"This was SlSTAR, thank you!"
Would I get  married before 30
My heat is already tired  from giving love oh
Even from the raindrop sound  My heart hurts
I'm still young and delicate  Naïve and delicate
Have a lot of tears
I cry and ask for it
There's that blank  space full of tears
Give me love That's enough
Would you come  before morning
"I only have you,  like a fool Oh"
I cry all day  Until the day breaks
I don't know if that  sun is the moon
I don't know if  it's night or day
I cry and ask for it
It's rendered to the point of being dry.
"Yeah, you may have some crisp on the skin, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but bananas?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I mean, it's like,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is this a joke?"
"It looks like you plated it and then stepped on it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Sadly, the cook&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on the banana&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is better than the cook on the duck."
Bananas with duck...
You've gone bananas!
That's what's happened.
You've gone [Bleep] bananas.
"The hero of the dish, in my mind, should have been the duck."
You have managed to cook the duck.
Everything else around that is dreadful.
"Samantha, the dish please. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Graham)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What is it?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Samantha) Um, it's pan-seared duck breast of a sweet potato-rhubarb puree, served with a eggplant Napoleon."
You know that that's not cooked.
- Right?
"- I do, sir. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And you put it&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on a plate.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Raw duck and, like, the leaning tower of dryness."
This is not what we're looking for.
"This is bad on so many levels, it's kind of hard to explain. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Scott, let's go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Um, what is that?"
It's a profitol... profiterole with a mashed-up sweet potato and a slice of the duck.
Two whole duck breasts equates to three miniature slices of duck.
- Where's the rest of it?
- I honestly got scared.
"It's embarrassing, Scott."
"Well, at least after the raw duck, we have a duck that has actually seen the frying pan. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You thought&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;it would impress us&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that you could put a slice of duck breast"
- in a profiterole?
- A little over-creative.
Over-creative?
Delusional.
Three embarrassing dishes.
I'm scared.
"If they call my name and they send me home,"
I'm gonna be the first person out of 18 gone.
Exactly as it was the case with the letters ?
your Father has prevented you to see your mother hidLetters from you and that meansYour father is an enemyyour mother.
"My father did nothave any enemy... he didn t ,burn the letters ,just hide them ! did you he readall the letters of your mother... and nevertheless you would stillbelieve that your father did not separated you from your mother ?"
yes mr Judge!This man was reading the letters while pretendingbe a practicing lawyer in the courtand wrote a report about it...
"Since he is the witnessln this case,"
"I want to file a lawsuitagainst this man for fraud,falisfication of documentsand deceiving the court and government officials and should be immediately placedin judicial proceedings!"
The case accepted!
"I 've committedall of these errors, but please believe mewhen I say that my fathernot the enemy nor Suleimannor Kader Altun!"
"If you were, I would have known!"
My father has not committing the crime!
"Mr. Mahir, you can sit down.No further questions."
Does defense have anyquestions for the witness?
"No, Your Honor!"
"Okay, witness may goback to his place."
Your Honor...
I'm not finishedwith my declaration.
I want to tell you what happenedmy family aftermy father was charged with this murder...
"Prison officershave abused my motherwhen they brought her at night to visit my father, that my nephew was been kidnappedand my father was blackmailed over the phoneto admitt all the charges..."
I wish that all thisput in evidence...
It's already been provenand is not applicable to this case.
"Mr. Judge,please listen to me! your requestto speak has been denied!"
"Please believe me,When I explain what my family has gone throughyou'll realize that was set a trap to my father !"
Sit down

ANTHONY:
I was President of one of the fraternities at Cal State Northridge.
"I used to get calls from Dean Peckham on Saturday and Sunday morning at 8:30, because one or more of the fraternities had had some kind of indiscretion, and I was being called on the carpet to explain our misbehavior."
"Of course, I never told my parents that the Dean was calling me for that."
"They were under the impression that I was a very important person to the management of the college, because a dean would call me almost every weekend and ask me to come down to college to help him."
"So, it worked for me."
I hope I helped the dean get the things done that he wanted to do.
It seems he went from there to a tremendous amount of success with the university.

NARRATOR:
Few individuals affiliated with Cal State Northridge are as beloved as Dr. Edmund Peckham.
"The son of two teachers, Ed learned the value of education and mentoring at an early age."
"With a bachelor's from Brown and a master's and Ph.D from Harvard,"
Ed began his service to San Fernando Valley State College in 1967 as Dean of Student Activities and Housing.
Ed was faced with the difficult task of initiating from the ground up a comprehensive program to improve student life on campus.
ANTHONY:
I think Ed's ability to get along with almost everybody was probably his main tremendous strength.
He was able to deal with people in almost any venue and come out looking like everybody's friend.
NARRATOR:
"By 1969, he was named Dean of Students and in 1985 he was named Vice President of Student Affairs."
"Ed was an active administrator, attending Associated Student government meetings, emceeing campus events, and advising many, many student clubs and organizations."
WlLLlAM:
"When we think about campus spirit, we think of Ed Peckham."
He was a colorful person.
He drove a yellow convertible vehicle.
I think it was a Pontiac.
And he'd ride this thing in the Homecoming parades.
He just had a lot of color about him and about his involvement with students.
The embarrassing thing here was that I was prepped to answer this question.
"Well I think just to, I'm sure there are bigger ideas than this, just to stick with the subject I would hope that even though I don't see this in purely generational terms, I would hope that parents begin to realize that handing your kids constantly inundating them with new technologies and giving them motivation to be interrupted all the time and to inundate themselves with information has to be balanced by encouraging them to be attentive, to read, to back away from the technology and to back away from there friends sometimes, and like you said collaboration and conversation is great, but there is a role in the world for solitude and I think that we should encourage our kids and ourselves to practice that as well."
Peter Norvig:
Ok (People Clapping)
So thank you to Nicholas Carr for sharing your incite and vision with us tonight.
This meeting from the common
"Perez, thank you for your kind words as well as sharing my latest Old Spice commercial with your readers"
Receiving accolades from you was truly an honour
"If I were to create a metaphor of blogs using mountains, your blog would be the mighty Everest, sitting on top of a skyscraper"
"And that skyscraper would be sitting on top of one of those rolling library ladders used to reach really, really high shelves"
"And on top of that wildly high ladder mountain, would be the mightiest of falcons, wearing an oxygen mask and flying at an impossibly high altitude"
And this falcon would represent your generous and flattering comments about me and on that falcon's head would be a top hat because top hats are for gentlemen
"Gentlemen like you, Perez."
I thank you.

Whether one approaches the problem from an arts perspective or a natural science perspective what we are giving them is pretty much the toolkit on asking the important questions and then pursuing the answers to those questions on their own.
"Charles Crew, CAS-Psychology Student:"
How I decided
"I really wanted to get into helping to teach as well as helping to conduct research here on campus,"
I started to conduct my own research project in 2009.

No more austerity!
That was the demand from unions in Brussels a day before EU leaders are due to gather in the city for a summit which will be crowned with a new fiscal treaty.
"The pact's aim is to control deficits in the bloc, but as in other parts of Europe which also saw protest action, demonstrators called for a new strategy."
"""Come up with another policy, your policy of austerity isn't working and is creating a gulf between citizens and you the leaders of Europe."" said one protester."
"""Greece is in the red."
"But Swiss banks hold Greek assets which are worth three times more than that country's public debt, so there is a way of finding the money without workers having to pay,"" said another women at the rally which was held in front of the EU Commission."
"Reporting from the protest euronews"" Gülsüm Alan said:"
"""As anti-austerity rallies take place across Europe, EU leaders are getting ready to sign on new fiscal treaty here in Brussels this Friday."
"Instead of solving the bloc's problems Unions believe it will only plunge Europe into a deeper recession."""

"During the 1920s, the Miami-Pittsburgh Land Company bought land near Miami. They planned to build ""Sweetwater Groves.""

"In 1938, Clyde Andrews bought most of the ""Sweetwater Groves"" land and began to sell it for homes. A group of Russian midgets were some of the people who bought the land. They were looking for a place to retire after their career in the circus. They built several homes on the land. These homes were not built for people of normal height. The homes were built smaller than normal so that the group would be comfortable living in them. This caused Sweetwater to be called the ""midget"" community for many years. Sweetwater became incorporated in 1941. . The first mayor of the town was the manager of the group of midgets. The town grew to a population of about 500 people by 1959.

Europa (moon)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Europa is a large moon of the planet Jupiter. It is a little smaller than Earth's Moon and it is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system.
"Europa's diameter is about 3000 kilometers. It probably has an iron core, and an atmosphere that's mostly oxygen. The surface is icy and very smooth. There are not a lot of craters, but there are some cracks and lines. Because the surface is so young and smooth, scientists believe that there is a liquid ocean under the surface, and that it is kept warm by tidal heating. In other words, Jupiter's strong gravitational pull on Europa makes it warm."
The moon Europa was found by Simon Marius in December 1609. Galileo Galilei first saw the moon in January 1610 (he did not know Marius had found it). Simon Marius was the one who had the idea of the name 'Europa'.
"The moon Europa is named after a princess from Greek mythology who became the first queen of Crete. However, people usually called Europa 'Jupiter II' until the middle of the 20th century."

In this town, the abbesses of Quedlinburg had some officials which were called the ""Vögte"" of Gera. These officials were the ancestors of the counts and princes of Reuß, which reigned in Gera for many years, until the year 1918."
"In the early modern period, Gera was famous for making textiles. There were some fires in which a lot of the town was destroyed, for example in 1686 and in 1780. In 1806, Napoleon was in Gera before the Battle of Jena."

"In economics, Jevons paradox is a paradox about resource usage. It is also called Jevons effect, after William Stanley Jevons who first observed it in 1865. Jevons observed that the steam engine James Watt had developed was much more efficient that the earlier model of Thomas Newcomen. Despite this, the use of coal in England increased. The improvements James Watt had introduced made coal a cheap source of energy. As a consequence, Watt's steam engine was more popular, and its use was more widespread. So even though each steam engine used less coal, the demand for coal increased, as there were more steam engines."

Royal Thai General System of Transcription
"The Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS) is the official system used to write Thai words into the Latin alphabet, or romanization. Thai has certain vowel and consonant sounds and other phonemic features that do not exist in English. This means that saying a syllable with a different tone or vowel length can make a completely different word. For these reasons, romanization in Thai presented many challenges. The RTGS only uses the 26 letters in the ISO standard Latin alphabet to spell Thai words. It is used on all documents that require words to be written in the Latin alphabet, including road signs, maps, applications, etc. However, it has many problems. The system does not show tones or vowel length, both of which are phonemic features of Thai. It also does not tell some of the consonant sounds apart."

"John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough"
"John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (26 May 1650 – 16 June 1722) was an important English soldier and statesman. He lived through the rules of five monarchs through the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Rising from a lowly page at the court of the House of Stuart, he faithfully served the Duke of York through the 1670s and early 1680s. This gave him military and political advancement through his brave, clever skill. Churchill helped secure James on the throne."
"However, just three years later he left his Catholic teacher for the Protestant Dutchman, William of Orange. For his help in the Glorious Revolution, William at his coronation made him Earl of Marlborough (pronounced /'mɔ:l b""ə""ɹə/). He served in the early years of the Nine Years' War and became famous. However, charges of Jacobitism made him fall from office. For some time, he was imprisoned in the Tower. When Queen Anne came to throne in 1702, however, Marlborough secured his fame and lots of money."
"His marriage to the quick-tempered Sarah Jennings – Anne's close friend – helped Marlborough's rise. He first became the Captain-Generalcy of British forces. Then he became a duke. Later, he became the richest of all Anne's subjects. Although in the end he could not completely crush his enemies, his victories allowed Britain to rise to very great power.

Battle of Wilson's Creek
"The Battle of Wilson's Creek, also called the ""Bull Run of the West"", was a battle of the American Civil War. It was the first battle that took place west of the Mississippi River. Nathaniel Lyon, the Union general, was the first general killed in the Civil war."
Prelude to the battle.
"During the summer of 1861, the Union and Confederate Armies were both trying to control Missouri. By the second week of July 1861, the Union Army of the West commanded by Brigadier general Nathaniel Lyon, camped at Springfield, Missouri. In total, he had about 5,400 soldiers in his command."
"About 75 miles to the southwest of Springfield, the pro-Southern Missouri State Guard were camped. They were under the command of Major general Sterling Price. Price was joined by Confederate generals Benjamin McCulloch and Nicholas Bartlett Pearce. Combined their forces numbered about 12,000. In late July both forces started moving closer to together, each army trying to learn what they could about the other. There was a skirmish at Dug Springs, Missouri on August 2. This is near present-day Clever, Missouri. The Union forces won but this is when Lyon realized the Confederates had more than twice the forces he had. The Union forces retreated back to Springfield."
The battle.
"On August 9, 1861, Lyon marched his troops from Springfield to where the Confederates were now camped at Wilson Creek. His plan called for Colonel Franz Sigel to do a flanking maneuver on the Confederates and attack them from their rear. The rest of Lyon's forces would attack from the north."
"On August 10, Sigel's flanking maneuver surprised the Confederate army. It allowed the Union army an early advantage. The two armies fought fiercely in the fields and hills around Wilson's Creek. After six hours of fighting and numerous casualties on both sides, the Union forces withdrew. Siegel's attack had at first proved very successful, but fell apart when he mistook the Confederate 3rd Louisiana for federal troops and allowed them to get too close without being challenged."
"Three times the confederates attacked the Union line and failed to break through all three times. During the battle, Lyon was killed and Major Samuel D. Sturgis replaced him. Meanwhile, Sigel's mistake had cost him the advantage and his forces were routed. After the third attack at about 11:00 am, the Confederates withdrew. With his ammunition running low and his men exhausted he withdrew to Springfield. Too disorganized to follow, the Confederate army did not pursue. Technically, it was a victory for the Confederate Army since the Union Army left the field. However, it can be considered a victory for the Union since they still kept control of Missouri. The Confederate army called the battle of Wilson’s Creek, the Battle of “Oak Hill(s)”."

Five Union Soldiers received the Medal of Honor for their parts in the battle. They were:

When he arrived he was immediately proclaimed Tzar Boris II. Sviatoslav I of Kiev, who had earlier subdued parts of Bulgaria, returned in August 969 and subdued the remaining parts of Bulgaria. He allied himself to Boris II in order to get his Bulgarian soldiers to fight against the Byzantines. The new Byzantine Emperor, John I Tzimisces invaded Bulgaria. By the end of 971 all of Bulgaria was in Byzantine hands. By that time Boris II had abdicated."

Jacques Marquette, a French , was the first European (or person from Europe) to get to the Wisconsin River and write down the name. He reached the Wisconsin River in 1673. He wrote the name of the river as ""Meskousing"" in his journal. Over time, other explorers from France this name into ""Ouisconsin"". This is now the French name for the Wisconsin River. As of 1845, the government of the Wisconsin Territory gave the name ""Wisconsin"" to the Wisconsin River."

Other rivers that make up the border of Wisconsin include the Mississippi River and St. Croix Rivers to the west and the Menominee River to the northeast."
"Wisconsin has a lot of different kinds of geography and is very diverse. Wisconsin is made up of five main areas of geography. The Lake Superior Lowland to the north is an area of land that is right against Lake Superior. The Northern Highland area of Wisconsin is to the south of the Lake Superior Lowland. This area contains trees and other kinds of forests. The Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest (1,500,000 acres big), is found in this area. The highest point in Wisconsin, Timms Hill, is in the Northern Highland area. The Central Plain area is found in the central part of Wisconsin. Lots of sandstone , such as the Dells of the Wisconsin River, are found in the Central Plain area. The Eastern Ridges and Lowlands area is found in the southeastern part of Wisconsin.

Farina was settled in 1878 by farmers who thought that if they ploughed the land and planted crops it would rain. It was named Farina after the Latin word for flour. The town was the railhead until 1884 when the railway reached Marree. During the wet years of the 1880s, plans were laid out for a town with 432 ¼-acre blocks. It was believed that it would be good for growing wheat and barley, however normal rainfall is not enough to grow these crops. Several silver and copper mines were dug in the surrounding area."

Siegbert Tarrasch
"Siegbert Tarrasch (Breslau, now Wrocław, 5 March 1862 – Munich, 17 February 1934) was a German doctor, and one of the strongest chess grandmasters of the day."
"Tarrasch was born in Breslau, in Prussian Silesia. He left in 1880 to study medicine, and qualified as a physician. He lived most of his life in Nuremberg, Bavaria, and later in Munich. Tarrasch was born Jewish, and converted to Christianity in 1909. He was a patriotic German, who lost a son in World War I, but he faced antisemitism in the early stages of Nazism."
"Tarrasch won more strong tournaments in the 1890s than any other player, and drew a 22-game match against Mikhail Chigorin, the leading Russian player. Tarrasch was also an influential chess writer, who summarised the chess ideas of the 1890s. It was his ideas against which the hypermoderns reacted in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;p411"
"Occupied with his profession, Tarrasch did not challenge Steinitz, and turned down the young Emanuel Lasker's request for a match. This turned out to be a mistake, for Lasker then challended Steinitz, and won the world chess championship. Later Tarrasch unsuccessfully challenged Lasker for the world championship, in 1908. He was by then past his best, though he continued to play in tournaments for many years. His best result in later years was to reach the final pool in the strong St. Petersburg 1914 tournament. He came fourth, behind Lasker, Capablanca and Alekhine."
Chess author.
"Tarrasch was a highly esteemed chess writer. His ""Dreihundert Schachpartien"" (1895; 300 chess games) was a landmark; it was the first 'best game collection' with in-depth annotations. The notes were readable and could be understood by ordinary players. This led to his being described as the ""praeceptor mundi"", which is Latin for 'teacher of the world'. The book was called by the American grandmaster Reuben Fine ""One of the monuments of our game"".f/w"
"Tarrasch regularly wrote tournament reports and notes for games in the ""Deutsch Schachzeitung"", the German-language chess magazine. These annotations were read throughout the world, since that was the leading chess magazine of the day."
"In his later elementary textbook ""The game of chess"" (1931) he wrote"

Manslaughter
"Manslaughter is the crime of killing a person. When a person is killed, lawyers also look at the reasons, and motives why this person was killed. If the death of a person was not on purpose, but the killer did something that resulted in the death of the another person, this is usually called manslaughter, in English. It is less serious than if a person was killed on purpose (sometimes with planning involved), which is called murder, in English. Killing someone in self-defence may be manslaughter. Depending on the circumstances, killing in self-defence may be no crime at all. Negligent homicide is an even lesser crime."
"Manslaughter is a relatively new legal concept. It was first mentioned in an English statute in 1547, but was interpreted very loosely and not earnestly enforced, instead usually charging with murder. Very few countries had manslaughter on their books until the latter half of the 20th century. In fact, no jurisdiction in the United States had manslaughter on its books until the 20th century. England and the United States were the first two countries to introduce manslaughter into their laws."

The N Judah was cut back to Embarcadero station; the surface part on the Embarcadero was served only by the T Third Street line, plus the J Church line at peak hours.

"When his brother Oswald was killed in 642, the overlordship died with him. Oswald had been king of a combined Bernicia, Deira and Lindsey (kingdom). But Northumbria was divided back into its earlier weaker sub-kingdoms. Penda, now the most powerful king in England took Lindsey. Oswiu became King of Bernicia. Oswine claimed Deira, preventing Oswiu from keeping it with Bernicia. A year after it happened Oswiu recovered parts of his brother's body from the battlefield where he died. Oswiu had Oswald's arm enshrined in his royal centre at Bamburgh and his head was taken to Lindisfarne."
"Oswiu invaded Deira in 651 seeking to reunite Deira with Bernicia. Oswine was betrayed by one of his own noblemen and was murdered in 651 on Oswiu's orders. But the Deirans chose Athelwald, Oswiu's nephew, as their king. Athelwald then aligned himself with Oswiu's enemy, Penda. Deira was under the protection of Mercia for the next three years. But Penda was determined to defeat Oswiu and take Bernicia as well. In 654 Penda raised a large army of some thirty 'legions'. According to Bede, Penda attacked Oswiu several times. With a much smaller force Oswiu attacked Penda's army near the banks of the River Winwaed. Most of the commanders of the thirty legions were killed including King Anna of East Anglia and Penda. From this time Oswiu became the or overlord over all the southern English people including Mercia. Mercia was then divided. North of the River Trent was controlled directly by Oswiu. He made Peada of Mercia, Penda's son, king over the part of Mercia south of the Trent. Peada had married Oswiu's daughter, Alflaed. Peada was murdered five months later by Alflaed, possibly on Oswiu's orders. Mercians rebelled against Oswiu and Peada's brother Wulfhere became king of Mercia."
Easter controversy.
"When Oswiu and Eanflaed were married, he was raised in the Celtic church while she was raised in the Roman church. The main difference was how each calculated the date of Easter. Members of the Celtic church might be celebrating Easter while the Roman church was celebrating Lent. In 658 his son Alfrith, who now supported the Roman Church, replaced several of his Celtic church officials with those from the Roman church."
"To resolve the differences between the two religions in his kingdom, Oswiu called for a in 664. Called the Synod of Whitby it was to decide on when to celebrate Easter and what rules the monasteries in Northumbria would follow. Members of the church were summoned from all over the north. The Roman position was given by Wilfrid who would afterwards become Bishop of Northumbria. Bishop Colmán argued for the Ionan calculation of Easter given them by Columba, founder of their order. Oswiu made the decision in favor of the Roman practice, uniting Northumbria under one religion. It joined Northumbrian religious practices to those of the southern English."
"Bede, in his ""Ecclesiastical History"", Book IV, chapter 5 gives the date of Oswiu's death as 15 February, 670 and his age at 58. His wife Eanflaed retired to the monastery at Whitby. This is where their daughter, also named Enflaed, was brought up. In 680 Enflaed and her daughter became joint abbesses at Whitby. Enflaed died ."

"Quorn, South Australia"
"Quorn is a small town in the Flinders Ranges in the north of South Australia, 39 km northeast of Port Augusta. In 2011 there were 1206 people living in Quorn. Quorn is the home of the Flinders Ranges Council local government area. It is in the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey."
It is also the home of the Pichi Richi Railway.
History.
"The town was surveyed in 1878 and named after Quorndon in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. It was a railway town, part of the railway line being built from Port Augusta. The railway line from Port Augusta to Quorn opened in 1879. It reached Government Gums (Farina) in 1882, Marree in 1884, Oodnadatta in 1890 and Alice Springs in 1929. This railway line later became known as the ""Ghan line"" or Central Australia Railway."
"In 1917, Quorn became the crossroads of the north–south Central Australian Railway and east–west Trans-Australian Railway between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. This made Quorn an important town, as everyone travelling east–west or north–south in Australia passed through Quorn. As a result, many fine buildings were built as the town expanded."
"Quorn's role as a crossroads was lost in 1937 when a standard gauge railway connection was opened between Port Pirie and Port Augusta. However, during World War II, Quorn was a vital service point for trains heading north to Alice Springs. Over one million soldiers passed through on their way to Darwin and on to Papua New Guinea. There were over 50 trains eaxh day during and immediately after World War II. The trains also carried coal mined at Leigh Creek to the new Playford A Power Station in Port Augusta."
"During the 1950s a new standard gauge line was built which did not pass through Quorn. It was built on the western side of The Dutchmans Stern, Mount Arden and Mount Eyre. This line went from Stirling North to Brachina and then followed the original narrow gauge route through Leigh Creek and to Marree. Trains no longer went through the Pichi Richi Pass or Quorn. The only services now operating through Quorn was freight from Peterborough and Hawker. As a result Quorn lost its important railway business and in the 1980s the railway was completely closed as freight was moved to road transport. One unusual aspect of the railway working from Peterborough to Quorn and then on to Hawker was the need for the engine to be turned and joined to the opposite end of the train when arriving at Quorn, as it was not a ""through"" station for the trip from Peterborough to Hawker."
"In 1973 the Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society was formed to keep and protect the unique bridges and stone work that formed the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass between Quorn and Stirling North. At first they only wanted to preserve the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass, but they later got railway carriages and locomotives to provide a tourist service through from Quorn to Port Augusta. TheThey have written a book showing the railway in its heyday."
Tourism.
"A main attraction in Quorn is the Pichi Richi Railway. There are also a self-guided walking tours in the town, included several based around the town's historic old buildings, the railway yards and other historic locations. The Flinders Ranges Visitor Information Centre / Pichi Richi Railway in the Quorn railway station provide visitor information, bookings for the railway, accommodation, tours and souvenirs."

"During a visit to Switzerland in 1961, Beyti Güler was inspired by the renowned butcher Möller's way of preparing meat. When he returned home, he introduced a dish consisting of roasted lamb fillets wrapped in strips of lamb cutlet fat. It came to be named after him when the kebap's fame spread all over the world."
Beyti (Istanbul)
"Beyti is a restaurant in Istanbul, Turkey. It was opened in 1945 in the neighbourhood of Küçükçekmece. It is owned and managed by Beyti Güler. The restaurant specialises in traditional Turkish food, particularly roasted meat."
Background.
"Beyti Güler is descended from Turkic people who fled from Samarkand to Crimea in the 1720s. In the 1870s, after the Crimean War, the family moved to Romania, then part of the Ottoman Empire. The family immigrated to Turkey in 1935."
"In 1945 Beyti and his father opened a small roadside meat restaurant of 30 m² with four tables in the suburbs of Istanbul. The restaurant only had 20 seats, but became popular soon after opening. Many came for the döner kebap that was rarely available elsewhere."
"An article published in 1965 in the ""New York Herald Tribune"" led to international fame. From 1966 to 1974, the restaurant catered daily to four Pan Am airliners. The restaurant served U.S. President Richard Nixon aboard Air Force One during his first official trip to Europe, an opportunity that helped the Turkish kebap (grill) dishes become renowned."

Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award
"In Major League Baseball, the Rookie of the Year Award is given each year to one player from each league as voted on by the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA). The award was start in 1940 by the Chicago chapter of the BBWAA. They selected a winner every year from 1940 through 1946. The award became national in 1947; Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers' first baseman, won the first award. One award was presented for both leagues in 1947 and 1948; since 1949, the honor has been given to one player each in the National and American League. At first, the award was known as the J. Louis Comiskey Memorial Award, named after the Chicago White Sox owner of the 1930s. The award was renamed the Jackie Robinson Award in July 1987, 40 years after Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line."
"Of the 128 players named Rookie of the Year, 14 have been selected for the National Baseball Hall of Fame—Jackie Robinson, five American League players, and eight others from the National League. The award has been shared twice: once by Butch Metzger and Pat Zachry of the National League in 1976; and once by John Castino and Alfredo Griffin of the American League in 1979. Members of the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers have won the most awards of any team (with 16). This is twice the total of the New York Yankees (eight), who have won the most in the American League. Fred Lynn and Ichiro Suzuki are the only two players who have been named Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player in the same year. Fernando Valenzuela is the only player to have won Rookie of the Year and the Cy Young Award in the same year. Sam Jethroe is the oldest player to have won the award, at age 32, 33 days older than 2000 winner Kazuhiro Sasaki (also 32). Buster Posey of the San Francisco Giants and Neftali Feliz of the Texas Rangers are the 2010 winners."
Qualifications and voting.
"From 1947 through 1956, each BBWAA voter had their own rules for decide who was a rookie. In 1957, the BBWAA first defined the term as someone with fewer than 75 at bats or 45 innings pitched in any Major League season before the current season. This guideline was later changed to 90 at bats, 45 innings pitched, or 45 days on a Major League roster before September 1 of the last year. The current rule is 130 at bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster of a Major League club (except for time in military service or on the disabled list) before September 1 was first used in 1971. Since 1980, each voter names three rookies: a first-place choice is given five points, a second-place choice three points, and a third-place choice one point. The award goes to the player who receives the most total points. Edinson Volquez received three second-place votes in 2008 even though he was not a rookie under the award's definition."
"Some baseball writers have criticized the voting in recent years because several players who played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) have won the award. These winners include Hideo Nomo in 1995, Kazuhiro Sasaki in 2000, and Ichiro Suzuki in 2001. The current definition of rookie for the award is based only on Major League playing. Some writers feel that past NPB players are not true rookies because of their past professional playing. This issue came up in 2003 when Hideki Matsui lost the AL award to Ángel Berroa in a close vote. Jim Souhan of the ""Minneapolis Star Tribune"" said he did not think Matsui was a rookie in 2003 because ""it would be an insult to the Japanese league to pretend that experience didn't count."" ""The Japan Times"" had a story in 2007 on calling Daisuke Matsuzaka, Kei Igawa, and Hideki Okajima as rookies, saying ""[t]hese guys aren't rookies."" Past winners such as Jackie Robinson, Don Newcombe, and Sam Jethroe had professional experience in the Negro Leagues."

"Uh, he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

"As far as  just having handguns around to, to have them, I don't believe that you should have handguns around."
"Right,"

Right.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
I agree too.
"I, uh,"
"it's, it's, as far as the ban goes and everything, I don't think it's possible, uh, to completely ban guns."
There's just too many.
"Well, no."
"There's too many sports people out there that, that do do these things."
"Right,"
"and I,"
"yeah,"
"right,"
"I mean,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"And I mean the, the technology's not that hard."
"I mean, you could make a gun, you know, from simple, you know, you know."
"Yeah,"
"well I suppose you could. Uh,"
"and I say that's great, why not, you know."
"Oh, my,"

"Yes,"
"why not because that's a, a lot of times, well, it's,"
"I believe that, uh, we in that category,"
and I'm not in that category quite yet
No.
"but, we are seasoned minds."
"Oh, yeah,"

No.
We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning
"At seven,"
yeah.
"We're past, yeah, we're past that age"
Really.
"It's not like driving a, a Winnebago or something."
"Oh, no"
"No,"
no.
"See, I'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now"
and they go isn't that a nice van
"and I go, um."
"Not really, you know."
How about  a Greyhound bus
Nice.
Yeah.
Nice isn't the word I'd choose.
Maybe practical.
Yeah.
"I mean that, you know."
Isn't that a practical van.
There's some that are prettier than others
and
"yeah,"
"the new type is prettier than what their, they used to look like"
"but I sure don't think it's attractive, you know."
"It's not like, like driving a little sports car."
Yeah.
"It, it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive."
Yeah.
I don't think that happens
"so, but I, I love mine,"
"so, and I, I bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii"
and I just went home
and I walked in
and I picked it out
Oh my goodness.
"And with our budget cuts, I'm sure  that's not going to not going to change anytime soon."
Yeah.
"Well that's the only way they're. Yeah, well, that's the only way they're going to be able to do it."
And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that.
Oh my goodness.
"So, in some ways I think the, the day schools do serve those purposes."
Yeah.
That's true.
"Well even the preschools, you know they get so much of that in preschool"
"and then when they hit kindergarten, you know, it's like wham  Culture shock."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's just,"
Put the colors away
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Get the computers out
Which is too bad.
"and, you know."
Uh-huh.
hard.
Uh-huh.
It's so difficult for them.
"Um, did you have your children, did you say in home, in, in, private care,"
was that in your home or in someone else's home?
Until they were two.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
both times they were at our house.
Uh-huh.
So you were able to have somebody come there.
"and,"
"Yeah,"
that's easy.
"I always like to have that, too."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Everybody seems to like that, too."
"I know,"
I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't.
"No,"
everybody likes that.
Yeah.
"And, then, uh, if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven, then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there, you know. Especially if a pork roast."
"Oh, yeah."
"That's what I love, with my"
"I like it, too."
"I do, too."
"And, uh, other than that, in fact, I'm just thinking of what next weekend when the Super Bowl's on"
Uh-huh.
I've asked a couple people to come over
"and I just, uh, had been thinking what to have for that"
Yeah.
"Well, have you had any good ideas yet?"
No
not yet
"Oh, okay."
"No,"
"and I, you know, I don't want to have to come away from the T V."
I want something that I can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the T V.
Yeah.
"You know, so, I'll think of something, just that we can munch on over there, you know."
Yeah.
"and it has not, really. Which is a bit of a disappointment."
"But it is very warm here, which is typical for this part of the, time of the year."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
How about
"I think you are, I think you are earlier than we are, as a rule, aren't you?"
"Your, your, your growing Summer starts a lot earlier than ours."
"It starts in, uh, March as a rule."
Uh-huh.
"See that is quite a bit,"
we are just beginning.
"People are, have got their gardens in, a lot of them now."
We could still have a frost.
"Really,"
this late?
Uh-huh.
Could you have snow?
"Uh, probably not."
"But we have had, we have had a frost as late as, as in June."
"Oh, well, we do not have that problem"
Early June.
"So, but we have also had nice weather. An unusually, uh, nice Spring."
It is almost like an early Summer for us.
"Oh, that is nice."
Uh-huh.
"We could use a little more rain, I believe."
"Uh, well, we will be glad, I will be glad to give you some of ours"
Uh
"Usually we get it in, in great quantities in April and May."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then it stops for three months.
and they put him on the scale
and he's up to ninety four now.
Oh.
"But he's not a real, he's not a real tall, uh, dog for a Golden Retriever."
"He's kind of stocky, shorter and stockier."
Um.
"But,"
Is he good with family?
He is.
"It's, uh, just me and my wife"
"and, uh, he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids."
We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten.
"Yeah,"
I can understand that
"Because I,"
Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids
Uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, we have a cat who's also about four years old."
Oh.
"And he's our spoiled child right now, too"
Uh-huh.
And he also sheds a lot.
Yeah.
"But, we, uh, we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday."
"But we figure we'll get the kids and then the, the dog"
That's probably a good idea.
They're good though.
"Uh, have you ever had a Retriever before?"
"No,"
but my husband had one when he was growing up.
"Because I, I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs."
I find it to be a good out
and I still enjoy the marching band
"and I still enjoy, uh, singing in the choir"
"so,"
Do you sing at choir at your church?
"Yes,"
I do.
Yeah.
"Yes,"
I do.
"That's,"
"in fact, that's about the only musical thing that I still do is sing in the choir."
Yeah.
"I tried out for choir when I was, think, in the seventh grade"
and they wouldn't let me in.
"So, I never tried again."
"Well, I sing in the choir,"
"I do know if they want me to or not,"
but at least I do sing in it
"Yeah,"
That's pretty good.
"Well,"
I never really learned the music or anything.
"I never learned,"
I got right to where I was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano
and that's about when I quit.
"I was at,"
"I actually went to the University of Texas at one time thinking that I would, be a musician."
I wanted to be a high school band director.
Yeah.
"But after one semester of that, I said no, no,"
this isn't for me.
Yeah.
That's
"yeah,"
that's a hard thing about it.
"If, I mean, I I can't foresee myself getting married"
"but if, you know, if I ever wanted to have a kid, how could I work."
"I mean, I don't think I could trust somebody with my kid either."
"Unless it was a friend that, you know, did it in ounds like an airplane their house that I knew well."
"Oh, yeah."
That's true.
Yeah.
"I just, I couldn't do it I don't think."
"It would just rip me apart, I think"
I don't know.
Yeah.
Just not knowing.
"Yeah,"
"just besides the fact that, you know, your, when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait."
"What do you usually wear to,"
"Well, let's see."
"It turns out that, uh,"
I work at TEKTRONIX
"and it's a very, uh, low key place as far as dress goes."
Uh-huh.
"You just wear, uh,"
let's see.
"When I first came here, I wore suits"
"but after a while I got, uh, found out that that wasn't all that important."
I'm an engineer.
"Oh, I see."
"And, uh, so, I get to wear just, uh, how shall I say it, uh, walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and well walking, how shall I say it, kind of like Avia, uh, walking shoes, uh,"
Uh-huh.
It's not getting any better.
"Yeah,"
I can't even hear what you're
"Oh, okay."
"Oh jeez,"
it's gone.
"I don't see, I don't think my phone really does that,"
"but every time I have this phone is a little weird,"
I mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times.
"Well, I don't know,"
there was
"well, whatever it was, there was a second there"
"I couldn't even hear what you were saying,"
"but, um,"
"Yeah,"
"I was beating on the phone going,"
Can you hear me.
"Yeah,"
I guess I was having a hard time there too.
"I thought it sounded,"
"well, I guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh, uh, doing this work."
Yeah.
"But, uh,"
"yeah,"
"I mean, that's a heck of a"
"you must have a lot of different stuff you get out of there,"
"especially up in Vermont there, you should have, uh, some really nice soil."
"Yeah,"
"we grow a lot of, uh, the basic, corn, potatoes."
Uh-huh.
She likes to really get into her pumpkins
"and see how many she can grow. corn, potatoes,"
same here.
"Uh, very seldom are they any different."
"And then, uh, like for groceries and everything, we try to put, like, two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen"
Uh-huh.
and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with.
"Oh, okay."
"And then we put our receipts in there, you know,"
and usually that's enough.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, but I don't have any, you know, small children to have anything extra come up, you know, like, uh, running to the doctor or something like that with them."
Right.
Luckily I don't either.
"I mean, you know, maybe my cat would get sick"
"but, I mean, usually that's not so much that it would throw me off"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
right.
"In fact, I did have to take my dog to the vet the other day"
"But you so you know what I'm saying,"
yeah.
Yeah.
"that, it's worse than having a kid, huh?"
"I,"
sometimes it can be.
Yeah.
Sometimes it can be.
I guess the worst thing I've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things.
Uh-huh.
"But I do try to build in a little extra money each month to, to be able to do that type of thing"
so.
"Yeah,"
"uh, I'm not working right now."
"Well, we've just, uh,"
"it seems like, we've always been at a place where we'd have to go away for the summer or something"
"and, uh, it was,  never convenient to have anything."
Yeah.
we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house.
Yeah.
"Uh, someplace where there, you know,"
we can take care of it and everything.
"We've got,  some children who would just really, uh, enjoy having an animal, you know, a dog, I think"
Yeah.
"and, What about you all?"
Yeah.
"Well, right now I'm a student,"
and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that
"Oh, no."
"No,"
we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat.
Is that right?
Yeah.
They're very strict about it.
"But you like, uh, you like pets and things?"
"Oh, I love animals."
"Oh, yeah ."
"I was raised,"
"our house when I, when I was growing up there was almost never, uh, at least one cat in the house."
Uh-huh.
"It was almost always at least one cat, sometimes, you know, like fifteen or twenty. But, uh, always cats in the house."
"Oh, yeah."
"We, we,  enjoyed them."
Oh.
"We like, we like pets,"
"but, uh, you know, you've got to deal with, uh, taking care of them and, and feeding them and everything like that."
"but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was, uh, it was something, a little different."
"It's a good experience,"
"it helps you feel, I think comfortable with your car and feel like, it's not so, scary if, um, your driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might, you think, well, I've, I've been under that hood"
and I know what's going on
"but,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"I think it's important that everyone know, you know, basically how, how the darn engine works,"
Uh-huh.
"it helps you figure out what's wrong with it, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"I've, I've been out with my sister before when, you know, her car died on the highway"
"and I happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all,"
Women?
"Yeah,"
"the changing roles of women, how roles changed"
and what do you see coming in the future.
"Oh, okay,"
that's not a broad enough topic
"Okay,"
yeah.
Sounds good.
I'm ready when you are.
"Okay,"
hold on.
Okay.
Are you there?
"Yeah,"
I'm here.
"Oh my goodness,"
I can't believe I did that.
"Okay,"
"I mean, it's, it's,"
"and so I'm going, I'm so old"
"and I'm, I, I really have to always tell myself, no, you're not, you're very young."
"No,"
"you're extremely,"
"yeah,"
"it's, it's"
"And, you know, so it's,"
"Well it's like us, we're getting ready to do, if possible, for an adoption"
"and I have friends that say well why would you do that,  if you know you haven't been able to children, which we do know, why would you do that now, at this part, point,"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and, um, it's just individual choices."
Yeah.
"I stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had, um,"
"in my family my brother's children,"
Uh-huh.
"I mean, he just turned forty,"
his children will be out of high school before he's forty-five.
Wow.
"Um, I mean that's like your mother,"

"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
Right.
"It's just, it,"
"but what you find is you don't compare the woman, because you just get into trouble."
It's all independent and choices.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
very true.
"Um, but what I was going to say about mothers is, uh, your mother probably just won't say it,"
"yeah,"
"lot of people don't, don't see the excitement in sailing,"
"but, then, again, they may they may never have tried anything like, uh, catamaran"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, that's when you really start getting into speed. You know,"
"you actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people behind, the skiers,"
"they get so fast, you know."
I didn't know that.
"Yeah,"
"they get pretty quick,"
but
That that would be something.
"uh,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"I haven't, I haven't personally done that,"
"but, uh, the races,"
"I, I work with a guy right now that, uh, races catamarans in the summertime"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, he's pretty gassed about it."
"He's got a good, uh,"
"What kind of, what lake do you all use?"
"Well, he, uh, he's from Detroit"
Uh-huh.
"so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes, I think, and does his sailing. Uh,"
"for me, I, I go back to Orlando, uh, in about a month, and so, down there, basically just go to the coast."
"We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast,"
"and there's a lot of places there you can go, you know."
"So, uh, so that's a good thing."
Yeah.
"But, yeah, so, what do you do for a job?"
"Uh, I build transformers."
"Uh, I do have my radio going most of the day though,"
"so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too, you know."
Okay.
"Do you  get like one of the talk stations, the news stations?"
"But,"
No.
Uh-huh. *listen; mistranscribed 'uh-uh'
"I just have a channel that has music except for, like every hour, you know, say eight o'clock, nine  o'clock, they come on for just a little bit of the news."
Sure.
Right.
"But as far as the actual news, I get that from like a call from the,"
can you hold on just for a second?
Sure.
Just a minute.
answers the other Hello sir comes back to speaker
Yes.
"Yes,"
I'm sorry to keep you waiting
Okay
"Uh, I was calling from work"
so and that was a call waiting.
Right.
"it sounds like you, uh, like the news a lot more than I do."
"Me, I figure if it's something really important, somebody will tell me about it."
"But, uh, you know, I, the thing is if, if I catch the news all the time, it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news."
Or that's what  comes on first.
"Yeah,"
That's true too.
"And, uh, you know, also late at night, you know, I don't like watching the news late at night"
but my wife is usually up then
and so  I can't go to sleep with the T V on.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"and then, you know, if you didn't have a car that had one, then your insurance would go up enormously,"
"Uh-huh,"
"uh-huh,"
"uh, I've got to go"
"my son's in a performance tonight,"
"I have to leave, in a couple of minutes."
"Oh that's okay,"
"Uh, I think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time."
Okay.
"It was good talking to you,"
"Well, you, you too."
Okay.
Good night.
All right
bye bye.
"Okay,"
"Dee, are you familiar with the Latin American policies?"
"Yeah,"
"to a point,"
it's not my best subject.
"Really,"
yeah
"it's not mine either,"
"but, uh, I know, I know our policy,"
"like in Nicaragua, I am familiar with that because we have, uh, some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border"
and they are missionaries there
"and they, they live there"
"and they have to travel by boat forty-five minutes to get to their car and stuff,"
"and uh, I know that they helped a lot of those Sandanistas refugees coming across the border"
and they housed them and stuff.
"They have been down there about three years now,"
"But, um, what I do do, and I've always done it is,"
"at my father's house, we have, my sister and I have a couple of gardens."
"I think we figured out total, this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre."
Uh-huh.
So we each have a third of an acre we do.
"Jeez,"
"that's more than, that's more than the property I have right here, that you've got as a, uh, garden,"
That's a lot
that's amazing.
"Yeah,"
"well, it's my dad's,"
and we've had it for he's been there for a long time
Right.
"so, um, it just happens they built a shopping center next to it"
"Oh, jeez."
"but, um, they put up a nice fence,"
"so we still have a lot of privacy,"
and we grow a lot of food.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I enjoy it,"
"um, the gardens are kind of old,"
"you have to step down in them now because we've tilled them so much,"
Uh-huh.
"but there's still,"
"we, we, my sister uses probably a fertilizer."
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
"But I wish this phone would stop screeching,"
Are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line?
Yes.
"I'm trying,"
I don't know if it's my phone.
This is bad.
Yeah.
"Right,"
"they're kind of the leaders right now, you know."
"I used to see all those commercials for Windows, you know,"
"and you're like, oh, gee, they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name."
"Really,"
"why don't they just say, almost a Mac for half the price."
"Yeah, you know."
They'd sell more if they were honest.
"Exactly,"
"almost is the key word, there, too, you know, because I, I really, I've used both"
and I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all.
"Yeah, it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. base."
"Uh,"
"Yeah, yeah that's true, too."
"But, uh, I don't know,"
"I'm really, I've gotten a little bit out of the, the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home."
"I, I do use a Mac at work"
"but, uh uh, I really don't, don't do much with it at home"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh,"
Apple's sort of making a
and they're ones were
"growling consumer, uh, need to worry about the Mac they're getting,"
"like if you bought a power book straight off, a lot of them had to go back."
They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive.
Right.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"you sound like you must, uh, work in the computer business."
"Yeah,"
"I have one,"
"Gardening in Texas is really interesting, though."
I grew up in Illinois
Yeah.
"and, um, Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry,"
"why, you know, everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has uh, watering system."
Uh-huh.
"And so with that, why, our lawns do stay, um, you know, pretty nice all summer, if you water."
Uh-huh.
"But in the winter, we have Bermuda grass"
Uh-huh.
and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack
"Right,"
yeah.
and and I just think it's ugly
"When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter, you know, and their grass is fairly green."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that's one, one aspect of a lot of those grasses, they go dormant."
"I think the Saint Augustine and, uh, Centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"yeah,"
those two.
Yeah.
"Some people have, I think it's fescue that stays green all winter,"
Yeah.
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer.
They have to water an incredible amount.
"But, um, those those lawns look nice during the winter,"
"but, you know, they almost stick out like a, I guess not a sore thumb, a pretty thumb."
"But, you know, when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except the one, you know,"
"it's sort of like, well,"
"Yes,"
"we're, we're smarter now."
We know what we can do
"Yeah,"
"right,"
"uh, so let's see."
So mine I don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here.
Uh-huh.
"And so the second question, forgot what the second question,"
"What was it, uh,"
what do the trends in families
"and do we approve what other, families do."
"Well, uh, the trends in the families were to spread apart, do your own thing."
That's right.
"But I have seen  lately, yes, I am seeing, I'm seeing a change that, whoops, government can't do it,"
A change?
I was going to say the same thing.
schools are not able to
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and between a person's religion, uh, their, their faith in their maker whether, you know, uh, whether you're Christian or Jewish  or whatever, uh,"
Right.
Right.
and the family
"Are going to have to solve some of the problem, huh."
"those are the two that can, that, that have the wherewithal"
"and, of course, Judeo-Christianity, uh, and of the Jewish folks, too, believe that the family unit is the one that was given the, uh, uh, mission by the Lord to do this very thing."
Uh-huh.
"So when another group of, of, uh, people step in, try to do it, they're, they're tromping on our territory, so to speak,"
so
Oh.
"I firmly believe that, uh,"
Right
"and, and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of,  um, women don't feel like they need to get married anymore."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
uh-huh.
I was twenty-seven when I got married
"and I just at the time, um,"
my husband actually even jokes about it.
Uh-huh.
He was twenty-three when we met
"an I was at a point where it was like, I didn't date,"
"I mean, I just, I went out to have a good time,"
Right.
but I didn't have to have male companionship.
"Right,"
right.
"Um, and a lot of the, um, friends that I had in school at that point, who had gone back and gone to law school, or M B A programs, um, which I also had done, had just, you know, they were very sad."
Uh-huh.
"But then by the time I got married, um,  it seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage track."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"So, I guess that's a big change in terms of, just, um, the attachments that women feel like they need to have, the dependency,  their self-identity is stronger."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"it's, it's just really not there anymore."
Yeah.
"And that, that has to do with, you know, the women getting out and other women seeing, uh, women seeing other women, you know,  out in the corporate world."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"That's like, oh, I can do that."
"You know, maybe,  I don't need to get married."
"Well, uh, normally I like to, to go out fishing in a boat, and, uh, rather than like bank fishing, and just like to try and catch anything that's swimming, because I've had such problems with trying to catch any type of fish, that, uh, I just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing."
"So, you like fresh water."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I've never tried like with, deep, uh, sea water fishing because you get, I get sea sick"
Uh-huh.
Oh I see
"Well, one of these days, I'm hoping they'll have some kind of medicine,"
"so I can go out and go, uh, deep sea fishing."
"Now, that would be nice."
"Well, I was raised on the Texas gulf coast, in the summers,"
Uh-huh.
and during the Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast
Uh-huh.
"and so, I thought fish came out of the ocean"
"Oh, my goodness."
and anything that was fresh water was muddy
Uh-huh.
so I didn't learn to fish in a lake until I was well into my twenties
"so I had, I had always been a, a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun."
Uh-huh.
Oh I bet it is.
There's so many different ways to catch fish.
Uh-huh.
"You know, at night you can go walking in the shallows, and gig flounder and things like that."
"Which isn't technically fishing,"
but it's a lot of fun.
Uh-huh.
"So, I, I grew up fishing."
Uh-huh.
What area of lakes do you like?
"Well, uh, now, I haven't done much fishing here in Texas, uh, because I moved from Ohio,"
"Uh, I don't know."
"I get, probably, most of my information either from the newspaper or from C N N."
"Uh, I like C N N because it, uh, you know, repeats it,"
well HEADLINE NEWS repeats every half hour
but it makes it really convenient cause I keep a rather hectic schedule
"Right,"
yeah.
"and, uh,"
"but the newspaper provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from,"
Yeah.
"I, I think I'd agree."
"A, a similar method of getting the news with me too."
"It's, uh, uh, C N N has been a welcome addition to the T V scene here in the, last, uh, number of years."
"Uh, prior to cable, you know, you didn't get much news off of normal, uh, television broadcasts."
Right.
"Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature"
"and, and I like, uh, C N N because you get some world, world events too uh, which is not too common on, on the other format, newspapers, and so forth."
Uh-huh.
Right.
Yeah.
"I know, the,"
"my only major objection is that, uh, I don't think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada."
"Uh,"
"That, that's true, you know."
"You hardly ever see, uh, headline articles about the, uh, either the economics or, or other news events going on in either of those countries."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, whereas if you pick up a, a European paper, you know, uh, it, all the surrounding countries, Soviet Union, and everything has, uh, major news, uh, articles in them."
Right.
Yeah.
"I mean, you know, Canada has gone through a lot of problems now with, with Quebec and, and everything"

"Littlefoot has been having nightmares of Grandma Longneck falling to her death, which almost occurred during an earthquake, but Grandma Longneck luckily saved herself before she fell. Grandma Longneck comforts and teaches Littlefoot important life lessons called ""Wisdoms"". Later on, Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky, Spike, and Petrie meet three yellow-bellied dinosaurs, Loofah, Doofah, and Foobie. They have lost their way while traveling to distant Berry Valley. Loofah, Doofah, and Foobie seem to be too unintelligent to find their way back, so Littlefoot and the others decide to help their new friends whilst sharing Wisdoms along the way."
"During the trip, Littlefoot and his friends have been pursued by a quartet of Sharpteeth, led by a Sharptooth with a scar that goes around his head. They made it to a Watering Hole and meet other yellow bellies. Earlier, Loofah mentioned a so-called ""wise one"" among the Yellow Bellies but Littlefoot cannot find no sign of him. Littlefoot begins to lead the Yellow Bellies across the Mysterious Beyond to reach the Berry Valley, however, Littlefoot has never been to Berry Valley and worries that he might make unwise decisions while he came to teach the Yellow Bellies how to be wise. His friends reassure him that he should trust in his feelings to let him know what to listen to."
"As an intense storm occurs, Littlefoot leads the Yellow Bellies onto a plateau for shelter, but Doofah becomes separated from the group, going the wrong direction. Once the storm ends, Littlefoot and his friends were able to find her and she rejoins the group. The sharpteeth attack again, but they were able to defeat them when the Yellow Bellies bounced up and down. After the Sharpteeth were defeated, they finally made it to Berry Valley. Foobie is revealed to be the ""Wise One"" all along. Littlefoot and his friends reunite with their family and they return to the Great Valley."

"Delta is an American sitcom starring Delta Burke that aired on ABC from September 15, 1992 to August 25, 1993. It was a new starring vehicle for Burke, as her return to television following her dismissal from the CBS sitcom ""Designing Women"" in the spring of 1991."
"Burke portrays Delta Bishop, a young woman with dreams of writing and singing country music. She became a hairstylist at Mona's House of Hair, married Charlie Bishop and thought she had found happiness. After eight years of marriage, she became restless: she was eager to follow in the footsteps of her childhood idol, Patsy Cline, and become a country music star. She quits her job, leaves her husband and friends behind, and travels to Nashville, Tennessee. There, she finds an apartment over the garage of a home owned by her cousin, Lavonne Overton (Gigi Rice), and her husband, Buck (Bill Engvall). She also finds a job waiting tables at The Green Lantern, a local bar that hosts an amateur night which she believes that if she could sing her songs there, it could jumpstart her career."
"Burke, most popular for her role as Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"", reportedly utilized her own singing talents for the role of Bishop, and dyed her familiar brunette hair blonde to play the role. The theme song was ""Climb That Mountain High"" by Reba McEntire which was not a charted single; the tune was featured on Reba's 1990 MCA album ""Rumor Has It""."
"The sitcom premiered September 15, 1992, to healthy ratings following ""Roseanne"". It then moved to Thursday nights opposite FOX's ""The Simpsons"", and ratings began to sink. It was pulled from the schedule in December 1992 and returned to ABC the following spring 1993 for six episodes before finally being canceled. In an attempt to infuse ratings, Burke brought her brunette hair back that spring (even refilming the opening credits to correspond with the change in hair color), in the sake of familiarity, but it did little to save it."

= = = Dusty Fletcher = = =
"Clinton ""Dusty"" Fletcher (July 8, 1900 – March 15, 1954) was an African-American vaudeville performer, who was best known for the comedy routine which became a hit record in 1947, ""Open the Door, Richard""."
He had one daughter Helen Fletcher with original Cotton Club Dancer Sadie Mae Fletcher. He had two granddaughters Jacqueline and Amber.
"Born in El Dorado, Arkansas, Fletcher had refined his act over at least twenty years in vaudeville before the 1940s. He would come on stage dressed in rags, acting drunk, muttering and complaining about trying to find his way home. He would then bring out a ladder, and try to set it up so he could get in through a window. Every so often he would crash sprawling on the floor while shouting ""Open the Door, Richard !""."
"In 1946, bandleader Jack McVea fashioned Fletcher's routine into the lyrics of a song, which he recorded with his band. McVea's record became a big hit, and Fletcher, by now semi-retired, was found living in South Carolina by Herb Abramson of National Records. He made his own recording of the song, using McVea's arrangement, which made number 3 on US ""Billboard"" R&B chart. The song was also covered by many others including Count Basie, Louis Jordan, and Pigmeat Markham."
"National Records began a lawsuit to claim Fletcher's royalties as the originator of the routine which led to McVea's hit. However, a blackface vaudeville comedian, John ""Spider Bruce"" Mason then claimed that Fletcher had originally stolen the routine from him in the 1920s. Eventually, McVea, Fletcher and Mason were all co-credited with writing McVea's version."
"Fletcher is credited with originating the ""Here come de Judge"" line used on the television comedy show, ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In""."
"The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publicly attacked the song, particularly Fletcher's version, for making light of public drunkenness and playing on the stereotype of black men as shiftless and ignorant."

"As he was taught that Islam and politics do not mix he says that """"one part of the book has stayed with me."""" This being the chapter ""Political System in Islam"". He says that Sarwar said that Politics within Islam is fundamental."
"Husain goes on to say that """"What I did not know at school was that Sarwar was a business management lecturer, not a scholar of religion. And he was an activist in the organisations that he mentioned Muslim Brotherhood and Jamat-e-Islami. Sarwar's book was not the dispassionate educational treatise it purported to be."""" and that """"He was also the brains behind the separation of Muslim children from school assemblies into what we called 'Muslim assembly', managed by the Muslim Educational Trust (MET) [of which Sarwar is the Director]. What seemed like an innocuous body was, in fact, an organisation with an agenda. In my school, a Jamat-e-Islami activist named Abdul Rabb represented the MET and awarded us trophies and medals for our performance in MET exams. Ostensibly it all seemed harmless, but the personnel all belonged to Jamat-e-Islami front organisations in Britain. Their key message was that Islam was not merely a religion but also an ideology that sought political power and was beginning to make headway."""""
"However, when Husain quotes Sarwar on page 21 of ""The Islamist"" regarding politics and Islam (page 169 of Sarwar's book), he does so but, although not wrong, he words the quoting very differently from what is actually written in Sarwar's book."
"Additionally, as discussed above, Husain mentions that """"What I did not know at school was that Sarwar was a business management lecturer, not a scholar of religion."""" However, it says clearly in Sarwar's book that he """"obtained his first degree in Commerce and a masters in Business Management from the University of Dhaka, Bangkladesh"""" and that """"For three years he taught Business Management to first-degree students in City College""""."
"It must be also noted that the book was written in collaboration with Usamah K. Ward, Prof Dr. Muhammad Abdul Jabbar Beg, Dr. Faruq Nurul Arefin, Dr. Muhammad Qamarul Hasan and Nasreen Sarwar, Farhat Yasmeen Sarwar, Ruqaiyyah Waris Maqsood (Rosalyn Kendrick) (former head of Religious Studies) and Syed Dohan Nuh."

"Norcot is an area of the suburb of Tilehurst in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. It is also an electoral ward of the Borough of Reading."
"Norcot ward is the far eastern sector of the Reading borough portion of Tilehurst. As a commonly used suburban area, Norcot centres on Norcot Road and the upper Oxford Road on Norcot Hill. It is electorally partly in Norcot ward and partly in Kentwood to its west. All these areas form a mixture of suburban and urban parts of West Reading. The original hamlet was near the junction of Norcot Road and Romany Lane and was largely made up of Norcot Farm in the north-east of old Tilehurst parish. The name means 'North Cottage' and has a southern neighbour Southcote, below Tilehurst church and manor."
"The Norcot Water Tower, built at the end of the 19th century, is somewhat older than the more prominent Tilehurst Water Tower. It is 50ft high, a Grade II listed building and since 2002 has been converted into a luxury apartment. Norcot School was built in 1906. In its lifetime, it was both a senior and a junior school. It closed in 1989. Like much of Tilehurst, Norcot Hill was used for the extraction of clay for brickmaking. In the 1920s, S. E. Collier's transported the clay via overhead cables to their main site in the Dee Road area of Tilehurst. St George's Church, Reading was built on the north-eastern edge of Norcot in 1886, largely to service the soldiers of the nearby Brock Barracks. Norcot Mission Church was started in 1929 to serve the new Norcot council estate. It started in a hut on land rented from the Pulsometer Engineering Works. The church moved to a permanent building in Brockley Close in 1972. The post office is on the Oxford Road."
"The ward of Norcot is west of the town centre and is bordered by Kentwood (the far western ward), Battle (the inner western ward), Southcote and Tilehurst wards."
"As with all wards, apart from smaller Mapledurham, it elects three councillors to Reading Borough Council. Elections since 2004 are held by thirds, with elections in three years out of four."
"In the 2011, 2012 and 2014 a Labour Party candidate won each election."
"These Councillors are currently, in order of election: Graeme Hoskin, Jo Lovelock and Debs Absolom."

"On 16 September 2013, White Lies announced that the next single from the album would be ""First Time Caller"", and they released an official music video for the song."
"""Big TV"" received generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 18 reviews."
"Matt Collar of AllMusic wrote that White Lies ""sound even more engaged and clear-eyed than on the ambitious, stylized ""Ritual"","" and they ""combine the urgent passions of their debut with the conceptual ambitions of their sophomore effort and by doing so, make the best album of their career"". Cai Trefor of ""Clash"" magazine rated the album 7 out of 10, and described it as leaning towards retro, but also sounding firmly in the present, ""utilising electronic samples with classic valve-driven guitar chords to accompany the trademark baritone of McVeigh"". The Line of Best Fit's reviewer Ryan Thomas noted the album's 1980s atmosphere but said that ""with influences visible, nods clearly marked, White Lies aren't just repackaging yesterday's hits as their own. Instead they're making use of abandoned utensils to create anew, achieving catharsis through resourcefulness. Yes, they are working with a previously-explored aesthetic, but they are molding it into a beautifully-original product, per a vision that refuses to forget music's former greatness""."

"After having a training session, Splinter (Hamato Yoshi) and the Turtles celebrate their 15th anniversary of being mutated, and Splinter tells them the story of how they came to be. After the story, the Turtles convince Splinter to allow them to travel to the surface."
"After taking a trip out of the sewers for the first time since being mutated, the Turtles witness April O'Neil and her father Kirby getting captured by The Kraang. Donatello develops a crush upon seeing April and concludes that the Turtles must save her and her father. The Turtles have a brief battle with the Kraang, but they are defeated since they aren't used to fighting as a team. As a result, the Kraang escape, with April and Kirby as their prisoners."
"Back at the lair, Splinter agrees that the Turtles must save April and Kirby, and picks Leonardo as the leader of the team, much to Raphael's irritation."
"While searching for April and Kirby, they meet Snake, a guy who works for the Kraang. Raph threatens to pour mutagen on him if he doesn't tell the Turtles information about the Kraang. Snake confesses, telling them everything he knows, before Michelangelo accidentally lets him escape. At the lair, Splinter tells Leo that failure is a possibility that every leader must face, and tells him the story of how he and Oroku Saki the Shredder were once friends, but became enemies."
"The Turtles eventually find the Kraang, and Snake accidentally gets mutagen ooze poured on him, and becomes a mutated plant. The Turtles enters the Kraang's facility, and begin to battle them, but before they can reach April and Kirby, they come across Snake in his mutant form, which Mikey dubs ""Snakeweed"". Snakeweed is seeking revenge against the Turtles for his mutation, and they go on to fight him. Donnie goes on to save April and Kirby while Leo, Raph and Mikey continue to fight Snakeweed. Donnie manages to save April, but the Kraang escape with Kirby. Snakeweed eventually blows up and the Turtles and April escape from the Kraang. However, Snakeweed's heart starts beating again, indicating this isn't the last they'll see of him."
"The Turtles made the news, but the Shredder watches the news back at Tokyo, Japan, discovering Splinter's symbol on the ninja star, concluding that he and the Foot Clan must relocate to New York to finish off Splinter."
"Max Nicholson of IGN gave ""Rise of The Turtles"" a rating of 8.5/10, saying ""The action sequences are fluid, fast-paced and exciting, and the dialogue-heavy scenes are usually peppered with entertaining slapstick."" Toon Zone reviewer Grant White gave the episode a positive review, saying ""Although I enjoyed this premiere, not everything sat well with me. There are some parts of both the writing and animation that felt poor and sometimes overlapped."" Noel Kirkpatrick at TV.com called the episode ""a tad on the bland side"". He cites that while there's plenty for surprises for the show's plot, ""in laying the groundwork, this pilot didn't really do anything new"". Matt Edwards at Den of Geek opined that the episode is ""so polished and ell executed,"" and praised it for its balance of comedy and action, stating ""A very strong start to the series, then, and one I’ve found myself revisiting frequently."""
The episode's original run garnered approximately 3.9 million viewers within the United States.

= = = Biosphere reserves in Singapore = = =
"The Singaporean government has established some five biosphere reserves in Singapore. There are namely: Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Central Catchment Nature Reserve, Chek Jawa, Labrador Nature Reserve, and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve."
"One of the first notions of biosphere reserves in Singapore was thought up by the then-Singapore Botanical Gardens Supritendent N. C. Cantley who, in 1882, proposed that select areas of land be preserved. In as early as 1883, the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve (as it is now known) was established, making it the inaugural biosphere reserve in Singapore. The Singapore Nature Reserves Act officially came into action in 1971. In 1984, biosphere reserves took up some of the country's land. This figure has been increased to , as of 2009."
"The Public Utilities Board-maintained Central Catchment Nature Reserve is Singapore's largest biosphere reserve. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve aids in the conservation of both bird species and mangrove plants. The Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, albeit small-sized at , hosts myriad plant and animal lifeforms. Chek Jawa is situated in eastern Pulau Ubin. Teeming with various kinds of marine life, Chek Jawa was ""discovered"" (much publicised) in 2001. The Labrador Nature Reserve is located by the sea. Described as ""an oasis of tranquility and natural wonders"", it teems with vast animal life, as well as plant life by the cliff. The large Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve comprises mostly wetland and a few bird species, most notably the shorebird, can be spotted there. It is cited as the ""first wetlands reserve to be gazetted in Singapore""."
"Owing to rapid urban development, the country is in need of more land for things such as housing, which is deemed more important than nature reservation. One possible issue faced by the biosphere reserves in Singapore is that they will be turned into nothingness by the government when the need arises. There was an instance when the government had wanted to reclaim part of Chek Jawa, but this was opposed by conservationists and it was ultimately not reclaimed."

"The trail goes from Hadley Green to Tottenham Hale, where the trail connects with the Lea Valley Walk. Most of the first half of the trail, as far as Arnos Park, runs beside Pymmes Brook, but after that the brook is only encountered intermittently as much of the brook passes through private land which is not open to the public. In its lower reaches sections of the brook have been culverted to alleviate the risk of flooding."
"The trail starts on Hadley Green, where the headwaters of Pymmes Brook rise, with a link from High Barnet tube station. Together with the London Loop, it then drops through Monken Hadley Common to Jack's Lake, to meet another link from Cockfosters tube station. Pymmes Brook proper starts here as it flows out from Jack's Lake. The trail detours through Victoria Recreation Ground, where Pymmes Brook is joined with Shirebourne brook, then follows a short street section to rejoin the brook at East Barnet Village. It then runs beside the brook through Oak Hill Park and Brunswick Park to the halfway point in Arnos Park, with a link to Arnos Grove tube station. It is also where Pymmes Brook is joined by Bounds Green Brook. The trail then leaves the brook to pass through Broomfield Park and Palmers Green. It crosses over the New River at Oakthorpe Road, then the North Circular Road, to divert through two new public open spaces - Bowes Meadow and Tile Kiln Lane Open Space - where Pymmes Brook can be followed again. The trail recrosses the North Circular Road onto Silver Street, Edmonton, where the path enters the gardens of Millfield House. From here the trail leads to Pymmes Park and another brookside section, then to Fore Street, where the brook flows underground to merge with Salmons Brook to the south of Angel Road. As of 2018, the trail must temporarily follow public throughfares for a short distance, but will eventually take a new route when access to the brook is opened up in the Meridian Water development. Finally, the trail passes through Tottenham Marshes, beside Pymmes Brook and past Stonebridge Lock on the Lee Navigation, to reach the point where the brook joins the River Lea.

Whizziwig is a science fiction children's programme broadcast on CITV between 1998 and 2000 based on the books by award winning children's author Malorie Blackman.

Whizziwig has the ability to grant wishes to anyone who uttered the words ""I wish.."", however wishes had to be made for someone else and would last a maximum of 24 hours. A recurring theme is Ben and Steve trying to deceive their friend into granting their intentional wishes only for the alien to become wise to the scheme."
"Ben would keep Whizziwig hidden, often smuggling her into school in his school bag. Many hilarious escapades ensued as the wishes made by unaware students in Whizziwigs earshot would be granted."
"Despite never achieving commercial success many critics hailed the show as groundbreaking in the manner in which it dealt with adult themes such as morality, death, and mereological nihilism, whilst still being accessible to its young audience."
"Within five years of the house leaving the Taft family, the front veranda was removed, replaced by a one-story porch. Other modifications were the addition of a conservatory and the demolition of outbuildings, including a stable. Upon Thompson's death the house was sold by his widow to Colonel Ernest H. Ruffner in 1912. Upon Ruffner's death it was sold by his daughter. The William Howard Taft Memorial Association was formed on July 7, 1937, in hopes of buying the property, but went without support of the Taft family, as Robert Taft thought it would look too opportunistic to memorialize the house his father grew up in, and thus failed in acquiring the $12,000 to buy it. In the 1940s the building was used as apartments, with the new owner Elbert R. Bellinger once considering selling it to become a funeral parlor for local blacks. Taft family political fortunes faltered with Robert's death in 1953, and with Charles Phelps Taft II available to spearhead the movement, the William Howard Taft Memorial Association eventually acquired the house for $35,000 (the assessment price), instead of the $75,000 Bellinger was demanding for it."
"By 1961, the house was in poor condition and needed restoration, to the tune of $92,500. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. A ceremony on September 15, 1964 (William's 107th birthday), celebrated the home becoming a National Historic Landmark."
"The association gained full title to the house in 1968 and in 1969 transferred it to the National Park Service, which currently operates the site as a historic house museum, so that its future upkeep is ensured. The United States government took the property title on November 1, 1970."
Letters and diary entries written by Louise Taft during her time in the home helped preservationists to return the domicile to how it appeared during William's childhood.
"William Howard Taft National Historic Site has two main buildings. The first is the original home owned by William Howard Taft's parents, Alphonso and Louise Taft. It has been restored to look as it did during the time William lived there. All the family portraits and many of the books on display belonged to the Taft family. The first floor has five rooms restored: William's birthplace, and four rooms representative of the period. The furniture is period pieces and did not necessarily belong to the Tafts. The second floor contains exhibits on the accomplishments of William."
"The second building is the National Historic Site's Visitor Center, officially called the Taft Education Center.

= = = Barony of Nikli = = =
"The Barony of Nikli was a medieval Frankish fiefdom of the Principality of Achaea, located in the southern Arcadia region of the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece, and centred on the town of Nikli (; ; ), also known as Amyklai or Amyklion (Ἀμύκλαι, Αμύκλιον)."
"The Barony of Nikli was established ca. 1209, after the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Crusaders, and was one of the original twelve secular baronies within the Principality of Achaea. The barony, with six knight's fiefs attached to it, was given to a lord known in the Greek and Italian versions of the ""Chronicle of the Morea"" only as William, but whose family name is given by Angevin records as Morlay. William was succeeded by his son Hugh—although Karl Hopf suggested the interposition of a second William after the original founder for chronological reasons—and then, around 1280, by Androuin de Villiers or de Villa, who had married Hugh's sister Sachette."
"Nikli, known in Antiquity as Tegea, is located on the southern Arcadian plain and was conquered by the Franks after a siege sometime before 1209; at the time it was a town of some importance and the seat of a bishopric, which was taken over by a Latin bishop until 1222, when it was abolished and joined to that of Lacedaemon. Nikli's location made it an excellent assembly point for armies, as well as for parliaments like the famous ""Ladies' Parliament"" in 1261, but after 1262, when the Byzantines recovered parts of the southeastern Peloponnese, the barony became a battleground, and by the early 1270s, Nikli was permanently garrisoned to prevent the Byzantines from breaking out of their territory in Laconia into the central Arcadian plateau. Nikli was still in Frankish hands in 1280, but was lost to the resurgent Byzantines sometime after. The Aragonese version of the ""Chronicle"" states that the Byzantines occupied the town in 1296, but, it being indefensible on account of its location on the plain, they preferred to destroy and abandon it. The region seems to have remained under Frankish control for a few years after that, but by 1302, it was definitely in Byzantine hands."

"Raniero Capocci, also known as Ranieri, Rainerio da Viterbo ( 1180-1190 – 27 May 1250) was an Italian cardinal and military leader, a fierce adversary of emperor Frederick II."
"Capocci was born at Viterbo in 1180–1190. Few details exist about his early life, and his alleged adherence to the Cistercian Order, including the role of abbot in the Tre Fontane Abbey in Rome, is unconfirmed. He entered the Roman curia before 1215, the year in which Pope Innocent III sent him to the Abbey of Montecassino to investigate about abbot Adenulf's tenure. In 1216 Capocci was created cardinal deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, and later became papal legate to Lombardy."
"Innocent's successor, Honorius III, appointed Capocci as ""rector"" of the Duchy of Spoleto, and later of the areas of Assisi, Nocera Umbra and Gubbio. In 1231 he became cardinal protodeacon."
"In 1234 the new pope Gregory IX named Capocci ""rector"" of Tuscia (Tuscany), as well as ""capitano"" (commander) of the Papal troops. In the same year Luca Savelli, grandson of Honorius III, forced the pope to flee from Rome to Umbria. Emperor (and King of Naples and Sicily) Frederick II moved from southern Italy with an army to help Gregory, joining Capocci's troops at Montefiascone. Savelli's army was besieged in a fortress a few kilometers south of Viterbo and, although Frederick left the siege in advance, Capocci was able to defeat them. Frederick's ambiguous behaviour led to his excommunication by Gregory four years later, and Capocci defended the pope's move with a series of letters and treatises disseminated throughout Europe, including the manifesto ""Ascendit de mare""."
"When Gregory died in 1241, Capocci was jailed by the Roman senator Matteo Rosso Orsini in the Septizodium. After the short reign of Celestine IV (17 days), Ranieri supported the election of a pope who would not show any compromise with Frederick II. The new pope was the Genoese Innocent IV, who would continue Gregory's anti-imperial policy. This is manifest in the events leading to the siege of Viterbo, in which Capocci was instrumental in the expulsion of the imperial garrison from the city, and in the following defeat of the rescue army led by Frederick in person. Capocci was left in the city as papal legate with full powers (he was also bishop of Viterbo for one year)."
"In 1244 a peace treaty was signed between Innocent and Frederick. However, the latter soon began military and diplomatic moves to overthrow the pope, who decided to take refuge in Lyon, leaving Capocci as his plenipotentiary in Italy. When the news arrived that a compromise with the emperor was likely, he had a series of pamphlets, full of insults and accusations of heresy against Frederick, published in the French city: their success among the prelates in the First Council of Lyon led to the deposition of the Sicilian leader (1245). Frederick replied by re-conquering Viterbo, although Capocci was able to gain back most of Umbria and the March of Ancona, including Iesi, the emperor's birthplace. In 1246 Innocent appointed him as papal legate also in the Kingdom of Sicily."
"In October 1249, however, Innocent started to consider Capocci's power as excessive, and called him back to the Roman curia. Ranieri never accepted the decision and, now ill, moved to Lyon, where he died in 1250. He was initially buried in the Abbey of Citeaux, but later his remains were transferred to the church of Santa Maria in Gradi at Viterbo, which he had built in 1217–1221 as a gift to his personal friend, Saint Dominic."

"Crickhowell Castle () is a Grade I listed building in Crickhowell, Wales, now largely ruined. An alternative name, ""Alisby's Castle"", is sometimes used; this is thought to be after a former governor of the castle, Gerald Alisby."
"The remaining sections of the castle walls and motte stand on a spur where a tributary stream meets the River Usk, in a more elevated position than the rest of the town, which was planned around it. It has been suggested that the castle replaced an earlier motte-and-bailey structure at nearby Maescelyn, where St Mary's Chapel, which has existed since around 1300, has also been linked with the castle by some historians. The motte is oval in shape and is still clearly visible, whilst the foundations of the shell keep are largely buried. Traces of the castle bailey have been identified in the nearby playing field."
"The castle was initially a motte and bailey castle built from around 1121, probably by Robert Turberville, a member of the notable Norman family, who at the time was a tenant of the Marcher lord Bernard de Neufmarché. In 1172 it was attacked by Welsh rebels, led by one Seisyllt ap Rhirid. Henry de Turberville (died 1239), the son of another Robert, was Seneschal of Gascony in the years 1226–1231 and again in 1237–1238, and Crickhowell Castle was held at the time by a Richard Turberville. Edmund de Turberville is recorded as lord of Crickhowell later in the century. Hugh Turberville, who held Crickhowell Castle from 1273, not as tenant-in-chief but as mesne lord, also held the position of Seneschal of Gascony. Hugh's services were called upon by King Edward I of England to train Welsh men-at-arms and transform the royal levy into a disciplined medieval army capable of conquering Wales; he led both cavalry and 6,000 infantry recruited in the Welsh Marches for King Edward's forces. He was later Constable of Castell y Bere in Merionethshire. He fought against Rhys ap Maredudd during his rising from 1287 to 1291, and died in 1293, the last of the family in the direct line."
"The castle was refortified in stone from 1242 when Sybil Turberville, Hugh's daughter, married Sir Grimbold Pauncefote (or ""Paunceforte""), who thus gained possession. It was walled with substantial stone towers and a large bailey, a home castle befitting an important Royal ally in Wales. The castle was in the hands of the powerful Mortimer family dynasty of Marcher Lords and in the 14th century and declined as a smaller holding within a large portfolio of lands, titles and larger castles."
"On the Royal command of new King King Henry IV in 1400, it was again refortified, this time by Sir John Pauncefote, great-grandson of Sir Grimbold, in advance of the uprising led by Owain Glyndŵr. The castle was largely destroyed in about 1403 by Glyndŵr's forces. who also attacked and burned Abergavenny town and other settlements in the area. It was at this time that the castle is thought to have been abandoned, subsequent stone-robbing leaving only the ruined stone double tower on Castle Green. However, 19th century illustrations suggest that its condition has deteriorated noticeably in the past century. It was listed in 1963."
"The so-called ""Ivy Tower"", a small tower once thought to have dated from the 14th century and to be part of the castle, was found by an archaeological survey to be much later in date and nothing to do with the castle at all."

"Commodity value is an important consideration in hedging against inflation. Whereas fiat currencies can devalue, often catastrophically, currencies with considerable commodity value are known to better maintain their value; a government can print as many fiat bills as it wants with relative ease, the same is not true of mining precious metals.

"The song ""In the Absence ov Light"" contains a spoken word quote from the Witold Gombrowicz drama ""The Marriage"" (pol. ""Ślub"") which states:"
"Upon its release, ""The Satanist"" received universal acclaim reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 92, which indicates ""universal acclaim"", based on 10 reviews. Joe DiVita of Loudwire noted that the album ""sees the band shed away that skin as they simultaneously get back to some of their blackened roots while exploring new areas with ... dynamic songwriting"". The album would claim the top spot on Loudwire's list of the best metal albums of 2014, with Loudwire stating that ""The disc is a masterpiece from beginning to end, with absolutely no filler to be skipped over""."
"Grayson Currin of Pitchfork said """"The Satanist"" is a terrific coil of most everything Behemoth have ever done well, a strangely hopeful vision of hell wrested away from its very grip."" The editorial staff of Dutch webzine Lords of Metal named it the third best album of 2014, after a score of 93/100 for the initial album review."
"In 2019 the album was voted as the ""Best Metal Album of the Decade"" by various publications such as Loudwire, Consequence of Sound, WhatCulture and others."

Relay Graduate School of Education is a private graduate school for teachers in New York City and other cities across the nation. It was established in 2011 after being spun off from Hunter College's Teacher U program. It is the first stand-alone graduate school of education to open in New York since Bank Street College of Education was founded in 1916.
"The New York Board of Regents approved the school unanimously with one abstention. Alternative certification programs such as Teach for America and the New York City Teaching Fellows utilize existing colleges for required coursework, while Relay GSE provides its own course program. Teacher U CEO Norman Atkins was chosen as the graduate school's president."
"Teacher U was founded by three charter school networks ""with impressive student achievement records"": KIPP, Achievement First, and Uncommon Schools. The school will serve charter school and district teachers. There was opposition to the school's establishment from some of New York's existing universities that offer teacher education programs."
"On September 7, 2013, Relay GSE held the commencement ceremony for its first graduating class of students on Pier 60 at Chelsea Piers in New York City."
"The school has since expanded nationwide, with additional campuses in Baton Rouge, Chicago, Connecticut, Delaware, Denver, Houston, Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Newark, Philadelphia, Camden, and San Antonio."

"Hovey appointed a committee of trustees to administer the fund, headed by abolitionist Wendell Phillips. Hovey specified that the funds should be spent at the rate of $8,000 per year to meet immediate needs."
The fund paid Susan B. Anthony's salary ($12 per week) while she coordinated the Women's Loyal National League's massive petition drive asking Congress to approve an amendment that would abolish slavery.
"With 400,000 signatures, it was the largest petition drive in the nation's history up to that time, gathering signatures from approximately one out every twenty-four adults in the Northern states and significantly contributing to the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution."

= = = Walter Beisiegel = = =
"Walter Karl Beisiegel OBE (13 July 1907 – 8 January 1973) was an English career Royal Air Force officer who played first-class cricket for the Royal Air Force cricket team and also for Leicestershire. He was born at Uppingham, Rutland and died in the RAF hospital at RAF Halton, Buckinghamshire."
"Beisiegel was educated at Uppingham School, where his batting at cricket won praise from Harry Altham in the annual review of schools cricket in ""Wisden Cricketers' Almanack"" in 1926. Altham wrote that Beisiegel ""stood head and shoulders over his colleagues"" and his innings of 126 not out for Uppingham against Rugby School ""was a fine wind-up to his school career""."
"For a period of five years between 1927 and 1932, inter-services cricket matches between the different branches of the UK armed forces – the Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force – were rated as first-class. Beisiegel played in five of these matches for the RAF team between 1928 and 1931 as a middle-order batsman. In his first match, against The Army cricket team in 1928, he scored 54 in his only innings of the match, and this was to be the highest score of his first-class career. A year later, in the same fixture, he top-scored for the RAF with 53. Though Beisiegel continued to play in these inter-services matches through to 1938, none of his games were first-class after 1931, and these were the only first-class scores he made of more than 50."
"Three years after his last first-class game for the Royal Air Force team, Beisiegel played 10 matches for Leicestershire in the 1934 season as a middle-order batsman. He was not particularly successful, scoring 185 runs at an average of just 12.33 and with a highest score of only 33. But when the Leicestershire captain Arthur Hazlerigg was injured late in the season, it fell to Beisiegel as an amateur player to take over the captaincy, and in his first game as captain he led the team to its first victory over Yorkshire since 1911. ""The Times"" report said that it was ""the most sensational victory of the season"": Yorkshire had declared their first innings 102 ahead with only five wickets down but, set 149 to win, were all out for 90. Two weeks later there was a second victory under Beisiegel's leadership against a team considered greatly superior to Leicestershire when Nottinghamshire were beaten by an innings and 106 runs inside two days at Trent Bridge. The end of the season, however, marked the end of Beisiegel's first-class cricket career as he resumed his RAF duties; he was, however, awarded an honorary county cap in recognition of his captaincy successes."
"From school, Beisiegel went as a cadet to the Royal Air Force College Cranwell where he graduated as a pilot officer in December 1927. He was promoted from flying officer to flight lieutenant in 1933. This was followed by promotion from flight lieutenant to squadron leader in 1937. From the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 to May 1940, he was in charge of No. 616 Squadron RAF, a unit that was equipped with the Mark I Spitfire during his command and that was based at RAF Leconfield until deployed south in May 1940. In 1942, he was temporarily promoted from wing commander to group captain under the heading of ""General Duties"". He remained in the RAF after the Second World War and was then officially promoted from wing commander to group captain in 1947. In 1950, he was awarded the OBE in the King's Birthday Honours. He retired from the RAF with a promotion to the rank of Air Commodore in 1956."

It was the first Australian legislation to deal with such issues."
It specifically excludes pathogenic bacteria and viruses from protection.
"Species may be listed under the act, and so can threatening processes. The Act provides for the declaration of Critical Habitat; however, no declarations of critical habitat for endangered species have been made."
Related acts include:
Also relevant is the Forest Practices Code.
"Lawyers for Forests (LFF) published a review of the act in 2002, and found a lack of resources to enforce the act, a lack of government transparency and accountability, that the act may be and is ignored in government decisionmaking, and that the act is generally unenforceable. The review identified the following factors:"
"As well as a general review, the review considers the impact of the Act on the Leadbeater's possum, the powerful owl and the tiger quoll, as well as on a threatened community and a threatening process. For example, it considers the concern of environmentalists for the small and poorly placed Special Protection and Management Zones for the tiger quoll, the continuing clear-fell logging followed by slash burns in their management zones, and the failure to stop the use of 1080 poison, which is a threat to the species."
"LFF recommended that the NRE should receive appropriate funding to fully implement the FFG Act, and the government commit to NRE fulfilling its obligations under the Act. The group further recommended that the Act should be enforceable, and NRE should be accountable in its efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Act."

"Cap and Gown Club, founded in 1890, is an eating club at Princeton University, in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. Colloquially known as ""Cap"", the club is one of the ""Big Four"" eating clubs at Princeton (the others are The Ivy Club, University Cottage Club, and Tiger Inn). Members are selected through a selective process called bicker. Sometimes known as ""the Illustrious Cap and Gown Club,"" it was the first of the currently selective eating clubs to accept women. Though personalities of eating clubs certainly change throughout the years, Cap and Gown is described in F. Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise as ""anti-alcoholic, faintly religious and politically powerful."""
"Cap was the most bickered eating club in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. It has been the most selective club since 2013, with 227 students bickering in Spring 2015, forty-four percent of whom were offered membership."
"Cap is located at 61 Prospect Avenue between Cloister Inn and the University Cottage Club. It is the only Princeton eating club to stay in the same geographic location for its entire existence. Three Cap clubhouses have occupied this location. The first was completed in 1892. In 1895 when the club outgrew this clubhouse, the structure was moved across the street, and William Ralph Emerson was commissioned to design the second clubhouse (completed in 1896). Ten years later, Cap was ready to expand again. The Emerson building was moved away, and Raleigh Gildersleeve designed the clubhouse that Cap still occupies today. A major renovation and expansion of the clubhouse to increase the size of the clubhouse in step with its growing membership was completed in February 2011."

From mid-November to December 25th each year, it switches to all-Christmas music. The station's studios and offices are located at the 400 Poydras Tower in New Orleans' downtown district."
"WLMG has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for non-grandfathered FM stations. The transmitter site is off Bahrman Highway in the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans. WLMG broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format."
"On March 15, 1970, the station first signed on the air as WWL-FM. It was owned by Loyola University of the South, now known as Loyola University New Orleans. Loyola also owned Channel 4 WWL-TV and AM powerhouse 870 WWL."
WWL and WWL-FM had the same call sign but separate formats. The AM was a full service middle of the road station while WWL-FM played beautiful music. It featured quarter hour sweeps of instrumental cover versions of popular songs with Hollywood and Broadway show tunes.
"In the mid-1970s, station management decided to go in a radically different direction, seeking a younger demographic for WWL-FM. Out went the soft instrumental musicians such as Henry Mancini and Percy Faith, trading them in for Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney. WWL-FM flipped to a Top 40 sound. But this was an era where most young people still were listening to inexpensive AM radios for their favorite hits. The station failed to make much headway against AM Top 40 leader 690 WTIX (now WQNO)."
"By May 1976, WWL-FM returned to easy listening music. The format featured mostly instrumental songs with several soft vocals each hour. On December 26, 1980, to separate the FM station's image from its AM and TV counterparts, the call letters were changed to WAJY. The station, calling itself ""Joy 102,"" moved closer to a 50/50 mix of instrumentals and vocals, some from soft rock artists such as Elton John, Olivia Newton-John, Stevie Wonder and Chicago."
"Through the 1980s, the easy format saw its audience continuing to age, while most advertisers seek young and middle-aged listeners. In 1987, the station completed its transition to a soft adult contemporary sound, eliminating the instrumental songs. The call sign was changed to WLMG using the moniker ""Magic 102."" With most radios in the 1990s going from analog dials to digital, the station began calling itself ""Magic 101.9"" in 1995."
"Over the next decade, WWL and WLMG switched hands several times. In 1989, Loyola University sold the stations to Keymarket Communications. The TV station was sold to a group of its employees, using the name Rampart Broadcasting. In July 1995, the radio stations were acquired by River City Communications. Later ownership switched to Sinclair Broadcasting. And in December 1999, WWL and WLMG were acquired by Entercom."
"In the early 2000s, WLMG moved to a mainstream adult contemporary sound. The tempo of the songs was picked up and the disc jockeys added more personality. The playlist extends from the 1980s to current day AC hits. In 2006, the WWL-FM call sign returned to New Orleans, on another station. Entercom decided to give AM 870 WWL an FM simulcast on 105.3 MHz, allowing WWL listeners the choice to hear the station on FM or AM."

It is named after the noted jazz musician Louis Armstrong, who lived nearby until his death in 1971 and was a significant figure in the Civil Rights Movement."
"The stadium was originally built as the Singer Bowl for the 1964 New York World's Fair, and hosted special events and concerts afterwards. It was renamed the Louis Armstrong Stadium in 1973 but closed the following year."
"In the early 1970s, the United States Tennis Association was looking for a new place to host the US Open as relations with the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, which had hosted the tournament, were breaking down. The USTA was initially unable to find a sufficient site, but the association's incoming president, W.E. Hester saw the old Singer Bowl from the window of an airplane flying into LaGuardia Airport. The old, long rectangular stadium was heavily renovated and divided into two venues, becoming the square Louis Armstrong Stadium, with the remaining third becoming the attached Grandstand, with a seating capacity of about 6,000."
"In 1997, the stadium was replaced as the US Open's primary venue by the new Arthur Ashe Stadium. Armstrong Stadium was renovated again, with the top tiers of seating being removed. The stadium held close to 18,000 at its peak, but this was reduced to around 10,200 with the renovation, which also added a brick facade to match that of Ashe Stadium."
The stadium was demolished in October 2016.
"A new 14,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium opened for the 2018 US Open. This new stadium features a retractable roof and is the largest of No. 2 stadium at a Grand Slam site. For the 2017 tournament, while construction was still ongoing on the new stadium, a temporary 8,800-seat stadium was built on the site of the demolished ticket office and East Gate entrance, on Parking Lot B, close to the boardwalk ramp to the subway and LIRR trains."

"Ion I. Moța [or Motza] (5 July 1902, Orăștie, Austria-Hungary—13 January 1937, Majadahonda, Spain) was the Romanian nationalist deputy leader of the Iron Guard killed in battle during the Spanish Civil War."
"Son of the nationalist Orthodox priest Ioan Moța, who edited a journal called ""Liberty"", Ion I. Moța studied law at University of Paris (1920-1921), the University of Cluj, University of Iași and University of Grenoble. His thesis, finished in 1932 at the University of Grenoble, was entitled ""Juridical Security in the Community of Nations."""
"At Cluj, he founded Acțiunea Românească (""Romanian Action""), a nationalist group inspired by Charles Maurras' Action Française. This organization fused with A. C. Cuza's National-Christian Defense League in 1925. Moța met Corneliu Zelea Codreanu at a meeting of antisemitic students in August 1923. The two formed a plan to assassinate Romanian politicians and leaders of Romanian Jewry seen as traitors and corruptors of Romanian national life. They were arrested in Bucharest on 8 October 1923 and sent to Văcărești prison. Acquitted in March 1924, Moța shot Vernichescu, the member of their conspiracy who betrayed it to the authorities, seven times (but not fatally). He spent two months in Galata prison before being acquitted and released on 29 September 1924."
"Codreanu made Moța leader of ""Frăția de Cruce"", a group of peasants and students who would fight for nationalistic renewal (founded on 6 May 1924). Moța attended the World Anti-Semitic Congress in September 1925; upon the founding of the Iron Guard (the ""Legion of the Archangel Michael""), on 24 June 1927, he became deputy Captain to Codreanu."
"Ion Moța represented the Legion at the 1934 Fascist International meeting in Montreux. He was vice-president of the Iron Guard political creation, the ""Everything for the Country Party"". From 1934 through 1936, he served as a correspondent for ""Welt-Dienst"" / ""World-Service"", an anti-Jewish publication founded by Ulrich Fleischhauer in Erfurt, Germany. Fleischhauer was a staunch believer in the veracity of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and appeared as an ""expert witness"" for the pro-Nazis at the famous Berne Trial."
"In late 1936, Moța formed a Legionary unit to fight against the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. He and Vasile Marin (another prominent Legionary) were killed on the Madrid Front on the same day of fighting (13 January 1937). Their funerals in Bucharest (13 February 1937) were an immense and orderly procession (""see Funerals of Ion Moța and Vasile Marin""), attended by the Ministers of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Francisco Franco's Spain, representatives of Portugal, the Japan of the early Shōwa period, and delegates of the Polish Patriotic Youth."
"The see became one of the dioceses approved by Cardinal Giovanni Paparoni at the synod of Kells in 1152, and has approximately the same boundaries as those of the ancient Kingdom of Breifne. In the Irish annals, the bishops were recorded of ""Breifne"", ""Breifni"", ""Breifny"", ""Tir-Briuin"", or ""Ui-Briuin-Breifne""."
"In the second half of the 12th century, it is likely the sees of Breifne and Kells were ruled together under one bishop. In 1172, Tuathal Ua Connachtaig took the oath of fealty to King Henry II of England as bishop of Kells. Soon after 1211 the see of Kells was incorporated into the diocese of Meath."
"In 1454, Pope Nicholas V gave permission for the then bishop, Aindrias Mac Brádaigh (Anglicised: Andrew McBrady), to have the ancient church at Kilmore, founded in the 6th century by Saint Felim (or Feithlimidh), to be the cathedral church of the diocese. This building passed into the hands of the Church of Ireland at the Reformation, and, following the construction of a new cathedral, is now used as a parochial hall."
"After the upheavals of the Reformation, there were parallel apostolic successions: one of the Church of Ireland and the other of the Roman Catholic Church."
"In the Church of Ireland, the title was intermittently held with Ardagh until they were finally united in 1839. In 1841, the sees of Kilmore and Ardagh were amalgamated with Elphin to form the united bishopric of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh. The current incumbent is The Right Reverend Samuel Ferran Glenfield M.A. M.Th. (Oxon.) M.Litt. He was elected, consecrated, and installed in 2013."
"In the Roman Catholic, the title continues as a separate bishopric. The most recent Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kilmore was the Most Reverend Philip Leo O'Reilly, who succeeded as the diocesan bishop on 16 October and installed at the Cathedral Church of Saints Patrick and Felim, Cavan on 15 November 1998. He had been appointed coadjutor bishop of Kilmore by the Holy See on 20 November 1996 and received episcopal ordination on 2 February 1997. He resigned on 31 December 2018 on health grounds."
"During the Reformation, Edmund Nugent and John MacBrady were at one time or another bishops of either the Church of Ireland or Roman Catholic succession. They were each appointed as Roman Catholic bishops, but later accepted or recognized as Anglican bishops."

The Reverend Monsignor John Wendrychowicz, the pastor of Saint Josaphat Parish at the time, informed parishioners of the decision in Masses held during the weekend of April 25, 2005, noting that he had also informed teachers and families of the children attending the school he had secured support from the Parish Pastoral and Finance Councils to request permission from Cardinal Justin Rigali, Archbishop of Philadelphia, to close the facility. Students enrolled in Saint Josaphat School at the time were given the option to attend any other parish elementary school for the 2005-2006 school year. A new regional Catholic school, the Holy Child Catholic School, also opened in September 2005. Cardinal Rigali, who granted permission for the closure, said of his decision:"
"""I am grateful to Monsignor Wendrychowicz and Monsignor Beach, for their leadership in making this recommendation to close Saint Josaphat School. I recognize it was guided by a desire for careful stewardship of parish resources and for the pastoral care of parents, children and staff of the school. It is my hope that parents will continue to choose a quality, Catholic education for their children and I pray that the parishioners of St. Josaphat and all the faithful of Manayunk will continue to support Catholic education and be guided by the Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior during this transition."""

The Hamnigan Buryats or Khamnigan are Mongolized Evenks of Tungusic origin.
"Khamnigan is the Buriat-Mongolian term for all Ewenkis. In the early 16th century, the Evenks of Transbaikalia or Khamnigans were tributary to the Khalkha. The Khamnigan are only ethnic group of Tungus origin in Mongolia. They who lived around Nerchinsk and the Aga steppe faced both Cossack demands for tribute and Khori-Buriats trying to occupy their pastures. Most of them came under the Cossack rule and enrolled the Cossack regiments in the Selenge valley. The Khori Buriats occupied most of the Aga steppe and forced the Ewenkis to flee to the Qing Dynasty."
"After 1880 Russia's Khamnigan Evenks moved to semi nomadic herding of cattle, sheep, camels and horses. Some time after 1918 the Evenks, along with their Buriat neighbors, fled over the border into Mongolia and Hulun Buir, establishing the current Khamnigan communities there. The Khamnigan of Mongolia, numbering 300 households, are scattered among the Buriats and speak only the Khamnigan dialect of Buriat language. They live around the Yeruu Lake, Dornod and Khentii provinces as well as Möngönmorit of Töv Province."
"There are approximately 535 Hamnigans in Mongolia and Hamnigans in Selenge Province, Mongolia. Not all Hamnigans are of Tungusic origin; there are some Mongols among the Hamnigans."

"John Patrick Kennedy (7 June 1926 – 20 March 1994) was a New Zealand Catholic journalist who served as the editor of the weekly Catholic newspaper ""The New Zealand Tablet"" from 1967 to 1989."
"Born in Methven, Canterbury, Kennedy was educated at St Bede's College and at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. He also worked as a journalist for several newspapers including the ""Christchurch Star-Sun"" and the Melbourne-based ""The Herald"", before returning to New Zealand to become the editor of ""The Tablet"" in Dunedin. During his work as a journalist, he won several awards including the Cowan Memorial Prize for Good Journalism in 1947 and the Kemsley Empire Scholarship for Journalism in 1950. In the 1974 New Year Honours, Kennedy was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to journalism."
"Kennedy was known for his socially-conservative stance on issues like homosexuality and abortion. During his career as editor of ""Tablet"", he also had a close friendship with Prime Minister Robert Muldoon and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children president Des Dalgety. During the Muldoon era, ""The Tablet"" adopted a pro-Muldoonist editorial standpoint and Muldoon himself contributed several articles. Muldoon himself supported ""The Tablet's"" position on private schools."
"Kennedy was also anti-Communist and was critical of Prime Minister David Lange's anti-nuclear policies, which he saw as weakening the ANZUS alliance and benefiting the Soviet Union. According to peace activist Maire Leadbeater, Kennedy passed information on left-wing groups like the Philippines Solidarity Group to the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, the country's main domestic intelligence agency."
"Kennedy died on 20 March 1994. Following Kennedy's death, the ""Tablet"" struggled to maintain the level of support it had during his editorship. The newspaper ceased publication in April 1996."
Kennedy married Colleen McAleer. They had seven children together.

"On May 20, 2013, the President of the United States Barack Obama released a statement that the Administration ""supports"" passage of S. 954 and ""looks forward to working with the Congress to address the important concerns"
"described below prior to final passage."" The announcement listed several reasons that the President supported the bill: elimination of the direct payments system; consolidation and streamlining of conservation assistance; and the inclusion of funding for bioenergy programs. The statement criticized the bill for not adopting all of the Administration's previous proposals for achieving crop insurance and commodity program savings and objected to any cuts at all to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)."
"Senator Debbie Stabenow argued in favor of the bill because it both reduced the deficit and supported ""16 million people who depend on agriculture for their jobs""."
The bill was opposed by groups focusing on hunger due to its reduction in spending on food stamps. It was also criticized by groups such as the Heritage Foundation for including a system of crop insurance that were less about helping farmers in the event of a true disaster and more of an income support system.
Senator John McCain (R-AZ) criticized the bill for containing a catfish inspection program that he believes duplicates one that is already conducted by the Food and Drug Administration.

"Gil Gutiérrez (born May 1, 1962 in Oaxaca, Mexico) is a virtuoso Mexican guitarist"
"His mother sent him to study sculpture, painting and ceramics at the art academy in Oaxaca. It was there that he heard the sounds of classical music and learned to play cello on a borrowed instrument. He then switched to a guitar which was a gift from his brother, because his family could not afford a cello. At the Benito Juarez Autonomous University in Oaxaca, Gutiérrez studied classical guitar and his musical interests spread to diverse genres including classical, flamenco, son cubano and jazz."
"At age fourteen he began playing classical guitar in restaurants in Oaxaca and caught the attention of German born guitarist Wolfgang “Lobo” Fink of Willie & Lobo. At 17, he teamed up with Fink to play venues in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. When Fink returned to Germany, Gutiérrez went to Mexico City to study jazz earning money by playing his guitar on city buses. The guitarist has played in South America and Spain with Ana Gabriel, Ricardo Arjona, Francisco Cespedes, and Pedro Guerra. A virtuoso with the nylon string guitar and tres, Gutiérrez has performed at the Kennedy Center, the Mexican Cultural Institute of the Mexican Embassy in Washington D.C. and to a crowd of 10,000 people at Millennium Park, Chicago.Gutierrez is recognized for his unique ability to connect with the audience and channeling a bit of the local energy into each performance."

"Ana Paula Treviño dreams of falling in love with Aníbal Paz-Soldán, one of the richest millionaires in the country. One day while walking in the streets, Ana Paula's purse is snatched, and she unfortunately mistakes a witness by-stander, Fernando, to be the thief. Fernando is captivated by Ana Paula's beauty and charm, and he is instantly attracted to her. Fernando later discovers that Ana Paula is poor and must work hard in her father's boarding house in order to try to pay their debts. So, he decides to conquer Ana Paula's heart by omitting that he is a Paz-Soldán, and lying that he is merely an employee at the Paz-Soldán company."

"The Nanto-Bordelaise Company — formally ""La Compagnie de Bordeaux et de Nantes pour la Colonisation de l’Île du Sud de la Nouvelle Zélande et ses Dépendances"" — was a French company inaugurated in 1839 by a group of merchants from the cities of Nantes and Bordeaux, with the purpose of founding a French colony in the South Island of New Zealand."
"The company was formed after negotiations in August 1838 between whaling boat captain Jean-François Langlois and several Ngai Tahu Māori chiefs for the purchase of several thousand acres of land on Banks Peninsula, for which Langlois promised to pay a total of 1,000 francs. Upon returning to France in 1839, Langlois set about founding a company with the help of several financial backers, the eventual aim of which was to claim the entirety of the South Island for France. Government support was obtained in December of the same year via King Louis-Philippe to transport 80 settlers to Port Louis-Philippe (now Akaroa). A warship, the corvette ""Aube"", would travel to New Zealand, followed a month later by the colonists aboard . ""Aube"" left for the Pacific in February 1840, captained by Charles François Lavaud, who had been appointed as Commissaire du Roi."
"Aware of the potential threat of losing sovereignty of parts of the New Zealand island chain to the French, during early 1840, Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson was tasked with securing the whole of the country for the British Government. To this end, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed as an agreement between the British Crown and the indigenous Māori population. By the time ""Aube"" arrived at the Bay of Islands in June 1840, the acquisition of the country by Britain was effectively complete. Faced with no prospect of anything more than a small colonial settlement, Lavaud left for Banks Peninsula to oversee the arrival of ""Comte de Paris"". Hobson also sent a ship, HMS ""Britomart"", on board which were colonial magistrates."
"On arriving at Akaroa, Lavaud discovered that the agreement between Langlois and the local Māori was not as clear-cut as had been promised. Despite this, the founding of the colony went ahead, under an amalgam of French and British jurisdiction. C.B. Robinson, one of the magistrates sent on ""Britomart"", worked alongside Lavaud in the organisation of the settlement. Lavaud retired in 1843, and was succeeded as Commissaire du Roi by Post-Captain A. Bérard, who remained in this position until 1846, when formal agreements between the French government and the Nanto-Bordelaise Company settlement ended."
"The question of sovereignty remained a complex one, which the local colonial authorities were unable to solve. Eventually, the British Government resolved that the company would be awarded four acres of land for every £1 they could prove to have spent on the settlement. On 30 June 1849, the company's remaining New Zealand properties were bought by the New Zealand Company for the sum of £4,500. A second ship carrying more French settlers, ""Monarch"", arrived at Akaroa in 1850."

He and Spanish Blas Ruiz were the first Europeans to ever set foot in Laos."
"Veloso's journey to Laos started in Cambodia. In Cambodia, Veloso met and befriended King Satha of Lovek and Ruiz of Spain. When Lovek was invaded by Ayutthaya, Satha was overthrown by his son and other nobles who allowed Ayutthaya to take control, forcing Veloso to flee to Portuguese Malacca, the place where he began his adventure in Southeast Asia. Eventually Veloso returned with Ruiz, who had fled to Spanish Philippines, to Lovek. When they arrived they learned Satha had fled to Lan Xang, an empire centered in modern-day Laos and consisting of Isan, Stung Treng, and small areas of Southern China and Vietnam."
"Veloso and Ruiz decided to journey to Laos and bring back Satha to restore his reign over Lovek. They arrived in Vientiane, Lan Xang's administrative capital, in the summer of 1596. They were met with a procession showing off the city's immense wealth consisting of Asian elephants, gold, jewels, silk, exotic snakes, bouquets of tropical flowers, chanting monks, Buddhist treasures and relics, music, and beautiful women. Veloso and Ruiz were also received with a great feast. But while they were in Vientiane they learned Satha had died from an illness he caught on his way from Cambodia to Laos. Saddened and angered by the news, Veloso and Ruiz returned to Lovek and started a rebellion to put one of Satha's political allies on the throne and free Cambodia from Ayutthaya. They managed to drive out Ayutthaya forces from parts of Cambodia and create a new state but led the new Cambodian state into a brief period of chaos."
Eventually Veloso returned to Malacca.

"Parkhurst apprentices were juvenile prisoners from Parkhurst Prison, sentenced to ""transportation beyond the seas"", but pardoned on arrival at their destination on the conditions that they be ""apprenticed"" to local employers, and that they not return to England during the original term of their sentence. Between 1842 and 1849, Western Australia accepted 234 Parkhurst apprentices, all males aged between 10 and 21. As Western Australia was not then a penal colony, contemporary documents studiously avoided referring to the prisoners as ""convicts"", and the ships that brought them were not officially recognised as convict ships there.

The university offers more than 70 undergraduate majors and seven graduate programs. Walsh has a satellite campus in Castel Gandolfo, Italy."
The school's namesake is Bishop Emmett Michael Walsh of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Youngstown.
"Walsh University was first founded as LaMennais College in Alfred, Maine in 1951 by the Brothers of Christian Instruction on an idea by Ferdinand Waldo Demara, who was then posing as a monk, to educate young men as brothers and teachers. LaMennais College continued in Alfred, Maine from 1951 until 1959. Because of a chance 1957 conversation between Brother Francoeur of La Mennais College and Monsignor William Hughes of Youngstown, Ohio about the Brothers' wish to move LaMennais College from Alfred, Maine, Bishop Walsh invited the Brothers to choose Canton, Ohio as the new location. Bishop Walsh donated $304,000 to the Walsh College project. In 1959 the present location of Walsh University began as of farm land on which two buildings were constructed, College Hall (Farrell Hall) and LaMennais Hall which continues to house the Brothers and international priest-students. The Founding Brothers include: Dacian J. Barrette, Thomas S. Farrell, Henry J. Vannasse, Edmond Drouin, Paul E. Masse, Robert A. Francoeur, and Alexis Guilbeault."

He is also the Chairman of Perennial Real Estate Holdings Ltd. He has an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion as of March 2019."
"Kuok earned a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the National University of Singapore, and began his career in 1973 trading soft commodities at Kuok Oils and Grains. He eventually became Managing Director of the business, and developed the Pasir Gudang Edible Oils refining complex in Johor, followed by China's first edible oil refinery, South Seas Oils and Fats."
"In 1991, he left the Kuok Group to start Wilmar, with Martua Sitorus soon after coming on board as a co-founder. Starting as a small commodities trading company with S$2m in seed capital from the mortgage of his family home, and further seed funding obtained from Kuok Hock Swee and Sons, his father's investment company. Wilmar grew rapidly from the outset, with initial growth in the Indonesian edible oil market, followed up with development of Sumatran oil palm plantations and Indonesian edible oil refineries. A large expansion into edible oil refining in mainland China, and a joint venture with the Adani Group in India subsequently placed it in leading positions within Asia's largest consumer edible oil markets. In 1994, a meeting with the legendary then-chairman of ADM, Dwayne Andreas, resulted in a US$30m investment into the company after the first meeting, and ADM coming on board as a long term strategic partner."
"In 2006, Wilmar International launched an Initial Public Offering on the Singapore Stock Exchange with a capitalisation of S$2.38Bn. In 2007, after a 16-year estrangement, he agreed with his uncle Robert Kuok to merge the Kuok Group's edible oil, trading and oil palm plantation assets into Wilmar in return for a 31% stake in the company. The merger resulted in the unification of Kuok's previous early career contributions to the Kuok Group with the rapidly growth of Wilmar International led by him and Martua Sitorus since 1991."

"His father, Kuok Hock Swee, had arrived in then British Malaya from Foochow in Southern China at the age of 18, eventually setting up a provision store in Mersing that he expanded into a thriving business distributing foodstuffs along the east coast of Peninsula Malaysia. This was subsequently merged with the Kuok Group in exchange for an equity stake in Robert Kuok's rapidly expanding business which by then included the first ShangriLa Hotel in Singapore."
"The Kuok family traces its ancestry to the 8th century Tang Dynasty general Guo Ziyi, whose descendants included several famous generals under Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire. Guo Ziyi was notably mentioned by the Nestorian Christians (known as the Church of the East) as perhaps the earliest high ranking patron of the Christian Church in Tang Dynasty China."

"God's Mischief (original title: Daivathinte Vikrithikal) is a 1989 Malayalam novel written by M. Mukundan. Like most of Mukundan's works, this novel too is based in Mayyazhi, better known once as Mahé, the French colony after it was decolonised. The story centres on a magician, Father Alfonso, his daughter, Elsee and an Ayurveda Vaidyar Kumaran and his two twin sons and how their life changes after the land is decolonised. The novel won the Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award and the N. V. Prize. It was adapted into a film by noted director Lenin Rajendran in 1992."
"The story begins in 1950s, when the French, the colonial rulers were packing off from Mahé, a coastal town in North Malabar, after 230 years, leaving behind remnants of a cultural history. Those, who considered themselves as belonging to Francophone culture, jumped onto the first available vessel to France. And many of the older generation, orphaned by the departure of the French, struggle to eke out a living even as they remember their days of plenty under their foreign masters. Caught up in their suffering, Kumaran Vaidyar does everything he can to keep the people of his beloved Mayyazhi from starving, but entrusts his own children to the care of his wife, who is no more. Meanwhile, Father Alphonse waves his magic wand and changes pebbles into candy and waits for his good-looking son to return. Through all this, untroubled by the woes of the elders, Shivan, Shashi and Elsie spend an idyllic childhood in sunny, sleepy Mayyazhi. Until the day of reckoning catches up with them and they pay the price of growing up."
"The English translation of the book by Prema Jayakumar was released by Penguin Books India on 30 October 2013. ""India Today"" wrote: ""The translation is brilliant, losing none of the linguistic subtleties of prose and colour of the original Malayalam.

He is a two-time Olympian (1996 and 2000) and a top 16 finalist in the 200 m breaststroke on his Olympic debut in Atlanta (1996). He still holds a Latvian record in the 200 m breaststroke (2:16.21) that stood for more than a decade. While studying in the United States, Kalmikovs achieved a sixth-fastest of all time in the 200-yard breaststroke at the 2000 NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships. He has also been named a three-time Big-12 Conference Champion and a nine-time All-American, as a member of the University of Nebraska swimming and diving team. Since his sporting career ended in 2004, Kalmikovs has extensively traveled across the United States and Europe, working as a swimming coach."
"Kalmikovs, a native of Riga, Latvia, started swimming at the very young age under a Soviet system. Both of his parents were swimming coaches that motivated and inspired him to undergo training to an elite level and to become part of the Latvian squad. He has one younger sister, Margarita Kalmikova, who is also an elite breaststroke swimmer. Kalmikovs and his sister shared a sibling tandem in the sport, when they both competed together in two editions of the Olympic Games (1996 and 2000)."
"Kalmikovs accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he competed for the Nebraska Cornhuskers swimming and diving team under head coach Cal Bentz. While swimming for the Cornhuskers, Kalmikovs received a total of nine All-American honors, captured three Big 12 Conference titles, and held four school records in the 100 and 200-yard breaststroke. At the 2000 NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, during his junior year, Kalmikovs posted a sixth-fastest time of 2:10.64 in the 200-yard breaststroke, where Ed Moses set a new world record. In his senior season, Kalmikovs served as an assistant volunteer coach for the team before he graduated from the University in 2001 with a bachelor of arts degree in international affairs."
"Kalmikovs made his official debut, along with his sister Margarita Kalmikova, at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. He failed to reach the top 16 final in two out of his three attempts, finishing twenty-first in the 200 m individual medley (2:06.16), and eighteenth in the 400 m individual medley (4:28.04). In his third attempt, 200 m breaststroke, Kalmikovs powered home with a thirteenth-place effort in the B-Final at 2:16.23."

"At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Kalmikovs decided to drop half of his medley double, and experiment instead with 100 m breaststroke. He achieved FINA B-standards of 1:04.89 (100 m breaststroke), 2:16.30 (200 m breaststroke), and 2:04.83 (200 m individual medley) from the European Championships in Helsinki. On the first day of the Games, Kalmikovs placed thirty-fourth in the 100 m breaststroke. Swimming in heat four, he enjoyed a sprint finish with Puerto Rico's Arsenio López, as they both hit the wall first in a matching time of 1:04.02. Three days later, in the 200 m breaststroke, Kalmikovs established a new Latvian record of 2:16.21 to pull off a nineteenth-place effort from the heats, but missed the semifinal cut by more than half a second (0.50). In his final event, 200 m individual medley, Kalmikovs placed twenty-fourth on the morning prelims. Swimming again in heat four, he came up short in second place by 0.11 of a second behind New Zealand's Dean Kent in a lifetime best of 2:04.18."
"At the 2001 FINA World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Kalmikovs competed only in a breaststroke double. He failed to produce best results for the semifinals in any of his individual events, finishing thirty-fifth in the 100 m breaststroke (1:05.36), and twenty-first in the 200 m breaststroke (2:19.23)."
"Kalmikovs also sought his bid for his third Olympics in Athens, but forced to drop out from the Games, because of a wrist injury. Shortly after his qualifying bid, he announced his retirement from swimming."
"Since he graduated from the University of Nebraska in 2001, Kalmikovs continued to serve as an assistant swimming coach. He completed his master's degree in sports management and athletic administration at Valparaiso University in 2003, and later moved to California to coach numerous age group swimmers for Bakersfield Swim Club.

"Mark Major (born March 20, 1970 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger. He was drafted 25th overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the National Hockey League's 1988 entry draft. Major acquired many penalty minutes over his career due to his playing style, which involved battling in front of the net for loose pucks, scoring garbage goals, and blocking the goaltenders view. Major only played in two NHL games, for the Detroit Red Wings. He also enjoyed a short career as a professional roller hockey player in Roller Hockey International (RHI). Taking into account all of his hockey games played at a professional level, Major played in 1,339 games and acquired 4,334 penalty minutes, giving Major an average of 3.24 penalty minutes per game during his career. After 4 seasons and 2 Championships as Head Coach of the Amherstview Jets Junior A team, Major is taking a year off to help coach his daughter's Kingston Ice Wolves' Peewee AA team."
"Major started receiving attention from NHL scouts while playing for the Don Mills Flyers of the MTHL in 1986. He advanced to the North Bay Centennials of the Ontario Hockey League for the 1987–88 season and put up 33 points in 57 games to go along with a whopping 272 penalty minutes (PIM). Major averaged almost 5 penalty minutes a game, but his hard-nosed style was admired by NHL scouts and Major was selected 25th overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1988 NHL Draft. Now as an NHL prospect, Major gained confidence and began the 1988–89 season again with the Centennials before being traded 11 games in to the Kingston Raiders. He would remain in Kingston for that season and the next (when they were renamed the Kingston Frontenacs), scoring 112 points and 361 PIMs, before moving up to the Muskegon Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League. Major remained with the Lumberjacks for three seasons, scoring 77 points and 617 PIMs. He led the team in penalties during the 1991–92 season with 302 and would add another 29 PIMs in the Lumberjacks' playoff run which saw them lose four games to none in the finals to the Kansas City Blades. After his last season with the Lumberjacks, that included a relocation to Cleveland, Major was let go by the parent club Pittsburgh and quickly signed as a free agent by the Boston Bruins on July 22, 1993."
"Major started play with Boston's affiliate the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League. He scored 26 points along with 176 PIMs during the 1993–94 season, but Providence failed to make the playoffs. He was let go by the Bruins, and joined the Detroit Vipers of the IHL for the following season. He continued to play aggressively, with his 36 points and 229 PIMs helping push the Vipers into the playoffs, but his play couldn't help them past the second round."
"Major again caught the attention of an NHL team, when the Detroit Red Wings signed him as a free agent on June 26, 1995. He began play for the Adirondack Red Wings of the AHL in the 1995–96 season and scored 29 points while racking up 234 PIMs for second on the team. He was known as a player who wouldn't back down from a fight, and he was involved in several fights during Adirondack's short playoff run that season, receiving 21 PIMs in just three games."
"Major finally received his first shot in the big leagues during the 1996–97 NHL season when he was brought up from Adirondack for two games starting on November 2, 1996. In his very first game, halfway though the second period, Major fought veteran instigator Tie Domi of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Major held his own against Domi but was rewarded with a bloody nose and a five-minute major. Major played the following night and failed to impress the Detroit staff, which resulted in him being sent back down to the minors. Finishing the season with Adirondack, and leading the team in PIMs with 213, Major was let go by Detroit."
"Major still had NHL interest and was quickly signed as a free agent on August 20, 1997 by the Washington Capitals. He started out in their farm system playing for the Portland Pirates of the AHL. In his first season, Major was first on his team and second in the league for penalty minutes with 355. This was his career high for PIMs in a season and as of 2007, he still holds the team record for penalty minutes in a single season. Major wasn't finished with 355 and added 52 more PIMs in 10 playoff games that year. The following season he again led the team in PIMs and saw his point production decrease to only nine points in 66 games. He was let go by Washington and began play for the Houston Aeros of the IHL in 1999. After just 20 games (with 81 PIMs), Major was signed as a free agent by the Flint Generals of the United Hockey League. He was named team captain and finished out the 1999–00 season with the Generals scoring 41 points, his highest point total in years, and helped the team win the Colonial Cup. He put up great numbers the following season when he finished with 46 points and 163 PIMs. Generals coach Billy Thurlow had this to say about Major's style of play:"
"Anytime he's on the ice, people have to respect us. Nobody's going to shove us around."
"He would also go on to join the AHL's Hershey Bears for two games in the 2000–01 season. In 2001, he joined the Wheeling Nailers of the East Coast Hockey League and would go on to score 84 points in two seasons with the Nailers. The coach, John Brophy, had this to say about Major returning for his second season in Wheeling:"
"We are very fortunate to have Mark return to the Nailers, not only are we getting a great player and a natural team leader, but a guy who is good in the community and represents the Nailers and Penguins organizations with class."
"The 2003–04 season would be Major's last, playing in 40 games for the Laval Chiefs of the QSMHL and 12 games for the Kalamazoo Wings of the UHL."
"Major was also an active member in the Roller Hockey International League for its entire lifespan. Major played on the Buffalo Stampede in 1994 and 1995, winning the Murphy Cup in 1994. He joined the Empire State Cobras in 1996 and the New Jersey Rockin' Rollers in 1997. When the RHI folded in 1997, Major continued playing with the Buffalo Wings of Major League Roller Hockey in 1998 and joined the newly re-formed Roller Hockey International with Buffalo in 1999.

= = = Bartholomeus Breenbergh = = =
"Bartholomeus Breenbergh (before 13 November 1598 – after 3 October 1657) was a Dutch Golden Age painter of Italian and Italianate landscapes, in Rome (1619-1630) and Amsterdam (1630-1657)."
"Little is known of his early life. In his three-volume ""Schouburg"", Arnold Houbraken mentioned him in his first volume with an entreaty to readers to write to him with more news of Breenbergh's biography. He had been told that Breenberg was born in Utrecht and had been a master of Cornelis van Poelenburgh, which he knew to be impossible from the facts that he already had, namely ""the birth of Poelenburg in 1586 and the death of Breenberg in 1660."" Houbraken never received the information he requested, though he mentioned Breenbergh again in his second volume in a list of 59 competent painters who were contemporaries of Abraham Bloemaert and Paulus Potter."
"Äccording to the Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD), Breenbergh was born in the Netherlands town of Deventer, but after the death of his father in 1607 moved away with the rest of his family, probably to Hoorn. There he was a contemporary of Jacques Waben and possibly received his first training, though his first teacher is now supposed to be ""one of those many forgotten Amsterdam landscape painters of the 1610s"". His registered teachers are Pieter Lastman and Jacob Symonsz Pynas."
"Breenbergh is first registered as a painter on an archival record in 1619 in Amsterdam, though he possibly was established there earlier."
"In the same year he left for Rome. There he lived and worked with the Flemish painter Frans van de Kasteele and was heavily influenced by another Fleming resident, the landscape painter Paul Bril. From 1623, however, he came under the spell of Italian landscapes by the somewhat older Cornelis van Poelenburgh—indeed, the works of Breenbergh and van Poelenburgh are sometimes difficult to tell apart. He was also influenced by Nicolaes Moeyaert. Breenbergh in his turn influenced the French landscape-painter Claude Lorrain (who arrived in the city about 1620). In about 1620 Breenbergh became one of the founders of the Roman society of Dutch and Flemish painters, the ""Bentvueghels"", among whom he was nicknamed ""het fret"" (""the ferret"")."

= = = Arthur Lyon Fremantle = = =
"General Sir Arthur James Lyon Fremantle (11 November 1835 – 25 September 1901) was a British Army officer and a notable British witness to the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. Whilst holding the rank of ""Captain and Lieutenant Colonel"" he spent three months (from 2 April until 16 July 1863) in North America, travelling through parts of the Confederate States of America and the Union. Contrary to popular belief, Colonel Fremantle was not an official representative of the United Kingdom; instead, he was something of a tourist."
"Fremantle was born into a distinguished military family; his father, Lieutenant-General John Fremantle, had commanded a battalion of the Coldstream Guards, and had served during the Peninsular War and Waterloo Campaign, as well as acting as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General John Whitelocke during the abortive British invasion of Buenos Aires in 1807. Arthur's middle name, Lyon, came from his mother, Agnes Lyon. He was called ""Arthur"" after the Duke of Wellington, who had been the first witness at his parents' wedding in 1829."
"After his graduation from Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Arthur Fremantle was commissioned into the British Army in 1852, serving firstly as an ensign in the 70th Foot, before being transferred to the 52nd Foot almost immediately thereafter. The following year, Fremantle became ensign and lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards, and continued to receive promotions until, in 1860, at the age of 25, he held the rank of captain of his regiment and lieutenant colonel in the Army."
"The same year, Fremantle was appointed to the position of assistant military secretary at Gibraltar under Governor William John Codrington. In January 1862, the Confederate commerce raider CSS ""Sumter"", pursued by the Union Navy, arrived in port. The ship's commander, Raphael Semmes, sought to have his ship repaired and refitted, although ultimately the ""Sumter"" was sold and its crew transferred to the newly constructed CSS ""Alabama"". Sometime in early 1862, the young British captain met the flamboyant Confederate captain, and was inspired by Semmes' tales of blockade running and combat on the high seas."
"Like many other officers of his generation, including Lieutenant Colonel Garnet Wolseley, Fremantle had a considerable interest in the American Civil War. Unlike most of the others, however, he decided to take a tour of the South, and applied for a leave of absence in 1863. By his own admission, his initial sympathies lay with the Union, due to his natural distaste for slavery. But as stated in his own book, in the Preface:"
"On 2 March 1863, Captain and Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle left England on board the mail steamer ""Atrato""."

= = = Museum Building (Trinity College Dublin) = = =
"The Museum Building is a building within Trinity College. Finished in 1857 and located on the south of New Square, it is home to the University's Geology, Geography, Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering departments. It is a Palazzo style building, inspired by Byzantine architecture of Venice, and finished in Lombardo−Romanesque detailing, with over highly decorated 108 carved capitals."
"In 1833 the then Board of the College instigated a competition for a new Museum Building to contain the geological and various other collections which were housed within the large room of Regents House. Tenders were invited for almost twenty years, ending with the design submitted by Thomas Newenham Deane and Benjamin Woodward being accepted in April 1853. At the time however a row with John McCurdy had caused some concerns to the Board."
"On 23 May 1853 a contract for foundations was agreed with Messrs Cockburn & Son builders (for £24,000) and ground was broken some months later. It was during this time that Samuel Haughton (Professor of Geology) undertook an investigation into the suitability of the site due to its close proximity to the Old Library. He reported various layers of made ground, ash pits and calcareous drift, finally deeming the site permissible to build upon."
"The exterior of the building was fully in place by 1855; however, it was not until 1857 that the interior was completed and the building as a whole finished."
"Suitably fitting for a building designed to house a Geology collection, the Museum Building was constructed from a vast number of different and contrasting forms of stone. College tradition holds that it some form of stone from every quarry in Ireland during the time of its construction was used somewhere within the building."
"The exterior walls were first constructed from Calp Limestone, which were then faced with 22.86 cm (9 inches) of Ballyknockan Granite. The quoins, columns and 108 capitals, as well as the string course which can be seen halfway up the building, are all of Portland stone from the Isle of Portland, Dorset. The tympanum over the heavy wooden main door to building and which bears the crest of the College (a popular 19th-century variant, slightly different from the one currently used by the college today) is of Caen stone from Caen, France. Overall the exterior amounted to just under half the cost for the entire building."
"Initially Deane and Woodward had planned for the interior walls to be of rubble which would then be plastered over. However, in early 1855 they submitted a design change to the Board, deciding instead to use Caen Stone, and the Board agreed. However, when they had learnt that only two thirds of the stone had arrived the Board rescinded this permission. After strong argument from Deane, on 4 May they Board overruled their prior decision and agreed to the use of Caen Stone."
"The large domed central hall once again makes heavy use of Irish stone. The Romanesque arches between each column use alternating yellow and red stained blocks which sit upon bases and capitals of heavily carved Portland Stone. The central staircase and floors of the upper balconies are also made of Portland Stone. The original floor was composed of Yorkstone flagstones, further Portland Stone, Welsh Ffestiniog stone, with black squares of black slate, however this floor later relaid."
"The main entrance hall of the building houses fourteen full columns and eighteen half-column made of Irish Marble, although the only true marble is Connemara Serpentine. There had been some problems sourcing the materials needed to have every column complete, which after more petitioning from Deane resulted in the half columns. The only non-Irish stone used in the columns is a dark red Serpentine from Ruan Minor, The Lizard peninsula area of Cornwall."
The known stone from which the columns are made of include:
"Some of the interior room designs by Deane and Woodward were never realised, as the official college architect John McCurdy had convinced the Board otherwise."
"The entirety of the building's carvings are by brothers John and James O'Shea of O'Shea and Whelan who gathered wild flowers to use as models from the college's botanical garden near Ballsbridge. There are seven carvings that relate specifically to Aesop's Fables, and one (considered to be the most important) which refers to Charles Darwin and Evolution."
"College records from May 1860 mention of how the smoggy atmosphere had adversely affected the stone. After years of laying behind sooty deposits the ashlar of the building had become obscured. In 2010 a three-year conservation programme of the Museum Building was begun. Once finished in March 2013, many of the carvings which were almost invisible had been restored to their past state."

"John McPherson (19 June 1868 – 31 July 1926) was a Scottish footballer who played for Cowlairs, Kilmarnock, Rangers and the Scotland national team."
"Born in Kilmarnock and known as 'Kitey' from a young age, McPherson started his career with his local side Kilmarnock, winning the Ayrshire Cup in 1885. He appeared for English club Everton as an amateur in 1887, also playing for Cowlairs of Glasgow in the early rounds of the 1887–88 Scottish Cup, which led to a protest by their defeated opponents Third Lanark over the possibility of McPherson and others having professional status (prohibited at the time). Another player (Robert Calderwood) was found to have been paid by an English club and the match was replayed, with Cowlairs winning again. McPherson did not return to Everton, featuring instead for Kilmarnock in the same edition of the Scottish Cup before spending the next two years with Cowlairs, after which he joined Rangers in 1890."
"McPherson played mainly as a striker at Rangers, but was often used in other positions including goalkeeper. He played in the inaugural Scottish League season, 1890–91, where Rangers finished as joint champions with Dumbarton. McPherson's first recorded appearance was in a friendly against Everton on 19 April 1890 at Ibrox, and he scored in a 6–2 defeat. His first League appearance, however, was in Rangers' first ever Scottish League match, on 16 August 1890 in a 5–2 win over Hearts at Ibrox, in which he scored. McPherson scored 15 goals in Rangers' 18 matches in the League that season, including four in a 6–2 win over Cambuslang at Whitefield Park on 23 August 1890 (the first ever hat-trick scored in the Scottish Football League) and five in an 8–2 win over St Mirren on 4 October 1890."
"Despite Rangers' successful introduction to the Scottish Football League, they had to wait until season 1898–99 to win the League title again. It was done in style as Rangers won all of their 18 League matches, with McPherson netting 10 times. That remarkable season was the first of four consecutive League titles and McPherson made significant contributions to all of them, scoring nine goals in 1899–1900, seven in 1900–01 and three in 1901–02 — which proved to be his last season with Rangers."
"McPherson also won three Scottish Cup medals with Rangers, the first in 1894, where he scored in five of Rangers' six matches, including the 3–1 final win over Celtic at Hampden. McPherson also scored in the 1897 final, where Rangers defeated Dumbarton 5–1. His third medal came a year later, 1898, in a 2–0 win over his former club Kilmarnock. His final recorded appearance for Rangers was in a 2–0 friendly defeat to Glentoran on 2 April 1902."
"McPherson was also a Scottish International, winning a total of nine caps and scoring six goals. He is one of four players named John McPherson (none of whom are related) to have represented Scotland at full international level. He also played five times for the Scottish League representative side."
"A qualified engine–fitter, McPherson maintained a close association with Rangers after his playing years, serving as a director from 1907 until his death in 1926 at the age of 58. He is buried in Craigton Cemetery not far from Ibrox Stadium."
"McPherson had several family members involved in football. His son, also John, played at Junior level with Benburb, and his grandson Johnny (known as 'Sailor' due to his wartime navy service) played a single league match for Rangers in 1948 followed by spells at senior level with Ayr United and in the juniors with Irvine Meadow."
"In addition, his younger brother David was a teammate at Rangers, had a long spell at Kilmarnock (including in the 1898 Scottish Cup Final where he and John were on the opposing teams) and was also a Scottish international. Elder brother James was a teammate at Kilmarnock, Cowlairs and the Glasgow FA team, played as a guest for Celtic and spent a lengthy period as a trainer at Newcastle United working with Frank Watt; when James retired, the role was taken by his son , whose previous jobs included the Norway squad at the 1920 Olympics, Vitesse in the Netherlands and Bayern Munich in Germany. Another of James's sons was also a trainer/manager who led HBS to the Dutch championship in 1925, while his daughter Mary married Newcastle player and Germany international Edwin Dutton."

"The English College Johore Bahru, also known as Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar, abbreviated as English College, EC, MSAB, The College, and sometimes dubbed ""The Pride Of Johore"", is an old premier school in Malaysia. It is an all-boys school in Johor Bahru, Johor. The school is under the royal patronage of the Sultanate of Johor, and it has been awarded the status of Cluster School of Excellence by the Ministry of Education (Malaysia). English College Johore Bahru (EC) is one of the ten oldest English institutions in Malaysia and the oldest school in Johore."
"English College was established on 21 March 1914, with 21 students selected from Bukit Zaharah School. The school was initially located close to the Sungai Chat Palace facing the Lido Beach in Johor Bahru. Remains of the former school site can still be seen but on the site is now the M Suite Hotel, while the campus of vocational studies has been replaced by the old Royal Malaysian Customs of Johore. The 21 students were placed under the tutelage of two teachers brought over from England, Morrison and Holman. These 21 students can be regarded as the pioneers, and from this beginning EC became an educational institution in Johor Bahru."
"The education system of the EC was based on that of the English public school and it adopted the British syllabus, and EC later became a model for other English medium schools in Johor. The teachers of the school were initially recruited from Europe, although later locally trained teachers were used to teach Malay subjects."
"After end of World War I in 1918, the EC held for the first time its "" Junior Cambridge"" examinations, later followed by"" Senior Cambridge"" examinations. However, the results for both examinations were poor, and as a consequence the school was closed temporarily in 1928 for reassessment. It reopened in May of the same year, and after remedial actions had been taken by the school administration, the school met its target at the end of 1928. 143 students were selected to study Mathematics, Science and English. Also in 1928, T. Drury, who had been in the Education Service of Malaya since 1921, was appointed the principal of EC."
"At the end of 1930, the school moved to its present location at Jalan Sungei Chat. Of the original school, only stone blocks and steps are left, which can still be seen at its old site. The new EC was officially opened in early 1931, and the school has since produced many outstanding students. Two of its most famous students are Tun Hussein Onn, who later became the Prime Minister and Tun Musa Hitam, the Deputy Prime Minister."
"Some of the notable teachers there were Pendeta Za'Ba, T. Drury, T. Grundy, Mr Bion Dury, Hj. Zulkipli Bin Hj. Mahmod, Victor Joshua Jeyaretnam (father of J. B. Jeyaretnam) and Mohamad Bin Iskandar (father of Tun Mahathir Mohamad)."
"During the Japanese occupation of Malaya from 1941 to 1945, the EC was used as a military base, a factory, a military hospital, as well as a prison camp by the Japanese. The school reopened in early 1946 after the end of Japanese occupation. H. L. Hill was appointed the Headmaster of EC, and under his leadership, the EC returned to its status of a prestigious school. In 1949, the first group of girls was admitted to the EC."
"In 1960, following the end of the British rule in Malaya, the name was changed to"" 'Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar""' (MSAB) after Sultan Sir Abu Bakar of Johor who was the Father of Modern Johore.

It sometimes even resides in Iguazú Falls in the Misiones Province, Argentina. It will also take small aquatic isopods, amphipods and even takes parasitic ostracods off other fish (preferably characins') bodies. It ranges from Mexico south to Chile. This species is very easy to keep in captivity. It will take live brine shrimp, freeze-dried bloodworms and algae flakes and pellets."
= = = Taxonomic contributions of Major P. H. G. Powell-Cotton = = =
This is a list of the taxonomic contributions of Major Percy Horace Gordon Powell-Cotton.
"The natural history specimens and cultural objects collected by Major Powell-Cotton (1866–1940) on his expeditions to Africa and Asia are finely preserved in the Powell-Cotton Museum. According to the Mammal Catalogue produced by the Powell-Cotton Museum, the species of over 6400 specimens (more than 230 species) preserved in the Museum belong to the following 42 families and 149 genera:"
"The majority of the specimens fall within the scope of the genera Alcelaphus, Anomalurus, Cephalophus, Cercocebus, Cercopithecus, Colobus, Euoticus, Felis, Gazella, Gorilla, Kobus, Pan, Redunca, Sylvicapra, Syncerus and Tragelaphuse (number of the specimens exceeds 100). And, except the two presented specimens of chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) collected in Swiss Alps in 1905, all the mammal specimens in the Powell-Cotton Museum were collected in Africa and Asia at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, which came from the following countries or regions: Abyssinia, Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Guinea, India, Kashmir, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Ogaden, Pakistan, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Tibet, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe."
"The large mammal specimen collection was built up on the basis of Powell-Cotton's forty years’ exploration in Africa and the Indian subcontinent, which is helpful in conducting taxonomic, zoological, ethnobiological/ethnomedical and ethnographic studies. The mammal type specimens identified from the total specimens are listed as follows:"
"The mammal species named after Major P. H. G. Powell-Cotton can be distinguished by the subspecies name “cottoni” or “powelli”. The specimens collected by Major P. H. G. Powell-Cotton play an important role in scientific studies because the existence of some of the cottoni species are in danger now, for example, the B/W Colobus (Colobus angolensis cottoni) was rated “Least Concern” in The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species published in 2008. The accounts of Major P. H. G. Powell-Cotton's specimen collection activities can be found in his books and articles. And, there is no difference between some of his writings and adventure stories. For example, in Black rhinoceros hunting which is included in Big Game Shooting in Africa, he vividly recorded the hunting of a black Rhino:"
"Aside from the two books titled “A Sporting Trip through Abyssinia” (1902) and “In Unknown Africa” (1904) and the book chapter titled “Black rhinoceros hunting”, his writings were published in journals and magazines, including The Antiquaries Journal (e.g. vol. 4, no. 3, 1924), The Geographical Journal (vol. 30, 1907), Journal of the Society for the Preservation of the Fauna of the Empire (e.g. Jan. 1937), Journal of the Royal African Society (e.g. vol. 7, 1907), The Wide World Magazine (e.g. Feb. 1904) and Man (e.g. vol. 29, 1929). The content of these writings includes the records of mammal hunting, accounts of the biological characteristics of mammals and descriptions of local (primarily African) culture and nature."
"The mammal specimens (skulls, skeletons, skin, horns, etc.) in the Powell-Cotton Museum are exhibits as well as objects of study. Some academics from universities and research institutes such as University of Cambridge, University College London, University of Sheffield, University of Kent, University of Exeter, The University of Bradford, University of the Witwatersrand, University of California, Université Sorbonne Nouvelle - Paris III, University of Melbourne, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Canterbury Christchurch University, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna used to visit this museum in order to obtain skeletal data, collect samples for DNA or dietary analysis and so on. One of the famous academic visitors is Professor Colin Groves of the Australian National University, whose research interests include but are not limited to mammalian taxonomy (especially primate taxonomy), human evolution and taxonomic history of mammals. In addition to the specimens preserved in the museums such as Natural History Museum (London), Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle (Paris), Museum voor Middenafrika (Tervuren), Naturalis (Leiden), Musée Royale d’Histoire Naturelle (Brussels), Kenya National Museums (Nairobi), Zoologisches Museum A. Humboldt (Berlin) and Museum A. Koenig (Bonn), he also utilized the mammal specimens provided by the Powell-Cotton Museum and hence conducted many comparative studies, for example, he used to measure the skulls of Northern White Rhinoceros, and examine the colobus material and the specimens of musk-deer at the Museum. Some of these studies can be found in his noted book “Primate Taxonomy” which is considered to relabel museum cabinets. And, he thought highly of the Powell-Cotton Museum."
"Under the joint effort of Bernard Wood, University Professor of Human Origins at The George Washington University, Adam D. Gordon, an anthropologist and assistant professor at the University at Albany, State University of New York and Malcolm Harman, curator of the Powell-Cotton Museum, the “Human Origin Database” project, which is funded by The G. Harold & Leila Y. Mathers Foundation and aims to provide information about fossil hominin specimens and extant hominoid specimens, has been developed. In addition to the measurements and skeletal element information in Professor Wood's 1991 book Koobi Fora Research Project. Volume 4: Hominid Cranial Remains, the complete skeletal element inventory of the chimpanzee and gorilla collections preserved in the Powell-Cotton Museum is also included in this database."

"Kenta spent the majority of his 2007 time in Noah wrestling a variety of tag team and six-man tag team matches with protégé Taiji Ishimori and Akitoshi Saito as partners. He saw most of his success with Ishimori as the two had critically acclaimed matches against a wide variety of competitors, including Ring of Honor (ROH) competitors on loan to the company due to the talent exchange agreement, the Global Professional Wrestling Alliance (GPWA), between ROH and Noah: the Briscoe Brothers, Davey Richards, and Bryan Danielson. As Kenta and Ishimori progressed as a unit, they entered the first NTV Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Tournament; in the finals they beat Marufuji and Kota Ibushi to win the tournament. They later challenged the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions, Dragon Gate wrestlers BxB Hulk and Shingo Takagi, in a winning effort before losing them to Yoshinobu Kanemaru and Kotaro Suzuki, only to defeat the team to win the second NTV Junior Heavyweight Tag Team League Tournament."

Kenta lost the title in February 2009 to rival in their interpromotional rivalry with another member of the GPWA in the Kensuke Office, Katsuhiko Nakajima, only to win it back in the next month. In October, Kobayashi was forced to vacate the title after suffering a knee injury, which would keep him sidelined for over seven months."

"Kenta's first loss in the company came in the form of a tag team match, which saw his partner, Davey Richards, get pinned in a match against the Briscoe Brothers. This led to a series of matches with the two against each other, as well as reluctant partners. At ""Glory by Honor V: Night 2"" Kenta received another match against Danielson for the ROH World title, which saw him submit to Danielson's signature hold, the Cattle Mutilation."

"Since November 2018, Itami formed an alliance with Ariya Daivari. On the January 8, 2019 episode of ""205 Live"", Itami defeated Cedric Alexander to qualify for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship fatal four-way match involving champion Buddy Murphy, Kalisto, and Tozawa at the Royal Rumble, where he lost after being pinned by Murphy."
"On January 29, it was reported that Itami requested and was granted his release from the company after a five year run. That same day, after a loss to Tozawa on ""205 Live"", Daivari turned on Itami. This was followed by multiple members of the roster saying goodbye to Itami on social media. On February 4, 2019, the WWE Performance Center YouTube channel that documents the Superstars travel and backstage life released a video chronicling Itami's last week in WWE. The video features Itami working with Daivari and talking about his struggles with learning to speak and understand English. The end of the video sees Hideo walking back to gorilla position and being given a standing ovation from those in the backstage area. On February 22, Kobayashi was officially released by WWE, as the company formally acknowledged his departure on Twitter."
"Kenta made his surprise debut for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) on June 9, 2019 at the Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall event, with Katsuyori Shibata as his manager, announcing his participation in the 2019 G1 Climax tournament. Kenta made his in-ring debut for NJPW on July 6, defeating Kota Ibushi as a part of the tournament. Kenta, competing in the A Block of the tournament, stayed undefeated in singles matches for over a month and a half, defeating Hiroshi Tanahashi, Lance Archer, and Evil before suffering his first defeat against IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada on July 27, as part of the tournament. Kenta would then lose his next four matches against Sanada, Bad Luck Fale, Will Ospreay and Zack Sabre Jr., failing to win the tournament with a final tally of 8 points."
"On the final night of the tournament, Kenta competed in a six-man tag team match alongside Chaos members Tomohiro Ishii and Yoshi-Hashi against Bullet Club's Bad Luck Fale, Tama Tonga, and Tanga Loa, only to turn on them in the closing moments of the match and assisting the Bullet Club for the victory. As Kenta was going to explain his actions, Katsuyori Shibata rushed into the ring and attacked Kenta until the rest of the Bullet Club members ambushed Shibata. At Royal Quest on August 31, Kenta defeated Ishii for the NEVER Openweight Championship, his first championship in NJPW. The match was criticized because Kobayashi suffered a concussion after a back suplex by Ishii, getting knocked out in the process. However, both continued the match without referee stoppage. He was sent to the hospital after the show. At Destruction in Kagoshima on September 16, Kenta unsuccessfully faced Kota Ibushi for the Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate."
"At Power Struggle, Kenta retained his title against Ishii in a rematch. Later in the night, he interfered in the main event between Jay White and Hirooki Goto helping White, a fellow Bullet Club member, retain the title while also once again assaulting Shibata. Kenta lost the NEVER Openweight Championship to Goto at Wrestle Kingdom 14 on January 5, 2020, ending his reign at 127 days with two successful defenses. Later that night, after the main event for both the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and IWGP Intercontinental Championship between Kazuchika Okada and Tetsuya Naito (which Naito won), KENTA attacked Naito and hit him with the GTS, and sat on top of him posing with both of Naito's newly won belts."

Bioswales are linear channels designed to concentrate and convey stormwater runoff while removing debris and pollution. Bioswales can also be beneficial in recharging groundwater.
"Bioswales are typically vegetated, mulched, or xeriscaped. They consist of a swaled drainage course with gently sloped sides (less than 6%). Bioswale design is intended to safely maximize the time water spends in the swale, which aids the collection and removal of pollutants, silt and debris. Depending on the site topography, the bioswale channel may be straight or meander. Check dams are also commonly added along the bioswale to increase stormwater infiltration. A bioswale's make-up can be influenced by many different variables, including climate, rainfall patterns, site size, budget, and vegetation suitability."
