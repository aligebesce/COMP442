"You don't get introduced to characters, you don't plunge  straight in."
"Er  yeah, I have thought of  a very different one."
"I mean they don't, er, in the middle of things."
You're not really given any background either.
Yeah.
So
"Shakespeare always usually gives you a bit of  you know, you just got the two gentleman speaking clear and ."
Yeah.
Exactly.
And we accept those things.
"You know, give us a chance to get into the play and get comfortable on our feet and we'll have a go, well, Johnson doesn't give you that option does he?"
"It's straight in there  there's a fight between three, two men and a woman, you don't know what's going on, they're just abusing each other and  and the picture"
is there.
Now Johnson it brilliant for doing abuse.
There's this  wonderful put down.
I'll have  please.
. Erm  okay.
"So in a very different world to that of Shakespearean comedy, a must harsher abrasive  world  erm  again th that bit where she's ge get , do I get the impression that most of you found yours much more difficult to get into"
Yeah.
than Shakespeare?
Yeah.
Mm mm.
Yeah?
Does anybody  have this  ?
"Er, mm"
"Erm, I found it was like reading Shakespeare when I first started reading Shakespeare."
Yeah.
"Cos it's  I think, different types."
Yeah.
You get used to Shakespeare.
Yeah.
"It's, it's, you get used to the way he works."
"How's , how's your eye."
"Keep still a minute, let's have a look, come here, Sam, Sam"
"Hey, Sam, Sam , come here."
Keep your head still a minute we want to look at your nutter.
It looks much better doesn't it?
Getting your fur fur back.
"That's right, you see to him, go on you see to him, you see to him,."
"Trouble is Rocky, Rocky's knackered from his walk and so is ."
", hello Davy ."
"That's great , Rocky, Rocky's panting a bit, seems a bit tired but Sam's all fresh."
"He has, he hasn't been very active actually"
There is an unfair advantage here
He was looking
"sleeping in the car today, that's what it is he's just woken up."

"Is there nobody round here listening that can erm that could bring in some Beaujolais Nouv no no little Off Licence that will do this free publicity on the B B C to come in a say, Look I'm an odd bin or something like that ?"
I I thought the B B C I thought the B B C couldn't advertise then?
No the B B C can't.
But you can?
Well.
You're the exception to the rule I suppose?
Yes you wait till you get severely beaten and then you say I'm very sorry I didn't mean to do that.
Hang on hang on I've got Rachael  from er from Guide Friday Buses.

"Oh I can't I've got things to do in the office, a busy company here."

"And I come out he goes oh it's cold I'm just gonna get me coat, I'll be back in a minute"
Ooh  he's dead creepy though isn't he?

"I goes what the hell's it look like, I'm going to sleep!"
"He goes  he goes you can't go to sleep, and he sat on the edge of my bed for about quarter of an hour."
Your bed.
What do you mean your bed ?
You was on Andrew's.
Ooh ah
"Well I was only going to  sleep Jo , I wasn't doing anything, I'm just tired."
"Oh I can't put it in there, it's not going to fit."

will make me feel alright
"And like he just, he just sat there  and it was, ooh it was so creepy."
"And like I thought I'm not gonna look up in case he goes for me or something, so I just kept my head in the pillow and pretended the light was blinding me  oh ha ha    cos when I get you alone   what?"
in their car.
What?

What's the matter?
I don't think    holding me tight tight
"You know,woh what you been doing, sort of thing!"
"And he's told her the whole story  so Noel's gone home and his mum's gone, what's that on your neck?"
"So Noel's gone  oh  someone tripped me up, I fell down the stairs and hit it on the coffee table, right!"
His mum believed him!
"So then his  Scott's mum and Noel's mum met in town  and they were just talking  and Scott's mum  it's dis , God it's disgusting isn't it  that lad given all them little lads love bites!"
And er  Noel's mum's going  well what?
I don't know what you mean!
Noel said  he'd hit it on the coffee table !
"Next day at school, Noel's come in and gone to Scott, you bastard!"
Why do you have go and tell your mum the truth for !
I'd never tell my mum that!
"Like, luckily they're"
Oh God!
"no , not very big but I've still got the one, I've still got, and it's right next to it as well!"
Mm.
Now it's yellow now it's going!
Yeah.
"But, ah"
Ah gee
ah Jesus!
I think they're
At least
really disgusting!
"Cos like, Scott was going I've never gave anyone one, you know."
"And er  Hannah's going  we started off the conversation where was the perviest you've ever had one  I mean, knowing that I didn't have one, ever had one before  and that was Mark , feeble attempt that lasted about ten minutes"
I think !
And I was really upset about that as you can imagine!
But like erm  what was I saying?
Oh yeah  so I was going what's the perviest place?
"I was thinking, you know, Scotts bound to have some pervy ones off Mandy !"
"But like er, and he was going oh I've never had one except for like, this Franny  bloke!."
Girls don't do it to boys as much as boys do it to girls though do they?
"No what, perhaps what you should do is"
Mm.
one of you should go and pick her up
That's what I'm saying.
Mm.
from the choir one night and you can say to him  oh my boyfriend's picking me up and then see how .
"Or you, bring me over and introduce me."
Mm.
And I'll say
"you know, I'll say thank you for taking Anna-Marie to, to the Mozart concert."
Mm.
I'll have to do it
But I think she was very .
"It was really, it was really , it was really very helpful to her  at her choir and her practice that night."
Er erm
"Yes, cos I'm gonna have to make up some"
rubbish about
Seeing him.
see my boyfriend isn't too interested in concerts
and that's why I've enjoyed coming out this evening.
"And here, here am I, and then I'll say  you know of course I  you know I'm indebted to you because I realize that, you know, Anna-Marie is quite prepared to go out with other men if she wants to"
but I like  and make sure it's alright.
I'm actually going to join in the choir.
You'll be able to take her
I can't even have a
.
.
Anna-Marie's  told me so much about it .
"And can you tell me the ta , time of trains from  ."
"Yum yum, look, come on over here."
"And that's what he was like on Wednesday night, he said look"
"as so , more or less as soon as he'd said hello he said erm  thirty two and two minutes past the hour, they're your trains."
"So  but we fair enjoyed them , they think, the younger ones don't like them nowadays but"
Mhm.
we enjoyed them.
"Cos I like, I like the accordion, I like country dancing."
Did you go to the Country Dancing Club at all?
Oh yes.
"Went to the Country Dancing Club, used to go all over to the Country Dances"
Oh?
to different places.
"It was supposed to have been quite good up at ,?"
"Aye it was sti , yes it was still going when I came up here."
Mhm
Aha.
"Was it Mrs , from  took it ?"
And were there men went to the country dancing as well?
"Oh yes , oh yes, aye."
Not so many men as went ladies but er
Do you think
there was a lot of men.
"the rise of the Country Dancing Clubs was maybe be to kind of try and compensate in a way for the dances themselves going down, ordinary dances, folk were wanting to do the Scottish dancing and things?"
It could have been but you found
"you found at the Country Dancing, it was different people that was at the Country Dancing than what than what it was at the  more at the the ordinary dances."
Folk that maybe would have been shy to go to a
Mhm.
a big dance?
Yes er maybe but
would come to the country dancing.
Or some of the older folk maybe that
"Folk, I think yes, it was more, mhm."
Right.
But you get country dancing that's very energetic really.
Yes.
No.
Mess around with your make up.
So I can get loads of homework done  and erm  like I can count that as one of my nights in.
Mm.
So that'll be quite useful I reckon really  as well as getting a bit of money.
"Well, oh my mum's having such a fit about like  on our er, exam leads  like er  she goes to me this morning, like my da , her and my dad were talking about it  she is saying, and she'll do it!"
Cos me
Yeah.
"and my, my, me and my brother are gonna be off at the same time"
Yeah.
"like be doing his A levels and that  she's saying that she's gonna take both of our stereos, lock them in the, lock them in the shed all day, take"
Mm.
"the keys with her  and take the er, plug off the telly  so we've got nothing to  occupy us!"
And she's serious as well!
Mm.
"Because  we're both such weak willed people, honestly!"
Same as me.
"I mean, I've got a, I've got a French homework that was due in today  told Mrs  I'd left my book at home, I accidentally bought the wrong book!"
"So she goes, I want it first thing tomorrow morning, and I mean like  this is talking like, we're talking major  here!"
Mm.
"And like  I started doing it, I'll read it out in English  I started writing it in French  came to a word I didn't know and thought  ah leave it!"
And I've left it now!
Mm.
"So like I'll go in, half nine  I'll get a drink, you know  sit down, look out the window, see if Scott's in, phone him up if he is  say helloee darling!"
"Ah, erm"
By the way I'm not pregnant !
God this subject keeps coming up doesn't it?
I'm gonna
Oh!
get dead bored now!
Whoever it is that's listening to our interesting conversation!
"Don't you reckon that'd be dead boring though, I mean  I mean"
"if you said I made a suggestion, what sort of word would that be?"
"Come on, you're all asleep, now a suggestion what would that be?"
A nou
"Yes come on Charlie be brave, a noun, yes, a something isn't it, a, if you write a or the in front of a word it's usually a noun, okay, so just keep listening for the a and the."
"The next one, Trevor"
Erm beware
"Beware, right and a sentence please"
Beware of Frankenstein
Beware of Frankenstein.
Charlie
Erm
third one down
I had a nightmare last night
You had a nightmare last night.
What happened in your nightmare?
Don't know
Come back to life again
because when you woke up this morning
and the next one
Juggle
Juggle
"Erm, I know a clown that juggles"
I know a clo a clown that juggles.
"Why couldn't you actually have J U G, one G, L E?"
why couldn't you have the spelling J U G L E?
Something would happen to the L
Something would happen not to the L but to the vowel.
"Hello  I'm terribly busy Norma actually, I've got a full lesson at the minute, erm, I'll, I'll try and, and sort that out as soon as I've finished this lesson"
"okay, thanks for telling me Norma"
"thank you, bye ."
Jugle
"Yes because what happens when you've got just a very thin L, the magic E can even work through it, U, right, so it will be jugle , yeah,jugle , that wouldn't be the right pronunciation at all, okay, let's go on to the next one"
An hour passed away .
`` Hang them ! ''
said the captain .
`` This is as dull as the doldrums .
"Gray , whistle for a wind . ''"
And just at that moment came the first news of the attack .
"`` If you please , sir , '' said Joyce , `` if I see anyone , am I to fire ? ''"
`` I told you so ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` Thank you , sir , '' returned Joyce with the same quiet civility ."
"Nothing followed for a time , but the remark had set us all on the alert , straining ears and eyes -- the musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands , the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face ."
"So some seconds passed , till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket and fired ."
"The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley , shot behind shot , like a string of geese , from every side of the enclosure ."
"Several bullets struck the log-house , but not one entered ; and as the smoke cleared away and vanished , the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before ."
"Not a bough waved , not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence of our foes ."
`` Did you hit your man ? ''
asked the captain .
"`` No , sir , '' replied Joyce ."
"`` I believe not , sir . ''"
"`` Next best thing to tell the truth , '' muttered Captain Smollett ."
"`` Load his gun , Hawkins ."
"How many should say there were on your side , doctor ? ''"
"`` I know precisely , '' said Dr. Livesey ."
`` Three shots were fired on this side .
I saw the three flashes -- two close together -- one farther to the west . ''
`` Three ! ''
repeated the captain .
"`` And how many on yours , Mr. Trelawney ? ''"
But this was not so easily answered .
"There had come many from the north -- seven by the squire 's computation , eight or nine according to Gray ."
From the east and west only a single shot had been fired .
"It was plain , therefore , that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities ."
`` Lazy ? ''
`` Certainly .
"Laziness is a virtue in these strenuous days , I was not born with it , but I have painstakingly acquired it , and I am proud of my success ."
I have time to enjoy life . ''
"`` I think that I like you , '' said Mollie ."
"`` You have the merit of being able to enter into a situation , '' he assured her ."
When the last Jersey was milked they carried the pails down to the spring where the creamers were sunk and strained the milk into them .
Murray washed the pails and Mollie wiped them and set them in a gleaming row on the shelf under a big maple .
"`` Thank you , '' she said ."
"`` You are not going yet , '' said Murray resolutely ."
`` The time I saved you in milking three cows belongs to me .
We will spend it in a walk along the pond shore .
I will show you a path I have discovered under the beeches .
It is just wide enough for two .
Come . ''
"He took her hand and drew her through the copse into a green lane , where the ferns grew thickly on either side and the pond waters plashed dreamily below them ."
"He kept her hand in his as they went down the path , and she did not try to withdraw it ."
"About them was the great , pure silence of the morning , faintly threaded with caressing sounds -- croon of birds , gurgle of waters , sough of wind ."
The spirit of youth and love hovered over them and they spoke no word .
"When they finally came out on a little green nook swimming in early sunshine and arched over by maples , with the wide shimmer of the pond before it and the gold dust of blossoms over the grass , the girl drew a long breath of delight ."
"`` It is a morning left over from Eden , is n't it ? ''"
said Murray .
"`` Yes , '' said Mollie softly ."
Murray bent toward her .
"`` You are Eve , '' he said ."
`` You are the only woman in the world -- for me .
Adam must have told Eve just what he thought about her the first time he saw her .
There were no conventionalities in Eden -- and people could not have taken long to make up their minds .
We are in Eden just now .
One can say what he thinks in Eden without being ridiculous .
"You are divinely fair , Eve ."
Your eyes are stars of the morning -- your cheek has the flush it stole from the sunrise-your lips are redder than the roses of paradise .
* * * * * When Katherine had been at Harbour Hill for a week she wondered how upon earth she was going to put in the remaining seven .
"Harbour Hill was noted for its beauty , but not every woman can live by scenery alone ."
"`` Aunt Elizabeth , '' said Katherine one day , `` does anybody ever die in Harbour Hill ?"
Because it does n't seem to me it would be any change for them if they did . ''
Aunt Elizabeth 's only reply to this was a shocked look .
"To pass the time Katherine took to collecting seaweeds , and this involved long tramps along the shore ."
On one of these occasions she met with an adventure .
The place was a remote spot far up the shore .
"Katherine had taken off her shoes and stockings , tucked up her skirt , rolled her sleeves high above her dimpled elbows , and was deep in the absorbing process of fishing up seaweeds off a craggy headland ."
"She looked anything but dignified while so employed , but under the circumstances dignity did not matter ."
"Presently she heard a shout from the shore and , turning around in dismay , she beheld a man on the rocks behind her ."
He was evidently shouting at her .
What on earth could the creature want ?
"`` Come in , '' he called , gesticulating wildly ."
`` You 'll be in the bottomless pit in another moment if you do n't look out . ''
"`` He certainly must be a lunatic , '' said Katherine to herself , `` or else he 's drunk ."
What am I to do ? ''
"`` Come in , I tell you , '' insisted the stranger ."
`` What in the world do you mean by wading out to such a place ?
"Why , it 's madness . ''"
Katherine 's indignation got the better of her fear .
"`` I do not think I am trespassing , '' she called back as icily as possible ."
The stranger did not seem to be snubbed at all .
He came down to the very edge of the rocks where Katherine could see him plainly .
He was dressed in a somewhat well-worn grey suit and wore spectacles .
"He did not look like a lunatic , and he did not seem to be drunk ."
"`` I implore you to come in , '' he said earnestly ."
`` You must be standing on the very brink of the bottomless pit . ''
"He is certainly off his balance , thought Katherine ."
He must be some revivalist who has gone insane on one point .
I suppose I 'd better go in .
He looks quite capable of wading out here after me if I do n't .
`` What is the matter ? ''
"asked Gilbert , who had arrived at the open kitchen door just in time to hear the sigh ."
"Anne colored , and thrust her writing out of sight under some school compositions ."
`` Nothing very dreadful .
"I was just trying to write out some of my thoughts , as Professor Hamilton advised me , but I could n't get them to please me ."
They seem so still and foolish directly they 're written down on white paper with black ink .
"Fancies are like shadows ... you ca n't cage them , they 're such wayward , dancing things ."
But perhaps I 'll learn the secret some day if I keep on trying .
"I have n't a great many spare moments , you know ."
"By the time I finish correcting school exercises and compositions , I do n't always feel like writing any of my own . ''"
"`` You are getting on splendidly in school , Anne ."
"All the children like you , '' said Gilbert , sitting down on the stone step ."
"`` No , not all ."
Anthony Pye does n't and WO N'T like me .
"What is worse , he does n't respect me ... no , he does n't ."
He simply holds me in contempt and I do n't mind confessing to you that it worries me miserably .
"It is n't that he is so very bad ... he is only rather mischievous , but no worse than some of the others ."
He seldom disobeys me ; but he obeys with a scornful air of toleration as if it was n't worthwhile disputing the point or he would ... and it has a bad effect on the others .
I 've tried every way to win him but I 'm beginning to fear I never shall .
"I want to , for he 's rather a cute little lad , if he IS a Pye , and I could like him if he 'd let me . ''"
`` Probably it 's merely the effect of what he hears at home . ''
`` Not altogether .
Anthony is an independent little chap and makes up his own mind about things .
He has always gone to men before and he says girl teachers are no good .
"Well , we 'll see what patience and kindness will do ."
I like overcoming difficulties and teaching is really very interesting work .
Paul Irving makes up for all that is lacking in the others .
"That child is a perfect darling , Gilbert , and a genius into the bargain ."
"I 'm persuaded the world will hear of him some day , '' concluded Anne in a tone of conviction ."
"`` I like teaching , too , '' said Gilbert ."
"`` It 's good training , for one thing ."
"Why , Anne , I 've learned more in the weeks I 've been teaching the young ideas of White Sands than I learned in all the years I went to school myself ."
"A whistle sounded thrice , and then again twice ."
It was repeated from another quarter .
"The woods on either side became full of the sound of people bursting through the underwood ; and a bewildered deer ran out into the open , stood for a second on three feet , with nose in air , and then plunged again into the thicket ."
"Selden still ran , bounding ; ever and again an arrow followed him , but still would miss ."
It began to appear as if he might escape .
"Dick had his bow armed , ready to support him ; even Matcham , forgetful of his interest , took sides at heart for the poor fugitive ; and both lads glowed and trembled in the ardour of their hearts ."
"He was within fifty yards of them , when an arrow struck him and he fell ."
"He was up again , indeed , upon the instant ; but now he ran staggering , and , like a blind man , turned aside from his direction ."
Dick leaped to his feet and waved to him .
`` Here ! ''
he cried .
`` This way !
here is help !
"Nay , run , fellow -- run ! ''"
"But just then a second arrow struck Selden in the shoulder , between the plates of his brigandine , and , piercing through his jack , brought him , like a stone , to earth ."
"`` O , the poor heart ! ''"
"cried Matcham , with clasped hands ."
"And Dick stood petrified upon the hill , a mark for archery ."
"Ten to one he had speedily been shot -- for the foresters were furious with themselves , and taken unawares by Dick 's appearance in the rear of their position -- but instantly , out of a quarter of the wood surprisingly near to the two lads , a stentorian voice arose , the voice of Ellis Duckworth ."
`` Hold ! ''
it roared .
`` Shoot not !
Take him alive !
It is young Shelton -- Harry 's son . ''
"And immediately after a shrill whistle sounded several times , and was again taken up and repeated farther off ."
"The whistle , it appeared , was John Amend-All 's battle trumpet , by which he published his directions ."
"`` Ah , foul fortune ! ''"
cried Dick .
`` We are undone .
"Swiftly , Jack , come swiftly ! ''"
And the pair turned and ran back through the open pine clump that covered the summit of the hill .
"CHAPTER VI -- TO THE DAY 'S END It was , indeed , high time for them to run ."
"I had heard the word , and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers , in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island ."
"`` Marooned three years agone , '' he continued , `` and lived on goats since then , and berries , and oysters ."
"Wherever a man is , says I , a man can do for himself ."
"But , mate , my heart is sore for Christian diet ."
"You might n't happen to have a piece of cheese about you , now ?"
No ?
"Well , many 's the long night I 've dreamed of cheese -- toasted , mostly -- and woke up again , and here I were . ''"
"`` If ever I can get aboard again , '' said I , `` you shall have cheese by the stone . ''"
"All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket , smoothing my hands , looking at my boots , and generally , in the intervals of his speech , showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature ."
But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness .
"`` If ever you can get aboard again , says you ? ''"
he repeated .
"`` Why , now , who 's to hinder you ? ''"
"`` Not you , I know , '' was my reply ."
"`` And right you was , '' he cried ."
"`` Now you -- what do you call yourself , mate ? ''"
"`` Jim , '' I told him ."
"`` Jim , Jim , '' says he , quite pleased apparently ."
"`` Well , now , Jim , I 've lived that rough as you 'd be ashamed to hear of ."
"Now , for instance , you would n't think I had had a pious mother -- to look at me ? ''"
he asked .
"`` Why , no , not in particular , '' I answered ."
"`` Ah , well , '' said he , `` but I had -- remarkable pious ."
"And I was a civil , pious boy , and could rattle off my catechism that fast , as you could n't tell one word from another ."
"And here 's what it come to , Jim , and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones !"
"That 's what it begun with , but it went further 'n that ; and so my mother told me , and predicked the whole , she did , the pious woman !"
But it were Providence that put me here .
"I 've thought it all out in this here lonely island , and I 'm back on piety ."
"You do n't catch me tasting rum so much , but just a thimbleful for luck , of course , the first chance I have ."
"I 'm bound I 'll be good , and I see the way to ."
"And , Jim '' -- looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper -- `` I 'm rich . ''"
"I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude , and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face , for he repeated the statement hotly : `` Rich !"
"` Please , sir , ' Peter explained , ' a lady lies very ill . '"
"She was lying at their feet , but Slightly had the sense not to see her ."
"` Tut , tut , tut , ' he said , ` where does she lie ? '"
` In yonder glade . ' '
"I will put a glass thing in her mouth , ' said Slightly ; and he made-believe to do it , while Peter waited ."
It was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn .
` How is she ? '
inquired Peter .
"` Tut , tut , tut , ' said Slightly , ` this has cured her . ' '"
"I am glad , ' Peter cried . '"
"I will call again in the evening , ' Slightly said ; ` give her beef tea out of a cup with a spout to it ' ; but after he had returned the hat to John he blew big breaths , which was his habit on escaping from a difficulty ."
In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes ; almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy 's feet .
"` If only we knew , ' said one , ` the kind of house she likes best . '"
"` Peter , ' shouted another , ` she is moving in her sleep . '"
"` Her mouth opens , ' cried a third , looking respectfully into it ."
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep , ' said Peter ."
"` Wendy , sing the kind of house you would like to have . '"
"Immediately , without opening her eyes , Wendy began to sing : ' I wish I had a pretty house , The littlest ever seen , With funny little red walls And roof of mossy green . '"
"They gurgled with joy at this , for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap , and all the ground was carpeted with moss ."
"As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves : ` We 've built the little walls and roof And made a lovely door , So tell us , mother Wendy , What are you wanting more ? '"
"To this she answered rather greedily : ` Oh , really next I think I 'll have Gay windows all about , With roses peeping in , you know , And babies peeping out . '"
"With a blow of their fists they made windows , and large yellow leaves were the blinds ."
But roses -- ?
"` Roses , ' cried Peter sternly ."
Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls .
Babies ?
"To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again : ` We 've made the roses peeping out , The babes are at the door , We can not make ourselves , you know , ` Cos we 've been made before . '"
"Peter , seeing this to be a good idea , at once pretended that it was his own ."
"The house was quite beautiful , and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within , though , of course , they could no longer see her ."
"Peter strode up and down , ordering finishing touches ."
Nothing escaped his eagle eye .
And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner .
"`` Then , '' he continued , `` then you 'll up , and you 'll say this : Gunn is a good man -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- , and he puts a precious sight more confidence -- a precious sight , mind that -- in a gen ` leman born than in these gen ` leman of fortune , having been one hisself . ''"
"`` Well , '' I said , `` I do n't understand one word that you 've been saying ."
But that 's neither here nor there ; for how am I to get on board ? ''
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` that 's the hitch , for sure ."
"Well , there 's my boat , that I made with my two hands ."
I keep her under the white rock .
"If the worst come to the worst , we might try that after dark ."
Hi ! ''
he broke out .
`` What 's that ? ''
"For just then , although the sun had still an hour or two to run , all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon ."
`` They have begun to fight ! ''
I cried .
`` Follow me . ''
"And I began to run towards the anchorage , my terrors all forgotten , while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly ."
"`` Left , left , '' says he ; `` keep to your left hand , mate Jim !"
Under the trees with you !
Theer 's where I killed my first goat .
They do n't come down here now ; they 're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of Benjamin Gunn .
Ah !
"And there 's the cetemery '' -- cemetery , he must have meant ."
`` You see the mounds ?
"I come here and prayed , nows and thens , when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo ."
"It were n't quite a chapel , but it seemed more solemn like ; and then , says you , Ben Gunn was short-handed -- no chapling , nor so much as a Bible and a flag , you says . ''"
"So he kept talking as I ran , neither expecting nor receiving any answer ."
The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms .
"Another pause , and then , not a quarter of a mile in front of me , I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood ."
PART FOUR -- The Stockade 16 Narrative Continued by the Doctor : How the Ship Was Abandoned IT was about half past one -- three bells in the sea phrase -- that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA .
"The captain , the squire , and I were talking matters over in the cabin ."
"Had there been a breath of wind , we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us , slipped our cable , and away to sea ."
"But the wind was wanting ; and to complete our helplessness , down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest ."
"If you 'd sassed her back , I 'd have thought she deserved it and would n't have blamed you a mite , but I would n't have bothered coming to talk to you either ."
"Well , well well !"
"Poor child , do n't cry ."
You just pick up and go home .
I 'll make it all right with Tom .
"You 're pretty near played out yourself , I can see that ."
"But a summer in Fir Cottage , with plenty of cream and eggs and my cookery , will soon make another girl of you ."
Do n't you dare to thank me .
It 's a privilege to be able to do something for Mary Carvell 's girls .
I just loved Mary . ''
"The upshot of the whole matter was that Marcella and Patty went , two days later , to Dalesboro , where Miss Draper gave them a hearty welcome to Fir Cottage -- a quaint , delightful little house circled by big Scotch firs and overgrown with vines ."
Never were such delightful weeks as those that followed .
Patty came rapidly back to health and strength .
"As for Marcella , Miss Draper 's prophecy was also fulfilled ; she soon looked and felt like another girl ."
"The dismal years of drudgery behind her were forgotten like a dream , and she lived wholly in the beautiful present , in the walks and drives , the flowers and grass slopes , and in the pleasant household duties which she shared with Miss Draper ."
"`` I love housework , '' she exclaimed one September day ."
`` I do n't like the thought of going back to the store a bit . ''
"`` Well , you 're not going back , '' calmly said Miss Draper , who had a habit of arranging other people 's business for them that might have been disconcerting had it not been for her keen insight and hearty good sense ."
`` You 're going to stay here with me -- you and Patty .
"I do n't propose to die of lonesomeness losing you , and I need somebody to help me about the house ."
I 've thought it all out .
"You are to call me Aunt Josephine , and Patty is to go to school ."
"I had this scheme in mind from the first , but I thought I 'd wait to see how we got along living in the same house , and how you liked it here , before I spoke out ."
"No , you need n't thank me this time either ."
I 'm doing this every bit as much for my sake as yours .
"Well , that 's all settled ."
"Patty wo n't object , bless her rosy cheeks ! ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"said Marcella , with eyes shining through her tears ."
"`` I 'm so happy , dear Miss Draper -- I mean Aunt Josephine ."
I 'll love to stay here -- and I will thank you . ''
`` Fudge ! ''
"`` Good shrew , let laugh , I pray you ."
"An ye could see yourself , I warrant ye would laugh the first . ''"
"`` Well , '' cried the lad , flushing , `` ye shall answer this when ye answer for the other ."
Laugh while yet ye may ! ''
"`` Nay , now , good cousin , '' replied Sir Daniel , with some earnestness , `` think not that I mock at you , except in mirth , as between kinsfolk and singular friends ."
"I will make you a marriage of a thousand pounds , go to !"
and cherish you exceedingly .
"I took you , indeed , roughly , as the time demanded ; but from henceforth I shall ungrudgingly maintain and cheerfully serve you ."
"Ye shall be Mrs. Shelton -- Lady Shelton , by my troth !"
for the lad promiseth bravely .
Tut !
ye will not shy for honest laughter ; it purgeth melancholy .
"They are no rogues who laugh , good cousin ."
"Good mine host , lay me a meal now for my cousin , Master John ."
"Sit ye down , sweetheart , and eat . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Master John , `` I will break no bread ."
"Since ye force me to this sin , I will fast for my soul 's interest ."
"But , good mine host , I pray you of courtesy give me a cup of fair water ; I shall be much beholden to your courtesy indeed . ''"
"`` Ye shall have a dispensation , go to ! ''"
cried the knight .
"`` Shalt be well shriven , by my faith !"
"Content you , then , and eat . ''"
"But the lad was obstinate , drank a cup of water , and , once more wrapping himself closely in his mantle , sat in a far corner , brooding ."
"In an hour or two , there rose a stir in the village of sentries challenging and the clatter of arms and horses ; and then a troop drew up by the inn door , and Richard Shelton , splashed with mud , presented himself upon the threshold ."
"`` Save you , Sir Daniel , '' he said ."
`` How !
Dickie Shelton ! ''
cried the knight ; and at the mention of Dick 's name the other lad looked curiously across .
`` What maketh Bennet Hatch ? ''
"`` Please you , sir knight , to take cognisance of this packet from Sir Oliver , wherein are all things fully stated , '' answered Richard , presenting the priest 's letter ."
"`` And please you farther , ye were best make all speed to Risingham ; for on the way hither we encountered one riding furiously with letters , and by his report , my Lord of Risingham was sore bested , and lacked exceedingly your presence . ''"
`` How say you ?
It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation .
"Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor , which certainly were not there when the children went to bed , and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile : ' I do believe it is that Peter again ! '"
"` Whatever do you mean , Wendy ? '"
"` It is so naughty of him not to wipe , ' Wendy said , sighing ."
She was a tidy child .
She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her .
"Unfortunately she never woke , so she did n't know how she knew , she just knew ."
"` What nonsense you talk , precious ."
No one can get into the house without knocking . ' '
"I think he comes in by the window , ' she said ."
"` My love , it is three floors up . '"
"` Were not the leaves at the foot of the window , mother ? '"
It was quite true ; the leaves had been found very near the window .
"Mrs. Darling did not know what to think , for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming ."
"` My child , ' the mother cried , ` why did you not tell me of this before ? ' '"
"I forgot , ' said Wendy lightly ."
She was in a hurry to get her breakfast .
"Oh , surely she must have been dreaming ."
"But , on the other hand , there were the leaves ."
"Mrs. Darling examined them carefully ; they were skeleton leaves , but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England ."
"She crawled about the floor , peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot ."
She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls .
"She let down a tape from the window to the pavement , and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet , without so much as a spout to climb up by ."
Certainly Wendy had been dreaming .
"But Wendy had not been dreaming , as the very next night showed , the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun ."
On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed .
"It happened to be Nana 's evening off , and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep ."
All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew .
"It was something for Michael , who on his birthday was getting into shirts ."
"The fire was warm , however , and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights , and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling 's lap ."
"Then her head nodded , oh , so gracefully ."
She was asleep .
"Well , the youngest Twin Sailor sailed along the moonglade till he came right up to the moon , and there was a little golden door in the moon and he opened it and sailed right through ."
He had some wonderful adventures in the moon but it would make this letter too long to tell them . ' ''
` Then there is the Golden Lady of the cave .
One day I found a big cave down on the shore and I went away in and after a while I found the Golden Lady .
She has golden hair right down to her feet and her dress is all glittering and glistening like gold that is alive .
And she has a golden harp and plays on it all day long ... you can hear the music any time along shore if you listen carefully but most people would think it was only the wind among the rocks .
I 've never told Nora about the Golden Lady .
I was afraid it might hurt her feelings .
It even hurt her feelings if I talked too long with the Twin Sailors . ' '' '
I always met the Twin Sailors at the Striped Rocks .
The youngest Twin Sailor is very good-tempered but the oldest Twin Sailor can look dreadfully fierce at times .
I have my suspicions about that oldest Twin .
I believe he 'd be a pirate if he dared .
There 's really something very mysterious about him .
He swore once and I told him if he ever did it again he need n't come ashore to talk to me because I 'd promised grandmother I 'd never associate with anybody that swore .
"He was pretty well scared , I can tell you , and he said if I would forgive him he would take me to the sunset ."
So the next evening when I was sitting on the Striped Rocks the oldest Twin came sailing over the sea in an enchanted boat and I got in her .
"The boat was all pearly and rainbowy , like the inside of the mussel shells , and her sail was like moonshine ."
"Well , we sailed right across to the sunset ."
"Think of that , teacher , I 've been in the sunset ."
And what do you suppose it is ?
The sunset is a land all flowers .
"We sailed into a great garden , and the clouds are beds of flowers ."
"We sailed into a great harbor , all the color of gold , and I stepped right out of the boat on a big meadow all covered with buttercups as big as roses ."
I stayed there for ever so long .
It seemed nearly a year but the Oldest Twin says it was only a few minutes .
"You see , in the sunset land the time is ever so much longer than it is here . ' ''"
` Your loving pupil Paul Irving . ' ''
"` P. S. of course , this letter is n't really true , teacher ."
"P.I. ' '' XII A Jonah Day It really began the night before with a restless , wakeful vigil of grumbling toothache ."
"When Anne arose in the dull , bitter winter morning she felt that life was flat , stale , and unprofitable ."
She went to school in no angelic mood .
I 'll tell you what I think of this : I think it handsome .
"And if you think as I do , you 'll give a good sea-cheer for the gentleman that does it . ''"
The cheer followed -- that was a matter of course ; but it rang out so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood .
"`` One more cheer for Cap'n Smollett , '' cried Long John when the first had subsided ."
And this also was given with a will .
"On the top of that the three gentlemen went below , and not long after , word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin ."
"I found them all three seated round the table , a bottle of Spanish wine and some raisins before them , and the doctor smoking away , with his wig on his lap , and that , I knew , was a sign that he was agitated ."
"The stern window was open , for it was a warm night , and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship 's wake ."
"`` Now , Hawkins , '' said the squire , `` you have something to say ."
Speak up . ''
"I did as I was bid , and as short as I could make it , told the whole details of Silver 's conversation ."
"Nobody interrupted me till I was done , nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement , but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last ."
"`` Jim , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` take a seat . ''"
"And they made me sit down at table beside them , poured me out a glass of wine , filled my hands with raisins , and all three , one after the other , and each with a bow , drank my good health , and their service to me , for my luck and courage ."
"`` Now , captain , '' said the squire , `` you were right , and I was wrong ."
"I own myself an ass , and I await your orders . ''"
"`` No more an ass than I , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` I never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before , for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according ."
"But this crew , '' he added , `` beats me . ''"
"`` Captain , '' said the doctor , `` with your permission , that 's Silver ."
A very remarkable man . ''
"`` He 'd look remarkably well from a yard-arm , sir , '' returned the captain ."
`` But this is talk ; this do n't lead to anything .
"I see three or four points , and with Mr. Trelawney 's permission , I 'll name them . ''"
"`` You , sir , are the captain ."
"It is for you to speak , '' says Mr. Trelawney grandly ."
"`` First point , '' began Mr. Smollett ."
"`` We must go on , because we ca n't turn back ."
"If I gave the word to go about , they would rise at once ."
"Second point , we have time before us -- at least until this treasure 's found ."
"Third point , there are faithful hands ."
"Now , sir , it 's got to come to blows sooner or later , and what I propose is to take time by the forelock , as the saying is , and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it ."
Look to it : he that is last at the lych-gate Sir Daniel shall reward .
Look to it right well !
I know you for a man of naught .
"Nance , '' he added , to one of the women , `` is old Appleyard up town ? ''"
"`` I 'll warrant you , '' replied the woman ."
"`` In his field , for sure . ''"
"So the group dispersed , and while Clipsby walked leisurely over the bridge , Bennet and young Shelton rode up the road together , through the village and past the church ."
"`` Ye will see the old shrew , '' said Bennet ."
`` He will waste more time grumbling and prating of Harry the Fift than would serve a man to shoe a horse .
And all because he has been to the French wars ! ''
"The house to which they were bound was the last in the village , standing alone among lilacs ; and beyond it , on three sides , there was open meadow rising towards the borders of the wood ."
"Hatch dismounted , threw his rein over the fence , and walked down the field , Dick keeping close at his elbow , to where the old soldier was digging , knee-deep in his cabbages , and now and again , in a cracked voice , singing a snatch of song ."
"He was all dressed in leather , only his hood and tippet were of black frieze , and tied with scarlet ; his face was like a walnut-shell , both for colour and wrinkles ; but his old grey eye was still clear enough , and his sight unabated ."
"Perhaps he was deaf ; perhaps he thought it unworthy of an old archer of Agincourt to pay any heed to such disturbances ; but neither the surly notes of the alarm bell , nor the near approach of Bennet and the lad , appeared at all to move him ; and he continued obstinately digging , and piped up , very thin and shaky : `` Now , dear lady , if thy will be , I pray you that you will rue on me . ''"
"`` Nick Appleyard , '' said Hatch , `` Sir Oliver commends him to you , and bids that ye shall come within this hour to the Moat House , there to take command . ''"
The old fellow looked up .
"`` Save you , my masters ! ''"
"he said , grinning ."
`` And where goeth Master Hatch ? ''
"`` Master Hatch is off to Kettley , with every man that we can horse , '' returned Bennet ."
"`` There is a fight toward , it seems , and my lord stays a reinforcement . ''"
"`` Ay , verily , '' returned Appleyard ."
`` And what will ye leave me to garrison withal ? ''
"`` I leave you six good men , and Sir Oliver to boot , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` It 'll not hold the place , '' said Appleyard ; `` the number sufficeth not ."
It would take two score to make it good . ''
"`` Why , it 's for that we came to you , old shrew ! ''"
replied the other .
`` Who else is there but you that could do aught in such a house with such a garrison ? ''
`` Ay !
"when the pinch comes , ye remember the old shoe , '' returned Nick ."
`` There is not a man of you can back a horse or hold a bill ; and as for archery -- St. Michael !
`` My name is Maxwell Seeley .
"My father died when I was seven years old , and my mother a year later ."
"My little sister , Bertha , then three years old , and I were left quite alone and very poor ."
We had no relatives .
"I was adopted by a well-to-do old bachelor , who had known my father ."
My sister was taken to an orphan asylum in a city some distance away .
I was very much attached to her and grieved bitterly over our parting .
My adopted father was very kind to me and gave me a good education .
"I did not forget my sister , and as soon as I could I went to the asylum ."
"I found that she had been taken away long before , and I could not even discover who had adopted her , for the original building , with all its records , had been destroyed by fire two years previous to my visit ."
"I never could find any clue to her whereabouts , and long since gave up all hope of finding her ."
But I have found her at last .
"You are Bertha Seeley , my little sister ! ''"
`` Oh -- can it be possible ! ''
`` More than possible -- it is certain .
"You are the image of my mother , as I remember her , and as an old daguerreotype I have pictures her ."
"And this is her watch -- see , I scratched my own initials on the case one day ."
There is no doubt in the world .
"Oh , Bertha , are you half as glad as I am ? ''"
`` Glad ! ''
Bertha 's eyes were shining like stars .
"She tried to smile , but burst into tears instead and her head went down on her brother 's shoulder ."
"By this time everybody in the room was staring at the extraordinary tableau , and Ernest , coming through the hall , gave a whistle of astonishment that brought the two in the corner back to a sense of their surroundings ."
"`` I have n't suddenly gone crazy , Ernest , old fellow , '' smiled Max ."
"`` Ladies and gentlemen all , this little school-ma ` am was introduced to you as Miss Price , but that was a mistake ."
"Let me introduce her again as Miss Bertha Seeley , my long-lost and newly-found sister . ''"
"Well they had an amazing time then , of course ."
They laughed and questioned and explained until the dinner was in imminent danger of getting stone-cold on the dining-room table .
"Luckily , Alma and Frances remembered it just in the nick of time , and they all got out , somehow , and into their places ."
"It was a splendid dinner , but I believe that Maxwell and Bertha Seeley did n't know what they were eating , any more than if it had been sawdust ."
"However , the rest of the guests made up for that , and did full justice to the girls ' cookery ."
"In the afternoon they all went to church , and at least two hearts were truly and devoutly thankful that day ."
"`` Captain , '' said the squire , `` the house is quite invisible from the ship ."
It must be the flag they are aiming at .
Would it not be wiser to take it in ? ''
`` Strike my colours ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` No , sir , not I '' ; and as soon as he had said the words , I think we all agreed with him ."
"For it was not only a piece of stout , seamanly , good feeling ; it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade ."
All through the evening they kept thundering away .
"Ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure , but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand ."
"We had no ricochet to fear , and though one popped in through the roof of the log-house and out again through the floor , we soon got used to that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket ."
"`` There is one good thing about all this , '' observed the captain ; `` the wood in front of us is likely clear ."
The ebb has made a good while ; our stores should be uncovered .
Volunteers to go and bring in pork . ''
Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward .
"Well armed , they stole out of the stockade , but it proved a useless mission ."
The mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel 's gunnery .
"For four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by , pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current ."
Silver was in the stern-sheets in command ; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own .
"The captain sat down to his log , and here is the beginning of the entry : Alexander Smollett , master ; David Livesey , ship 's doctor ; Abraham Gray , carpenter 's mate ; John Trelawney , owner ; John Hunter and Richard Joyce , owner 's servants , landsmen -- being all that is left faithful of the ship 's company -- with stores for ten days at short rations , came ashore this day and flew British colours on the log-house in Treasure Island ."
"Thomas Redruth , owner 's servant , landsman , shot by the mutineers ; James Hawkins , cabin-boy -- And at the same time , I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins ' fate ."
A hail on the land side .
"`` Somebody hailing us , '' said Hunter , who was on guard ."
`` Doctor !
Squire !
Captain !
"Hullo , Hunter , is that you ? ''"
came the cries .
"And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins , safe and sound , come climbing over the stockade ."
"19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins : The Garrison in the Stockade AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt , stopped me by the arm , and sat down ."
"`` Now , '' said he , `` there 's your friends , sure enough . ''"
"`` Far more likely it 's the mutineers , '' I answered ."
`` That ! ''
"I 'm glad ... I really feel the need of some diversion , for what with Anthony Pye in school and Davy Keith at home my nerves have had about all they can endure for one day . ''"
"IX A Question of Color `` That old nuisance of a Rachel Lynde was here again today , pestering me for a subscription towards buying a carpet for the vestry room , '' said Mr. Harrison wrathfully ."
`` I detest that woman more than anybody I know .
"She can put a whole sermon , text , comment , and application , into six words , and throw it at you like a brick . ''"
"Anne , who was perched on the edge of the veranda , enjoying the charm of a mild west wind blowing across a newly ploughed field on a gray November twilight and piping a quaint little melody among the twisted firs below the garden , turned her dreamy face over her shoulder ."
"`` The trouble is , you and Mrs. Lynde do n't understand one another , '' she explained ."
`` That is always what is wrong when people do n't like each other .
I did n't like Mrs. Lynde at first either ; but as soon as I came to understand her I learned to . ''
"`` Mrs. Lynde may be an acquired taste with some folks ; but I did n't keep on eating bananas because I was told I 'd learn to like them if I did , '' growled Mr. Harrison ."
"`` And as for understanding her , I understand that she is a confirmed busybody and I told her so . ''"
"`` Oh , that must have hurt her feelings very much , '' said Anne reproachfully ."
`` How could you say such a thing ?
I said some dreadful things to Mrs. Lynde long ago but it was when I had lost my temper .
I could n't say them DELIBERATELY . ''
`` It was the truth and I believe in telling the truth to everybody . ''
"`` But you do n't tell the whole truth , '' objected Anne ."
`` You only tell the disagreeable part of the truth .
"Now , you 've told me a dozen times that my hair was red , but you 've never once told me that I had a nice nose . ''"
"`` I daresay you know it without any telling , '' chuckled Mr. Harrison ."
`` I know I have red hair too ... although it 's MUCH darker than it used to be ... so there 's no need of telling me that either . ''
"`` Well , well , I 'll try and not mention it again since you 're so sensitive ."
"You must excuse me , Anne ."
I 've got a habit of being outspoken and folks must n't mind it . ''
`` But they ca n't help minding it .
And I do n't think it 's any help that it 's your habit .
"What would you think of a person who went about sticking pins and needles into people and saying , ` Excuse me , you must n't mind it ... it 's just a habit I 've got . '"
"You 'd think he was crazy , would n't you ?"
"And as for Mrs. Lynde being a busybody , perhaps she is ."
"But did you tell her she had a very kind heart and always helped the poor , and never said a word when Timothy Cotton stole a crock of butter out of her dairy and told his wife he 'd bought it from her ?"
Mrs. Cotton cast it up to her the next time they met that it tasted of turnips and Mrs. Lynde just said she was sorry it had turned out so poorly . ''
"`` I suppose she has some good qualities , '' conceded Mr. Harrison grudgingly ."
`` Most folks have .
That is not the way God works .
"But work He does , Miss Oliver , and in the end His purpose will be fulfilled . ''"
"`` Sound and orthodox -- sound and orthodox , '' muttered Susan approvingly in the kitchen ."
Susan liked to see Miss Oliver sat upon by the minister now and then .
"Susan was very fond of her but she thought Miss Oliver liked saying heretical things to ministers far too well , and deserved an occasional reminder that these matters were quite beyond her province ."
In May Walter wrote home that he had been awarded a D.C. Medal .
"He did not say what for , but the other boys took care that the Glen should know the brave thing Walter had done ."
"`` In any war but this , '' wrote Jerry Meredith , `` it would have meant a V.C. ."
But they ca n't make V.C. 's as common as the brave things done every day here . ''
"`` He should have had the V.C. , '' said Susan , and was very indignant over it ."
"She was not quite sure who was to blame for his not getting it , but if it were General Haig she began for the first time to entertain serious doubts as to his fitness for being Commander-in-Chief ."
Rilla was beside herself with delight .
"It was her dear Walter who had done this thing -- Walter , to whom someone had sent a white feather at Redmond -- it was Walter who had dashed back from the safety of the trench to drag in a wounded comrade who had fallen on No-man 's - land ."
"Oh , she could see his white beautiful face and wonderful eyes as he did it !"
What a thing to be the sister of such a hero !
And he had n't thought it worth while writing about .
His letter was full of other things -- little intimate things that they two had known and loved together in the dear old cloudless days of a century ago .
"`` I 've been thinking of the daffodils in the garden at Ingleside , '' he wrote ."
"`` By the time you get this they will be out , blowing there under that lovely rosy sky ."
"Are they really as bright and golden as ever , Rilla ?"
It seems to me that they must be dyed red with blood -- like our poppies here .
And every whisper of spring will be falling as a violet in Rainbow Valley .
"`` There is a young moon tonight -- a slender , silver , lovely thing hanging over these pits of torment ."
Will you see it tonight over the maple grove ?
"`` I 'm enclosing a little scrap of verse , Rilla ."
I wrote it one evening in my trench dug-out by the light of a bit of candle -- or rather it came to me there -- I did n't feel as if I were writing it -- something seemed to use me as an instrument .
"I 've had that feeling once or twice before , but very rarely and never so strongly as this time ."
That was why I sent it over to the London Spectator .
It printed it and the copy came today .
I hope you 'll like it .
It 's the only poem I 've written since I came overseas . ''
"The poem was a short , poignant little thing ."
Dick bounded to his side and raised him .
His face desperately worked ; his whole body was shaken by contorting spasms .
`` Is the arrow black ? ''
he gasped .
"`` It is black , '' replied Dick , gravely ."
"And then , before he could add one word , a desperate seizure of pain shook the wounded man from head to foot , so that his body leaped in Dick 's supporting arms , and with the extremity of that pang his spirit fled in silence ."
"The young man laid him back gently on the snow and prayed for that unprepared and guilty spirit , and as he prayed the sun came up at a bound , and the robins began chirping in the ivy ."
"When he rose to his feet , he found another man upon his knees but a few steps behind him , and , still with uncovered head , he waited until that prayer also should be over ."
"It took long ; the man , with his head bowed and his face covered with his hands , prayed like one in a great disorder or distress of mind ; and by the bow that lay beside him , Dick judged that he was no other than the archer who had laid Sir Daniel low ."
"At length he , also , rose , and showed the countenance of Ellis Duckworth ."
"`` Richard , '' he said , very gravely , `` I heard you ."
"Ye took the better part and pardoned ; I took the worse , and there lies the clay of mine enemy ."
Pray for me . ''
And he wrung him by the hand .
"`` Sir , '' said Richard , `` I will pray for you , indeed ; though how I may prevail I wot not ."
"But if ye have so long pursued revenge , and find it now of such a sorry flavour , bethink ye , were it not well to pardon others ?"
"Hatch -- he is dead , poor shrew !"
"I would have spared a better ; and for Sir Daniel , here lies his body ."
"But for the priest , if I might anywise prevail , I would have you let him go . ''"
A flash came into the eyes of Ellis Duckworth .
"`` Nay , '' he said , `` the devil is still strong within me ."
But be at rest ; the Black Arrow flieth nevermore -- the fellowship is broken .
"They that still live shall come to their quiet and ripe end , in Heaven 's good time , for me ; and for yourself , go where your better fortune calls you , and think no more of Ellis . ''"
"CHAPTER VIII -- CONCLUSION About nine in the morning , Lord Foxham was leading his ward , once more dressed as befitted her sex , and followed by Alicia Risingham , to the church of Holywood , when Richard Crookback , his brow already heavy with cares , crossed their path and paused ."
`` Is this the maid ? ''
"he asked ; and when Lord Foxham had replied in the affirmative , `` Minion , '' he added , `` hold up your face until I see its favour . ''"
He looked upon her sourly for a little .
"`` Ye are fair , '' he said at last , `` and , as they tell me , dowered ."
"How if I offered you a brave marriage , as became your face and parentage ? ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' replied Joanna , `` may it please your grace , I had rather wed with Sir Richard . ''"
`` How so ? ''
"he asked , harshly ."
"`` It may be what it will , '' returned Dick ; `` and it must be as heaven please ."
"Reck we not a jot , but push on the livelier , and put it to the touch ."
"Up , friends -- enough breathed . ''"
"As they advanced , the snow became more and more trampled with hoof-marks , and it was plain that they were drawing near to the encampment of a considerable force of mounted men ."
"Presently they could see the smoke pouring from among the trees , ruddily coloured on its lower edge and scattering bright sparks ."
"And here , pursuant to Dick 's orders , his men began to open out , creeping stealthily in the covert , to surround on every side the camp of their opponents ."
"He himself , placing Alicia in the shelter of a bulky oak , stole straight forth in the direction of the fire ."
"At last , through an opening of the wood , his eye embraced the scene of the encampment ."
"The fire had been built upon a heathy hummock of the ground , surrounded on three sides by thicket , and it now burned very strong , roaring aloud and brandishing flames ."
"Around it there sat not quite a dozen people , warmly cloaked ; but though the neighbouring snow was trampled down as by a regiment , Dick looked in vain for any horse ."
He began to have a terrible misgiving that he was out-manoeuvred .
"At the same time , in a tall man with a steel salet , who was spreading his hands before the blaze , he recognised his old friend and still kindly enemy , Bennet Hatch ; and in two others , sitting a little back , he made out , even in their male disguise , Joanna Sedley and Sir Daniel 's wife ."
"`` Well , '' thought he to himself , `` even if I lose my horses , let me get my Joanna , and why should I complain ? ''"
"And then , from the further side of the encampment , there came a little whistle , announcing that his men had joined , and the investment was complete ."
"Bennet , at the sound , started to his feet ; but ere he had time to spring upon his arms , Dick hailed him ."
"`` Bennet , '' he said -- `` Bennet , old friend , yield ye ."
"Ye will but spill men 's lives in vain , if ye resist . '' ''"
"'T is Master Shelton , by St. Barbary ! ''"
cried Hatch .
`` Yield me ?
Ye ask much .
What force have ye ? ''
"`` I tell you , Bennet , ye are both outnumbered and begirt , '' said Dick ."
`` Caesar and Charlemagne would cry for quarter .
"I have two score men at my whistle , and with one shoot of arrows I could answer for you all . ''"
"`` Master Dick , '' said Bennet , `` it goes against my heart ; but I must do my duty ."
The saints help you ! ''
And therewith he raised a little tucket to his mouth and wound a rousing call .
"Then followed a moment of confusion ; for while Dick , fearing for the ladies , still hesitated to give the word to shoot , Hatch 's little band sprang to their weapons and formed back to back as for a fierce resistance ."
"In the hurry of their change of place , Joanna sprang from her seat and ran like an arrow to her lover 's side ."
"`` Here , Dick ! ''"
"she cried , as she clasped his hand in hers ."
did he ?
I declare I should n't wonder !
It would be just like the dear old blunder-head . ''
"`` I never thought of it till you told me where Bob was , and then it all sort of burst upon me in one minute ! ''"
"cried Jill , waving her arms about to express the intellectual explosion which had thrown light upon the mystery , like sky-rockets in a dark night ."
`` You are as bright as a button .
"No time to lose ; I 'm off ; '' and off he was , splashing through the mud to post the letter , on the back of which he added , to make the thing sure , `` Hurry up ."
"F.M. '' Both felt rather guilty next day , but enjoyed themselves very much nevertheless , and kept chuckling over the mine they were making under Jack 's unconscious feet ."
"They hardly expected an answer at noon , as the Hill people were not very eager for their mail , but at night Jill was sure of a letter , and to her great delight it came ."
"Jack brought it himself , which added to the fun , and while she eagerly read it he sat calmly poring over the latest number of his own private and particular `` Youth 's Companion . ''"
"Bob was not a `` complete letter-writer '' by any means , and with great labor and much ink had produced the following brief but highly satisfactory epistle ."
"Not knowing how to address his fair correspondent he let it alone , and went at once to the point in the frankest possible way : -- `` Jack did come up Friday ."
Sorry he got into a mess .
"It was real kind of him , and I shall pay him back soon ."
Jack paid Jerry for me and I made him promise not to tell .
Jerry said he 'd come here and make a row if I did n't cash up .
"I was afraid I 'd lose the place if he did , for the Capt. is awful strict ."
"If Jack do n't tell now , I will ."
I ai n't mean .
Glad you wrote .
`` R.O.W. '' `` Hurrah ! ''
"cried Jill , waving the letter over her head in great triumph ."
"`` Call everybody and read it out , '' she added , as Frank snatched it , and ran for his mother , seeing at a glance that the news was good ."
"Jill was so afraid she should tell before the others came that she burst out singing `` Pretty Bobby Shafto '' at the top of her voice , to Jack 's great disgust , for he considered the song very personal , as he was rather fond of `` combing down his yellow hair , '' and Jill often plagued him by singing it when he came in with the golden quirls very smooth and nice to hide the scar on his forehead ."
"In about five minutes the door flew open and in came Mamma , making straight for bewildered Jack , who thought the family had gone crazy when his parent caught him in her arms , saying tenderly , -- `` My good , generous boy !"
I knew he was right all the time ! ''
"while Frank worked his hand up and down like a pump-handle , exclaiming heartily , -- `` You 're a trump , sir , and I 'm proud of you ! ''"
"Jill meantime calling out , in wild delight , -- `` I told you so !"
I told you so !
"I did find out ; ha , ha , I did ! ''"
"`` Come , I say !"
What 's the matter ?
Stephen went off to the States and went into business with his uncle and married a Yankee .
"He 's never been home since , though his mother has been up to see him once or twice ."
His wife died two years ago and he 's sending the boy home to his mother for a spell .
He 's ten years old and I do n't know if he 'll be a very desirable pupil .
You can never tell about those Yankees . ''
Mrs Lynde looked upon all people who had the misfortune to be born or brought up elsewhere than in Prince Edward Island with a decided can-any-good-thing-come-out-of-Nazareth air .
"They MIGHT be good people , of course ; but you were on the safe side in doubting it ."
She had a special prejudice against `` Yankees . ''
Her husband had been cheated out of ten dollars by an employer for whom he had once worked in Boston and neither angels nor principalities nor powers could have convinced Mrs. Rachel that the whole United States was not responsible for it .
"`` Avonlea school wo n't be the worse for a little new blood , '' said Marilla drily , `` and if this boy is anything like his father he 'll be all right ."
"Steve Irving was the nicest boy that was ever raised in these parts , though some people did call him proud ."
I should think Mrs. Irving would be very glad to have the child .
She has been very lonesome since her husband died . ''
"`` Oh , the boy may be well enough , but he 'll be different from Avonlea children , '' said Mrs. Rachel , as if that clinched the matter ."
"Mrs. Rachel 's opinions concerning any person , place , or thing , were always warranted to wear ."
"`` What 's this I hear about your going to start up a Village Improvement Society , Anne ? ''"
"`` I was just talking it over with some of the girls and boys at the last Debating Club , '' said Anne , flushing ."
`` They thought it would be rather nice ... and so do Mr. and Mrs. Allan .
Lots of villages have them now . ''
"`` Well , you 'll get into no end of hot water if you do ."
"Better leave it alone , Anne , that 's what ."
People do n't like being improved . ''
"`` Oh , we are not going to try to improve the PEOPLE ."
It is Avonlea itself .
There are lots of things which might be done to make it prettier .
"For instance , if we could coax Mr. Levi Boulter to pull down that dreadful old house on his upper farm would n't that be an improvement ? ''"
"`` It certainly would , '' admitted Mrs. Rachel ."
`` That old ruin has been an eyesore to the settlement for years .
"But if you Improvers can coax Levi Boulter to do anything for the public that he is n't to be paid for doing , may I be there to see and hear the process , that 's what ."
"I do n't want to discourage you , Anne , for there may be something in your idea , though I suppose you did get it out of some rubbishy Yankee magazine ; but you 'll have your hands full with your school and I advise you as a friend not to bother with your improvements , that 's what ."
"But there , I know you 'll go ahead with it if you 've set your mind on it ."
You were always one to carry a thing through somehow . ''
`` Will you please wipe your feet carefully on the grass and then walk on these papers ? ''
she said anxiously .
`` I 've just swept the house all over and I ca n't have any more dust tracked in .
The path 's been real muddy since the rain yesterday . ''
"`` Do n't you dare laugh , '' warned Anne in a whisper , as they marched along the newspapers ."
"`` And I implore you , Diana , not to look at me , no matter what she says , or I shall not be able to keep a sober face . ''"
"The papers extended across the hall and into a prim , fleckless parlor ."
Anne and Diana sat down gingerly on the nearest chairs and explained their errand .
"Mrs. White heard them politely , interrupting only twice , once to chase out an adventurous fly , and once to pick up a tiny wisp of grass that had fallen on the carpet from Anne 's dress ."
"Anne felt wretchedly guilty ; but Mrs. White subscribed two dollars and paid the money down ... `` to prevent us from having to go back for it , '' Diana said when they got away ."
Mrs. White had the newspapers gathered up before they had their horse untied and as they drove out of the yard they saw her busily wielding a broom in the hall .
"`` I 've always heard that Mrs. Theodore White was the neatest woman alive and I 'll believe it after this , '' said Diana , giving way to her suppressed laughter as soon as it was safe ."
"`` I am glad she has no children , '' said Anne solemnly ."
`` It would be dreadful beyond words for them if she had . ''
At the Spencers ' Mrs. Isabella Spencer made them miserable by saying something ill-natured about everyone in Avonlea .
"Mr. Thomas Boulter refused to give anything because the hall , when it had been built , twenty years before , had n't been built on the site he recommended ."
"Mrs. Esther Bell , who was the picture of health , took half an hour to detail all her aches and pains , and sadly put down fifty cents because she would n't be there that time next year to do it ... no , she would be in her grave ."
"Their worst reception , however , was at Simon Fletcher 's ."
When they drove into the yard they saw two faces peering at them through the porch window .
But although they rapped and waited patiently and persistently nobody came to the door .
Two decidedly ruffled and indignant girls drove away from Simon Fletcher 's .
Even Anne admitted that she was beginning to feel discouraged .
But the tide turned after that .
"Several Sloane homesteads came next , where they got liberal subscriptions , and from that to the end they fared well , with only an occasional snub ."
Their last place of call was at Robert Dickson 's by the pond bridge .
"They stayed to tea here , although they were nearly home , rather than risk offending Mrs. Dickson , who had the reputation of being a very `` touchy '' woman ."
While they were there old Mrs. James White called in .
"`` I 've just been down to Lorenzo 's , '' she announced ."
`` He 's the proudest man in Avonlea this minute .
What do you think ?
"There 's a brand new boy there ... and after seven girls that 's quite an event , I can tell you . ''"
"Anne pricked up her ears , and when they drove away she said ."
But you look more like your great grandfather West than the MacAllisters .
He died of a paralytic stroke quite early in life . ''
`` Did you see anybody at the store ? ''
"asked Rilla desperately , in the faint hope of directing Susan 's conversation into more agreeable channels ."
"`` Nobody except Mary Vance , '' said Susan , `` and she was stepping round as brisk as the Irishman 's flea . ''"
What terrible similes Susan used !
Would Kenneth think she acquired them from the family !
"`` To hear Mary talk about Miller Douglas you would think he was the only Glen boy who had enlisted , '' Susan went on ."
"`` But of course she always did brag and she has some good qualities I am willing to admit , though I did not think so that time she chased Rilla here through the village with a dried codfish till the poor child fell , heels over head , into the puddle before Carter Flagg 's store . ''"
Rilla went cold all over with wrath and shame .
Were there any more disgraceful scenes in her past that Susan could rake up ?
"As for Ken , he could have howled over Susan 's speeches , but he would not so insult the duenna of his lady , so he sat with a preternaturally solemn face which seemed to poor Rilla a haughty and offended one ."
"`` I paid eleven cents for a bottle of ink tonight , '' complained Susan ."
`` Ink is twice as high as it was last year .
Perhaps it is because Woodrow Wilson has been writing so many notes .
It must cost him considerable .
My cousin Sophia says Woodrow Wilson is not the man she expected him to be -- but then no man ever was .
"Being an old maid , I do not know much about men and have never pretended to , but my cousin Sophia is very hard on them , although she married two of them , which you might think was a fair share ."
"Albert Crawford 's chimney blew down in that big gale we had last week , and when Sophia heard the bricks clattering on the roof she thought it was a Zeppelin raid and went into hysterics ."
And Mrs. Albert Crawford says that of the two things she would have preferred the Zeppelin raid . ''
Rilla sat limply in her chair like one hypnotized .
She knew Susan would stop talking when she was ready to stop and that no earthly power could make her stop any sooner .
"As a rule , she was very fond of Susan but just now she hated her with a deadly hatred ."
It was ten o'clock .
Ken would soon have to go -- the others would soon be home -- and she had not even had a chance to explain to Ken that Fred Arnold filled no blank in her life nor ever could .
Her rainbow castle lay in ruins round her .
Kenneth got up at last .
"He realized that Susan was there to stay as long as he did , and it was a three mile walk to Martin West 's over-harbour ."
"He wondered if Rilla had put Susan up to this , not wanting to be left alone with him , lest he say something Fred Arnold 's sweetheart did not want to hear ."
"Rilla got up , too , and walked silently the length of the veranda with him ."
"They stood there for a moment , Ken on the lower step ."
The step was half sunk into the earth and mint grew thickly about and over its edge .
"`` Then I shall send him right home , '' said Daisy , with decision ."
"`` People do n't do so at parties , it is n't proper . ''"
`` I shall never ask him any more . ''
`` That would do .
"He 'd be sorry not to come to the dinner-ball , would n't he ? ''"
`` I guess he would !
"we 'll have the splendidest things ever seen , wo n't we ?"
"Real soup with a ladle and a tureem -LSB- she meant tureen -RSB- and a little bird for turkey , and gravy , and all kinds of nice vegytubbles . ''"
"Daisy never could say vegetables properly , and had given up trying ."
"`` It is ` most three , and we ought to dress , '' said Nan , who had arranged a fine costume for the occasion , and was anxious to wear it ."
"`` I am the mother , so I sha n't dress up much , '' said Daisy , putting on a night-cap ornamented with a red bow , one of her aunt 's long skirts , and a shawl ; a pair of spectacles and large pocket handkerchief completed her toilette , making a plump , rosy little matron of her ."
"Nan had a wreath of artificial flowers , a pair of old pink slippers , a yellow scarf , a green muslin skirt , and a fan made of feathers from the duster ; also , as a last touch of elegance , a smelling-bottle without any smell in it ."
"`` I am the daughter , so I rig up a good deal , and I must sing and dance , and talk more than you do ."
"The mothers only get the tea and be proper , you know . ''"
"A sudden very loud knock caused Miss Smith to fly into a chair , and fan herself violently , while her mamma sat bolt upright on the sofa , and tried to look quite calm and `` proper . ''"
"Little Bess , who was on a visit , acted the part of maid , and opened the door , saying with a smile , `` Wart in , gemplemun ; it 's all weady . ''"
"In honor of the occasion , the boys wore high paper collars , tall black hats , and gloves of every color and material , for they were an afterthought , and not a boy among them had a perfect pair ."
"`` Good day , mum , '' said Demi , in a deep voice , which was so hard to keep up that his remarks had to be extremely brief ."
"Every one shook hands and then sat down , looking so funny , yet so sober , that the gentlemen forgot their manners , and rolled in their chairs with laughter ."
"`` Oh , do n't ! ''"
"cried Mrs. Smith , much distressed ."
"`` You ca n't ever come again if you act so , '' added Miss Smith , rapping Mr. Bangs with her bottle because he laughed loudest ."
"`` I ca n't help it , you look so like fury , '' gasped Mr. Bangs , with most uncourteous candor ."
"`` So do you , but I should n't be so rude as to say so ."
"He sha n't come to the dinner-ball , shall he , Daisy ? ''"
"cried Nan , indignantly ."
`` I think we had better dance now .
"Did you bring your fiddle , sir ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Smith , trying to preserve her polite composure ."
"`` It is outside the door , '' and Nat went to get it ."
"`` Better have tea first , '' proposed the unabashed Tommy , winking openly at Demi to remind him that the sooner the refreshments were secured , the sooner they could escape ."
"`` No , we never have supper first ; and if you do n't dance well you wo n't have any supper at all , not one bit , sir , '' said Mrs. Smith , so sternly that her wild guests saw she was not to be trifled with , and grew overwhelmingly civil all at once ."
"They liked this , and played hard till bedtime , when most of them turned in and slept like dormice ."
"Dan , however , had a plan in his head , and when he and Nat were alone , he unfolded it ."
`` Look here ! ''
"he said , taking from under his bed a bottle , a cigar , and a pack of cards , `` I 'm going to have some fun , and do as I used to with the fellows in town ."
"Here 's some beer , I got if of the old man at the station , and this cigar ; you can pay for 'em or Tommy will , he 's got heaps of money and I have n't a cent ."
"I 'm going to ask him in ; no , you go , they wo n't mind you . ''"
"`` The folks wo n't like it , '' began Nat ."
`` They wo n't know .
"Daddy Bhaer is away , and Mrs. Bhaer 's busy with Ted ; he 's got croup or something , and she ca n't leave him ."
"We sha n't sit up late or make any noise , so where 's the harm ? ''"
"`` Asia will know if we burn the lamp long , she always does . ''"
"`` No , she wo n't , I 've got a dark lantern on purpose ; it do n't give much light , and we can shut it quick if we hear anyone coming , '' said Dan ."
"This idea struck Nat as a fine one , and lent an air of romance to the thing ."
"He started off to tell Tommy , but put his head in again to say , `` You want Demi , too , do n't you ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't ; the Deacon will rollup eyes and preach if you tell him ."
"He will be asleep , so just tip the wink to Tom and cut back again . ''"
"Nat obeyed , and returned in a minute with Tommy half dressed , rather tousled about the head and very sleepy , but quite ready for fun as usual ."
"`` Now , keep quiet , and I 'll show you how to play a first-rate game called ` Poker , ' '' said Dan , as the three revellers gathered round the table , on which were set forth the bottle , the cigar , and the cards ."
"`` First we 'll all have a drink , then we 'll take a go at the ` weed , ' and then we 'll play ."
"That 's the way men do , and it 's jolly fun . ''"
"The beer circulated in a mug , and all three smacked their lips over it , though Nat and Tommy did not like the bitter stuff ."
"The cigar was worse still , but they dared not say so , and each puffed away till he was dizzy or choked , when he passed the `` weed '' on to his neighbor ."
"Dan liked it , for it seemed like old times when he now and then had a chance to imitate the low men who surrounded him ."
"He drank , and smoked , and swaggered as much like them as he could , and , getting into the spirit of the part he assumed , he soon began to swear under his breath for fear some one should hear him ."
`` You must n't ; it 's wicked to say ` Damn ! ' ''
"cried Tommy , who had followed his leader so far ."
"`` Oh , hang !"
"do n't you preach , but play away ; it 's part of the fun to swear . ''"
"`` I 'd rather say ` thunder turtles , ' '' said Tommy , who had composed this interesting exclamation and was very proud of it ."
"`` And I 'll say ` The Devil ; ' that sounds well , '' added Nat , much impressed by Dan 's manly ways ."
"Dan scoffed at their `` nonsense , '' and swore stoutly as he tried to teach them the new game ."
"But Tommy was very sleepy , and Nat 's head began to ache with the beer and the smoke , so neither of them was very quick to learn , and the game dragged ."
"And how terrible it would be to be doing something you did n't like every day for ... well , say forty years ."
"Anne was of two minds whether to have her cry out then and there , or wait till she was safely in her own white room at home ."
"Before she could decide there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor , and Anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made her recall a recent criticism of Mr. Harrison 's on an overdressed female he had seen in a Charlottetown store ."
`` She looked like a head-on collision between a fashion plate and a nightmare . ''
"The newcomer was gorgeously arrayed in a pale blue summer silk , puffed , frilled , and shirred wherever puff , frill , or shirring could possibly be placed ."
"Her head was surmounted by a huge white chiffon hat , bedecked with three long but rather stringy ostrich feathers ."
"A veil of pink chiffon , lavishly sprinkled with huge black dots , hung like a flounce from the hat brim to her shoulders and floated off in two airy streamers behind her ."
"She wore all the jewelry that could be crowded on one small woman , and a very strong odor of perfume attended her ."
"`` I am Mrs. DonNELL ... Mrs. H. B. DonNELL , '' announced this vision , `` and I have come in to see you about something Clarice Almira told me when she came home to dinner today ."
It annoyed me EXCESSIVELY . ''
"`` I 'm sorry , '' faltered Anne , vainly trying to recollect any incident of the morning connected with the Donnell children ."
`` Clarice Almira told me that you pronounced our name DONnell .
"Now , Miss Shirley , the correct pronunciation of our name is DonNELL ... accent on the last syllable ."
I hope you 'll remember this in future . ''
"`` I 'll try to , '' gasped Anne , choking back a wild desire to laugh ."
`` I know by experience that it 's very unpleasant to have one 's name SPELLED wrong and I suppose it must be even worse to have it pronounced wrong . ''
`` Certainly it is .
And Clarice Almira also informed me that you call my son Jacob . ''
"`` He told me his name was Jacob , '' protested Anne ."
"`` I might well have expected that , '' said Mrs. H. B. Donnell , in a tone which implied that gratitude in children was not to be looked for in this degenerate age ."
"`` That boy has such plebeian tastes , Miss Shirley ."
"When he was born I wanted to call him St. Clair ... it sounds SO aristocratic , does n't it ?"
But his father insisted he should be called Jacob after his uncle .
"I yielded , because Uncle Jacob was a rich old bachelor ."
"And what do you think , Miss Shirley ?"
When our innocent boy was five years old Uncle Jacob actually went and got married and now he has three boys of his own .
Did you ever hear of such ingratitude ?
"The moment the invitation to the wedding ... for he had the impertinence to send us an invitation , Miss Shirley ... came to the house I said , ` No more Jacobs for me , thank you . '"
From that day I called my son St. Clair and St. Clair I am determined he shall be called .
"His father obstinately continues to call him Jacob , and the boy himself has a perfectly unaccountable preference for the vulgar name ."
But St. Clair he is and St. Clair he shall remain .
"You will kindly remember this , Miss Shirley , will you not ?"
Something about the firm outlines of Anne 's lips told that Mrs. Rachel was not far astray in this estimate .
Anne 's heart was bent on forming the Improvement Society .
"Gilbert Blythe , who was to teach in White Sands but would always be home from Friday night to Monday morning , was enthusiastic about it ; and most of the other folks were willing to go in for anything that meant occasional meetings and consequently some `` fun . ''"
"As for what the `` improvements '' were to be , nobody had any very clear idea except Anne and Gilbert ."
"They had talked them over and planned them out until an ideal Avonlea existed in their minds , if nowhere else ."
Mrs. Rachel had still another item of news .
`` They 've given the Carmody school to a Priscilla Grant .
"Did n't you go to Queen 's with a girl of that name , Anne ? ''"
"`` Yes , indeed ."
Priscilla to teach at Carmody !
How perfectly lovely ! ''
"exclaimed Anne , her gray eyes lighting up until they looked like evening stars , causing Mrs. Lynde to wonder anew if she would ever get it settled to her satisfaction whether Anne Shirley were really a pretty girl or not ."
II Selling in Haste and Repenting at Leisure Anne drove over to Carmody on a shopping expedition the next afternoon and took Diana Barry with her .
"Diana was , of course , a pledged member of the Improvement Society , and the two girls talked about little else all the way to Carmody and back ."
"`` The very first thing we ought to do when we get started is to have that hall painted , '' said Diana , as they drove past the Avonlea hall , a rather shabby building set down in a wooded hollow , with spruce trees hooding it about on all sides ."
`` It 's a disgraceful looking place and we must attend to it even before we try to get Mr. Levi Boulder to pull his house down .
Father says we 'll never succeed in DOING that .
Levi Boulter is too mean to spend the time it would take . ''
"`` Perhaps he 'll let the boys take it down if they promise to haul the boards and split them up for him for kindling wood , '' said Anne hopefully ."
`` We must do our best and be content to go slowly at first .
We ca n't expect to improve everything all at once .
"We 'll have to educate public sentiment first , of course . ''"
Diana was n't exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant ; but it sounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to belong to a society with such an aim in view .
"`` I thought of something last night that we could do , Anne ."
You know that three-cornered piece of ground where the roads from Carmody and Newbridge and White Sands meet ?
"It 's all grown over with young spruce ; but would n't it be nice to have them all cleared out , and just leave the two or three birch trees that are on it ? ''"
"`` Splendid , '' agreed Anne gaily ."
`` And have a rustic seat put under the birches .
And when spring comes we 'll have a flower-bed made in the middle of it and plant geraniums . ''
"`` Yes ; only we 'll have to devise some way of getting old Mrs. Hiram Sloane to keep her cow off the road , or she 'll eat our geraniums up , '' laughed Diana ."
"`` I begin to see what you mean by educating public sentiment , Anne ."
There 's the old Boulter house now .
"I believe in Him now -- I have to -- there 's nothing else to fall back on but God -- humbly , starkly , unconditionally . '' ''"
"` Our help in ages past ' -- ` the same yesterday , to-day and for ever , ' '' said the minister gently ."
`` When we forget God -- He remembers us . ''
There was no crowd at the Glen Station the next morning to see Walter off .
It was becoming a commonplace for a khaki clad boy to board that early morning train after his last leave .
"Besides his own , only the Manse folk were there , and Mary Vance ."
"Mary had sent her Miller off the week before , with a determined grin , and now considered herself entitled to give expert opinion on how such partings should be conducted ."
"`` The main thing is to smile and act as if nothing was happening , '' she informed the Ingleside group ."
`` The boys all hate the sob act like poison .
Miller told me I was n't to come near the station if I could n't keep from bawling .
"So I got through with my crying beforehand , and at the last I said to him , ` Good luck , Miller , and if you come back you 'll find I have n't changed any , and if you do n't come back I 'll always be proud you went , and in any case do n't fall in love with a French girl . '"
"Miller swore he would n't , but you never can tell about those fascinating foreign hussies ."
"Anyhow , the last sight he had of me I was smiling to my limit ."
"Gee , all the rest of the day my face felt as if it had been starched and ironed into a smile . ''"
"In spite of Mary 's advice and example Mrs. Blythe , who had sent Jem off with a smile , could not quite manage one for Walter ."
But at least no one cried .
"Dog Monday came out of his lair in the shipping-shed and sat down close to Walter , thumping his tail vigorously on the boards of the platform whenever Walter spoke to him , and looking up with confident eyes , as if to say , `` I know you 'll find Jem and bring him back to me . ''"
"`` So long , old fellow , '' said Carl Meredith cheerfully , when the good-byes had to be said ."
`` Tell them over there to keep their spirits up -- I am coming along presently . ''
"`` Me too , '' said Shirley laconically , proffering a brown paw ."
Susan heard him and her face turned very grey .
"Una shook hands quietly , looking at him with wistful , sorrowful , dark-blue eyes ."
But then Una 's eyes had always been wistful .
"Walter bent his handsome black head in its khaki cap and kissed her with the warm , comradely kiss of a brother ."
"He had never kissed her before , and for a fleeting moment Una 's face betrayed her , if anyone had noticed ."
But nobody did ; the conductor was shouting `` all aboard '' ; everybody was trying to look very cheerful .
Walter turned to Rilla ; she held his hands and looked up at him .
She would not see him again until the day broke and the shadows vanished -- and she knew not if that daybreak would be on this side of the grave or beyond it .
"`` Good-bye , '' she said ."
On her lips it lost all the bitterness it had won through the ages of parting and bore instead all the sweetness of the old loves of all the women who had ever loved and prayed for the beloved .
"`` Write me often and bring Jims up faithfully , according to the gospel of Morgan , '' Walter said lightly , having said all his serious things the night before in Rainbow Valley ."
But at the last moment he took her face between his hands and looked deep into her gallant eyes .
Danger !
"` Are you sure , Wendy ? '"
` Oh yes . '
Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window .
It was securely fastened .
"She looked out , and the night was peppered with stars ."
"They were crowding round the house , as if curious to see what was to take place there , but she did not notice this , nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her ."
"Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry , ` Oh , how I wish that I was n't going to a party to-night ! '"
"Even Michael , already half asleep , knew that she was perturbed , and he asked , ` Can anything harm us , mother , after the night-lights are lit ? '"
"` Nothing , precious , ' she said ; ` they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her to guard her children . '"
"She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them , and little Michael flung his arms round her ."
"` Mother , ' he cried , ` I 'm glad of you . '"
They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time .
"-LSB- Illustration : PETER FLEW IN -RSB- No. 27 was only a few yards distant , but there had been a slight fall of snow , and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their shoes ."
"They were already the only persons in the street , and all the stars were watching them ."
"Stars are beautiful , but they may not take an active part in anything , they must just look on for ever ."
It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was .
"So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak -LRB- winking is the star language -RRB- , but the little ones still wonder ."
"They are not really friendly to Peter , who has a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out ; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night , and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way ."
"So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament , and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way screamed out : ` Now , Peter ! '"
"CHAPTER III COME AWAY , COME AWAY !"
For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly .
"They were awfully nice little night-lights , and one can not help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter ; but Wendy 's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also , and before they could close their mouths all the three went out ."
"There was another light in the room now , a thousand times brighter than the night-lights , and in the time we have taken to say this , it has been in all the drawers in the nursery , looking for Peter 's shadow , rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out ."
"It was not really a light ; it made this light by flashing about so quickly , but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy , no longer than your hand , but still growing ."
"It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf , cut low and square , through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage ."
She was slightly inclined to embonpoint .
"A moment after the fairy 's entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars , and Peter dropped in ."
"He had carried Tinker Bell part of the way , and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust ."
"` Tinker Bell , ' he called softly , after making sure that the children were asleep , ` Tink , where are you ? '"
"She was in a jug for the moment , and liking it extremely ; she had never been in a jug before ."
"` Oh , do come out of that jug , and tell me , do you know where they put my shadow ? '"
"Look at the four of them , Wendy and Michael over there , John here , and Mrs. Darling by the fire ."
There should have been a fourth night-light .
While she slept she had a dream .
She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it .
"He did not alarm her , for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children ."
Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also .
"But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland , and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap ."
"The dream by itself would have been a trifle , but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open , and a boy did drop on the floor ."
"He was accompanied by a strange light , no bigger than your fist , which darted about the room like a living thing ; and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling ."
"She started up with a cry , and saw the boy , and somehow she knew at once that he was Peter Pan ."
If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling 's kiss .
"He was a lovely boy , clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees ; but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth ."
"When he saw she was a grown-up , he gnashed the little pearls at her ."
"CHAPTER II THE SHADOW Mrs. Darling screamed , and , as if in answer to a bell , the door opened , and Nana entered , returned from her evening out ."
"She growled and sprang at the boy , who leapt lightly through the window ."
"Again Mrs. Darling screamed , this time in distress for him , for she thought he was killed , and she ran down into the street to look for his little body , but it was not there ; and she looked up , and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star ."
"She returned to the nursery , and found Nana with something in her mouth , which proved to be the boy 's shadow ."
"As he leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly , too late to catch him , but his shadow had not had time to get out ; slam went the window and snapped it off ."
"You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully , but it was quite the ordinary kind ."
Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow .
"She hung it out at the window , meaning ` He is sure to come back for it ; let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children . '"
But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window ; it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house .
"She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling , but he was totting up winter greatcoats for John and Michael , with a wet towel round his head to keep his brain clear , and it seemed a shame to trouble him ; besides , she knew exactly what he would say : ` It all comes of having a dog for a nurse . '"
"She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer , until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband ."
Ah me !
"The opportunity came a week later , on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday ."
Of course it was a Friday . '
"I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday , ' she used to say afterwards to her husband , while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her , holding her hand ."
"` No , no , ' Mr. Darling always said , ' I am responsible for it all ."
"I , George Darling , did it ."
"Mea culpa , mea culpa ."
' He had had a classical education .
I fondly expected it would turn my hair black -- and it turned it green .
So it had to be cut off . ''
"`` You had a narrow escape , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' exclaimed Susan ."
`` Of course you were too young then to know what a German was .
It was a special mercy of Providence that it was only green dye and not poison . ''
"`` It seems hundreds of years since those Green Gables days , '' sighed Mrs. Blythe ."
`` They belonged to another world altogether .
Life has been cut in two by the chasm of war .
What is ahead I do n't know -- but it ca n't be a bit like the past .
I wonder if those of us who have lived half our lives in the old world will ever feel wholly at home in the new . ''
"`` Have you noticed , '' asked Miss Oliver , glancing up from her book , `` how everything written before the war seems so far away now , too ?"
One feels as if one was reading something as ancient as the Iliad .
This poem of Wordsworth 's -- the Senior class have it in their entrance work -- I 've been glancing over it .
"Its classic calm and repose and the beauty of the lines seem to belong to another planet , and to have as little to do with the present world-welter as the evening star . ''"
"`` The only thing that I find much comfort in reading nowadays is the Bible , '' remarked Susan , whisking her biscuits into the oven ."
`` There are so many passages in it that seem to me exactly descriptive of the Huns .
"Old Highland Sandy declares that there is no doubt that the Kaiser is the Anti-Christ spoken of in Revelations , but I do not go as far as that ."
"It would , in my humble opinion , Mrs. Dr. dear , be too great an honour for him . ''"
"Early one morning , several days later , Miranda Pryor slipped up to Ingleside , ostensibly to get some Red Cross sewing , but in reality to talk over with sympathetic Rilla troubles that were past bearing alone ."
"She brought her dog with her -- an over-fed , bandy-legged little animal very dear to her heart because Joe Milgrave had given it to her when it was a puppy ."
Mr. Pryor regarded all dogs with disfavour ; but in those days he had looked kindly upon Joe as a suitor for Miranda 's hand and so he had allowed her to keep the puppy .
"Miranda was so grateful that she endeavoured to please her father by naming her dog after his political idol , the great Liberal chieftain , Sir Wilfrid Laurier -- though his title was soon abbreviated to Wilfy ."
Sir Wilfrid grew and flourished and waxed fat ; but Miranda spoiled him absurdly and nobody else liked him .
Rilla especially hated him because of his detestable trick of lying flat on his back and entreating you with waving paws to tickle his sleek stomach .
"When she saw that Miranda 's pale eyes bore unmistakable testimony of her having cried all night , Rilla asked her to come up to her room , knowing Miranda had a tale of woe to tell , but she ordered Sir Wilfrid to remain below ."
"`` Oh , ca n't he come , too ? ''"
said Miranda wistfully .
`` Poor Wilfy wo n't be any bother -- and I wiped his paws so carefully before I brought him in .
He is always so lonesome in a strange place without me -- and very soon he 'll be -- all -- I 'll have left -- to remind me -- of Joe . ''
"Rilla yielded , and Sir Wilfrid , with his tail curled at a saucy angle over his brindled back , trotted triumphantly up the stairs before them ."
"`` Oh , Rilla , '' sobbed Miranda , when they had reached sanctuary ."
`` I 'm so unhappy .
"But she shook her head and I heard her telling mother later that , in her opinion , ` cooties ' and ` sarks ' were not proper subjects for young girls to talk about ."
"She was especially horrified when Jem wrote in his last letter to mother , ` Tell Susan I had a fine cootie hunt this morning and caught fifty-three ! '"
Susan positively turned pea-green .
"` Mrs. Dr. dear , ' she said , ` when I was young , if decent people were so unfortunate as to get -- those insects -- they kept it a secret if possible ."
"I do not want to be narrow-minded , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I still think it is better not to mention such things . '"
`` Miranda grew confidential over our vermin shirts and told me all her troubles .
She is desperately unhappy .
She is engaged to Joe Milgrave and Joe joined up in October and has been training in Charlottetown ever since .
Her father was furious when he joined and forbade Miranda ever to have any dealing or communication with him again .
"Poor Joe expects to go overseas any day and wants Miranda to marry him before he goes , which shows that there have been ` communications ' in spite of Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
"Miranda wants to marry him but can not , and she declares it will break her heart . ''"
` Why do n't you run away and marry him ? '
I said .
It did n't go against my conscience in the least to give her such advice .
"Joe Milgrave is a splendid fellow and Mr. Pryor fairly beamed on him until the war broke out and I know Mr. Pryor would forgive Miranda very quickly , once it was over and he wanted his housekeeper back ."
But Miranda shook her silvery head dolefully . ''
` Joe wants me to but I ca n't .
"Mother 's last words to me , as she lay on her dying-bed , were , `` Never , never run away , Miranda , '' and I promised . '"
"`` Miranda 's mother died two years ago , and it seems , according to Miranda , that her mother and father actually ran away to be married themselves ."
To picture Whiskers-on-the-moon as the hero of an elopement is beyond my power .
But such was the case and Mrs. Pryor at least lived to repent it .
"She had a hard life of it with Mr. Pryor , and she thought it was a punishment on her for running away ."
"So she made Miranda promise she would never , for any reason whatever , do it ."
"`` Of course , you can not urge a girl to break a promise made to a dying mother , so I did not see what Miranda could do unless she got Joe to come to the house when her father was away and marry her there ."
But Miranda said that could n't be managed .
"Her father seemed to suspect she might be up to something of the sort and he never went away for long at a time , and , of course , Joe could n't get leave of absence at an hour 's notice . ''"
"` No , I shall just have to let Joe go , and he will be killed -- I know he will be killed -- and my heart will break , ' said Miranda , her tears running down and copiously bedewing the vermin shirts !"
`` I am not writing like this for lack of any real sympathy with poor Miranda .
"I 've just got into the habit of giving things a comical twist if I can , when I 'm writing to Jem and Walter and Ken , to make them laugh ."
I really felt sorry for Miranda who is as much in love with Joe as a china-blue girl can be with anyone and who is dreadfully ashamed of her father 's pro-German sentiments .
"I think she understood that I did , for she said she had wanted to tell me all about her worries because I had grown so sympathetic this past year ."
I wonder if I have .
We all seem to be getting on pretty well .
"The Newbridge people like Jane , I hear ; and I think White Sands is tolerably satisfied with your humble servant ... all except Mr. Andrew Spencer ."
I met Mrs. Peter Blewett on my way home last night and she told me she thought it her duty to inform me that Mr. Spencer did n't approve of my methods . ''
"`` Have you ever noticed , '' asked Anne reflectively , `` that when people say it is their duty to tell you a certain thing you may prepare for something disagreeable ?"
Why is it that they never seem to think it a duty to tell you the pleasant things they hear about you ?
"Mrs. H. B. DonNELL called at the school again yesterday and told me she thought it HER duty to inform me that Mrs. Harmon Andrew did n't approve of my reading fairy tales to the children , and that Mr. Rogerson thought Prillie was n't coming on fast enough in arithmetic ."
If Prillie would spend less time making eyes at the boys over her slate she might do better .
"I feel quite sure that Jack Gillis works her class sums for her , though I 've never been able to catch him red-handed . ''"
`` Have you succeeded in reconciling Mrs. DonNELL 's hopeful son to his saintly name ? ''
"`` Yes , '' laughed Anne , `` but it was really a difficult task ."
"At first , when I called him ` St. Clair ' he would not take the least notice until I 'd spoken two or three times ; and then , when the other boys nudged him , he would look up with such an aggrieved air , as if I 'd called him John or Charlie and he could n't be expected to know I meant him ."
So I kept him in after school one night and talked kindly to him .
I told him his mother wished me to call him St. Clair and I could n't go against her wishes .
He saw it when it was all explained out ... he 's really a very reasonable little fellow ... and he said I could call him St. Clair but that he 'd ` lick the stuffing ' out of any of the boys that tried it .
"Of course , I had to rebuke him again for using such shocking language ."
Since then I call him St. Clair and the boys call him Jake and all goes smoothly .
"He informs me that he means to be a carpenter , but Mrs. DonNELL says I am to make a college professor out of him . ''"
"The mention of college gave a new direction to Gilbert 's thoughts , and they talked for a time of their plans and wishes ... gravely , earnestly , hopefully , as youth loves to talk , while the future is yet an untrodden path full of wonderful possibilities ."
Gilbert had finally made up his mind that he was going to be a doctor .
"`` It 's a splendid profession , '' he said enthusiastically ."
`` A fellow has to fight something all through life ... did n't somebody once define man as a fighting animal ?
... and I want to fight disease and pain and ignorance ... which are all members one of another .
"I want to do my share of honest , real work in the world , Anne ... add a little to the sum of human knowledge that all the good men have been accumulating since it began ."
The folks who lived before me have done so much for me that I want to show my gratitude by doing something for the folks who will live after me .
It seems to me that is the only way a fellow can get square with his obligations to the race . ''
"`` I 'd like to add some beauty to life , '' said Anne dreamily ."
`` I do n't exactly want to make people KNOW more ... though I know that IS the noblest ambition ... but I 'd love to make them have a pleasanter time because of me ... to have some little joy or happy thought that would never have existed if I had n't been born . ''
"`` I think you 're fulfilling that ambition every day , '' said Gilbert admiringly ."
And he was right .
Anne was one of the children of light by birthright .
"After she had passed through a life with a smile or a word thrown across it like a gleam of sunshine the owner of that life saw it , for the time being at least , as hopeful and lovely and of good report ."
Finally Gilbert rose regretfully .
"DAMON AND PYTHIAS Mrs. Bhaer was right ; peace was only a temporary lull , a storm was brewing , and two days after Bess left , a moral earthquake shook Plumfield to its centre ."
"Tommy 's hens were at the bottom of the trouble , for if they had not persisted in laying so many eggs , he could not have sold them and made such sums ."
"Money is the root of all evil , and yet it is such a useful root that we can not get on without it any more than we can without potatoes ."
"Tommy certainly could not , for he spent his income so recklessly , that Mr. Bhaer was obliged to insist on a savings-bank , and presented him with a private one an imposing tin edifice , with the name over the door , and a tall chimney , down which the pennies were to go , there to rattle temptingly till leave was given to open a sort of trap-door in the floor ."
"The house increased in weight so rapidly , that Tommy soon became satisfied with his investment , and planned to buy unheard-of treasures with his capital ."
"He kept account of the sums deposited , and was promised that he might break the bank as soon as he had five dollars , on condition that he spent the money wisely ."
"Only one dollar was needed , and the day Mrs. Jo paid him for four dozen eggs , he was so delighted , that he raced off to the barn to display the bright quarters to Nat , who was also laying by money for the long-desired violin ."
"`` I wish I had 'em to put with my three dollars , then I 'd soon get enough to buy my fiddle , '' he said , looking wistfully at the money ."
`` P'raps I 'll lend you some .
"I have n't decided yet what I 'll do with mine , '' said Tommy , tossing up his quarters and catching them as they fell ."
`` Hi !
boys !
come down to the brook and see what a jolly great snake Dan 's got ! ''
called a voice from behind the barn .
"`` Come on , '' said Tommy ; and , laying his money inside the old winnowing machine , away he ran , followed by Nat ."
"The snake was very interesting , and then a long chase after a lame crow , and its capture , so absorbed Tommy 's mind and time , that he never thought of his money till he was safely in bed that night ."
"`` Never mind , no one but Nat knows where it is , '' said the easy-going lad , and fell asleep untroubled by any anxiety about his property ."
"Next morning , just as the boys assembled for school , Tommy rushed into the room breathlessly , demanding , `` I say , who has got my dollar ? ''"
`` What are you talking about ? ''
asked Franz .
"Tommy explained , and Nat corroborated his statement ."
"Every one else declared they knew nothing about it , and began to look suspiciously at Nat , who got more and more alarmed and confused with each denial ."
"`` Somebody must have taken it , '' said Franz , as Tommy shook his fist at the whole party , and wrathfully declared that , `` By thunder turtles !"
"if I get hold of the thief , I 'll give him what he wo n't forget in a hurry . ''"
"`` Keep cool , Tom ; we shall find him out ; thieves always come to grief , '' said Dan , as one who knew something of the matter ."
"`` May be some tramp slept in the barn and took it , '' suggested Ned ."
"`` No , Silas do n't allow that ; besides , a tramp would n't go looking in that old machine for money , '' said Emil , with scorn ."
`` Was n't it Silas himself ? ''
said Jack .
"`` Well , I like that !"
Old Si is as honest as daylight .
"You would n't catch him touching a penny of ours , '' said Tommy , handsomely defending his chief admirer from suspicion ."
"For the next two hours the girls wrote busily , forgetting all about the rainy day , and enjoying their epistolary labours to the full ."
It was dusk when all the letters were finished .
"`` Why , has n't the afternoon gone quickly after all ! ''"
exclaimed Carol .
`` I just let my pen run on and jotted down any good working idea that came into my head .
"Cyrilla Blair , that big fat letter is never for Miss Marshall !"
What on earth did you find to write her ? ''
"`` It was n't so hard when I got fairly started , '' said Cyrilla , smiling ."
"`` Now , let 's hunt up Nora Jane and send the letters around so that everybody can read his or hers before tea-time ."
We should have a choice assortment of smiles at the table instead of all those frowns and sighs we had at dinner . ''
"Miss Emily Marshall was at that moment sitting in her little back room , all alone in the dusk , with the rain splashing drearily against the windowpanes outside ."
Miss Marshall was feeling as lonely and dreary as she looked -- and as she had often felt in her life of sixty years .
She told herself bitterly that she had n't a friend in the world -- not even one who cared enough for her to come and see her or write her a letter now and then .
"She thought her boarding-house acquaintances disliked her and she resented their dislike , without admitting to herself that her ungracious ways were responsible for it ."
She smiled sourly when little ripples of laughter came faintly down the hall from the front room where The Trio were writing their letters and laughing over the fun they were putting into them .
"`` If they were old and lonesome and friendless they would n't see much in life to laugh at , I guess , '' said Miss Marshall bitterly , drawing her shawl closer about her sharp shoulders ."
`` They never think of anything but themselves and if a day passes that they do n't have ` some fun ' they think it 's a fearful thing to put up with .
I 'm sick and tired of their giggling and whispering . ''
In the midst of these amiable reflections Miss Marshall heard a knock at her door .
"When she opened it there stood Nora Jane , her broad red face beaming with smiles ."
"`` Please , Miss , here 's a letter for you , '' she said ."
`` A letter for me ! ''
Miss Marshall shut her door and stared at the fat envelope in amazement .
Who could have written it ?
The postman came only in the morning .
"Was it some joke , perhaps ?"
Those giggling girls ?
Miss Marshall 's face grew harder as she lighted her lamp and opened the letter suspiciously .
"`` Dear Miss Marshall , '' it ran in Cyrilla 's pretty girlish writing , `` we girls are so lonesome and dull that we have decided to write rainy-day letters to everybody in the house just to cheer ourselves up ."
So I 'm going to write to you just a letter of friendly nonsense . ''
"Pages of `` nonsense '' followed , and very delightful nonsense it was , for Cyrilla possessed the happy gift of bright and easy letter-writing ."
"She commented wittily on all the amusing episodes of the boarding-house life for the past month ; she described a cat-fight she had witnessed from her window that morning and illustrated it by a pen-and-ink sketch of the belligerent felines ; she described a lovely new dress her mother had sent her from home and told all about the class party to which she had worn it ; she gave an account of her vacation camping trip to the mountains and pasted on one page a number of small snapshots taken during the outing ; she copied a joke she had read in the paper that morning and discussed the serial story in the boarding-house magazine which all the boarders were reading ; she wrote out the directions for a new crocheted tidy her sister had made -- Miss Marshall had a mania for crocheting ; and she finally wound up with `` all the good will and good wishes that Nora Jane will consent to carry from your friend , Cyrilla Blair . ''"
"At all events , though he told her grumpily that she had made a nice fool of herself , and would live to regret it , he said nothing worse , and Mrs. Joe put on her apron and went to work as usual , while Sir Wilfrid Laurier , who had a poor opinion of lighthouses for winter residences , went to sleep in his pet nook behind the woodbox , a thankful dog that he was done with war-weddings ."
"CHAPTER XIX `` THEY SHALL NOT PASS '' One cold grey morning in February Gertrude Oliver wakened with a shiver , slipped into Rilla 's room , and crept in beside her ."
`` Rilla -- I 'm frightened -- frightened as a baby -- I 've had another of my strange dreams .
Something terrible is before us -- I know . ''
`` What was it ? ''
asked Rilla .
"`` I was standing again on the veranda steps -- just as I stood in that dream on the night before the lighthouse dance , and in the sky a huge black , menacing thunder cloud rolled up from the east ."
I could see its shadow racing before it and when it enveloped me I shivered with icy cold .
"Then the storm broke -- and it was a dreadful storm -- blinding flash after flash and deafening peal after peal , driving torrents of rain ."
"I turned in panic and tried to run for shelter , and as I did so a man -- a soldier in the uniform of a French army officer -- dashed up the steps and stood beside me on the threshold of the door ."
"His clothes were soaked with blood from a wound in his breast , he seemed spent and exhausted ; but his white face was set and his eyes blazed in his hollow face ."
"` They shall not pass , ' he said , in low , passionate tones which I heard distinctly amid all the turmoil of the storm ."
Then I awakened .
"Rilla , I 'm frightened -- the spring will not bring the Big Push we 've all been hoping for -- instead it is going to bring some dreadful blow to France ."
I am sure of it .
The Germans will try to smash through somewhere . ''
"`` But he told you that they would not pass , '' said Rilla , seriously ."
She never laughed at Gertrude 's dreams as the doctor did .
"`` I do not know if that was prophecy or desperation , Rilla , the horror of that dream holds me yet in an icy grip ."
We shall need all our courage before long . ''
"Dr. Blythe did laugh at the breakfast table -- but he never laughed at Miss Oliver 's dreams again ; for that day brought news of the opening of the Verdun offensive , and thereafter through all the beautiful weeks of spring the Ingleside family , one and all , lived in a trance of dread ."
There were days when they waited in despair for the end as foot by foot the Germans crept nearer and nearer to the grim barrier of desperate France .
"Susan 's deeds were in her spotless kitchen at Ingleside , but her thoughts were on the hills around Verdun ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she would stick her head in at Mrs. Blythe 's door the last thing at night to remark , `` I do hope the French have hung onto the Crow 's Wood today , '' and she woke at dawn to wonder if Dead Man 's Hill -- surely named by some prophet -- was still held by the `` poyloos . ''"
Susan could have drawn a map of the country around Verdun that would have satisfied a chief of staff .
"`` If the Germans capture Verdun the spirit of France will be broken , '' Miss Oliver said bitterly ."
"`` But they will not capture it , '' staunchly said Susan , who could not eat her dinner that day for fear lest they do that very thing ."
"`` In the first place , you dreamed they would not -- you dreamed the very thing the French are saying before they ever said it -- ` they shall not pass . '"
"I declare to you , Miss Oliver , dear , when I read that in the paper , and remembered your dream , I went cold all over with awe ."
It seemed to me like Biblical times when people dreamed things like that quite frequently .
"`` I know -- I know , '' said Gertrude , walking restlessly about ."
"`` I cling to a persistent faith in my dream , too -- but every time bad news comes it fails me ."
"Stuffy was observed to offer her frequent sucks on his candy-ball during the game , which evidently sweetened her temper , for the last thing she said on going to bed was , `` When my battledore and shuttle-cock comes , I 'll let you all play with 'em . ''"
Her first remark in the morning was `` Has my box come ? ''
"and when told that it would arrive sometime during the day , she fretted and fumed , and whipped her doll , till Daisy was shocked ."
"She managed to exist , however , till five o'clock , when she disappeared , and was not missed till supper-time , because those at home thought she had gone to the hill with Tommy and Demi ."
"`` I saw her going down the avenue alone as hard as she could pelt , '' said Mary Ann , coming in with the hasty-pudding , and finding every one asking , `` Where is Nan ? ''"
"`` She has run home , little gypsy ! ''"
"cried Mrs. Bhaer , looking anxious ."
"`` Perhaps she has gone to the station to look after her luggage , '' suggested Franz ."
"`` That is impossible , she does not know the way , and if she found it , she could never carry the box a mile , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , beginning to think that her new idea might be rather a hard one to carry out ."
"`` It would be like her , '' and Mr. Bhaer caught up his hat to go and find the child , when a shout from Jack , who was at the window , made everyone hurry to the door ."
"There was Miss Nan , to be sure , tugging along a very large band-box tied up in linen bag ."
"Very hot and dusty and tired did she look , but marched stoutly along , and came puffing up to the steps , where she dropped her load with a sigh of relief , and sat down upon it , observed as she crossed her tired arms , `` I could n't wait any longer , so I went and got it . ''"
"`` But you did not know the way , '' said Tommy , while the rest stood round enjoying the joke ."
"`` Oh , I found it , I never get lost . ''"
"`` It 's a mile , how could you go so far ? ''"
"`` Well , it was pretty far , but I rested a good deal . ''"
`` Was n't that thing very heavy ? ''
"`` It 's so round , I could n't get hold of it good , and I thought my arms would break right off . ''"
"`` I do n't see how the station-master let you have it , '' said Tommy ."
`` I did n't say anything to him .
"He was in the little ticket place , and did n't see me , so I just took it off the platform . ''"
"`` Run down and tell him it is all right , Franz , or old Dodd will think it is stolen , '' said Mr. Bhaer , joining in the shout of laughter at Nan 's coolness ."
`` I told you we would send for it if it did not come .
"Another time you must wait , for you will get into trouble if you run away ."
"Promise me this , or I shall not dare to trust you out of my sight , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , wiping the dust off Nan 's little hot face ."
"`` Well , I wo n't , only papa tells me not to put off doing things , so I do n't . ''"
"`` That is rather a poser ; I think you had better give her some supper now , and a private lecture by and by , '' said Mr. Bhaer , too much amused to be angry at the young lady 's exploit ."
"The boys thought it `` great fun , '' and Nan entertained them all supper-time with an account of her adventures ; for a big dog had barked at her , a man had laughed at her , a woman had given her a doughnut , and her hat had fallen into the brook when she stopped to drink , exhausted with her exertion ."
"`` I fancy you will have your hands full now , my dear ; Tommy and Nan are quite enough for one woman , '' said Mr. Bhaer , half an hour later ."
"`` I know it will take some time to tame the child , but she is such a generous , warm-hearted little thing , I should love her even if she were twice as naughty , '' answered Mrs. Jo , pointing to the merry group , in the middle of which stood Nan , giving away her things right and left , as lavishly as if the big band-box had no bottom ."
"It was those good traits that soon made little `` Giddygaddy , '' as they called her , a favorite with every one ."
"Daisy never complained of being dull again , for Nan invented the most delightful plays , and her pranks rivalled Tommy 's , to the amusement of the whole school ."
"laughed Jack , adding , with great interest , `` What did the other fellow do ? ''"
"`` He went about fighting other people 's battles , helping the poor , and trying to do good ."
"But he lacked judgment , so he often got into trouble , and was in such a hurry that he did not always stop to find out the wisest way ."
"As when he gave away his best coat to a beggar boy , instead of the old one which he intended to give . ''"
"`` I say , that is n't fair , mother !"
"Neither of them was new , and the boy needed the best more than I did , and I wore the old one all winter , did n't I ? ''"
"asked Jack , who had rather exulted over Frank , and was now taken down himself ."
"`` Yes , you did , my dear ; and it was not an easy thing for my dandiprat to do ."
"Now listen , and I 'll tell you how they both learned to be wiser ."
"The elder prince soon found that the big dragons were too much for him , and set about training his own little one , who now and then ran away with him ."
"Its name was Will , a good servant , but a bad master ; so he learned to control it , and in time this gave him great power over himself , and fitted him to be a king over others . ''"
"`` Thank you , mother ; I 'll remember my part of the moral ."
"Now give Jack his , '' said Frank , who liked the dragon episode , as he had been wrestling with his own of late , and found it hard to manage ."
"`` He had a fine example before him in a friend , and he followed it more reasonably till he grew able to use wisely one of the best and noblest gifts of God -- benevolence . ''"
`` Now tell about the girl .
Was there more to that part of the story ? ''
"asked Jack , well pleased with his moral , as it took Ed in likewise ."
"`` That is the best of all , but it seems as if I never should get to it ."
"After Patience made Lucy sweet and cheerful , she began to have a curious power over those about her , and to work little miracles herself , though she did not know it ."
"The queen learned to love her so dearly she could not let her go ; she cheered up all her friends when they came with their small troubles ; the princes found bright eyes , willing hands , and a kind heart always at their service , and felt , without quite knowing why , that it was good for them to have a gentle little creature to care for ; so they softened their rough manners , loud voices , and careless ways , for her sake , and when it was proposed to take her away to her own home they could not give her up , but said she must stay longer , did n't they ? ''"
"`` I 'd like to see them saying anything else , '' said Frank , while Jack sat up to demand fiercely , -- `` Who talks about taking Jill away ? ''"
"`` Lucy 's mother thought she ought to go , and said so , but the queen told her how much good it did them all to have her there , and begged the dear woman to let her little cottage and come and be housekeeper in the palace , for the queen was getting lazy , and liked to sit and read , and talk and sew with Lucy , better than to look after things . ''"
`` And she said she would ? ''
"cried Jill , clasping her hands in her anxiety , for she had learned to love her cage now ."
`` Yes . ''
"Mrs. Minot had no time to say more , for one of the red slippers flew up in the air , and Jack had to clap both hands over his mouth to suppress the `` hurrah ! ''"
that nearly escaped .
"Frank said , `` That 's good ! ''"
"and nodded with his most cordial smile at Jill who pulled herself up with cheeks now as rosy as the red carnation , and a little catch in her breath as she said to herself , -- `` It 's too lovely to be true . ''"
"`` That 's a first-rate end to a very good story , '' began Jack , with grave decision , as he put on his slipper and sat up to pat Jill 's hand , wishing it was not quite so like a little claw ."
"`` That 's not the end ; '' and Mamma 's eyes laughed more than ever as three astonished faces turned to her , and three voices cried out , -- `` Still more ? ''"
`` The very best of all .
"Now here is a pleasant story about a boy who hurt his foot worse than you did yours ; read it , and see how bravely he bore his troubles . ''"
"She put that charming little book , `` The Crofton Boys , '' into his hands , and left him for an hour , passing in and out from time to time that he might not feel lonely ."
"Dan did not love to read , but soon got so interested that he was surprised when the boys came home ."
"Daisy brought him a nosegay of wild flowers , and Nan insisted on helping bring him his supper , as he lay on the sofa with the door open into the dining-room , so that he could see the lads at table , and they could nod socially to him over their bread and butter ."
"Mr. Bhaer carried him away to his bed early , and Teddy came in his night-gown to say good-night , for he went to his little nest with the birds ."
`` I want to say my prayers to Danny ; may I ? ''
"he asked ; and when his mother said , `` Yes , '' the little fellow knelt down by Dan 's bed , and folding his chubby hands , said softly , `` Pease Dod bess everybody , and hep me to be dood . ''"
Then he went away smiling with sleepy sweetness over his mother 's shoulder .
"But after the evening talk was done , the evening song sung , and the house grew still with beautiful Sunday silence , Dan lay in his pleasant room wide awake , thinking new thoughts , feeling new hopes and desires stirring in his boyish heart , for two good angels had entered in : love and gratitude began the work which time and effort were to finish ; and with an earnest wish to keep his first promise , Dan folded his hands together in the Darkness , and softly whispered Teddy 's little prayer , `` Please God bless every one , and help me to be good . ''"
CHAPTER XI .
"UNCLE TEDDY For a week Dan only moved from bed to sofa ; a long week and a hard one , for the hurt foot was very painful at times , the quiet days were very wearisome to the active lad , longing to be out enjoying the summer weather , and especially difficult was it to be patient ."
"But Dan did his best , and every one helped him in their various ways ; so the time passed , and he was rewarded at last by hearing the doctor say , on Saturday morning , `` This foot is doing better than I expected ."
"Give the lad the crutch this afternoon , and let him stump about the house a little . ''"
`` Hooray ! ''
"shouted Nat , and raced away to tell the other boys the good news ."
"Everybody was very glad , and after dinner the whole flock assembled to behold Dan crutch himself up and down the hall a few times before he settled in the porch to hold a sort of levee ."
"He was much pleased at the interest and good-will shown him , and brightened up more and more every minute ; for the boys came to pay their respects , the little girls fussed about him with stools and cushions , and Teddy watched over him as if he was a frail creature unable to do anything for himself ."
"They were still sitting and standing about the steps , when a carriage stopped at the gate , a hat was waved from it , and with a shout of `` Uncle Teddy !"
Uncle Teddy ! ''
Rob scampered down the avenue as fast as his short legs would carry him .
"All he boys but Dan ran after him to see who should be first to open the gate , and in a moment the carriage drove up with boys swarming all over it , while Uncle Teddy sat laughing in the midst , with his little daughter on his knee ."
"`` Stop the triumphal car and let Jupiter descend , '' he said , and jumping out ran up the steps to meet Mrs. Bhaer , who stood smiling and clapping her hands like a girl ."
"`` How goes it , Teddy ? ''"
"`` All right , Jo . ''"
"Then they shook hands , and Mr. Laurie put Bess into her aunt 's arms , saying , as the child hugged her tight , `` Goldilocks wanted to see you so much that I ran away with her , for I was quite pining for a sight of you myself ."
"We want to play with your boys for an hour or so , and to see how ` the old woman who lived in a shoe , and had so many children she did not know what to do , ' is getting on . ''"
`` I 'm so glad !
"Play away , and do n't get into mischief , '' answered Mrs. Jo , as the lads crowded round the pretty child , admiring her long golden hair , dainty dress , and lofty ways , for the little `` Princess , '' as they called her , allowed no one to kiss her , but sat smiling down upon them , and graciously patting their heads with her little , white hands ."
"They all adored her , especially Rob , who considered her a sort of doll , and dared not touch her lest she should break , but worshipped her at a respectful distance , made happy by an occasional mark of favor from her little highness ."
"As she immediately demanded to see Daisy 's kitchen , she was borne off by Mrs. Jo , with a train of small boys following ."
"The others , all but Nat and Demi , ran away to the menagerie and gardens to have all in order ; for Mr. Laurie always took a general survey , and looked disappointed if things were not flourishing ."
"Standing on the steps , he turned to Dan , saying like an old acquaintance , though he had only seen him once or twice before , `` How is the foot ? ''"
"""He's going to take us home,"" said Jane. ""Oh, he is a good dragon. I am glad!"""
"George was rather glad too, though neither of the children felt at all sure of their welcome, especially as their feet were wet, and they were bringing a strange dragon home with them."
"They went very fast, because dragons can go uphill as easily as down."
"You would not understand why if I told you because you are only in long division at present; yet if you want me to tell you, so that you can show off to other children, I will. It is because dragons can get their tails into the fourth dimension and hold on there, and when you can do that everything else is easy."
"The dragon went very fast, only stopping to eat the collector and the sportsman, who were still struggling to go up the slide vainly, because they had no tails, and had never even heard of the fourth dimension."
"When the dragon got to the end of the slide he crawled very slowly across the dark field beyond the field where there was a bonfire, next to the next-door garden at Forest Hill."
"He went slower and slower, and in the bonfire field he stopped altogether, and because the Arctic regions had not got down so far as that, and because the bonfire was very hot, the dragon began to melt and melt and melt and before the children knew what he was doing they found themselves sitting in a large pool of water, and their boots were as wet as wet, and there was not a bit of dragon left!"
So they went indoors.
"Of course some grown-up or other noticed at once that the boots of George and Jane were wet and muddy, and that they had both been sitting down in a very damp place, so they were sent to bed immediately."
"It was long past their time, anyhow."
"Now, if you are of an inquiring mind not at all a nice thing in a little child who reads fairy tales you will want to know how it is that since the sealskin dwarfs have all been killed, and the fires all been let out, the Aurora Borealis shines, on cold nights, as brightly as ever."
"My dear, I do not know! I am not too proud to own that there are some things I know nothing about and this is one of them. But I do know that whoever has lighted those fires again, it is certainly not the sealskin dwarfs. They were all eaten by moths and motheaten things are of no use, even to light fires!"
V. The Island of the Nine Whirlpools
"The dark arch that led to the witch's cave was hung with a black-and-yellow fringe of live snakes. As the Queen went in, keeping carefully in the middle of the arch, all the snakes lifted their wicked, flat heads and stared at her with their wicked, yellow eyes. You know it is not good manners to stare, even at Royalty, except of course for cats. And the snakes had been so badly brought up that they even put their tongues out at the poor lady. Nasty, thin, sharp tongues they were too."
"Now, the Queen's husband was, of course, the King. And besides being a King he was an enchanter, and considered to be quite at the top of his profession, so he was very wise, and he knew that when Kings and Queens want children, the Queen always goes to see a witch. So he gave the Queen the witch's address, and the Queen called on her, though she was very frightened and did not like it at all. The witch was sitting by a fire of sticks, stirring something bubbly in a shiny copper cauldron."
"""What do you want, my dear?"" she said to the Queen."
"""Oh, if you please,"" said the Queen, ""I want a baby a very nice one. We don't want any expense spared. My husband said """
"""Oh, yes,"" said the witch. ""I know all about him. And so you want a child? Do you know it will bring you sorrow?"""
"""It will bring me joy first,"" said the Queen."
"""Great sorrow,"" said the witch."
"""Greater joy,"" said the Queen."
"Then the witch said, ""Well, have your own way. I suppose it's as much as your place is worth to go back without it?"""
"""The King would be very much annoyed,"" said the poor Queen."
"""Well, well,"" said the witch. ""What will you give me for the child?"""
"""Anything you ask for, and all I have,"" said the Queen."
"""Then give me your gold crown."""
The Queen took it off quickly.
"""And your necklace of blue sapphires."""
The Queen unfastened it.
"""And your pearl bracelets."""
The Queen unclasped them.
"And she dragged the Rabbit out by one ear, and put him into the Boy's arms."
"That night, and for many nights after, the Velveteen Rabbit slept in the Boy's bed. At first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the Boy hugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and sometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the Rabbit could scarcely breathe. And he missed, too, those long moonlight hours in the nursery, when all the house was silent, and his talks with the Skin Horse. But very soon he grew to like it, for the Boy used to talk to him, and made nice tunnels for him under the bedclothes that he said were like the burrows the real rabbits lived in. And they had splendid games together, in whispers, when Nana had gone away to her supper and left the night-light burning on the mantelpiece. And when the Boy dropped off to sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close under his little warm chin and dream, with the Boy's hands clasped close round him all night long."
"And so time went on, and the little Rabbit was very happy-so happy that he never noticed how his beautiful velveteen fur was getting shabbier and shabbier, and his tail becoming unsewn, and all the pink rubbed off his nose where the Boy had kissed him."
"Spring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever the Boy went the Rabbit went too. He had rides in the wheelbarrow, and picnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built for him under the raspberry canes behind the flower border. And once, when the Boy was called away suddenly to go out to tea, the Rabbit was left out on the lawn until long after dusk, and Nana had to come and look for him with the candle because the Boy couldn't go to sleep unless he was there."
"He was wet through with the dew and quite earthy from diving into the burrows the Boy had made for him in the flower bed, and Nana grumbled as she rubbed him off with a corner of her apron."
Spring Time
"""You must have your old Bunny!"" she said. ""Fancy all that fuss for a toy!"""
The Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands.
"""Give me my Bunny!"" he said. ""You mustn't say that. He isn't a toy."
"He's REAL!"""
"When the little Rabbit heard that he was happy, for he knew that what the Skin Horse had said was true at last. The nursery magic had happened to him, and he was a toy no longer. He was Real. The Boy himself had said it."
"That night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love stirred in his little sawdust heart that it almost burst. And into his boot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a look of wisdom and beauty, so that even Nana noticed it next morning when she picked him up, and said, ""I declare if that old Bunny hasn't got quite a knowing expression!"""
That was a wonderful Summer!
"Near the house where they lived there was a wood, and in the long June evenings the Boy liked to go there after tea to play. He took the Velveteen Rabbit with him, and before he wandered off to pick flowers, or play at brigands among the trees, he always made the Rabbit a little nest somewhere among the bracken, where he would be quite cosy, for he was a kind-hearted little boy and he liked Bunny to be comfortable. One evening, while the Rabbit was lying there alone, watching the ants that ran to and fro between his velvet paws in the grass, he saw two strange beings creep out of the tall bracken near him."
"They were rabbits like himself, but quite furry and brand-new. They must have been very well made, for their seams didn't show at all, and they changed shape in a queer way when they moved; one minute they were long and thin and the next minute fat and bunchy, instead of always staying the same like he did. Their feet padded softly on the ground, and they crept quite close to him, twitching their noses, while the Rabbit stared hard to see which side the clockwork stuck out, for he knew that people who jump generally have something to wind them up. But he couldn't see it. They were evidently a new kind of rabbit altogether."
Summer Days
"They stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the time their noses twitched."
"""Why don't you get up and play with us?"" one of them asked."
"""I don't feel like it,"" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain that he had no clockwork."
"""Ho!"" said the furry rabbit. ""It's as easy as anything,"" And he gave a big hop sideways and stood on his hind legs."
"""I don't believe you can!"" he said."
"""I can!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I can jump higher than anything!"" He meant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn't want to say so."
"""Can you hop on your hind legs?"" asked the furry rabbit."
"That was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no hind legs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a pincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other rabbits wouldn't notice."
"""I don't want to!"" he said again."
But the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. And this one stretched out his neck and looked.
"""He hasn't got any hind legs!"" he called out. ""Fancy a rabbit without any hind legs!"" And he began to laugh."
"""I have!"" cried the little Rabbit. ""I have got hind legs! I am sitting on them!"""
"""Then stretch them out and show me, like this!"" said the wild rabbit."
"And he began to whirl round and dance, till the little Rabbit got quite dizzy."
"""I don't like dancing,"" he said. ""I'd rather sit still!"""
"But all the while he was longing to dance, for a funny new tickly feeling ran through him, and he felt he would give anything in the world to be able to jump about like these rabbits did."
"""What would I have done without your help?"" she said. ""I was so dreadfully frightened. Don't you see how my paws are shaking still?"" And she held out the prettiest little paws imaginable for him to see."
"Then Mr. Red Squirrel's heart began to thump very fast and hard beneath the white fur of his chest, and he sighed softly. ""I wish I might always help you and protect you,"" he said; ""but I suppose there are better fellows than I who want to do that."" And he sighed again."
"""Yes, they might want to,"" she said, looking away from him and acting as though she saw another Blue Jay coming."
"""You wouldn't be my little wife, would you?"" he asked, coming nearer to her."
"""Why I might!"" she answered, with a saucy flirt of her tail, and she scampered away as fast as she could. Do you think Mr. Red Squirrel stopped then to eat his fat kernel of yellow corn? Or do you think he waited to see whether the Blue Jays were around? No, indeed! He followed as fast as his legs could carry him from tree to tree, from branch to branch, and it was not until he had reached the top of a tall beech that he overtook his little sweetheart. They were still there when the Gray Squirrel happened along in the afternoon."
"""Ah!"" said he, squinting at Mr. Red Squirrel, for his eyes were poor."
"""You are getting acquainted, are you? Pleasant society here. The Squirrel set is very select. You must meet some of our young people."
"Suppose you will begin housekeeping one of these days?"""
"""I have done so already, sir,"" answered Mr. Red Squirrel, although his wife was nudging him with one paw and motioning him to keep quiet. ""Mrs."
"Red Squirrel and I will build our round home in the top fork of this tree. We shall be pleased to have you call when we are settled."""
"""Is that so?"" exclaimed the Gray Squirrel. ""I did not know that you were married. I thought you came alone to the forest."""
"""This is my wife, sir,"" said Mr. Red Squirrel, and the Gray Squirrel made his very best bow and looked at her as sharply as his poor eyes would let him."
"""I think I must have seen you somewhere,"" he said; ""your face is very familiar."" And he scratched his poor old puzzled head with one claw."
"""Why, Cousin Gray Squirrel, don't you know Bushy-tail?"" she cried. ""You lived the next tree to mine all winter."""
"""To be sure!"" he exclaimed. ""But isn't your marriage rather sudden?"""
"""No,"" she said, blushing under her fur. ""We have always liked each other, although we never spoke until this morning. I used to scamper along the rail fence to see Mr. Red Squirrel in his cage."""
"""Did you truly come for that?"" asked her husband, after their caller had gone."
"""I truly did,"" she answered, ""but I never expected anybody to know it."
"You poor fellow! I felt so sorry for you. I would have given every nut I had to set you free."""
"They were a very happy couple, and the next fall the Gray Squirrel watched them and their children gathering nuts for their winter stores."
"Mr. Red Squirrel, as the head of the family, planned the work, yet each did his share. The nuts were not yet ripe, and they gnawed off the stems, then came to the ground, filled their cheek-pockets with the fallen nuts, and scampered off to hide them in many places. They were stored in tree-hollows, under the rustling leaves which strewed the ground, in the cracks of old logs, beneath brush-heaps, and in holes in the ground."
"""Don't stop to think how many you need,"" said the little mother to her children. ""Get every nut you can. It may be a very long winter."""
"""And if you don't eat them all,"" said their hard-working father with a twinkle in his eyes, ""you may want to drop a few down to some poor fellow who has none. That was your mother's way."""
"""When was it her way? What makes you smile when you say it? Mother, what does he mean?"" cried the young Red Squirrels all in a breath."
"""I gave some nuts to a hungry Squirrel once,"" she said, ""and he was so grateful that he drove the Blue Jays away when they tried to rob me."""
"But she looked so happy as she spoke that the children knew there was more to the story. They dared not tease her to tell, so they whispered among themselves and wondered what their father meant."
"As they gathered nuts near the Gray Squirrel, he motioned them to come close. ""S-sh!"" said he. ""Don't tell it from me, but I think the poor hungry fellow was your father, and it was a lucky thing for you that she had enough to give away."""
"""Do you suppose that was it?"" the young Red Squirrels whispered to each other. ""Do you really suppose so?"""
THE BIGGEST LITTLE RABBIT LEARNS TO SEE
"Seven little Rabbits lay on their nest at the bottom of the burrow, and wriggled and squirmed and pushed their soft noses against each other all day long. Life was very easy for them, and they were contented. The first thing that they remembered was lying on their bed of fur, hay, and dried leaves, and feeling a great, warm, soft Something close beside them. After a while they learned that this Something was their Mamma Rabbit. It was she who had gotten the nest ready for them and lined it with fur that she tore from her own breast. She didn't care so much about looking beautiful as she did about making her babies comfortable."
"It was their Mamma Rabbit, too, who fed them with warm milk from her own body until they should be old enough to go out of the burrow. Then they would nibble bark and tender young shoots from the roots of the trees, and all the fresh, green, growing things that Rabbits like. She used to tell them about this food, and they wondered and wondered how it would taste. They began to feel very big and strong now. The soft fur was growing on their naked little bodies and covering even the soles of their feet. It was growing inside their cheeks, too, and that made them feel important, for Papa Rabbit said that he did not know any other animals that had fur inside their cheeks. He said it was something to be very proud of, so they were very proud, although why one should want fur inside of one's cheeks it would be hard to say."
"When Mr. Red Squirrel first came to the forest, he knew nothing of the way in which they do, and he afterward said that learning forest manners was even harder than running away from his old home. You see, Mr. Red Squirrel was born in the forest, but was carried away from there when he was only a baby. From that time until he was grown, he had never set claw upon a tree, and all he could see of the world he had seen by peeping through the bars of a cage. His cousins in the forest learned to frisk along the fence-tops and to jump from one swaying branch to another, but when this poor little fellow longed for a scamper he could only run around and around in a wire wheel that hummed as it turned, and this made him very dizzy."
"He used to wonder if there were nothing better in life, for he had been taken from his woodland home when he was too young to remember about it."
"One day he saw another Squirrel outside, a dainty little one who looked as though she had never a sad thought. That made him care more than ever to be free, and when he curled down in his cotton nest that night he dreamed about her, and that they were eating acorns together in a tall oak tree."
"The next day Mr. Red Squirrel pretended to be sick. He would not run in the wheel or taste the food in his cage. When his master came to look at him, he moaned pitifully and would not move one leg. His master thought that the leg was broken, and took limp little Mr. Red Squirrel in his hand to the window to see what was the matter. The window was up, and when he saw his chance, Mr. Red Squirrel leaped into the open air and was away to the forest. His poor legs were weak from living in such a small cage, but how he ran! His heart thumped wildly under the soft fur of his chest, and his breath came in quick gasps, and still he ran, leaping, scrambling, and sometimes falling, but always nearer the great green trees of his birthplace."
"At last he was safe and sat trembling on the lowest branch of a beech-tree. The forest was a new world to him and he asked many questions of a fat, old Gray Squirrel. The Gray Squirrel was one of those people who know a great deal and think that they know a great, great deal, and want others to think so too. He was so very knowing and important that, although he answered all of Mr. Red Squirrel's questions, he really did not tell him any of the things which he most wanted to know, and this is the way in which they talked:"
"""What is the name of this place?"" asked Mr. Red Squirrel."
"""This? Why this is the forest, of course,"" answered the Gray Squirrel."
"""We have no other name for it. It is possible that there are other forests in the world, but they cannot be so fine as this, so we call ours 'the forest.'"""
"""Are there pleasant neighbors here?"" asked Mr. Red Squirrel."
"""Very good, very good. My wife and I do not call on many of them, but still they are good enough people, I think."""
"""Then why don't you call?"""
"""Why? Why? Because they are not in our set. It would never do."" And the Gray Squirrel sat up very straight indeed."
"""Who is that gliding fellow on the ground below?"" asked the newcomer."
"""Is he one of your friends?"""
"""That? That is the Rattlesnake. We never speak to each other. There has always been trouble between our families."""
"""Who lives in that hollow tree yonder?"""
"""Sh, sh! That is where the Great Horned Owl has his home. He is asleep now and must not be awakened, for Squirrels and Owls cannot be friendly."""
"""Why not?"""
"""Because. It has always been so."""
"""And who is that bird just laying an egg in her nest above us?"""
"""Speak softly, please. That is the Cowbird, and it is not her nest. You will get into trouble if you talk such things aloud. She can't help it."
"She has to lay her eggs in other birds' nests, but they don't like it."""
"Mr. Red Squirrel tried very hard to find out the reason for this, but there are always some things for which no reason can be given; and there are many questions which can never be answered, even if one were to ask, ""Why? why? why?"" all day long. So Mr. Red Squirrel, being a wise little fellow, stopped asking, and thought by using his eyes and ears he would in time learn all that he needed to know. He had good eyes and keen ears, and he learned very fast without making many mistakes. He had a very happy life among the forest people, and perhaps that was one reason. He learned not to say things which made his friends feel badly, and he did not ask needless questions. And after all, you know, it would have been very foolish to ask questions which nobody could answer, and worse than foolish to ask about matters which he could find out for himself."
"It is in the forest as in the world outside. We can know that many things are, but we never know why they are."
WHY MR GREAT HORNED OWL HATCHED THE EGGS
"If the Rattlesnake is the king of the forest in the daytime, the Great Horned Owl is the king at night. Indeed, he is much the more powerful of the two, for he is king of air and earth alike and can go wherever he wishes, while the snake can only rule over those who live near the ground or who are so careless as to come to him there."
"There was but one pair of Great Horned Owls in the forest, and they lived in the deepest shade, having their great clumsy nest in the hollow of a tall tree. You might have walked past it a hundred times and never have guessed that any Owls lived there, if you did not notice the round pellets of bone and hair on the grass. They are such hungry fellows that they swallow their food with the bones in it. Then their tough little stomachs go to work, rolling all the pieces of bone and hair into balls and sending them back to be cast out of the Owls' mouths to the ground."
"The Great Horned Owl was a very large bird. His whole body was covered with brown, dull yellow, and white feathers. Even his feet and legs were covered, and all that you could see besides were his black claws and his black hooked bill. Yes, at night you could see his eyes, too, and they were wonderful great eyes that could see in the dark, but they were shut in the daytime when he was resting. His wife, who was the queen of the forest at night, looked exactly like him, only she was larger than he. And that is the way among Owls, the wife is always larger than her husband."
"Every night when the sun had gone down, the Great Horned Owl and his wife would come out of their hollow tree and sit blinking on a branch near by, waiting until it got dark enough for them to see quite plainly."
"As the light faded, the little black spots in their eyes would grow bigger and bigger, and then off they would go on their great soft, noiseless wings, hunting in the grass and among the branches for the supper which they called breakfast."
"Mrs. Owl could not be gone very long at a time, for there were two large round white eggs in the nest which must not get cold. Her husband was on the wing most of the night, and he often flew home with some tender morsel for her. He was really a kind-hearted fellow, although you could never have made the small birds think so. Sometimes his wife would sigh and tell how tired she was of sitting still, and how glad she would be when the eggs were hatched and she could go more with him. When she began to speak of that, the Great Horned Owl would get ready for another flight and go off saying: ""It is too bad. I am so sorry for you. But then, one would never have young Owlets if one didn't stick to the nest."" He was always proud of his children, and he thought himself a very good husband. Perhaps he was; still he had never taken his place on the nest while his wife went hunting."
"Now the other forest people would have liked to watch the Bat longer, but after the Ground Hog had gone off in this way, they thought it would show too much curiosity if they stayed. So one after another went away, and the little Bat was left alone. He fluttered around until he reached the branch where the Blue Jay had been, and there he hung himself up to wait until night."
"""Oh dear!"" he said, ""I wonder how long a day is. I am hot and blind and sleepy, and if any more of the forest people come and talk about me, I don't know what I shall do. They don't think me good-looking because my wings grow to my legs. I only wish I could see what they look like. I believe they are just as homely."""
"And then, because he was a very tired little Bat, and cross, as people always are when they have done wrong, he began to blame somebody else for all his trouble."
"""If my father and mother had cared very much about me,"" he said, ""they would never have let me stay up all day. Guess if I were a big Bat and had little Bats of my own, I'd take better care of them!"" But that is always the way, and when, long afterward, he was a big Bat with little Bats of his own, he was a much wiser person."
A SWARM LEAVES THE BEE TREE
"The old Bee tree was becoming very crowded and the Queen-Mother grew restless. There were many things to make her so. In the tree were thousands of cells made ready for her eggs, and she had been busy for days putting one in each. In the larger cells she laid eggs that would hatch out Drones, and in the smaller ones she laid Worker eggs. She never laid any Queen eggs. Perhaps she did not want any Queens among her children, for there can never be two Queens in one swarm, and when a new one is hatched, the Queen-Mother has to go away and find another home."
That is a law among the Bees.
"The Workers, however, knew that there must be young Queens growing up all the time. Supposing something should happen to the Queen-Mother, what would become of the swarm if there were nobody to lay eggs? So after she had laid several thousand Worker eggs, and it was time for the young ones to hatch, they decided to change some of the babies into young Queens. And this was easy enough. When they were out for honey, they filled the pockets on their hind legs with pollen, the yellow dust that is found in flowers. This was to be mixed with honey and water and made into bread for the babies, who were now awake, and looked like tiny white worms in the bottom of their cells. Then they made some that was almost like sour jelly, and put it in a few of the Worker cells for the tiny white worms, or Larvæ, to eat. The Larvæ that eat this jelly grow up to be Queens, and can lay eggs. Those that eat the common bread are either Drones or Workers, whichever their mother had planned them to be."
"After the Larvæ were five or six days old, the Workers shut them up in their cells and stopped feeding them. That was because the Larvæ had other things to do than eat. They had to spin their cocoons, and lie in them until they were grown and ready to come out among the older Bees."
"When a Larva, or Bee baby, has finished its cocoon, and is lying inside, it is called a Pupa, and when a Pupa is full grown and has torn its way out of the cocoon and wax, it is called a Drone, or a Worker, or a Queen."
"Now the Queen-Mother was restless. She could hear the young Queens piping in their cells, and she knew that they wanted to come out and drive her away. She wanted to get to them and stop their piping, but the Workers stood in her way and prevented her. They knew it would not be well for the Queen-Mother to meet her royal children, and when these children tried to come out the Workers covered the doors of their cells with another layer of wax, leaving little holes where they could put out their tongues and be fed."
"This made the Queen-Mother more restless than ever. ""If I cannot do as I wish to with my own children,"" she said, ""I will leave the tree."" And she began walking back and forth as fast as she could, and talked a great deal, and acted almost wild with impatience. The Workers saw how she felt, and part of them decided to go with her. When a Worker made up her mind to go with the Queen-Mother, she showed it by also acting wild and walking back and forth, and talking a great deal, sometimes fluttering her wings very fast. Then she would go for honey, because when Bees are about to swarm they fill their honey-pockets just as full as they can. At times the Queen-Mother would be quiet, and you might almost think that she had given up going. Then suddenly she would grow restless again, and all the Workers who were going with her would act as she did, and they would get so warm with excitement that the air in the tree became quite hot."
"At last the Queen-Mother thought it time to start, and her followers came around her in the tree, and were very still for a minute. Several of the Workers had been flying in circles around the tree, and now they came to the doorway and called. Then all came out, and hovered in the air a few minutes before stopping to rest on a bush near by. When they rested, the first Bee held on to the bush, the next Bee held on to her, and that was the way they did until they were all clinging tightly together in a squirming, dark-brown mass."
"Ah, then the Queen-Mother was happy! She felt that she was young again, and she thought, ""How they love me, these dear Workers!"" She stroked her body with her legs to make herself as fine as possible, and she noticed, with pleasure, how slender she was growing. ""I had thought I should never fly again,"" she said, ""yet this is delightful. I believe I will go off by myself for a little while."""
So she flew off by herself and was talking rather airily to a Butterfly when two of the Workers came after her.
"""You may return to the rest,"" she said in a queenly way, as she motioned to them with her feelers. ""I will come by and by."""
"""No,"" said they, ""you must come at once or we shall all go back to the Bee tree. You must stay with us. You must do your part as it should be done."" And she had to go, for she knew in her heart that Queens have to obey the law as well as other people."
"After she had hung with the Workers on the bush for some time, the ones who had gone ahead to find a new home for the swarm came back and gave the signal for the rest to follow. They went to an old log near the river-bank, and here they began the real work. Crawling through an opening at one end, they found a roomy place within, and commenced to clean house at once."
"""If there is anything I do like,"" said a Worker, as she dropped a splinter of rotten wood outside the door, ""it is house-cleaning."""
"""So do I,"" said her sister. ""But what a fuss the Drones always make when we try to do anything of the sort! A pretty-looking home we'd have if they took care of it!"""
"""I'm glad none of them came with us to this place,"" said the first Worker. ""I guess they knew they were not wanted."""
"""There, there!"" said the Queen-Mother, coming up to where they were; ""you must not talk in that way. It may be that you would rather do without Drones, and perhaps they would rather do without you; but I need you both and I will not have any quarreling."" When she said this she walked away with her head in the air, and the Workers did not scold any more. They knew that she was right, and, after all, she was their Queen, even if she did have to obey the laws."
"Next they got varnish from the buds of poplar trees and varnished over all the cracks and little holes in the walls of their home, leaving open only the place where they were to go in and out. They also covered with varnish a few heavy fragments of wood that lay on the floor of their home, and when this task was done it was all in order and ready for the furniture, that is, the comb."
"You know how the comb looks, and you know how they get the wax from which to make it, but unless you are acquainted with the Bees, and have seen them at work, you have no idea what busy creatures they are. The Queen-Mother, as soon as the cells were ready and she could begin laying eggs again, was as contented and happy as ever."
"One day, when she was walking around a corner of the comb, she ran against a sad and discouraged-looking Worker. ""Why, what is the matter?"""
"said she, kindly. ""Are you sick?"""
"""No,"" answered the Worker. ""I'm not sick and I'm not tired, only I want to get through."""
"""Through with what?"" asked the Queen."
"""With work! It is clean house, varnish the walls, make wax, build combs, get honey, make bread and jelly, and feed the babies. And when they get old enough they'll have to clean house, varnish the walls, make wax, build combs, get honey, make bread and jelly, and feed the babies. I want to know when it is going to stop, and Bees can spend their time in play."""
"""Never,"" said the Queen-Mother; and she spoke very gently, for she saw that the Worker was crazy. ""It will never stop. If you had nothing to do but play all your life you would soon want to die, and you ought to, for there is no place in this world for idlers. You know that after a while the Drones die because they do nothing, and it is right they should."""
"""Don't you ever get tired of your eggs?"" asked the Worker."
"""Now the time is up,"" bawled the King; ""come hither, headsman, and take off his head."""
"""Nay, nay!"" said the lad; ""stop a bit, there are still three minutes!"
"Out with the key, and let me get into this house."""
"But there stood the King and fumbled with his keys, to draw out the time. At last he said he hadn't any key."
"""Well, if you haven't, I have,"" said the lad, as he gave the door such a kick that it flew to splinters inwards on the floor."
"At the door the Princess met him, and told her father this was her deliverer, on whom her heart was set. So she had him; and this was how the beggar boy came to marry the daughter of the King of Arabia."
PRINCE LINDWORM
"Once upon a time, there was a fine young King who was married to the loveliest of Queens. They were exceedingly happy, all but for one thing they had no children. And this often made them both sad, because the Queen wanted a dear little child to play with, and the King wanted an heir to the kingdom."
"One day the Queen went out for a walk by herself, and she met an ugly old woman. The old woman was just like a witch: but she was a nice kind of witch, not the cantankerous sort. She said, ""Why do you look so doleful, pretty lady?"" ""It's no use my telling you,"" answered the Queen, ""nobody in the world can help me."" ""Oh, you never know,"""
"said the old woman. ""Just you let me hear what your trouble is, and maybe I can put things right."""
"""My dear woman, how can you?"" said the Queen: and she told her, ""The King and I have no children: that's why I am so distressed."" ""Well, you needn't be,"" said the old witch. ""I can set that right in a twinkling, if only you will do exactly as I tell you. Listen."
"To-night, at sunset, take a little drinking-cup with two ears"" (that is, handles), ""and put it bottom upwards on the ground in the north-west corner of your garden. Then go and lift it up to-morrow morning at sunrise, and you will find two roses underneath it, one red and one white. If you eat the red rose, a little boy will be born to you: if you eat the white rose, a little girl will be sent. But, whatever you do, you mustn't eat both the roses, or you'll be sorry, that I warn you! Only one: remember that!"" ""Thank you a thousand times,"" said the Queen, ""this is good news indeed!"" And she wanted to give the old woman her gold ring; but the old woman wouldn't take it."
"So the Queen went home and did as she had been told: and next morning at sunrise she stole out into the garden and lifted up the little drinking-cup. She was surprised, for indeed she had hardly expected to see anything. But there were the two roses underneath it, one red and one white. And now she was dreadfully puzzled, for she did not know which to choose. ""If I choose the red one,"" she thought, ""and I have a little boy, he may grow up and go to the wars and get killed."
"But if I choose the white one, and have a little girl, she will stay at home awhile with us, but later on she will get married and go away and leave us. So, whichever it is, we may be left with no child after all."""
"However, at last she decided on the white rose, and she ate it. And it tasted so sweet, that she took and ate the red one too: without ever remembering the old woman's solemn warning."
"Some time after this, the King went away to the wars: and while he was still away, the Queen became the mother of twins. One was a lovely baby-boy, and the other was a Lindworm, or Serpent. She was terribly frightened when she saw the Lindworm, but he wriggled away out of the room, and nobody seemed to have seen him but herself: so that she thought it must have been a dream. The baby Prince was so beautiful and so healthy, the Queen was full of joy: and likewise, as you may suppose, was the King when he came home and found his son and heir. Not a word was said by anyone about the Lindworm: only the Queen thought about it now and then."
"Many days and years passed by, and the baby grew up into a handsome young Prince, and it was time that he got married. The King sent him off to visit foreign kingdoms, in the Royal coach, with six white horses, to look for a Princess grand enough to be his wife. But at the very first cross-roads, the way was stopped by an enormous Lindworm, enough to frighten the bravest. He lay in the middle of the road with a great wide open mouth, and cried, ""A bride for me before a bride for you!"" Then the Prince made the coach turn round and try another road: but it was all no use. For, at the first cross-ways, there lay the Lindworm again, crying out, ""A bride for me before a bride for you!"" So the Prince had to turn back home again to the Castle, and give up his visits to the foreign kingdoms. And his mother, the Queen, had to confess that what the Lindworm said was true. For he was really the eldest of her twins: and so he ought to have a wedding first."
"There seemed nothing for it but to find a bride for the Lindworm, if his younger brother, the Prince, were to be married at all. So the King wrote to a distant country, and asked for a Princess to marry his son (but, of course, he didn't say which son), and presently a Princess arrived. But she wasn't allowed to see her bridegroom until he stood by her side in the great hall and was married to her, and then, of course, it was too late for her to say she wouldn't have him."
But next morning the Princess had disappeared. The Lindworm lay sleeping all alone: and it was quite plain that he had eaten her.
"A little while after, the Prince decided that he might now go journeying again in search of a Princess. And off he drove in the Royal chariot with the six white horses. But at the first cross-ways, there lay the Lindworm, crying with his great wide open mouth, ""A bride for me before a bride for you!"" So the carriage tried another road, and the same thing happened, and they had to turn back again this time, just as formerly. And the King wrote to several foreign countries, to know if anyone would marry his son. At last another Princess arrived, this time from a very far distant land. And, of course, she was not allowed to see her future husband before the wedding took place, and then, lo and behold! it was the Lindworm who stood at her side. And next morning the Princess had disappeared:"
and the Lindworm lay sleeping all alone; and it was quite clear that he had eaten her.
"By and by the Prince started on his quest for the third time: and at the first cross-roads there lay the Lindworm with his great wide open mouth, demanding a bride as before. And the Prince went straight back to the castle, and told the King: ""You must find another bride for my elder brother."""
"""I don't know where I am to find her,"" said the King, ""I have already made enemies of two great Kings who sent their daughters here as brides: and I have no notion how I can obtain a third lady. People are beginning to say strange things, and I am sure no Princess will dare to come."""
"Now, down in a little cottage near a wood, there lived the King's shepherd, an old man with his only daughter. And the King came one day and said to him, ""Will you give me your daughter to marry my son the Lindworm? And I will make you rich for the rest of your life."" ""No, sire,"" said the shepherd, ""that I cannot do. She is my only child, and I want her to take care of me when I am old. Besides, if the Lindworm would not spare two beautiful Princesses, he won't spare her either. He will just gobble her up: and she is much too good for such a fate."""
"But the King wouldn't take ""No"" for an answer: and at last the old man had to give in."
"Well, when the old shepherd told his daughter that she was to be Prince Lindworm's bride, she was utterly in despair. She went out into the woods, crying and wringing her hands and bewailing her hard fate. And while she wandered to and fro, an old witch-woman suddenly appeared out of a big hollow oak-tree, and asked her, ""Why do you look so doleful, pretty lass?"" The shepherd-girl said, ""It's no use my telling you, for nobody in the world can help me."" ""Oh, you never know,"" said the old woman. ""Just you let me hear what your trouble is, and maybe I can put things right."" ""Ah, how can you?"" said the girl, ""For I am to be married to the King's eldest son, who is a Lindworm. He has already married two beautiful Princesses, and devoured them: and he will eat me too! No wonder I am distressed."""
"""Well, you needn't be,"" said the witch-woman. ""All that can be set right in a twinkling: if only you will do exactly as I tell you."" So the girl said she would."
"""Listen, then,"" said the old woman. ""After the marriage ceremony is over, and when it is time for you to retire to rest, you must ask to be dressed in ten snow-white shifts. And you must then ask for a tub full of lye,"" (that is, washing water prepared with wood-ashes) ""and a tub full of fresh milk, and as many whips as a boy can carry in his arms, and have all these brought into your bed-chamber. Then, when the Lindworm tells you to shed a shift, do you bid him slough a skin. And when all his skins are off, you must dip the whips in the lye and whip him; next, you must wash him in the fresh milk; and, lastly, you must take him and hold him in your arms, if it's only for one moment."""
"""The last is the worst notion ugh!"" said the shepherd's daughter, and she shuddered at the thought of holding the cold, slimy, scaly Lindworm."
"""Do just as I have said, and all will go well,"" said the old woman."
Then she disappeared again in the oak-tree.
"When the wedding-day arrived, the girl was fetched in the Royal chariot with the six white horses, and taken to the castle to be decked as a bride. And she asked for ten snow-white shifts to be brought her, and the tub of lye, and the tub of milk, and as many whips as a boy could carry in his arms. The ladies and courtiers in the castle thought, of course, that this was some bit of peasant superstition, all rubbish and nonsense. But the King said, ""Let her have whatever she asks for."" She was then arrayed in the most wonderful robes, and looked the loveliest of brides. She was led to the hall where the wedding ceremony was to take place, and she saw the Lindworm for the first time as he came in and stood by her side. So they were married, and a great wedding-feast was held, a banquet fit for the son of a king."
"The white-winged horse flew around and around the Dragon as he writhed on the dry pebbles. He was getting very hot: indeed, parts of him even had begun to smoke. He knew that he must certainly catch fire in another minute unless he could get under a tree. He made a snatch with his red claws at the King and Hippogriff, but he was too feeble to reach them, and besides, he did not dare to overexert himself for fear he should get any hotter."
"It was then that he saw The Book of Beasts lying on the pebbles, open at the page with ""Dragon"" written at the bottom. He looked and he hesitated, and he looked again, and then, with one last squirm of rage, the Dragon wriggled himself back into the picture and sat down under the palm tree, and the page was a little singed as he went in."
"As soon as Lionel saw that the Dragon had really been obliged to go and sit under his own palm tree because it was the only tree there, he jumped off his horse and shut the book with a bang."
"""Oh, hurrah!"" he cried. ""Now we really have done it."""
And he clasped the book very tightly with the turquoise and ruby clasps.
"""Oh, my precious Hippogriff,"" he cried. ""You are the bravest, dearest, most beautiful """
"""Hush,"" whispered the Hippogriff modestly. ""Don't you see that we are not alone?"""
"And indeed there was quite a crowd round them on the Pebbly Waste: the Prime Minister and the Parliament and the Soccer Players and the Orphanage and the Manticora and the Rocking Horse, and indeed everyone who had been eaten by the Dragon. You see, it was impossible for the Dragon to take them into the book with him it was a tight fit even for one Dragon so, of course, he had to leave them outside."
"They all got home somehow, and all lived happy ever after."
"When the King asked the Manticora where he would like to live he begged to be allowed to go back into the book. ""I do not care for public life,"""
he said.
"Of course he knew his way onto his own page, so there was no danger of his opening the book at the wrong page and letting out a Dragon or anything. So he got back into his picture and has never come out since:"
"That is why you will never see a Manticora as long as you live, except in a picture-book. And of course he left the kitties outside, because there was no room for them in the book and the milk cans too."
"Then the Rocking Horse begged to be allowed to go and live on the Hippogriff's page of the book. ""I should like,"" he said, ""to live somewhere where Dragons can't get at me."""
"So the beautiful, white-winged Hippogriff showed him the way in, and there he stayed till the King had him taken out for his great-great-great-great-grandchildren to play with."
"As for the Hippogriff, he accepted the position of the King's Own Rocking Horse a situation left vacant by the retirement of the wooden one. And the Blue Bird and the Butterfly sing and flutter among the lilies and roses of the Palace garden to this very day."
"II. Uncle James, or The Purple Stranger"
The Princess and the gardener's boy were playing in the backyard.
"""What will you do when you grow up, Princess?"" asked the gardener's boy."
"""I should like to marry you, Tom,"" said the Princess. ""Would you mind?"""
"""No,"" said the gardener's boy. ""I shouldn't mind much. I'll marry you if you like if I have time."""
"For the gardener's boy meant, as soon as he was grown up, to be a general and a poet and a Prime Minister and an admiral and a civil engineer. Meanwhile, he was top of all his classes at school, and tip-top of the geography class."
"As for the Princess Mary Ann, she was a very good little girl, and everyone loved her. She was always kind and polite, even to her Uncle James and to other people whom she did not like very much; and though she was not very clever, for a Princess, she always tried to do her lessons. Even if you know perfectly well that you can't do your lessons, you may as well try, and sometimes you find that by some fortunate accident they really are done. Then the Princess had a truly good heart: She was always kind to her pets. She never slapped her hippopotamus when it broke her dolls in its playful gambols, and she never forgot to feed her rhinoceroses in their little hutch in the backyard. Her elephant was devoted to her, and sometimes Mary Ann made her nurse quite cross by smuggling the dear little thing up to bed with her and letting it go to sleep with its long trunk laid lovingly across her throat, and its pretty head cuddled under the Royal right ear."
"When the Princess had been good all through the week for, like all real, live, nice children, she was sometimes naughty, but never bad Nurse would allow her to ask her little friends to come on Wednesday morning early and spend the day, because Wednesday is the end of the week in that country. Then, in the afternoon, when all the little dukes and duchesses and marquises and countesses had finished their rice pudding and had had their hands and faces washed after it, Nurse would say: ""Now, my dears, what would you like to do this afternoon?"" just as if she didn't know. And the answer would be always the same:"
"""Oh, do let's go to the Zoological Gardens and ride on the big guinea pig and feed the rabbits and hear the dormouse asleep."""
"So their pinafores were taken off and they all went to the Zoological Gardens, where twenty of them could ride at a time on the guinea pig, and where even the little ones could feed the great rabbits if some grown-up person were kind enough to lift them up for the purpose."
"There always was some such person, because in Rotundia everybody was kind except one."
"Now that you have read as far as this you know, of course, that the Kingdom of Rotundia was a very remarkable place; and if you are a thoughtful child as of course you are you will not need me to tell you what was the most remarkable thing about it. But in case you are not a thoughtful child and it is just possible of course that you are not I will tell you at once what that most remarkable thing was. All the animals were the wrong sizes! And this was how it happened."
"In old, old, olden times, when all our world was just loose earth and air and fire and water mixed up anyhow like a pudding, and spinning around like mad trying to get the different things to settle into their proper places, a round piece of earth got loose and went spinning away by itself across the water, which was just beginning to try to get spread out smooth into a real sea. And as the great round piece of earth flew away, going around and around as hard as it could, it met a long piece of hard rock that had got loose from another part of the puddingy mixture, and the rock was so hard, and was going so fast, that it ran its point through the round piece of earth and stuck out on the other side of it, so that the two together were like a very-very-much-too-big spinning top."
"I am afraid all this is very dull, but you know geography is never quite lively, and after all, I must give you a little information even in a fairy tale like the powder in jam."
"Well, when the pointed rock smashed into the round bit of earth the shock was so great that it set them spinning together through the air which was just getting into its proper place, like all the rest of the things only, as luck would have it, they forgot which way around they had been going, and began to spin around the wrong way. Presently Center of Gravity a great giant who was managing the whole business woke up in the middle of the earth and began to grumble."
"It looked odd to the English, of course, to see him come into the royal presence, and, leaning his wet umbrella up against the throne, ask the king, ""How's trade?"""
"Franklin never put on any frills, but he was not afraid of a crowned head. He used to say, frequently, that a king to him was no more than a seven-spot."
"He did his best to prevent the Revolutionary War, but he couldn't do it."
"Patrick Henry had said that the war was inevitable, and had given it permission to come, and it came."
"He also went to Paris, and got acquainted with a few crowned heads there. They thought a good deal of him in Paris, and offered him a corner lot if he would build there and start a paper. They also promised him the county printing; but he said, No, he would have to go back to America or his wife might get uneasy about him. Franklin wrote ""Poor Richard's Almanac"" in 1732 to 1757, and it was republished in England."
"Franklin little thought, when he went to the throne-room in his leather riding-clothes and hung his hat on the throne, that he was inaugurating a custom of wearing groom clothes which would in these days be so popular among the English."
"Dr. Franklin entered Philadelphia eating a loaf of bread and carrying a loaf under each arm, passing beneath the window of the girl to whom he afterwards gave his hand in marriage."
"Nearly everybody in America, except Dr. Mary Walker, was once a poor boy."
CHAPTER XVI.
THE CRITICAL PERIOD.
"Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold on the 10th of May led two small companies to Ticonderoga, a strong fortress tremendously fortified, and with its name also across the front door. Ethan Allen, a brave Vermonter born in Connecticut, entered the sally-port, and was shot at by a guard whose musket failed to report. Allen entered and demanded the surrender of the fortress."
"""By whose authority?"" asked the commandant."
"""By the authority of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress,"""
"said Allen, brandishing his naked sword at a great rate."
"""Very well,"" said the officer: ""if you put it on those grounds, all right, if you will excuse the appearance of things. We were just cleaning up, and everything is by the heels here."""
"""Never mind,"" said Allen, who was the soul of politeness. ""We put on no frills at home, and so we are ready to take things as we find them."""
"The Americans therefore got a large amount of munitions of war, both here and at Crown Point."
"General Washington was now appointed commander-in-chief of all the troops at the second session of the Continental Congress. On his arrival at Boston there were only fourteen thousand men. He took command under the historic elm at Cambridge. He was dressed in a blue broadcloth coat with flaps and revers of same, trimmed with large beautiful buttons. He also wore buff small-clothes, with openings at the sides where pockets are now put in, but at that time given up to space. They were made in such a way as to prevent the naked eye from discovering at once whether he was in advance or retreat. He also wore silk stockings and a cocked hat."
"The lines of Dryden starting off ""Mark his majestic fabric"" were suggested by his appearance and general style. He always dressed well and rode a good horse, but at Valley Forge frosted his feet severely, and could have drawn a pension, ""but no,"" said he, ""I can still work at light employment, like being President, and so I will not ask for a pension."""
"Each soldier had less than nine cartridges, but Washington managed to keep General Gage penned up in Boston, and, as Gage knew very few people there, it was a dull winter for him."
"The boys of Boston had built snow hills on the Common, and used to slide down them to the ice below, but the British soldiers tore down their coasting-places and broke up the ice on the pond."
"They stood it a long time, rebuilding their playground as often as it was torn down, until the spirit of American freedom could endure it no longer. They then organized a committee consisting of eight boys who were noted for their great philosophical research, and with Charles Sumner Muzzy, the eloquent savant from Milk Street, as chairman, the committee started for General Gage's head-quarters, to confer with him regarding the matter."
"In the picture Mr. Muzzy is seen addressing General Gage. The boy in the centre with the colored glasses is Marco Bozzaris Cobb, who discovered and first brought into use the idea of putting New Orleans molasses into Boston brown bread. To the left of Mr. Cobb is Mr. Jehoab Nye, who afterwards became the Rev. Jehoab Nye and worked with heart and voice for over eight of the best years of his life against the immorality of the codfish-ball, before he learned of its true relations towards society."
"Above and between these two stands Whomsoever J. Opper, who wrote ""How to make the Garden Pay"" and ""What Responsible Person will see that my Grave is kept green?"" In the background we see the tall form of Wherewithal G. Lumpy, who introduced the Pompadour hair-cut into Massachusetts and grew up to be a great man with enlarged joints but restricted ideas."
"Charles Sumner Muzzy addressed General Gage at some length, somewhat to the surprise of Gage, who admitted in a few well-chosen words that the committee was right, and that if he had his way about it there should be no more trouble."
"Charles was followed by Marco Bozzaris Cobb, who spoke briefly of the boon of liberty, closing as follows: ""We point with pride, sir, to the love of freedom, which is about the only excitement we have. We love our country, sir, whether we love anything else much or not. The distant wanderer of American birth, sir, pines for his country. 'Oh, give me back,' he goes on to say, 'my own fair land across the bright blue sea, the land of beauty and of worth, the bright land of the free, where tyrant foot hath never trod, nor bigot forged a chain. Oh, would that I were safely back in that bright land again!'"""
"Mr. Wherewithal G. Lumpy said he had hardly expected to be called upon, and so had not prepared himself, but this occasion forcibly brought to his mind the words also of the poet, ""Our country stands,"" said he, ""with outstretched hands appealing to her boys; from them must flow her weal or woe, her anguish or her joys. A ship she rides on human tides which rise and sink anon: each giant wave may prove her grave, or bear her nobly on. The friends of right, with armor bright, a valiant Christian band, through God her aid may yet be made, a blessing to our land."""
"General Gage was completely overcome, and asked for a moment to go apart and think it over, which he did, returning with an air which reminded one of ""Ten Nights in a Bar-Room."""
"""You may go, my brave boys; and be assured that if my troops molest you in the future, or anywhere else, I will overpower them and strew the Common with their corses."
"Washington decided that he must strike a daring blow while his troops had any hope or vitality left; and so on Christmas night, after crossing the Delaware as shown elsewhere, he fell on the Hessians at Trenton in the midst of their festivities, captured one thousand prisoners, and slew the leader."
"The Hessians were having a symposium at the time, and though the commander received an important note of warning during the Christmas dinner, he thrust it into his pocket and bade joy be unconfined."
"When daylight came, the Hessians were mostly moving in alcoholic circles trying to find their guns. Washington lost only four men, and two of those were frozen to death."
The result of this fight gave the Colonists courage and taught them at the same time that it would be best to avoid New Jersey symposiums till after the war was over.
"Having made such a hit in crossing the Delaware, Washington decided to repeat the performance on the 3d of January. He was attacked at Trenton by Cornwallis, who is known in history for his justly celebrated surrender. He waited till morning, having been repulsed at sundown."
"Washington left his camp-fires burning, surrounded the British, captured two hundred prisoners, and got away to Morristown Heights in safety. If the ground had not frozen, General Washington could not have moved his forty cannon; but, fortunately, the thermometer was again on his side, and he never lost a gun."
"September 11 the English got into the Chesapeake, and Washington announced in the papers that he would now fight the battle of the Brandywine, which he did."
"Marie Jean Paul Roch Yves Gilbert Motier, Marquis de La Fayette, fought bravely with the Americans in this battle, twice having his name shot from under him."
"The patriots were routed, scoring a goose-egg and losing Philadelphia."
"October 4, Washington attacked the enemy at Germantown, and was beaten back just as victory was arranging to perch on his banner. Poor Washington now retired to Valley Forge, where he put in about the dullest winter of his life."
"The English had not been so successful in the North. At first the Americans could only delay Burgoyne by felling trees in the path of his eight thousand men, which is a very unsatisfactory sort of warfare, but at last Schuyler, who had borne the burden and heat of the day, was succeeded by Gates, and good luck seemed to come slowly his way."
"A foolish boy with bullet-holes cut in his clothes ran into St. Leger's troops, and out of breath told them to turn back or they would fill a drunkard's grave. Officers asked him about the numbers of the enemy, and he pointed to the leaves of the trees, shrieked, and ran for his life."
"He ran several days, and was barely able to keep ahead of St. Leger's troops by a neck."
"Burgoyne at another time sent a detachment under Colonel Baum to take the stores at Bennington, Vermont. He was met by General Stark and the militia. Stark said, ""Here come the redcoats, and we must beat them to-day, or Molly Stark is a widow."" This neat little remark made an instantaneous hit, and when they counted up their string of prisoners at night they found they had six hundred souls and a Hessian."
"Burgoyne now felt blue and unhappy. Besides, his troops were covered with wood-ticks and had had no washing done for three weeks."
"He moved southward and attacked Gates at Bemis Heights, or, as a British wit had it, ""gave Gates ajar,"" near Saratoga. A wavering fight occupied the day, and then both armies turned in and fortified for two weeks."
"Burgoyne saw that he was running out of food, and so was first to open fire."
"Arnold, who had been deprived of his command since the last battle, probably to prevent his wiping out the entire enemy and getting promoted, was so maddened by the conflict that he dashed in before Gates could put him in the guard-house, and at the head of his old command, and without authority or hat, led the attack. Gates did not dare to come where Arnold was, to order him back, for it was a very warm place where Arnold was at the time. The enemy was thus driven to camp."
"Arnold was shot in the same leg that was wounded at Quebec; so he was borne back to the extreme rear, where he found Gates eating a doughnut and speaking disrespectfully of Arnold."
"A council was now held in Burgoyne's tent, and on the question of renewing the fight stood six to six, when an eighteen-pound hot shot went through the tent, knocking a stylographic pen out of General Burgoyne's hand. Almost at once he decided to surrender, and the entire army of six thousand men was surrendered, together with arms, portable bath-tubs, and leather hat-boxes. The Americans marched into their camp to the tune of Yankee Doodle, which is one of the most impudent compositions ever composed."
During the Valley Forge winter (1777-78) Continental currency depreciated in value so that an officer's pay would not buy his clothes.
"Many, having also spent their private funds for the prosecution of the war, were obliged to resign and hire out in the lumber woods in order to get food for their families. Troops had no blankets, and straw was not to be had. It was extremely sad; but there was no wavering. Officers were approached by the enemy with from one hundred to one thousand pounds if they would accept and use their influence to effect a reconciliation; but, with blazing eye and unfaltering attitude, each stated that he was not for sale, and returned to his frozen mud-hole to rest and dream of food and freedom."
Those were the untitled nobility from whom we sprung. Let us look over our personal record and see if we are living lives that are worthy of such heroic sires.
Five minutes will now be given the reader to make a careful examination of his personal record.
"In the spring the joyful news came across the sea that, through the efforts of Benjamin Franklin, France had acknowledged the independence of the United States, and a fleet was on the way to assist the struggling troops."
"The battle of Monmouth occurred June 28. Clinton succeeded Howe, and, alarmed by the news of the French fleet, the government ordered Clinton to concentrate his troops near New York, where there were better facilities for getting home."
"Washington followed the enemy across New Jersey, overtaking them at Monmouth. Lee was in command, and got his men tangled in a swamp where the mosquitoes were quite plenty, and, losing courage, ordered a retreat."
"Washington arrived at that moment, and bitterly upbraided Lee. He used the Flanders method of upbraiding, it is said, and Lee could not stand it. He started towards the enemy in preference to being there with Washington, who was still rebuking him. The fight was renewed, and all day long they fought. When night came, Clinton took his troops with him and went away where they could be by themselves."

He climbed the steps of the brownstone and tried the knob. The door
"opened. He went inside and found himself in a drab, dark hall furnished"
"with an umbrella stand, a worn carpet, and a table spread with mail."
"There was a bell on the table. He tapped it and, after a lazy length of"

"""Anjou's admiral,--Robert of Lavenna!"""
"The duke paused a moment, as if endeavoring to bring order into the"

there was something about the latter's personality which he could not
reconcile with his previous acquaintance.
At last Francesco's worldly habit flashed upon him.
"""What of the Cross?"" he flashed abruptly."
"""There is blood upon it!"" retorted Francesco."

Kilshaw replied by saying that Mr. Puttock had introduced Benham to him

unfortunate Sunday morning?

I repeated my question.
Solem denied he had said any such thing.

"Suddenly he dropped to the floor of the shed, convulsed, without shape, an"
outline merely; a few minutes passed before he got up again. When he was
last he stood still before her.
"“Among ordinary honourable people one takes such things for granted,” he"
said.
"“Forgive me,” she said again, humbly."
But he could find no pity for her in his heart. She had wronged him past
redemption.
“How much truth was there in the newspaper story?” he asked coldly.
She told him rapidly what Amédée Bazouge had said concerning his attack
in the hospital and his subsequent stroke.
“So the man is wilfully killing himself with absinthe?” he said.
"“It appears so,” replied Yvonne with a shudder."
“Could you tell me what passed between you otherwise--in general terms?”
"he asked, after a short silence. “You explained your position? Or did"
"you leave him in ignorance, as you were going to leave me?”"
“I told him--of course. It was necessary. And he laughed--I thought to
"spare you, Everard.”"
"“Spare me, Yvonne?”"
"“Yes,” she said, simply, “I could have borne all the pain and fright"
of it alone--why should I have made you unhappy? And _he_ said he would
"never interfere with me, and I can trust his word. Why should I have"
"told you, Everard?”"
And jammed neatly down behind it was the body of Les King. His throat
had been cut.
Brent Taber stared down into the closet for what seemed like an
interminable time. His eyes were bleak and his mouth was grim and stiff
as he passed a slow hand along his jaw.
"He took a long, backward step and closed his eyes for a moment as though"
hoping the whole improbable mess would go away. But it was still there
when he opened them again.
"He turned, went downstairs, and took the receiver off the phone on the"
wall by the front door.
"The shapeless landlady came out again. She scowled at Taber. ""What are"
"you doing here?"""
"He regarded her with a kind of affectionate weariness. ""Have you got a"
"dime, lady?"""
"Gaping, she pawed into her apron pocket and handed him a coin."
"""Thanks much."" He dialed. ""Is Captain Abrams there?"""
"There was a wait, during which Brent Taber asked the oddly bemused"
"landlady: ""Are you afraid of the dead?"""
"But before she could decide whether she was or not, Taber turned to the"

simultaneously with the report.
Johnson winced.
"""Poor devil!"" he muttered. ""But of course, as you say, he's only a"

In reply to which the Girl uttered words to the effect that she was glad
he had been caught.
"""Well, you're right,"" said Johnson, thoughtfully, after a short silence;"
"then determinedly and in short jerky sentences, he went on: ""I've been"
thinking that I must go--tear myself away. I have very important
"business at dawn--imperative business . . ."""
"The Girl, who now stood by the table folding up the white cloth cover,"
"watched him out of the corner of her eye, take down his coat from the"

"his coat. ""In five minutes you wouldn't know where you was. Your"
important business would land you at the bottom of a canyon 'bout twenty

Johnson cleared his throat as if to speak but said nothing; whereupon
the Girl continued:

"Andrews chuckled. ""I'll do better than our young pilot friend. The man"

"She smiled thinly. ""Naturally. All women think about it. Most do."
"I--er--"""
"Alice let her voice trail away uncertainly. The direct, frontal attack"
"had put her off-balance, but she realized that this was Andrews' direct"
way.
"He had smiled at her uncertainty, and said swiftly, ""Then may I be the"
"first--"" when he noted the fading amusement in her face and glibly ad"
"libbed--""to congratulate you on your choice of young men? The space"
commodore to whom you bade farewell in Chicago was an up and coming
"man, I'd assume."""
“I fled.
“And now you have found me.”
"She had turned, hastily, to leave the room. Kennedy blocked the door."
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he said firmly, “listen to me. What was the first"
question you asked me? ‘Can I trust you?’ And I told you you could.
This is no time for—for suicide.” He shot the word out bluntly. “All
may not be lost. I have sent for your husband. Muller is outside.”
“Muller?” she cried. “He made the replica.”
“Very well. I am going to clear this thing up. Come. You _must_.”
"It was all confused to me, the dash in a car to the little pawnbroker’s"
"on the first floor of a five-story tenement, the quick entry into the"
place by one of Muller’s keys.
Over the safe in back was a framework like that which had covered
"Schloss’ safe. Kennedy tore it away, regardless of the alarm which it"
must have sounded. In a moment he was down before it on his knees.
"“This is how Schloss’ safe was opened so quickly,” he muttered, working"
feverishly. “Here is some of their own medicine.”
He had placed the peculiar telephone-like transmitter close to the
combination lock and was turning the combination rapidly.
"Suddenly he rose, gave the bolts a twist, and the ponderous doors swung"
open.
"""Why do you stop? Why don't you go on--finish your search--only don't"
"ever speak to me again."""
"At that, Rance became conciliatory."
"""Say, Min, I don't want to quarrel with you."""
Turning her back on him the Girl moved over to the bureau where she
snapped out over her shoulder:
"""Go on with your search, then p'r'aps you'll leave a lady to herself to"
"go to bed."""
The Sheriff followed her up with the declaration:
"""I'm plumb crazy about you, Min."""
The Girl shrugged her shoulder.
"""I could have sworn I saw--I--Oh, you know it's just you for me--just"
"you, and curse the man you like better. I--I--even yet I can't get over"
"the queer look in your face when I told you who that man really was."" He"
"stopped and flung his overcoat down on the floor, and fixing her with a"
"look he demanded: ""You don't love him, do you?"""
Again the Girl sent over her shoulder a forced little laugh.
"""Who--me?"""
"The Sheriff's face brightened. Taking a few steps nearer to her, he"
hazarded:
"""No,"" said Etienne, coolly. ""You see, my cousin might not give me"
"another!"""
But the butcher of Tortosa could be as simple and direct in his methods
as even Rollo himself.
"""Will you give it to me?"" he said, still admiring it as it flashed upon"
his finger.
"Etienne looked at the general calmly from head to foot, Concha all the"
time frowning upon him to warn him of his danger. But the young man was
"preening himself like a little bantam-cock of vanity, glad to be"
reckless under the fire of such eyes. He would not have missed the
"chance for worlds, so he replied serenely, ""Do you still intend to shoot"
"us?"""
"""What has that to do with the matter?"" growled Cabrera, who was losing"
his temper.
"""Because if you do,"" said Etienne, who had been waiting his opportunity,"
"""you are welcome to the jewel--_after_ I am dead. But if I am to live, I"
"shall require it for myself!"""
CHAPTER XXIII
THE BURNING OF THE MILL-HOUSE
"Cabrera bit his lip for a moment, frowned still more darkly, and then"
"should be hastily sent away by his friends, what her father had"
"condemned her to, what manner of man he was; he must seem to destroy or"
impair the perfect sweetness of memory wherein she held her mother.
"He opened the door softly. She was sitting in a large armchair, over a"
"little bit of bright fire; save for gleams suddenly coming and going, as"
"a coal blazed and died down again, the room was in darkness. He walked"
"up to her and knelt by the chair, his head almost on a level with hers."
"""Well, Daisy, what are you doing?"""
She put out a hand and laid it on his with a gentle pressure.
"""I'm thinking,"" she said. ""Do you want a light?"""
"""No, I like it dark best--best for what I have to say."""
"Suddenly she threw her arms round his neck, drawing him to her and"
kissing his face.
"""I'd do the same if you'd killed him yourself,"" she whispered in the"
"extravagance of her love, and kissed him again."
"""But, Daisy, you don't know."""
"""Yes, I do. He told me. He's been here."""
"""Who?"""
"""Jack Norburn. He said you would hate telling me, so he did. You mustn't"
"mind, dear, you mustn't mind. Oh, you didn't think it would make any"
"difference to me, dear, did you? What do I care? Mrs. Puttock may care,"
ever-increasing recklessness--began presently to possess us. Once or
"twice I had to check the foremost, or they would have outrun the rear;"
"and this kind of race brought us gradually into such a state of alarm,"
"that by-and-by, when the line came to a sudden stop on the brow of a"
"gentle descent, I could hardly restrain my impatience."
'What is it?' I asked eagerly. 'Why are we stopping?' Surely the road
is good enough here.'
"No one answered, but it was significant that on the instant one of the"
women began to cry.
'Stop that folly!' I said. 'What is in front there? Cannot some one
speak?'
"'The Waldgrave thinks that he hears horsemen before us,' Fraulein Max"
answered.
In another moment the Waldgrave's figure loomed out of the darkness.
"'Martin,' he said--I noticed that his voice shook--'go forward. They"
"are in front. Man alive, be quick!' he continued fiercely. 'Do you"
want to have them into us?'
"I left my girl's rein, and pushing past the women and Fraulein, joined"
"Steve, who was standing by my lady's rein. 'What is it?' I said."
"'Nothing, I think,' he answered in an uncertain tone."
"I stood a moment listening, but I too could hear nothing. I began to"
argue with him. 'Who heard it?' I asked impatiently.
"'The Waldgrave,' he answered."
"“I know you are an angel—oh, hang it! You do make me feel as if you"
_were_ my mother.”
"“Now, don’t be unreasonable, or I shall believe that you are a tyrant.”"
"“A tyrant? I? Horri—no, I wish I was. What a model of propriety you"
are! I never should have thought it—I mean—darling! you were always
"such a coquette, you know. Not that I ever thought so. You know I never"
"did—oh, hang it all—but if I let you have your own way in this"
unreasonable—I mean this perfectly natural whim—you might at least
"promise to marry me in a month. And, indeed, I think that if you are an"
"angel, I am a saint.”"
"“Well, on one condition.”"
“Any! Any!”
“It must be an absolute secret until the wedding is over. I hate
"congratulations, and if we are going to have a sensation we might as"
well have a good concentrated one.”
"“I agree with you, and I’ll never find fault with you again. You—”"
Miss Decker almost ran into the room.
"“Jessica!” she cried. “Oh, dear Mr. Dedham, how are you? Jessica, mother"
"has one of her terrible attacks, and I must ask you to stay with her"
while I go for the doctor myself. I cannot trust servants.”
“Let me go! let me go!” cried Teddy. “I’ll bring him back in a quarter
of an hour. Who shall—”
The staff-paymaster spoke seriously. The man was heart and soul in
"his work, and his mental horizon was bounded by official forms and"
other red-tapeism connected with the accountant branch of H.M.
Service.
"""By the by,"" interposed Oswestry, ""Staggles ought to be recommended"
"for the V.C."""
"""What's that, Torps?"" asked Barracombe. ""Our staff-paymaster the"
"V.C.?"""
"""What for?"" inquired the staff-paymaster innocently."
The commander entrenched himself behind a double number of an
illustrated periodical.
"""For bringing Mephisto in out of action,"" he replied with a chuckle."
CHAPTER XXVIII.
THE FOILED AIR RAID.
"LATE that evening the ""Sunderland"" brought up in the Admiralty"
"Harbour at Dover, in company with three other light cruisers, two"
"monitors, and a flotilla of destroyers. All night long the men slept"
"at their guns, while the cruiser's searchlights aided those of the"
forts both ashore and on the breakwater in sweeping the approach to
the sheltered harbour.
Her face was pale and drawn; her smile was as abstract as the mystery on
the lips of the Mona Lisa. She laid a hand on the suitcase.
"""We had our first quarrel over it, remember? We went to Puerto Rico for"
"that week and I wanted to use mine but you said, 'Goddamn it, if you're"
"ashamed of my suitcase you're ashamed of me, so the hell with it.'"""
"""I remember."""
"He sat down beside her, lit a cigarette, and then dropped it on the"
floor and stepped on it. They both looked straight ahead.
"""Take me with you, Frank."""
"""That's impossible."""
"""I know, but take me with you."""
"""There will be no money. I'll live in a stuffy room somewhere."""
"""What difference does that make? Take me."""
"""You have your job. You're on the way up. It would be unthinkable."""
"""I don't have any job. I quit. I was halfway through a piece of"
copy--very important copy--and I got up and walked into Mr. Frankel's
"office. I said, 'Mr. Frankel, it's been very nice working for you. I"
appreciate all you've done but I'm leaving now. The pencils are all
sharpened on my desk and the next girl can have the new leather-bound

Travers seized his arm. His eyes shone with a painful excitement.
"""Yes--yes!"" he stammered. ""You have a chance--a sure hope. I can save"
you; I can--atone. That's what I want. Only you must help me. I am a
dying man. I want you to bring me to the Rajah--at once. Only five
minutes with him--that will be enough. Then he will let you go--he
"must!"""
Nicholson freed himself resolutely from the clinging hands.
"""You exaggerate your power,"" he said, ""and, besides, what you ask is"
"an impossibility."""
"He turned away, but Travers caught his arm and held him with a"
"frantic, desperate strength."
"little given to humiliating your neighbours, male or female....”"
"“Yes, yes; but we are not so conceited or such play-actors as you are."
"A woman may think herself pretty and amiable and sweet, and not be so."
"That is true; but on the other hand, every man thinks himself braver"
"than the Cid, even if he is afraid of a fly, and more talented than"
"Seneca, even if he is a dolt.”"
"“To sum up, men are a calamity.”"
“Just so.”
“And women spend their lives fishing for these calamities.”
“They need them; there are inferior things which still are necessary.”
"unveiling, I am too thrilled.”"
He kept button-holing Pangbutt:
"“Too thrilled to--er--I am thrilled, sir, thrilled, as indeed is"
"Charlotte--oh, ah, yes--Charlotte!” He searched about behind him for"
"the little old lady, who moved up to his side. “Oh, ah, yes--there"
"you are, Charlotte! Allow me to introduce Mr. Pangbutt, our host."
"May I ask, sir, if Mr. Anthony Bickersteth has yet arrived? No?..."
"How fortunate! How very fortunate!... Charlotte, I am becoming quite"
excited.”
Pangbutt led them to chairs.
Two richly-dressed ladies of an age that discovers as much as is
"concealed by considerable dressing, hesitated at the door; and one,"
taking a last amused glance over her shoulder at some incident that
"passed upon the stairs below, tittered, and, turning, swept the room"
with keen regard through her raised lorgnettes.
“How amusin’! how absolutely amusin’!” she crooned. “I like literary
and artistic people _so_ much.”
"“Yes,” said the other, “they are _so_ different to one’s own class...."
And actresses _dress_ so well!”
"She flung back an elaborate head of jewels, and whispered something to"
the lady of the lorgnettes.
The lady of the lorgnettes laughed:
“Really?” said she
MAQUILLAGE.
"THE charm of rouge on fragile cheeks,"
"Pearl-powder, and, about the eyes,"
The dark and lustrous Eastern dyes;
The floating odour that bespeaks
A scented boudoir and the doubtful night
Of alcoves curtained close against the light
"Gracile and creamy white and rose,"
"Complexioned like the flower of dawn,"
Her fleeting colours are as those
"That, from an April sky withdrawn,"
Fade in a fragrant mist of tears away
When weeping noon leads on the altered day.

"THE pink and black of silk and lace,"
Flushed in the rosy-golden glow
Of lamplight on her lifted face;
"Powder and wig, and pink and lace,"
And those pathetic eyes of hers;
"""Have you ever heard the like of it? She told me to get out! I shall leave"
"tomorrow."""
"""Have you found the galoshes?"" I asked."
"""Of course,"" he replied. ""They were right in the passage. 'Here they are,'"
"I said to her. 'Yes, yes,' she said. 'Right under your nose,' I said."
"'Yes, yes, go away,' she said, and began to cry. So I went away."""
"""She'll get over it."""
"""Do you think so? Yes, I expect she will. Oh, well, it's my opinion nobody"

That evening the lady was in the dining room before us; she was there when
"we came in, and we all nodded slightly in greeting. To the actor she was"
"very kind, quite making up for her petulance of the afternoon."
When he sat down he found a letter in his table napkin: a written note
folded into the napkin. He was so surprised that he dropped everything he
"was doing to unfold and read it. With an exclamation and a smile, his"
"blue, delighted eyes splashed over her; but she was looking down into her"
"lap with her forehead wrinkled, so he put the note away in his vest"
pocket.
"Then it probably dawned on him that he had betrayed her, and he tried to"
cover it up somehow.
He looked down the scuttle at the clock.
"""Why, you owe me twenty."""
Simcox flew out with pretended politeness.
"""Oh, make it half an hour!  Don't let's haggle about such a trifle."
What's it matter if I stand here waiting?  Can't I keep the whole
"bloomin' watch for you?"""
"""Go to hell,"" said Lampert sulkily."
And Simcox went below.
"""To be a sailor is to be a natural born fool,"" said Lampert,"
"addressing the bitter and unkindly elements at large, ""and to be on"
"board a ship with such a windy gassing crowd, from the old man down"
"to the cook, is very trying.  It's very trying."""
"The wind took off a little later, but the weather was still thickish."
"""It's like lookin' through a haystack,"" grunted Lampert, ""but there,"
bar an island or so there's nothing to speak of in our way.  And if
"the skipper will crack on, and it a week since we saw the sun, it's"
"the owners' look out, not mine."""
"He spoke with a certain bitterness, as though he would really enjoy"
"being wrecked, in the trust that the _Potluck_ was not insured, and"
"that old Jones would get his certificate cancelled, or at least"
suspended.
"""'Twould give the old ass time to study foreign politics,"" sneered"
"to tea and was very----'  I can't quite make this word out."""
"""Let _me_ look,"" said the King, his rubicund face becoming yet more"
"rubicund.  ""It looks like 'charming,'"" he said casually."
"""Fancy!"" said Belvane.  ""Fancy my writing that!  I put down just what"
"comes into my head at the time, you know.""  She made a gesture with"
her hand indicative of some one who puts down just what comes into her
"head at the time, and returned to her diary.  ""'Remained to tea, and"
"was very charming.  Mused afterwards on the mutability of life!'"" She"
"looked up at him with wide-open eyes.  ""I often muse when I'm alone,"""
she said.
The King still hovered over the diary.
"""Have you any more entries like--like that last one?  May I look?"""
"""Oh, your Majesty!  I'm afraid it's _quite_ private.""  She closed the"
book quickly.
"""I just thought I saw some poetry,"" said the King."
"""Just a little ode to a favourite linnet.  It wouldn't interest your"
"Majesty."""
"""I adore poetry,"" said the King, who had himself written a rhymed"
"couplet which could be said either forwards or backwards, and in the"
latter position was useful for removing enchantments.  According to
"the eminent historian, Roger Scurvilegs, it had some vogue in Euralia"
and went like this:
"""_Bo, boll, bill, bole._"
"“Well, crowd along!” advised Ned."
“Crowd along?” repeated Jimmie. “What for?”
"“Use your nose,” advised Ned."
Jimmie sniffed elaborately and hit Ned a resounding whack on the back.
Then he sat down on the bottom of the passage.
"“Say, Ned, look here!” he said. “When we got into this scrape, we didn’t"
"look for any old Franciscan monks to help us out, did we? Two or three"
"hundred years ago, when they dug this passage through the rock, they"
"hadn’t any idea they were digging it for us, had they?”"
"“This is a mysterious world,” Ned answered. “It seems to be unnecessary"
for us to plan any mode of escape. The wise old chap who formed the
"Franciscan order in Europe, hundreds of years ago, prepared the way of"
escape for us!”
“That’s what he did!” answered Jimmie. “And I wish he had gone a little
farther and prepared a good fat meat pie for us.”
"“Jimmie,” Ned chuckled, “some day you’ll get into a corner where you"
won’t get anything to eat for a week. I never knew a boy who thought so
much of his stomach as you do!”
“May the day be long delayed!” laughed Jimmie.
"“Well, crawl along!” Ned advised, “and I’ll see if I can get this slab"
of stone you pushed out back in its place.”
talk such damned bad French.”
Rippley went and touched him on the shoulder:
"“Blotte, old boy; you’re very queer to-night,” he said. “You make me"
feel as blue as a newly-clipped hearse-horse.”
"Blotte roused, and moved towards the door; halted; turned to them all:"
“I say I sup with the gods to-night--and mix the hats--and set the
table in a roar.... I must hasten away.... I hear them call.... God
"bless you, dear boys! we shall meet in sunshine----”"
Rippley stepped to the door:
"“Quick!” said he in a hushed whisper, “make a line, quick there,"
"you Fluffy, Doome, Blotte, to my left here at the door. Here comes"
Pangbutt.... He blows his nose like the old nobility.... Come along.
Blotte--don’t look like a broken-down anarchist in an advanced stage
"of pip. You must affect the smiling, friendly, neapolitan manner,"
expectant of a fee.”
"As Blotte’s pale face took on a deathly smile, Rippley bowed, and there"
stepped into the open doorway the well-groomed figure of their host.
"Pangbutt halted, perplexed."
He gazed in vague consternation at the Vandyke travesty in white silks
before him--turned to the solemn countenances of the four waiters:
"“May I ask what, in the name of Beelzebub, is happening in this house?”"
he asked.
"HE stands, a patient figure, where the crowd"
Heaves to and fro beside him. In his ears
"All day the Fair goes thundering, and he hears"
"In darkness, as a dead man in his shroud."
"Patient he stands, with age and sorrow bowed,"
And holds a piteous hat of ancient yean;
And in his face and gesture there appears
The desperate humbleness of poor men proud.
"What thoughts are his, as, with the inward sight,"
He sees those mirthful faces pass him by?
Is the long darkness darker for that light.
The misery deeper when that joy is nigh?
"Patient, alone, he stands from morn to night,"
Pleading in his reproachful misery.
THE OLD LABOURER.
"HIS fourscore years have bent a back of oak,"
His earth-brown cheeks are full of hollow pits;
His gnarled hands wander idly as he sits
Bending above the hearthstone’s feeble smoke.
Threescore and ten slow years he tilled the land;
He wrung his bread from out the stubborn soil;
He saw his masters flourish through his toil;
He held their substance in his horny hand.
"""What silly talk is this, young know-it-all! We have no wives?"" said the"
"captain. ""Or do you happen to have done away with them?"" asked the"
quartermasters.
"""No, all of us together did away with them,"" answered the boy, and told"
them what he had heard and seen that Sunday afternoon when he was on
"watch on the ship; while the crew was ashore, and the captain was buying"
his deckload of wood.
And when they sailed home they learned that their wives had disappeared
"the day of the storm, and that since that time no one had seen or heard"
anything more of them.
NOTE
"A weird tale of the sea and of witches is that of ""Storm Magic"""
"(Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I, p. 248. From the vicinity of"
"Christiania, told by a sailor, Rasmus Olsen). In the ""Fritjof"
"Legend"" the hero has a similar adventure at sea with two witches,"
who call up a tremendous storm. It would be interesting to know
"the inner context of the cabin-boy's counter magic, and why it is"
"that the birch-wood, cast into the sea billet by billet, had the"
power to destroy the witches.

THE FOUR-SHILLING PIECE
tricks were the outcome of years of concentrated effort and constant
"exercise, and being moved by the Grace of God, he desired to offer the"
best thing he had to give to the Lord of Life. His best was his skill.
"He lived by it. Shown in the streets and the play places, it won for"
him his daily bread. His work was to give men amusement in their hours
of recreation by an exhibition of his feats of strength and
"nimbleness. Could this, his one talent, be consecrated and devoted to"
"God? So he considered, and humbly sought the sanctuary, and there"
before the Presence he performed his fantastic tricks which had cost
him years of endeavour. The story is a parable which men have not been
"slow to read, and it has become the theme of the musician and artist."
Shall I offend my fellow-writers if I repeat it here in this
connection?

THE FIRES OF MOLOCH
“_There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets._”
Every three months with unfailing regularity small paragraphs appear
in the daily papers headed “RECORD LOW BIRTH-RATE.” Some figures
The character of his relations towards them was confirmed by the
"appearance of his clothes, which, as a rule, were tidy, and cleaner"
"than those of his companions.  And now, sitting at the door of the"
"dosshouse, he boastingly related that for a long time past Redka had"
"been asking him to go and live with her, but he had not gone because he"
did not want to part with the company.  They heard this with jealous
"interest.  They all knew Redka.  She lived very near the town, almost"
"below the mountain.  Not long ago, she had been in prison for theft."
"She was a retired nurse; a tall, stout peasant woman, with a face"
"marked by smallpox, but with very pretty, though always drunken, eyes."
"""Just look at the old devil!"" swore Abyedok, looking at Simtsoff, who"
was smiling in a self-satisfied way.
"""And do you know why they love me?  Because I know how to cheer up"
"their souls."""
"""Do you?"" inquired Kuvalda."
"""And I can make them pity me....  And a woman, when she pities!  Go and"
"weep to her, and ask her to kill you ... she will pity you--and she"
"will kill you."""
"""I feel inclined to commit a murder,"" declared Martyanoff, laughing his"
dull laugh.
"""Upon whom?"" asked Abyedok, edging away from him."
"""It's all the same to me ... Petunikoff ... Egorka ... or even you!"""
"""And why?"" inquired Kuvalda."
"""I do not interfere in the councils of the Gitano,"" she cried; ""I am"
"old, but not old enough to desire death!"""
"But more grim and lack-lustre than ever, the face of Sergeant Cardono"
"was turned upon her, and more starrily twinkled the sloe-like eyes"
"(diamonds set in Cordovan leather) as he replied:--""The councils of the"
"Rom are as an open book to me. If they are life, they are life because I"
"will it; if death, then I will the death!"""
The old gipsy stared incredulously.
"""Long have I lived,"" she said, staring hard at the sergeant, ""much have"
"I seen, both of gipsy and Gorgio; but never have I seen or heard of the"
"man who could both make that boast, and make it good!"""
She appeared to consider a moment.
"""Save one,"" she added, ""and he is dead!"""
"""How did he die?"" said the Sergeant, his tanned visage like a mask, but"
never removing his eyes from her face.
"""By the _garrote_"" she answered, in a hushed whisper. ""I saw him die."""
"""Where?"""
"""In the great _plaza_ of Salamanca,"" she said, her eyes fixed in a stare"
"of regretful remembrance. ""It was filled from side to side, and the"
"balconies were peopled as for a bull-fight. Ah, he was a man!"""
"""His name?"""
"“How long since you left the camp?” Ned asked, after Jimmie had"
introduced the two.
"“Perhaps half an hour ago,” was the answer. “When I went to sleep, the"
"boys were sitting by the fire, but when I woke there was no one in"
sight. I came out to look for them.”
“I understand you came on a mission for Jack Bosworth’s father?” asked
Ned after a pause.
"“Yes,” was the reply, “at the request of my employer I came on this most"
dangerous mission. I shall be glad to see New York again.”
Ned hesitated a moment and then asked:
“Did Mr. Bosworth ever say anything to you about a set of documents he
wished us to bring to light?”
"“He did not,” was the answer."
"“His purpose in sending you, then, was to secure, by means of our help,"
proof connecting a corporation he is fighting with unlawful acts which
have been or may be committed in this section?”
“That is exactly the idea!” answered Gilroy.
"“Come on,” Jimmie shouted, “let’s get back to camp. I begin to feel"
hungry already. Perhaps the boys have returned.”
Before Gilroy would move out of the forest he insisted on pinning up
certain rents in his clothing and combing out his mussed up hair with
"his fingers. There were also numerous scratches on his face, caused by"
"""Yolande--Yolande!""  I called, touching her cheek in an effort to awaken"
"her, for I could not believe that she was actually dead."
But there was no response.  Those blanched lips and the coldness of
those cheeks told their own tale.  She had passed to that land which
lies beyond the range of human vision.
How long I stood there I cannot tell.  My thoughts were inexpressibly
"sad ones, and the discovery had utterly upset me, so that I scarcely"
knew what I said or did.  The blow of thus finding her lifeless crushed
"me.  The affair was mysterious, to say the least of it.  Of a sudden,"
"however, the sobs of the grief-stricken Countess aroused me to a sense"
"of my responsibility, and taking her hand I led her from the bedside"
into an adjoining room.
"""How has this terrible catastrophe occurred?""  I demanded of her"
"breathlessly.  ""Only two hours ago she was well and happy."""
"""You mean when you saw her?"" she said.  ""What was the object of your"
"call?"""
"""To see her,"" I responded."
"""And yet you parted ill friends in Brussels?"" she observed in a tone of"
"distinct suspicion.  ""You had some motive in calling.  What was it?"""
I hesitated.  I could not tell her that I suspected her daughter to be a
spy.
"""In order to assure her of my continued good friendship."""
"""Say, Girl, was your answer final to-night about marrying me?"""
Without turning round the Girl answered coyly:
"""I might think it over, Jack."""
"Instantly the man's passion was aroused. He strode over to her, put his"
arms around her and kissed her forcibly.
"""I love you, I love you, Minnie!"" he cried passionately."
"In the struggle that followed, the Girl's eyes fell on the bottle on the"
mantel. With a cry she seized it and raised it threateningly over her
"head. Another second, however, she sank down upon a chair and began to"
"sob, her face buried in her hands."
"Rance regarded her coldly; at last he gave vent to a mirthless laugh,"
the nasty laugh of a man whose vanity is hurt.
"""So, it's as bad as that,"" he sneered. ""I didn't quite realise it. I'm"
"much obliged to you. Good-night."" He snatched up his coat, hesitated,"
"then repeated a little less angrily than before: ""Good-night!"""
"But the Girl, with her face still hidden, made no answer. For a moment"
"he watched the crouching form, the quivering shoulders, then asked, with"
sudden and unwonted gentleness:
"""Can't you say good-night to me, Girl!"""
"Slowly the Girl rose to her feet and faced him, aversion and pity"
"struggling for mastery. Then, as she noted the spot where he was now"
He has taken his staff for the Pilgrim's way.
"His sandals are girt on his tender feet,"
And he carries his scrip for what gifts he may.
"What will you give to him, Fate Divine?"
What for his scrip on the winding road?
"A crown for his head, or a laurel wreath?"
"A sword to wield, or is gold his load?"
What will you give him for weal or woe?
What for the journey through day and night?
"Give or withhold from him power and fame,"
But give to him love of the earth's delight.
Let him be lover of wind and sun
And of falling rain; and the friend of trees;
"With a singing heart for the pride of noon,"
And a tender heart for what twilight sees.
Let him be lover of you and yours--
"The Child and Mary; but also Pan,"
"And the sylvan gods of the woods and hills,"
And the god that is hid in his fellow-man.
"Love and a song and the joy of earth,"
These be the gifts for his scrip to keep
"Till, the journey ended, he stands at last"
"In the gathering dark, at the gate of sleep."
_Ethel Clifford._
And so our stories should contain all the essentials for the child's
"scrip on the road of life, providing the essentials and holding or"
"girl's getting on. She's dependent upon her own labor."" As she spoke"
she spread out the sheet. A sketch dropped to the table.
Trude drew a long breath. She had not known how worried she was. She
wanted to laugh aloud now from sheer relief. Because she had to do
"something she took up the sketch with a murmured: ""May I?"""
"""Laura writes it's a little sketch she made in class. 'This will show"
you I am improving. It's from life. It will give you an idea of the
"delightful types we find around here, types that you will not find"
anywhere else. These are two little vagabonds whom you see almost
anytime on the beach or around the wharves--as wild and free and
"beautiful as the seagulls--'"""
Mrs. White looked up from the letter to take the sketch and exclaimed
aloud at Trude's face. It had gone deathly white.
"""My _dear_, what is it?"""
For a moment Trude could not answer. She was staring at the sketch as
though she could not take her eyes from it.
"""Read that again! These are types--you find these girls any time on the"
"wharves--wild--vagabonds! Oh, Aunt Edith that's--_that's_--_Sidney_!"""
"""Why, it _can't_ be, Trude. You said--"""
"Trude shook her head. ""I can't help what I said. It's Sidney. I--know."
The likeness is true--there can't be anyone else who looks like Sidney!
But she's barefooted--and--and so--_slovenly_--and--_her hair_! She's

was lying.  As we entered she lifted her hand slowly to me in sign of
"recognition, and in an instant I was at her side."
"""Yolande!""  I cried, taking her hand, so different now that death had"
"been defeated by life.  ""Yolande! my darling,"" I burst forth"
"involuntarily, ""you have come back to me!"""
"A sweet, glad smile spread over her beautiful face, leaving an"
"expression of calm and perfect contentment, as in a low, uncertain"
"voice, as though of one speaking afar off, she asked:"
"""Gerald, is it actually you?"""
"""Yes,"" I said, ""of course it is.  These two gentlemen are doctors,"" I"
"added.  ""This is my old friend Deane; and the other is Doctor Trepard,"
"of whom I daresay you have heard."""
She nodded to them both in acknowledgment of their kind expressions;
then in a few low words inquired what had happened to her.  She seemed
in utter ignorance of it all.
"""You were found lying on the floor of the little salon soon after I"
"left, and they thought you were dead,"" I explained.  ""Cannot you tell us"
"how it occurred?"""
"A puzzled expression settled upon her face, as though she were trying to"
remember.
"""I recollect nothing,"" she declared."
"""But you surely remember how you were attacked?""  I urged."
"He started to walk with long strides through the sad, empty streets."
"He went toward the river and met Kennedy, who was coming back, he told"
"him, from the studio of a sculptor friend of his."
“You look like desolation. What has happened to you?”
"“Nothing, but I am in a perfectly hellish humour.”"
“I am melancholy too. It must be the weather. Let’s take a walk.”
"They went along the bank of the Tiber. Full of clay, more turbid than"
"ever, and very high between the white embankments hemming it in, the"
river looked like a big sewer.
“This is not the ‘coeruleus Tibris’ that Virgil speaks of in the
"Aeneld, which presented itself to Aeneas in the form of an ancient man"
"with his head crowned with roses,” said Kennedy."
"“No. This is a horrible river,” Cæsar opined."
"They followed the shore, passed the Castel Sant’ Angelo and the bridge"
with the statues.
"From the embankment, to the right, they could now see narrow lanes, sunk"
"almost below the level of the river. On the other bank a new, white"
edifice towered in the rain.
"They went as far as the Piazza d’Armi, and then came back at nightfall"
to Rome. The rain was gradually ceasing and the sky looked less
threatening. A file of greenish gaslights followed the river-wall and
then crossed over the bridge.

“But you must have read of the famous Moulton diamonds?”
"“Yes,” said Craig, blankly, as if it were all news to him."
“Schloss has them—or at least had them. The jewels she wore at the
"opera this winter were paste, I understand.”"
“Does Moulton play?” he asked.
"“I think so—but not here, naturally. In a way, I suppose, it is his"
fault. They all do it. The example of one drives on another.”
"Instantly there flashed over my mind a host of possibilities. Perhaps,"
"after all, Winters had been right. Schloss had taken this way to make"
sure of the jewels so that she could not redeem them. Suddenly another
"explanation crowded that out. Had Mrs. Moulton robbed the safe herself,"
"or hired some one else to do it for her, and had that person gone back"
on her?
Then a horrid possibility occurred to me. Whatever Antoinette Moulton
"may have been and done, some one must have her in his power. What a"
situation for the woman! My sympathy went out to her in her supreme
"struggle. Even if it had been a real robbery, Schloss might easily"
recover from it. But for her every event spelled ruin and seemed only
to be bringing that ruin closer.
"We left Winters, still watching on the trail of Schloss, and went on"
uptown to the laboratory.
"Whereupon, Johnson went over to the window and put his face close to"
hers on the frosted panes; a great sea of white snow met his gaze!
"""This means--"" he said, turning away from the window and meeting her"
"glance--""surely it doesn't mean that I can't leave Cloudy to-night?"""
"""It means you can't get off the mountain to-night,"" calmly answered the"
Girl.
"""Good Lord!"" fell from the man's lips."
"""You can't leave this room to-night,"" went on the Girl, decidedly. ""Why,"
you couldn't find your way three feet from this door--you a stranger!
"You don't know the trail anyway unless you can see it."""
"""But I can't stay here?"" incredulously."
"""Why not? Why, that's all right! The boys'll come up an' dig us out"
"to-morrow or day after. There's plenty o' wood an' you can have my bed."""
"And with no more ado than that, the Girl went over to the bed to remove"
the covers and make it ready for his occupancy.
"""I wouldn't think of taking that,"" protested the man, stoutly, while his"
face clouded over.
The Girl felt a thrill at the note of regard in his voice and hastened
to explain:
"""I never use it cold nights; I always roll up in my rug in front of the"
"fire."" All of a sudden she broke out into a merry little laugh. ""Jest"
"think of it stormin' all this time an' we didn't know it!"""

When the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the
uproar.
Maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and
"memoranda, with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging"
"in disorderly strings over his forehead. His window was open, for the"
beloved janitress Spring had turned on a little warmth through the
waking registers of the earth.
And through the window came a wandering—perhaps a lost—odour—a
"delicate, sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment"
"immovable. For this odour belonged to Miss Leslie; it was her own, and"
hers only.
"The odour brought her vividly, almost tangibly before him. The world of"
finance dwindled suddenly to a speck. And she was in the next
room—twenty steps away.
"“By George, I’ll do it now,” said Maxwell, half aloud. “I’ll ask her"
now. I wonder I didn’t do it long ago.”
He dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to
cover. He charged upon the desk of the stenographer.
"She looked up at him with a smile. A soft pink crept over her cheek,"
and her eyes were kind and frank. Maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk.
He still clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the pen was
above his ear.
"“Miss Leslie,” he began hurriedly, “I have but a moment to spare. I"
"“No, indeed,” the Englishman proclaimed."
Cæsar and Kennedy disagreed about everything.
"Susanna discussed her plans, and constantly referred to Paul Bourget’s"
"novel _Cosmopolis_, which had obviously influenced her in her"
inclination for Catholicism.
“Are there many Jewish ladies who aspire to be baptized and become
"Catholics, as Bourget says?” asked Susanna."
“Bah!” exclaimed Cæsar.
“You do not believe that either?”
"“No, it strikes me as a piece of naïvety in this good soul of a"
"novelist. To become a Catholic, I don’t believe requires more than some"
few pesetas.”
"“You are detestable, as a Cardinal’s nephew.”"
“I mean that I don’t perceive that there are any obstacles to prevent
"anybody from becoming a Catholic, as there are to prevent his becoming"
"rich. What a high ambition, to aspire to be a Catholic! While nobody"
anywhere does anything but laugh at Catholics; and it has become an
axiom: ‘A Catholic country is a country bound for certain ruin.’”
Kennedy burst out laughing.
"Susanna said that she had no real faith, but that she did have a great"
"enthusiasm for churches and for choirs, for the smell of incense and"
"of veal, and he’s got a cute little round bald spot on the top of his"
head. And he wants to be dignified and speaks his words impressively.
"Say, Ned,” the boy continued, “I wouldn’t mind having that fellow get"
into some kind of a mixup out here!”
“Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Oh Lord!” cried the voice from the forest.
"“That’s Gilroy, all right enough!” Ned declared. “Why don’t you go down"
"and see what he wants, Jimmie?” he added."
"“Aw, he ain’t talking to me!” cried the boy."
"“Then I presume I’ll have to go,” Ned said, rising from his seat in"
front of the barrier. “Perhaps he’s been stung by a bee.”
"“He didn’t get crippled in his shrieker,” Jimmie suggested."
Ned stepped into the cave and secured an automatic revolver to replace
"the one taken from him at the old mission, and also passed one to"
Jimmie. Then the two hastened into the forest in the direction of the
sounds.
"The call for help continued to come, although the voice of the man came"
hoarser at every call. When the boys finally came close enough to
"distinguish words spoken in low tones, they heard a warning."
“Shoot!” he cried. “There’s a lot of bears under this tree!”
"Although convulsed with laughter, the boys moved more cautiously after"
this. At last they came to the pine from which the voice proceeded.
"There was a rustle in the thicket as they advanced, and they saw a black"
object shambling away.
red glow illumined the sky.
"The two men looked at each other, grimly, soberly."
"""We're here,"" said Dex, flexing the muscles of his powerful arms."
"""We are,"" said Brand, patting the gun in his holster."
The rapid dusk of the giant planet began to close in on them. The thin
"sunlight darkened; and with its lowering, the red spot of Jupiter"
"glared more luridly ahead of them. Silently the two men gazed at it,"
and wondered what it held.
"They shot the space ship toward it, and halted a few hundred miles"
"away. Watery white light from the satellites, ""that jitter around in"
"the sky like a bunch of damned waterbugs,"" as Dex put it, was now the"
sole illumination.
"They hung motionless in their space shell, to wait through the"
five-hour Jovian night for the succeeding five hours of daylight to
"illumine a slow cruise over the red area that, in less than a year,"
had swallowed up three of Earth's space ships. And ever as they
"waited, dozing a little, speculating as to the nature of the danger"
"they faced, the peep, peep of the radio shrilled in their ears to tell"
them that there was still a connection--though a very tenuous
one--with their mother planet.

"approaching it slowly."""

"""I know some people are very ready to be at his feet,"" he said, with a"
sneering smile.
His shaft hit the mark. Alicia flushed and sat speechless. A glance at
Lady Eynesford's face told him the scene had lasted too long: he rose
"and took his leave, paying Alicia the homage of a bow, but not seeking"
"her hand. She took no notice of his salute, and Lady Eynesford only"
"gasped ""Good-bye."""
The two sat silent for some moments after he had gone; then Lady
"Eynesford remarked,"
"""Were you mad, Alicia? See what you laid yourself open to! Oh, of course"
"a gentleman wouldn't have said it, but you yourself didn't treat him as"
"if he was a gentleman. Really, I can make a great deal of allowance for"
"him. Your manner was inexcusable."""
Alicia did not attempt to defend herself.
"""You are out of temper,"" continued her sister-in-law, ""and you choose to"
hit the first person within reach; if you can do that you care nothing
for my dignity or your own self-respect. You parade your--your interest
"in this man----"""
"""I shall never speak to him again."""
"""I'm glad to hear it, and, if you come into my drawing-room, I will"
"thank you to behave yourself properly and be civil to my guests,"" and"
Lady Eynesford walked out of the room.
"A door opened, and through it (though dimly) Rollo could see the great"
"waterfall glimmering and above the stars, chill over the snowy shoulder"
"of Peñalara. He could not make out who had opened the door, but there"
was enough light to discern that a lady wrapped in a mantilla went out
"first. Then followed another, stouter and of shorter stature, apparently"
carrying a burden. Then the whole doorway was obscured by the tall
figure of a man.
"""Muñoz himself, by Heaven!"" thought Rollo."
"And with a leap he was after him, in his headlong course dashing to the"
ground some other unseen person who confronted him in the hall.
In a moment more he had caught the tall man by the collar and swung him
impetuously round back within the doorway.
"""Move one sole inch and your blood be on your own head!"" he muttered."
"And the captive feeling Rollo's steel cold at his throat, remained"
prudently silent. Not so the lady without. She uttered a cry which rang
about the silent château.
"""Muñoz! My husband! Fernando, where art thou? Oh, they have slain him,"
"and I only am to blame!"""
"She turned about and rushed back to the door, which she was about to"
"enter, when a cry far more sudden and terrible rang out behind her."
"""_They have killed the Princess! Some one hath slain my darling!_"""
"At the word Rollo abandoned the man whom he was holding down, and with"
"shouts of ""Cardono!"" ""El Sarria!"" ""To me! They are upon us!"" he flung"
"Coxon showed more interest now, and remarked,"
"""Why, Gaspard was one of Medland's organisers. I saw him with both"
"Medland and Norburn on Saturday."""
"""I don't suppose they were planning to murder this Benham. Indeed, I"
don't see that the thing can have been political at all. What did it
"matter whether Benham lived or died?"""
"""I don't see that it did, except to Benham,"" assented the Captain. ""But"
"what's become of Gaspard?"""
"""Ah, that they don't know. He's supposed to have taken ship, and they've"
"cabled to search all ships that left the port that morning."""
"""He'll find the man in blue--or the local equivalent--on the wharf,"""
"said the Captain. ""Rather a jar that, Sir Robert, when you're in from a"
"voyage. What are they doing now?"""
"""Well, the Superintendent said they were going to have a thorough search"
"through the dead man's lodgings, to see if they could find out anything"
about him which would throw light on the motive. The police don't think
"much of the political theory of the crime."""
"""Dashed nonsense, _I_ should think,"" said the Captain, and he sauntered"
off to play billiards.
"""That young man,"" said the Chief Justice, ""is really not a fool, though"
"he does his best to look like one."""
"""That queer conduct seems to me rather common in young men at home. I"
"eyes without spectacles, I recognized George Hamilton, and almost choked"
myself in smothering a cry.
"Frances turned to me, asking indignantly, ""Why did not you tell me?"""
"""Because I did not know,"" I answered, hardly able to believe the truth."
"But we had important business before us, and I knew that we should"
"prepare for it before Lilly came in. So George, Bettina, Frances, and"
I went to a window at the far end of the room to hold a consultation.
"""Since I did not recognize you, perhaps Lilly will not,"" I suggested. ""I"
"trust the Doctor, but perhaps we had better leave him under the"
impression that you are Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise and give no intimation
"of the truth."""
"""I had not hoped that my disguise would deceive you, Baron Ned,"" said"
"George, ""but since it has, it is just as well that we leave Lilly in the"
"dark if we can."""
"""But he will know. The stars will tell him,"" suggested Bettina, opening"
her eyes very wide.
"""The stars will tell him what he is paid to hear,"" I remarked. Then"
"turning to Frances, I asked, ""How is it that you were able to recognize"
"him?"""
"""By his eyes!"" exclaimed Frances and Bettina in concert."
"""That gives me a valuable hint,"" said George, hastily adjusting his"
"colored spectacles. ""Now, how about it?"""

"Brand stared sympathetically at her. ""They treat them very badly?"" he"
asked gently.
"""Terribly! Terribly!"" said Greca, shuddering again."
"""But you seem quite privileged,"" he could not help saying."
"She shook her dainty head pathetically. ""I am of high rank among my"
"people. I am a priestess of our religion, which is the religion of The"
"Great White One who rules all the sky everywhere. The Rogans"" (it was"
the best translation Brand could make of her mental term for the slimy
"tall things that held them captive) ""--the Rogans hold my fate over"
"the heads of my race. Should they rebel, I would be thrown to the"
monster in the pen. Of course the Rogans could crush any revolt with
"their terrible tubes, but they do not want to kill their slaves if"
they can help it. They find it more effective to hold their
"priestesses in hostage."""
Brand turned from personal history to more vital subjects.
"""Why,"" he asked Greca, ""are the shining red squares of metal laid"
"everywhere over this empire of the Rogans?"""
"""To make things light,"" was the reply. ""When the Rogans first came to"
"this mighty sphere, they could hardly move. Things are so heavy here,"
somehow. So their first thought was to drive my enslaved people to the
casting and laying of the metal squares and the metal beams that
"connect them, in order to make things weigh less."""
"shot."""
The patrolman wanted to believe. He most pathetically wanted to believe.
"""Honest?"""
"""It's the God's honest truth. No man could have stood in front of that"
killer and pulled a trigger. He's a master hypnotist. You're all right.
We won't say a word about what happened in here. And you'll have no
"trouble in the future."""
"The patrolman shook his head. ""Still, I gotta do something about it."""
"""Talk to your psychiatrist,"" Taber said. ""In the meantime, keep that"
"crowd out there from spilling in here."""
Taber pushed out through the choked entrance to the areaway and went
back up the street. It was alive with activity now and he passed
unnoticed. No one recognized him as the man who had given chase in the
bloody business that would make headlines that evening in every New York
newspaper.
And yet the radio and TV news commentators gave it no special attention.
It went in along with other items of the day's news as a more or less
routine big-city happening.
"One national-hookup headliner stated: ""In New York City today, a man"
"identified as John Dennis, address unknown, went berserk in a"
"fashionable Upper East Side apartment. Dennis, wielding a knife, killed"
"a man and a woman, and seriously wounded another man before he was cut"
down by police bullets.
"""A jet airliner, down in the North Atlantic today, imperiled the lives"
"uprooting of all your habits,” said he, in a softened voice."
"She smiled. “I can bring them with me,” she said cheerfully. “You won't"
"mind Dandy, will you? He'll soon get used to you. And as for Dickie,”"
"she added, with a touch of wistfulness, “I 'm sure I can find a nice"
home for him.”
John put his arm round her shoulder and gave her the kiss of a shy bear.
"“My good soul,” he cried, “bring fifty million Dickies if you like.” He"
laughed. “There's nothing like the song of birds for the humanizing of
the cockney child.”
"He looked around and beheld the little, gimcrack room with a new vision."
"After all, it was as much an expression of her individuality, and as"
"genuine in the eyes of the high gods, as Herold's exquisitely furnished"
"abode was of Herold's, or the untidy jumble of the room in Fenton Square"
was of his own. And all she had to live upon was a hundred and fifty
"pounds a year, and no artistic instincts or antecedents whatsoever."
“I feel a brute in asking you to give up this little place now that
"you've made it so pretty,” he said."
"Her face brightened at the praise. “It is pretty, is n't it?” Then she"
sighed as her eyes rested fondly on her possessions. “I suppose it would
be too tiny for us all to live here.”
"“I'm afraid it would,” said John. “Besides, we must live in London, on"
account of my work.”
“In London?”
"shall have some of the money,"" said the merchant to himself, ""but not"
"all of it. For he has to thank me for the cat, which I bought for him,"
"and charity begins at home."""
"But while the merchant was thinking these thoughts, such a storm and"
tempest arose that all thought the ship would sink. Then the merchant
realized that there was nothing left for him to do but to promise that
"the boy should have all the money. No sooner had he made his vow, than"
"the weather turned fair, and he had a favoring wind for his journey"
"home. And when he landed, he gave the youth the six hundred dollars and"
his daughter to boot. For now the scullion was as rich as the merchant
"himself and richer, and thereafter he lived in splendor and happiness."
"And he took in his mother and treated her kindly. ""For I do not believe"
"that charity begins at home,"" said the youth."

THE MAGIC APPLES
Once upon a time there was a lad who was better off than all the others.
He showed me his thumbnail; there was no mark on it.
"The newspaper reporters wrote articles and sent telegrams, not only about"
"the Blue Peak and the dreadful death, but about the locality, and about"
"the Tore Peak resort, that haven for the weary, with its wonderful"
buildings set like jewels in the mountains. What a surprise to come here:
"gargoyles, living room, piano, all the latest books, timber outside ready"
"for new jewels in their setting, altogether a magnificent picture of"
Norway's modern farming.
"Yes, indeed, the newspapermen appreciated it. And they did their"
advertising.
The English arrived.
"""Where is Solem?"" they asked, and ""Where is the Blue Peak?"" they asked."
"""We ought to get the hay in,"" said Josephine and the wife at the farm."
"""There'll be rain, and fifty cartloads are still out!"""
"That was all very well, but ""Where is Solem?"" asked the English. So Solem"
"had to go with them. The two casual laborers began to cart away the hay,"
but then the women had no one to help them rake. Confusion was rife.
Everyone rushed wildly hither and thither because there was no one to lead
them.
"The weather stayed fine overnight; it was patient, slow-moving weather. As"
"soon as the dew dried up, more hay would be brought in, perhaps all the"
"hay. Oh, we should manage all right."
"More English appeared; and ""Solem--the Blue Peak?"" they said. Their"
"""If someone 'round here's doing it Cap'n Davies wants to catch him"
himself. He says he doesn't want the reward but he wants to punish the
man who's hurting the honest name of this part of Cape Cod. I think
"that's a grand spirit."""
Lavender's shoulders lifted. Why couldn't someone else save the fair
name of Cape Cod--someone like a crippled boy whom most of the
towns-people looked upon as a loafer?
"""I'd like to catch 'em, myself,"" he said slowly in such a low voice"
that Sidney barely caught the words.
"""Oh, Lav, why not? We have as good a chance as anyone, knowing as much"
"as we do. What'll we do first?"" For Sidney was ready for adventure."
Suddenly Lavender realized that he was gripping the knife in his hand.
He looked down at it.
"""What we ought to do first is to find out how this knife got here."
Let's put it where we found it and go back around the other side of
that schooner so's no one on the _Puritan_'ll see us. Then we can come
"out late this afternoon and if it's gone--well, we'll know someone came"
"to look for it!"""
"""And then we'd know for sure that someone had been on the _Arabella_."""
"""That's the idea. You get on quickly for a girl, Sid. Come on, now,"
"we'll pull the dory round to the starboard side."""
Sidney caught herself tiptoeing across the deck of the_ Arabella_. In
"her excitement she scarcely breathed. Every move, every act, was"
murmured.
"The Mater turned her gentle eyes to the fire, and Dad, clearing his"
throat in a blustering way--though he was not at all a blustering
man--replied:
"""Perhaps it's rather decent of us to have a son who--er, I mean,"
"who--well, er----"""
"""A cruise hits me right,"" I exclaimed, hurriedly coming to his rescue,"
"for neither of us wanted a scene. ""And I'll wire Tommy Davis, Mater--the"
chap you mentioned. He's a corking fellow! I didn't write you how the
battalion started calling him 'Rebel' till he closed up half a dozen
"eyes, did I? You see, in the beginning, when we were rookies, the"
"sergeant had us up in formation to get our names, and when he came to"
"Tommy that innocent drawled: 'Mr. Thomas Jefferson Davis, suh, of"
"Loui'ville, Jefferson county, Kentucky, suh.' You could have heard a pin"
"drop. The sergeant, as hard-boiled as they come, stood perfectly still"
"and let a cold eye bore into him for half a minute, then gasped: 'Gawd!"
"What a wicked little rebel!'"""
They laughed.
"""Why didn't you bring him home with you?"""
"""Same reason he couldn't take me home with him. There were people"
"waiting, and turkey, and--but he won't want to go,"" I added. ""He's crazy"
"about a girl down there!"""
"""Fiddlesticks,"" my father chuckled. ""Any normal fellow'll want to"
"cruise! I'll wire him myself--this very night!"""
"And, be it remembered, for her the doing had been no light ordering--it"
"was a flagellation of her own nakedness with cruel whips; for, as each"
"change obliterated a footprint of the past, the atmosphere in which the"
boy and man had wrought their career swiftly vanished--the very hint of
an early struggle had departed from the place.
Noll felt how the room must have struck Netherby in the face as he
leaped up the stair and flung open the door to be welcomed to its
old genial comradeship after his journey and absence from his beloved
things.
Noll’s eyes came back from his thoughts to rest on the bent shoulders
of the disconsolate man; and Netherby realized that the other had
digested the situation.
"He sighed sadly, his head in his hands:"
“Poor Julia!” he said--“ she must never know. She has done this during
"our absence--as a surprise. And,” he added grimly: “it was!”"
Noll smiled:
"“But, Netherby, my dear old boy; you must not fret. You are famous,"
man----”
“Oh yes--quite. A duchess has asked me to dinner--without my wife.”
Noll put out the light:
"“Let us sit in the dusk for awhile, Netherby, as we have sat many a day"
and settled the affairs of the state. We have laughed at care here;
"""He isn't even thinking of coming, the wretch! ..."""
"""That means that he does not love me!"" sang Deacon Taras, leaning his"
chin on his hand and casting a humorous glance towards the mountain.
At last Petunikoff appeared.  He came in a respectable cart with his
"son playing the role of groom.  The latter was a red-checked,"
"nice-looking youngster, in a long square-cut overcoat.  He wore smoked"
"eyeglasses.  They tied the horse to an adjoining tree, the son took the"
"measuring instrument out of his pocket and gave it to his father, and"
they began to measure the ground.  Both were silent and worried.
"""Aha!"" shouted the Captain, gleefully."
All those who were in the dosshouse at the moment came out to look at
them and expressed themselves loudly and freely in reference to the
matter.
"""What does the habit of thieving mean?  A man may sometimes make a big"
"mistake when he steals, standing to lose more than he gets,"" said the"
"Captain, causing much laughter among his staff and eliciting various"
murmurs of assent.
"""Take care, you devil!"" shouted Petunikoff, ""lest I have you in the"
"police court for your words!"""
"""You can do nothing to me without witnesses ...  Your son cannot give"
"evidence on your side"" ... the Captain warned him."
"""Look out all the same, you old wretch, you may be found guilty too!"""
"And Petunikoff shook his fist at him. His son, deeply engrossed in his"
"truth, I was once a man, though I was not noble.  I care now for"
nothing and nobody ... and all my life has been tame--a sweetheart who
"has jilted me--therefore I despise life, and am indifferent to it."""
"""You lie!"" says Abyedok."
"""I lie?"" roars Aristid Kuvalda, almost crimson with anger."
"""Why shout?"" comes in the cold sad voice of Martyanoff."
"""Why judge others?  Merchants, noblemen ... what have we to do with"
"them?"""
"""Seeing that we are"" ... puts in Deacon Taras."
"""Be quiet, Abyedok,"" says the teacher, goodnaturedly."
"""Why do you provoke him?""  He does not love either discussion or noise,"
and when they quarrel all around him his lips form into a sickly
"grimace, and he endeavours quietly and reasonably to reconcile each"
"with the other, and if he does not succeed in this he leaves the"
"company. Knowing this, the Captain, if he is not very drunk, controls"
"himself, not wishing to lose, in the person of the teacher, one of the"
best of his listeners.
"""I repeat,"" he continues, in a quieter tone, ""that I see life in the"
"hands of enemies, not only enemies of the noble but of everything good,"
"avaricious and incapable of adorning existence in any way."""

"Genoa, Venice, Holland--and all these were merchants, merchants from"
"England, India, the Stroyanoff merchants ..."""
head.
"""One must learn by experience,"" Petunikoff reassured him, lighting a"
cigarette.
"""Learn ...  It is not that, my dear sir; but don't you see there is no"
freedom?  Don't you see what a life I lead?  I live in fear and
trembling ...  I am refused the freedom so desirable to me in my
"movements, and I fear this ghost of a teacher will write about me in"
the papers.  Sanitary inspectors will be called for ... fines will have
to be paid ... or else your lodgers will set fire to the place or rob
and kill me ... I am powerless against them.  They are not the least
"afraid of the police, and they like going to prison, because they get"
"their food for nothing there."""
"""But then we will have them turned out if we come to terms with you,"""
promised Petunikoff.
"""What shall we arrange, then?"" asked Vaviloff, sadly and seriously."
"""Tell me your terms."""
"""Well, give me the six hundred mentioned in the claim."""
"""Won't you take a hundred roubles?"" asked the merchant, calmly, looking"
"attentively at his companion, and smiling softly.  ""I will not give you"
"one rouble more,"" ... he added."
"After this, he took out his eye-glasses, and began cleaning them with"
his handkerchief.  Vaviloff looked at him sadly and respectfully.  The
"calm face of Petunikoff, his grey eyes and clear complexion, every line"
of his thickset body betokened self-confidence and a well-balanced
every moment was precious.
"'Bring nothing but cloaks and food and wine,' I said. 'We have to go a"
league on foot and can carry little.'
"The Countess heard my words, and looked at me with growing"
comprehension. 'The Waldgrave?' she muttered. 'Is he here?'
"He came forward from the door to speak to her; but when she saw him,"
"and how pale and thin he was, with great hollows in his cheeks and his"
"eyes grown too large for his face, she began to cry weakly, as any"
"other woman might have cried, being overwrought. I bade Marie, who"
"alone kept her wits, to bring her wine and make her take it; and in a"
"minute she smiled at us, and would have thanked us."
"'Wait!' I said bluntly, feeling a great horror upon me whenever I"
looked towards the general or caught his eye. 'You may have small
"cause to thank us. If we fail, Heaven and you forgive us, my lady, for"
this man will not. If we are retaken----'
'We will not be retaken!' she cried hardily. 'You have horses?'
"'Five only,' I answered. 'They are all Steve could get, and they are a"
"league away. We must go to them on foot. There are eight of us here,"
and young Jacob and Ernst are watching outside. Are all ready?'
"My lady looked round; her eye fell on Fraulein Max, who with a little"
bundle in her arms had just re-entered and stood shivering by the
"door. The Dutch girl winced under her glance, and dropping her bundle,"
stooped hurriedly to pick it up.
'That woman does not go!' the Countess said suddenly.
squarely in the stomach.
"With a startled, disbelieving look the Japanese stumbled backward,"
crashing over a large chair positioned next to the table. The other
"_kobun_ instantly reached for his holstered Llama, but by then Kenji"
"Nogami had moved, seizing him and momentarily pinning his arms with a"
powerful embrace.
"For her own part, Eva had lunged for Vera and her purse, to neutralize"
"the Walther she carried. Comrade Karanova, however, had already"
"anticipated everything. She whisked back the purse, then plunged her"
"hand in. What she withdrew, though, was not a pistol but a shiny"
cylindrical object made of glass.
"It was three against three, a snapshot of desperation."
"We've got a chance, Vance thought. Keep him down. And get the Llama."
"As the _kobun_ tried to rise, gasping, Vance threw himself over the"
"upturned chair, reaching to pin the man's arms. With a bear-like"
"embrace he had him, the body small and muscular in his arms. Out of the"
corner of his eye he saw Kenji Nogami still grappling with the other
"_kobun_. The computer now lay on the floor, open and askew."
"Where's Eva? He tried to turn and look for her, but there was no sound"
to guide him. Then the _kobun_ wrenched free one arm and brought a fist
"against the side of his face, diverting him back to matters at hand."
Hold him down. Just get the gun.
"He tried to crush his larger frame against the other's slim body,"
forcing the air out of him. Focus.
But the wiry man was stronger than he looked. With a twist he rolled
over and pinned Vance's shoulders against the carpet. Vance felt the
"shag, soft against his skin, and couldn't believe how chilly it felt."
"But now he had his hand on the _kobun's_ throat, holding him in a"
powerful grip while jamming a free elbow against the holster.
Cut off his oxygen. Don't let him breathe.
"The old moves were coming back, the shortcuts that would bring a more"
powerful opponent to submission. He pressed a thumb against the man's
"windpipe, shutting off his air. A look of surprise went through the"
"_kobun's_ eyes as he choked, letting his hold on Vance's shoulders"
slacken.
Now.
He shoved the man's arm aside and reached for the holster. Then his
hand closed around the hard grip of the Llama. The Japanese was weaker
"now, but still forcing his arm away from the gun, preventing him from"
getting the grip he needed.
"He rammed an elbow against the man's chin, then tightened his finger on"
the grip of the Llama. He almost had it.
"With his other hand he shoved the _kobun_'s face away, clawing at his"
"eyes, and again they rolled over, with the Japanese once more against"
the carpet. But now he had the gun and he was turning.
"He felt a sharp jab in his back, a flash of pain that seemed to come"
"from nowhere. It was both intense and numbing, as though his spine had"
"been caught in a vise. Then he felt his heart constrict, his"
difficult to make out whether the men had left the boat or not. Once
Lav crawled to the top of the companion ladder but a muttering like a
human voice drove him back. Queer sounds struck upon their sensitized
ears. And the boat seemed to lift to a new motion.
They waited for an interminable time. Then Mart spoke quickly.
"""Lav, we're moving!"""
"Lav needed no warning. He, too, had missed the pull of the boat on the"
anchor rope. He shot up the ladder.
"""Oh, what's the matter?"" cried Sidney and Pola, forgetting all caution."
"Mart had no time to explain her fears. In an instant Lav was back,"
fairly throwing himself into the cabin.
"""We're drifting! They cut the anchor rope! We're drifting out! Fast!"
"Way out! To sea!"""
"That had been the ""better scheme."" To cut the _Arabella_ free from its"
mooring and let the wind and tide carry it out into the bay. At first
Starrow had not favored the plan; he had declared that it was too much
"risk, that the wind was shifting and freshening fast and that the old"
"tub might open a seam, but Joe Josephs had convinced him with: ""the"
_Arabella_ would be good for a week out in a nastier sea than this.
It's safer than riskin' runnin' afoul one of Phin Davies' men ashore.
Guthrie's _Sally_'ll stand this squall and pick up the _Arabella_ easy
"and we can reckon sure on the course the old tub'll take, even 'lowin'"
"for the wind to shift."""
As she comprehended what had happened Pola screamed. Mart and Sidney
the wardrobe top.
"In that same moment Johnson was standing in the parting of the curtains,"
his hand raised warningly. In another moment he was over to the door
"where, after taking his pistols from his overcoat pockets, he stood in a"
"cool, determined attitude, fingering his weapons."
"""But some one's ben callin',"" the Girl was saying, at the very moment"
when above the loud roaring of the wind another knock was heard on the
"cabin door. ""Who can it be?"" she asked as if to herself, and calmly went"
"over to the table, where she took up the candle and lit it."
"Springing to her side, Johnson whispered tensely:"
"""Don't answer--you can't let anyone in--they wouldn't understand."""
The Girl eyed him quizzically.
"""Understand what?"" And before he had time to explain, much less to check"
"her, she was standing at the window, candle in hand, peering out into"
the night.
"""Why, it's the posse!"" she cried, wheeling round suddenly. ""How did they"
"ever risk it in this storm?"""
At these words a crushed expression appeared on Johnson's countenance;
"an uncanny sense of insecurity seized him. Once more the loud, insistent"
"pounding was repeated, and as before, the outlaw, his hands on his guns,"
commanded her not to answer.
"""But what on earth do the boys want?"" inquired the Girl, seemingly"
"oblivious to what he was saying. Indeed, so much so that as the voice of"
"By mutual consent, Mrs. Carmichael and Beatrice ceased to talk, but"
"when suddenly there was a movement close to them, and a dim light"
"flashed over the partition, they exchanged a glance of meaning."
"""That is my husband,"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered. ""Something is going"
"to happen. Listen!"""
She was not wrong in her supposition. The Colonel had entered the next
"room, followed by Nicholson and Saunders, and had closed the door"
carefully after him. All three men carried lanterns. They glanced
instinctively at the wooden partition which divided them from the four
"women, but Carmichael shook his head."
"""It's all right,"" he said. ""They must be fast asleep, poor souls."
"Let's have a look at these fellows."" He went over to a huddled-up"
figure lying in the shadow. The corner of a military cloak had been
thrown over the face. He drew it on one side and then let it drop.
"""Gone!"" he said laconically. He passed on to the next. There were in"
"all three men ranged against the wall. Two of them were dead. ""Martins"
"told me they couldn't last,"" Colonel Carmichael muttered. ""It is"
"better for them. They are out of it a little sooner, that's all."" The"
"third man was Travers. He lay on his back, his face turned slightly"
"toward the wall, his eyes closed. He seemed asleep. The Colonel nodded"
"somberly. ""Another ten hours,"" he calculated."
"He came back to the table, where the others waited, and drew out a"
paper from his pocket.
"""Give me your light a moment, Nicholson,"" he said."
No one spoke while he examined the list before him. All around them
“And do you like Rome; eh?”
"“I should say so! At first, I didn’t, I must admit. It was a"
disappointment to me. I had dreamed so much about Rome!” and Kennedy
talked of the books and guides he had read about the Eternal City.
"“I must admit that I had never dreamed about Rome,” said Cæsar. “And"
you boast of that?” asked Laura.
"“No, I don’t boast of it, I merely state it. I understand how agreeable"
it is to know things. Cæsar died here! Cicero made speeches here! Saint
Peter stumbled over this stone! It is fine! But not knowing things
is also very comfortable. I am rather like a barbarian walking
indifferently among monuments he knows nothing about.”
“Doesn’t such an idea make you ashamed?”
"“No, why? It would be a bother to me to know a lot of things offhand. To"
"pass by a mountain and know how it was thrown up, what it is composed"
"of, what its flora and fauna are; to get to a town and know its history"
in detail.... What things to be interested in! It’s tiresome! I hate
"history too much. I far prefer to be ignorant of everything, and"
"especially the past, and from time to time to offer myself a capricious,"
arbitrary explanation.”
"“But I think that knowing things not only is not tiresome,” said"
"Kennedy, “but is a great satisfaction.”"
“You think even learning things is a satisfaction?”
“Thousands of years ago one could know things almost without learning
"them; nowadays in order to know, one has to learn. That is natural and"
"“I’m afraid it wouldn’t do much good in case of an attack,” Ned"
suggested. “We’d soon get hungry and thirsty and have to surrender.”
"“Anyway, it’s an all right thing to shoot from!” Jimmie announced. “If"
"you’d seen the way we sweat rolling those rocks, you’d think it was all"
"right, anyway. I wonder where the boys are.”"
"“I was thinking more about the boys than about the barricade,” Ned"
admitted. “Were they all here when you left?”
"“All sitting in front of the entrance,” Jimmie replied, “except Gilroy,"
and he was asleep on a pile of blankets in the cave.”
"“He may be there yet,” suggested Ned. “Suppose we go and see.”"
"Jimmie made his way through the narrow entrance, found a searchlight,"
and turned a round circle of flame on a great heap of blankets in a back
corner. There was no one in the cave at all save only himself.
"Before returning to report to Ned, the hungry boy seized a plate of corn"
pones and a can of tinned beans from the provision chest.
"“Look here, Ned,” he said in a moment, appearing before his chum with"
"his mouth full of beans, “the appetite of our midnight visitor seems to"
be for confidential clerks as well as for bread. Someone has stolen
"Gilroy! Anyway, he’s not in the cave!”"
"“He may have gone away with the boys,” suggested Ned."
"“He wasn’t thinking of going away with the boys when I left,” Jimmie"
"answered. “He was telling how much he liked New York, and how he’d like"
"this way, Mr. Gilroy,” he went on, “the bears out here are hungry for"
"fat clerks from Wall street. I’ve heard they make stews of ’em,” he"
concluded.
Gilroy now arose to his feet and stood gazing into the thicket in the
direction of the bear’s disappearance. Jimmie’s assertion that bruin
would hit the Arctic circle early the next morning seemed to give him
"great comfort. As the distance between the bear and himself increased,"
he grew braver and began throwing out his chest.
"“What a chance that was for me to kill a bear!” he began, boastfully,"
"“If I’d only had a gun with me, I might have had a fine rug made out of"
his hide! It would have been fine to show my friends.”
“Sure it would!” declared Jimmie. “I’m glad you didn’t remember that you
had a gun in your pocket. The bears out here are pretty sensitive about
"being shot at. If you’d blazed away at that cub, and hadn’t shot him"
"dead in his tracks the first time, he would have eaten you.”"
Gilroy put his hand to his pistol pocket and a look of pretended
amazement came over his fat face.
"“Upon my word!” he said, “I thought I left my gun in the bunk!”"
"“After this,” Ned advised, “always keep your gun in sight when you go"
"into the forest. Suppose there had been no tree to climb, what then?”"
"“I should have grappled with him, sir!” exclaimed Gilroy. “I certainly"
should have grappled with him.”
"“You would have had to catch him first,” Jimmie grinned."
"words on any subject as fast as pen could travel, no matter what torture"
"burned his brain, could not find a foolish message for a sick child. At"
last he wrote like a school-boy:
"_Darling: The flowers were beautiful, and so is the new picture, and I"
want to see you early in the morning. I hope you are well. John Risca._
And he had to tear the letter out of its envelope and put it into a
fresh one because he had omitted to add the magic initials “G. H. B.” to
"his name. Compared with his usual imaginative feats of correspondence,"
this was a poverty-stricken epistle. She would wonder at the change.
"Perhaps his demand for an immediate interview would startle her, and"
"shocks were dangerous. He tore up the letter and envelope, and went to"
his own room. It was past two o'clock when he crept downstairs again to
lay his letter on the hall table.
At the sight of him the next morning the color deepened in the delicate
"cheeks of Stellamaris, and her dark eyes grew bright. She held out a"
welcoming hand.
"“Ah, Belovedest, I 've been longing to see you ever since dawn. I woke"
up then and could n't go to sleep again because I was so excited.”
"He took the chair by her bedside, and her fingers tapped affectionately"
on the back of the great hand that lay on the coverlid.
"“I suppose I was excited, too,” said he, “for I was awake at dawn.”"
“Did you look out of window?”
"“Yes,” said John."
to pound his ear for about three days and nights.”
"“Anyway,” Ned decided, “we’ll wait here a little while and see if they"
"don’t return. In the meantime, you can get yourself something to eat.”"
“Don’t you call this something to eat?” asked Jimmie.
“One poor little can of beans and one poor little plate of corn pones
"won’t make much of an impression on your appetite,” Ned laughed. “What"
"you need is one of those neat little bear steaks, about as large as a"
warming pan. You’ll have plenty of time in which to cook it.”
"“And that means that I can cook one for you, too?” asked Jimmie."
"“Why, of course you can!” returned Ned."
“I’d like to cook one for the Boy Scout who got us both into such
"trouble,” Jimmie declared. “I’d put poison on it!”"
"“Now, don’t you be too severe on that Boy Scout,” Ned advised."
"“According to your own story, he warned you and Frank in the thicket,"
"and I know very well that he wanted to tell me something, but didn’t"
dare do it.”
"“Well, here’s another thing,” Jimmie explained. “When I went out to look"
"for you, I gave the ‘help’ smoke signal from the top of a granite rock"
in the pines. In five minutes after the columns of smoke became large
"enough to be seen at a distance, the signal was answered from the north,"
"it seemed to me from the vicinity of the old mission. Now, of course,"
you didn’t send out that signal.”
"“I rather think not,” smiled Ned."
friend?'
"'Like this, my lord?' I muttered stupidly."
"He nodded. 'Yes, like this,' he repeated. 'I have heard him called a"
"brave man. Coming of his stock, he should be; and when I saw him in"
"Tzerclas' camp he had the air of one. Now he starts at a shadow, is in"
"a trance half his time, and a tremor the other half. What ails him?'"
"I told him how he had been wounded, fighting bravely, and that since"
that he had not been himself.
"Count Hugo rubbed his chin gravely. 'It is a pity,' he said. 'We want"
all--every German arm and every German head. We want you. Man alive!'
"he continued, roused to anger, I suppose, by my dull face, 'do you"
know what is in front of you?'
"'No, my lord,' I said in apathy."
He opened his mouth as if to hurl a volley of words at me. But he
"thought better of it and shut his lips tight. 'Very well,' he said"
grimly. 'Wait three days and you will see.'
"But in truth, I had not to wait three days. Before sunset of the next"
"I began to see, and, downcast as I was, to prick up my ears in wonder."
"Beyond Romhild and between that town and Bamberg, the great road which"
"runs through the valley of the Pegnitz, was such a sight as I had"
never seen. For many miles together a column of dust marked its
"course, and under this went on endless marching. We were but a link in"
"a long chain, dragging slowly southwards. Now it was a herd of"
"oxen that passed along, moving tediously and painfully, driven by"
half-naked cattle-men and guarded by a troop of grimy horse. Now it
"“Thanks,” said Mrs. Winstanley, and then, suddenly looking at Yvonne--"
"“Mercy, my dear! How white you are!”"
"“There’s nothing the matter with me,” said Yvonne, trying to smile."
"“It’s past our _déjeuner_ hour,” said the Canon, briskly. “You want some"
food.”
"“Perhaps I do,” said Yvonne."
"She went with the Canon on to the _digue_, and walked along the shady"
"side, by the hotels, past the gay terraces thronged with lunching"
guests. But all the glamour had gone from the place. An hour had changed
it. And that hour seemed a black abyss separating her from happiness.
"An hour ago she had looked upon this kind, grave man who walked by"
her side as her husband. Now what was he to her? She shrank from the
"thought, terrified, and came nearer to him, touching the flying skirt of"
his coat as if to take strength from him.
"They entered the crowded dining-room, where the _maître d’hôtel_ had"
"reserved them a table. She struggled bravely through part of the meal,"
strove to keep up a conversation. But the strain was too great. Another
"five minutes, she felt, would make her hysterical. She rose, with an"
"excuse to the Canon, and escaped to her room."
There she flung herself down on the bed and buried her face in the cool
pillows. It was a relief to be alone with her fright and dismay. She
"strove to think, but her head was in a whirl. The incidents of the late"
"scene came luridly before her mind, and she shivered with revulsion. A"
rough hand had been laid on the butterfly and brushed the dust from its
hysteric desire to talk loudly and hide his chagrin; and he turned at
"the sound of Fosse’s voice, raised in argument, as hyena goes to offal."
"Fosse in his despair had turned from Sir Gilders, and launched into the"
discussion round about him:
"“In the arts,” he was saying, “woman does not, cannot, shine. She only"
exists--on sufferance. A woman’s province----”
Myre had strolled towards the voice:
"“I am flattered to find,” said he, “that Mr. Fosse has been reading me."
He is right. A woman’s province is to be beautiful; and if she write
at all she may write of the nursery--of the domesticities. A woman
has not the experiences of life--she writes only from intuition. She
cannot experience the emotions of a man--cannot describe all shades of
life--is too careful of her skirts to have been on the heights and in
the gutters----”
Lovegood coughed:
"“Never,” said he, with big deliberate voice--“never shall I again"
approach a municipal sewer without an ecstatic thrill.”
Quogge Myre took no notice of the shaft:
"“A woman,” said he, “cannot be in the thrash and fume of life. She only"
peeps out fearfully over the window-blind at the doings of the world.
She has not physical strength----”
Somebody coughed:
“Tra-la-lee!” said he--“opera--bouffe--bouffe--bouffe.”
and awful death. Montagu Askew was in the business. He was one of the
few that came out alive.
"In the rush of the distraught ladies, princesses, duchesses, maids, to"
"the sole outlet of the seething hell, Montagu Askew got caught near the"
door--frantic hands of terrified women clutched at him for help--he was
almost within reach of the free air--could see the sunlight a few paces
"before him--a frightened girl clung to his arm in the awful crush, then"
"another--women’s skirts got under foot as they made for the door, and"
"they went down. He tried to shake himself clear of the two girls, he"
was a little slender man.... The heat was hellish.... One of the girls
"tripped on her skirt and fell, clinging to him. He beat her down with"
the jade-handled cane--fought his way blindly through the rush of women
for the door--stood at last out in the sunlight.
"Some coachmen were dashing into the fiery furnace, lifting up and"
"bringing out fainting women, whose muslin skirts were in flames."
But Monty Askew was frightened.
He smoothed his ruffled dress and went home.
"Montagu Askew, entering a café with Rupert Greppel one evening, saluted"
"Noll Baddlesmere, where he stood amongst a group of students; and a"
silence fell upon the place.
Noll nodded:
"“That’s a handsome cane, Askew,” said he--“though they tell me the"
women have a poor opinion of it.”
"Aubrey at the mantelpiece, gazing at himself in the mirror, said simply:"
“Bosh!”
"“Rather a dramatic situation when you come to think of it, eh?” said"
"Fluffy Reubens, lolling his full length in the easy-chair."
"Rippley, his hands in his trousers pockets, considered the situation"
with reflective eye fixed on the carpet:
"“And a rippin’ dramatic emotion, eh! To feel one’s self being wrangled"
about from one end of the country to the other----”
Aubrey turned languidly from the mirror:
"“Ah!” said he, “and then to listen to it all, robed in the delightful"
invisible cloak of pseudonymity!”
Rippley laughed drily:
"“No, no, Aubrey, old man--that wouldn’t have suited you at all. You"
wouldn’t have lasted at it for a fortnight.”
Lovegood smiled:
"“We need not get into the quarrelsome stage about it yet,” he said in"
his big deep voice: “We shall be tearing him to pieces in magazine
articles to-morrow and flinging him to the dogs of the lower journalism
to snarl at before the year is out.... The failures are always
suspicious of popularity.”
"Aubrey turned to the mirror again, and said “Bosh!”"
pillow.
I held my breath.  The awful truth was distinctly apparent.  I placed my
"hand upon her heart, the bodice of her dress being already unloosened."
"Then a few seconds later I drew back, standing rigid and aghast."
"""Why, she's dead!""  I gasped."
"""Yes,"" the Countess said, covering her face with her hands and bursting"
"into tears.  ""My poor Yolande! she is dead--_dead_!"""
The discovery appalled me.  Only a couple of hours before we had chatted
"together, and she seemed in the best of health and spirits, just as in"
"the old days, until I had made the announcement of Wolf's presence in"
Paris.  The effect of that statement upon her had apparently been
"electrical.  Why, I knew not.  Had she not implored me to save her?"
This in itself was sufficient to show that she held him in deadly fear.
"Again I bent in order to make further examination, but saw the"
unmistakable mark of death upon her countenance.  The lower jaw had
"dropped, the checks were cold, and the silver hand-mirror which I had"
snatched from the table and held at her mouth was unclouded.  There was
"no movement--no life.  Yolande, my well-beloved of those long-past days,"
was dead.
I stood there at the bedside like a man in a dream.  So swiftly had she
been struck down that the terrible truth seemed impossible of
realisation.
"The Countess, standing beside me, sobbed bitterly.  Truly the scene in"
that darkened chamber was a strange and impressive one.  Never before in
my whole life had I been in the presence of the dead.
The grim smile on the countenance of old Pépe of the Eleven Wounds grew
yet more grim.
"""No gipsy planned it and no man!"" he said sententiously. ""Come hither,"
"Chica!"""
And out from among the listening throng came a girl of thirteen or
"fourteen, dressed neatly and simply in a grey linen blouse belted at the"
"waist with a leather belt. A gay plaid, striped of orange and crimson,"
"hung neatly folded over her shoulder, and she rested her small sunburnt"
hand on the silver hilt of a pistol. Black elf-locks escaped from
beneath a red silk kerchief knotted saucily after the fashion of her
"companions. But her eyes, instead of being beady and black with that"
"far-away contemplative look which characterises the children of Egypt,"
were bright and sunny and blue as the Mediterranean itself in the front
of spring.
"""Come hither, Chica--be not afraid,"" repeated old Pépe of the Eleven"
"Wounds, ""this is a great man--the greatest of all our race. You have"
"heard of him--as who, indeed, has not!"""
Chica nodded with a quick elfish grin of intense pleasure and
"appreciation. ""I was listening,"" she said, ""I heard all. And I"
"saw--would that I could see it again. Oh, if only the like would happen"
"to me!"""
"""Tell the noble Don José who you are, my pretty Chica,"" said Pépe,"
soothingly.
But the child stamped her sandalled foot. It was still white at the
"instep, and the sergeant could see by the blue veins that she had not"
CHAPTER XIV
"""SALLIE HARRIS"""
Sallie's first startled impulse was to deny the new identity Slyne had
so glibly bestowed on her. It seemed too preposterous to be believable;
"and she was very suspicious of him. A little flushed, more than a little"
"afraid, and yet in some sense convinced in spite of herself by the"
outward and visible signs about her that all these strange happenings
"must have at least some foundation of fact, she sought to read the"
others' thoughts in their faces.
"The Marquis of Ingoldsby was gaping at her, in open wonder and"
"admiration. Slyne's features wore a subdued expression of triumph, and"
"Captain Dove's a dazed, incredulous frown. Mr. Jobling was beaming about"
"him, so apparently satisfied with her, so respectably prosperous-looking"
himself that her doubts as to Slyne's good faith began to give way. When
the lawyer was in turn presented to her and also addressed her by that
"new name, she could scarcely disclaim it."
"""You'll stay and have luncheon with us, Lord Ingoldsby?"" Slyne remarked,"
touching the bell; and his lordship left off gaping at Sallie to look
him over with all the solemn sagacity of a young owl in broad daylight.
"""Er--all right,"" his lordship at length agreed. ""Don't mind if I do."
"""Though I have some--er--friends waitin' for me,"" he added as an"
"found him. He didn't come down in the morning, and, as she couldn't make"
"him hear, she forced the door, and found him with his throat cut."""
"""Awful!"" shuddered Lady Eynesford. ""He looked such a respectable man"
"too."""
"""Ah, I fancy he'd gone a bit to the bad lately--taken to drinking and so"
"on."""
"""He was a friend of Mr. Kilshaw's, wasn't he?"" asked Alicia."
"""A sort of hanger-on, I think. Anyhow, there he was dead, and with his"
"pockets empty."""
"""Perhaps he killed himself,"" she suggested."
"""They think not. They've arrested the woman, but she declares she knows"
"nothing about it!"""
"""Poor man!"" said Alicia; and, at another time, she might have thought a"
good deal about the horrible end of a man whom she had known as an
"acquaintance. But, as it was, she soon forgot him again, and, leaving"
"the rest, returned to her solitary seat."
"In the town, the news of the murder was but one ruffle more on the wave"
"of excitement, and not a very marked one. Few people knew Benham's"
"name, and when the first agitation following on the discovery of the"
"body died away and the onlookers found there was no news to be had, they"
turned away to join the processions or to stare at them. The police were
"left to pursue their investigations in peace, and they soon reached a"
"conclusion. The landlady of the house where Benham died lived alone,"
save for the occasional presence of her son: he was away at work in an
and a glass; but in the act of pouring out a drink for him there came a
"loud rap on the window, and quickly looking round she saw Rance's"
"piercing eyes peering into the room. For an instant she paled, but then"
there flashed through her mind the comforting thought that the Sheriff
"could not possibly see Johnson from his position. So, after giving the"
"latter his drink, she waited quietly until a rap at the door told her"
"that Rance had left the window when, her eye having lit on the ladder"
"that was held in place on the ceiling, she quickly ran over to it and"
"let it down, saying:"
"""Go up the ladder! Climb up there to the loft You're the man that's got"
"my first kiss an' I'm goin' to save you . . ."""
"""Oh, no, not here,"" protested Johnson, stubbornly."
"""Do you want them to see you in my cabin?"" she cried reproachfully,"
trying to lift him to his feet.
"""Oh, hurry, hurry . . .!"""
With the utmost difficulty Johnson rose to his feet and catching the
rounds of the ladder he began to ascend. But after going up a few rounds
"he reeled and almost fell off, gasping:"
"""I can't make it--no, I can't . . ."""
"""Yes, you can,"" encouraged the Girl; and then, simultaneously with"
"another loud knock on the door: ""You're the man I love an' you"
"must--you've got to show me the man that's in you. Oh, go on, go on,"
"jest a step an' you'll git there."""
"""But I can't,"" came feebly from the voice above. Nevertheless, the next"
"""By the time I'm through here, Sallie will be ready to go ashore."""
"Captain Dove looked very fiercely at him, but without effect."
"""Sallie won't stir a step from the ship,"" the old man affirmed, ""till"
"you've handed over the cash."""
"Slyne looked up, in mild surprise."
"""But, dear me! Dove,"" he remarked, ""you don't expect that the London"
lawyer's going to take my word for a girl he's never even seen? Until
"he's satisfied on that point, he won't endorse my note to you. So we've"
_got_ to take her along with us. I'm doing my best to give you a square
"deal; and all I ask in return is a square deal from you."""
"""You'd better not try any crooked games with me,"" growled Captain Dove,"
and sat for a time sunk in obviously aggravating reflections.
"""If we get on his soft side,"" suggested Slyne insidiously, ""there's no"
"saying how much more we might both make."""
Captain Dove rose and retired into his sleeping-cabin without further
"words; while Slyne, picking out with a two-pronged fork the cleanest of"
"the beans on his plate, smiled sneeringly to himself."
"""What's the latest long-shore fashion, Slyne?"" the old man asked after"
an interval. Slyne knew by his tone that he had dismissed dull care from
his mind and was prepared to be quarrelsome again.
"""It wouldn't suit a figure like yours,"" he answered coolly, and was"
"gratified to hear another hoarse growl. For, strange though it may seem,"
"Captain Dove was not without vanity. ""All you really need to worry about"
"standing, his great height bringing him so near to the low boards of the"
loft where her lover was lying that it seemed as though he must hear the
"wounded man's breathing, all other feelings were swept away by"
overwhelming fear. With the one thought that she must get rid of
"him,--do anything, say anything, but get rid of him quickly, she forced"
"herself forward, with extended hand, and said in a voice that held out"
new promise:
"""Good-night. Jack Rance,--good-night!"""
"Rance seized the hand with an almost fierce gladness in both his own,"
"his keen glance hungrily striving to read her face. Then, suddenly, he"
"released her, drawing back his hand with a quick sharpness."
"""Why, look at my hand! There's blood on it!"" he said."
"And even as he spoke, under the yellow flare of the lamp, the Girl saw a"
"second drop of blood fall at her feet. Like a flash, the terrible"
significance of it came upon her. Only by self-violence could she keep
"her glance from rising, tell-tale, to the boards above."
"""Oh, I'm so sorry,"" she heard herself saying contritely, all the time"
"desperately groping to invent a reason; at length, she added futilely:"
"""I must have scratched you."""
"Rance looked puzzled, staring at the spatter of red as though"
hypnotised.
"""No, there's no scratch there,"" he contended, wiping off the blood with"
his handkerchief.
"""Oh, yes, there is,"" insisted the Girl tremulously; ""that is, there will"
Tildy could not keep the delightful secret. When trade was slack she
went and stood at Bogle’s desk. Her eyes were shining; she tried not to
let her words sound proud and boastful.
"“A gentleman insulted me to-day,” she said. “He hugged me around the"
waist and kissed me.”
"“That so?” said Bogle, cracking open his business armour. “After this"
week you get a dollar a week more.”
At the next regular meal when Tildy set food before customers with whom
"she had acquaintance she said to each of them modestly, as one whose"
merit needed no bolstering:
“A gentleman insulted me to-day in the restaurant. He put his arm
around my waist and kissed me.”
"The diners accepted the revelation in various ways—some incredulously,"
some with congratulations; others turned upon her the stream of
badinage that had hitherto been directed at Aileen alone. And Tildy’s
"heart swelled in her bosom, for she saw at last the towers of Romance"
rise above the horizon of the grey plain in which she had for so long
travelled.
For two days Mr. Seeders came not again. During that time Tildy
"established herself firmly as a woman to be wooed. She bought ribbons,"
"and arranged her hair like Aileen’s, and tightened her waist two"
inches. She had a thrilling but delightful fear that Mr. Seeders would
rush in suddenly and shoot her with a pistol. He must have loved her
desperately; and impulsive lovers are always blindly jealous.
(_b_) The wife of a knight or baronet is _Lady_. Whether this title
precedes or follows her forename depends upon whether she had a title
before her marriage.
"That is, if Lady Mary Smith marries Sir John Brown (either knight or"
"baronet), she is _Lady Mary Brown_, also if Hon. Mary Smith marries"
Sir John Brown (knight or baronet) she is _Lady Mary Brown_; but if
"Miss Mary Smith marries Sir John Brown (knight or baronet), she becomes"
"_Mary, Lady Brown_."
"(_c_) A maid of honor retains her _Hon._ after marriage, unless, of"
"course, it is merged into a higher title."
"Thus, if she marries a baronet she is the _Honᵇˡᵉ Lady Brown_; if a"
"peer, the _Lady So and So_. In either case as though she had been a"
peer's daughter.
(_d_) The wife of an earl's (or higher peer's) younger son is never the
_Honᵇˡᵉ Lady_; if she used the _Lady_ before marriage in her own right
"she does not, of course, add anything by such marriage, but the wife"
of a younger son of a lower peer than an earl is _Honᵇˡᵉ Mrs._ (not
"_Lady_)--the younger children of all peers using, of course, the family"
"name, with or without their forenames, according to their rank."
(_e_) If the lady to whom the title _Hon._ belongs in virtue of her
"father's rank marries a commoner, she retains her title, becoming"
"_Hon. Lady_ if she marries a knight or baronet, and _Hon. Mrs._ if her"
husband has no title.
None of these courtesy titles is inherited by the children of those who
"bear them, the third generation of even the highest peer being simply"

"There is one problem in the history of human thought, which, however"
conscious we might be of the multiplicity and historical contingency
"of philosophical problems, yet can appear to us as the ultimate or"
"central one, if only because it is an abstract interrogation describing"
"the attitude of the philosopher, and to which every concrete logical"
"research, every act of thought, can be reduced. It is Pilate's"
question: _Quid est veritas?_ What is truth?
"The question itself has no definite meaning, until it receives from the"
"individual thinker a definite content, which is history or experience,"
and the infinite variety of the answers it has received is due to the
infinite variability of that content. But at all times man has been

companionway door.
"""I come again,"" he smiled apologetically, ""because tomorrow our journeys"
"part, and I have shown scant consideration for your kindness."""
"""It's we who feel the obligation,"" Tommy murmured. ""Now, if we could"
"only help you find the child--supposing, of course, that's what you're"
"watching for!"""
"Monsieur gave a deep sigh, appearing to be quite overcome by a secret"
"grief; but after a moment he looked at us, asking ingenuously:"
"""You think my behavior unusual?"""
"""Well, since you make a point of it,"" I laughed, and hesitated."
"""I see, I see! But, my young friends, you must take my word that I"
"cannot tell you much."" He drew us nearer. ""This I may say: that, after"
"Roumania dropped out of the war, the new Chancellor of Azuria wired"
imploringly for me to leave my classes at the University and come to
"him--because for years I have advised with Azurian statesmen, frequently"
going on special missions. By the recent death of the old Chancellor a
certain paper came to light. This was a secret agent's report sent from
Havana in 1914----I may not divulge its contents. But for the war it
would have been followed up at once. Whether the same hopes exist
"now--well, I am here to discover. Ah, my young friends,"" his voice"
"trembled, ""much depends upon this! I must--I must find the child if it"
"lives!"""
Tommy's eyes grew round.

"Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. ""Notice! Passengers"
"not permitted past this point!"" A big sign in red."
I peeked around the corner. I knew it--the next deck was the hull. I
"could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the"
velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed
existed in the Universe.
"There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this"
"distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely."
If I just took one quick look....
But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.
"Then I saw the big red sign again. ""Passengers not permitted--"""
Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth
"Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And"
didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to
get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the
"careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to"
men.
"""Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You"
"can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth"
"Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this"
"clause--'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,"
this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations
"pertaining'--and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that"
you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.
"No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men."""
He went back into the drawing-room.  There they were--just passing the
"side of the house. Five minutes, and they would be down at the turning."
"He stood at the window, waiting.  If only that fellow did not come in!"
Through the partition wall he could hear him still tramping up and down
the dining-room.  What a long time a minute was!  Three had gone when he
"heard the dining-room door opened, and Fiorsen crossing the hall to the"
"front door.  What was he after, standing there as if listening?  And"
"suddenly he heard him sigh.  It was just such a sound as many times, in"
"the long-past days, had escaped himself, waiting, listening for"
"footsteps, in parched and sickening anxiety. Did this fellow then really"
"love--almost as he had loved?  And in revolt at spying on him like this,"
he advanced and said:
"""Well, I won't wait any longer."""
Fiorsen started; he had evidently supposed himself alone.  And Winton
thought: 'By Jove! he does look bad!'
"""Good-bye!"" he said; but the words: ""Give my love to Gyp,"" perished on"
their way up to his lips.
"""Good-bye!"" Fiorsen echoed.  And Winton went out under the trellis,"
conscious of that forlorn figure still standing at the half-opened door.
Betty was nowhere in sight; she must have reached the turning.  His
"mission had succeeded, but he felt no elation.  Round the corner, he"
"picked up his convoy, and, with the perambulator hoisted on to the taxi,"
"journeyed on at speed.  He had said he would explain in the cab, but the"
only remark he made was:
"""You'll all go down to Mildenham to-morrow."""
"And Betty, who had feared him ever since their encounter so many years"
"""Yes,"" he answered, ""and I shall visit him without delay."""
"""In Paris?"" I asked, not quite sure that Monsieur le Grand was King Louis"
"of France, and not desiring to know certainly."
"""In Paris,"" he answered, giving me to understand by his manner that he"
must tell me nothing more definite of Le Grand's identity.
"""Don't tell me what you know of the business this letter refers to, but"
"tell me whether you know,"" I said, hoping that George might at least tell"
me it meant good fortune for him.
"""I cannot even conjecture the business upon which I am wanted,"" he said,"
"""but I hope that it may give me an opportunity to be of service to the"
"writer."""
Thus I was relieved of the disagreeable task of trying to induce George
"to leave England, and was very thankful to escape it."
"After a long silence, during which he read the one-line letter many"
"times, he asked:--"
"""Are you willing to bring Frances to me early to-morrow morning, if she"
"will come?"""
"""Doubtless I can,"" I answered. ""Her willingness to come has been shown"
"all too plainly of late; but ought I bring her?"""
"""Yes. It will be the last time I shall ever see her unless good fortune"
"lies in this letter, and for that I hardly dare hope. You know that when"
"a man's luck has been against him for a long time, it kills the very"
roots of hope and brings him almost to doubt certainty. Soon after I have
official? But the very German nurses and doctors at the Red Cross
hospital had spoken of her having given free treatment in her Home
"to Germans who needed immediate operations, and for whom there was"
no room in the military hospitals--And for such a trivial offence as
_that_--and to kill her before there could be any appeal for
reconsideration or clemency. Oh _what_ a nation! She would tend
their sick and wounded no more.
She hurried on up the ascent of the Boulevard of the Botanic Garden
on her way to the Rue Royale. She burst into von Giesselin's office.
He was not there. A clerk looking at her rather closely said that
"the Herr Oberst was packing, was going away. Vivie scarcely took in"
"the meaning of his German phrases. She waited there, her eyes"
"ablaze, feeling she must tell her former friend and protector what"
she thought of his people before she renounced any further
relations with him.
"Presently he entered, his usually rather florid face pale with"
"intense sorrow or worry, his manner preoccupied. She burst out:"
"""_Have_ you seen the Red Placard they have just put up?"""
"""What about?"" he said wearily."
"""The assassination by your Government of Edith Cavell, a crime for"
"which England--yes, and America--will _never_ forgive you.... From"
"this moment I--"""
"""But have you not heard what has happened to _me_? I am _dismissed_"
"from my post as Secretary, I am ordered to rejoin my regiment in"
Lorraine--It is very sad about your Miss Cavell. I knew nothing of
it till this morning when I received my own dismissal--And _oh_ my

"had, as he saw it. And yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this"
girl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and
all objects.
"“This way of living that you speak of,” she said, “sounds so futile and"
purposeless. Haven’t you any work to do in the world that might
interest you more?”
"“My dear Miss Marian,” he exclaimed—“work! Think of dressing every day"
"for dinner, of making half a dozen calls in an afternoon—with a"
policeman at every corner ready to jump into your auto and take you to
"the station, if you get up any greater speed than a donkey cart’s gait."
We do-nothings are the hardest workers in the land.”
"The dinner was concluded, the waiter generously fed, and the two walked"
out to the corner where they had met. Miss Marian walked very well now;
her limp was scarcely noticeable.
"“Thank you for a nice time,” she said, frankly. “I must run home now. I"
"liked the dinner very much, Mr. Chandler.”"
"He shook hands with her, smiling cordially, and said something about a"
"game of bridge at his club. He watched her for a moment, walking rather"
"rapidly eastward, and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward."
In his chilly bedroom Chandler laid away his evening clothes for a
sixty-nine days’ rest. He went about it thoughtfully.
"“That was a stunning girl,” he said to himself. “She’s all right, too,"
"I’d be sworn, even if she does have to work. Perhaps if I’d told her"
"the truth instead of all that razzle-dazzle we might—but, confound it!"
I had to play up to my clothes.”
"""Oh--h, take me back to the cabin!"" moaned Pola."
"""I guess we might as well,"" muttered Mart. Their matches had been long"
since exhausted; they had been of little avail for the one ship's light
on the boat was without oil.
"One on each side of her, Mart and Sidney helped Pola down into the"
"cabin. The boat was rolling heavily now in the rough sea, each lift and"
drop sending terror to the three young hearts. In the blackness of the
night the waves looked mountain high. Even Mart was glad to shut them
from view.
"""If--if we're going to drown I'd rather drown in--a--room,"" gasped"
"Pola, clinging to Sidney and burying her face in Sidney's shoulder."
It seemed to the girls as though months had passed since Lav had
plunged to what they felt certain was his death. The _Arabella_ had
"tossed about on the roughening water like some wild thing, her old"
timbers creaking and groaning under their new living. Just at first
Sidney and Mart had been too concerned in quieting the panic-stricken
Pola to face their danger; not until Pola had exhausted herself did
they think of their possible fate.
"Unless Lav succeeded in reaching the beach and giving an alarm, they"
"might toss about for days or be dashed to pieces on some reef. Or,"
"worse fate, Jed Starrow and his gang might find the boat and--"
"""Wh-at are you thinking about, Mart?"" whispered Sidney after a long"
"time of silence, broken only by the howling of the wind and the"
"pounding of the water. ""Let's talk--and then we can't hear--"""
"misery, the Girl's face turned pale."
"""What do you mean?"" she asked."
"Johnson coloured, hesitated, and finally with a swift glance at the"
"clock, he briefly explained:"
"""I mean it's hard to go and leave you here. The clock reminded me that"
long before this I should have been on my way. I shouldn't have come up
"here at all. God bless you, dear,"" and here their eyes came together and"
"seemed unable to part,--""I love you as I never thought I could . . ."""
But at Johnson's queer look she hastened to inquire:
"""But it ain't for long you're goin'?"""
For long! Then she had not understood that he meant to go for all time.
How tell her the truth? While he pondered over the situation there came
"to him with great suddenness the thought that, perhaps, after all, Life"
never intended that she should be given to him only to be taken away
almost as suddenly; and seized with a desire to hold on to her at any
"cost, he sprang forward as if to take her in his arms, but before he"
"reached her, he stopped short."
"""Such happiness is not for me,"" he muttered under his breath; and then"
"aloud he added: ""No, no, I've got to go now while I have the courage, I"
"mean."" He broke off as suddenly as he had begun, and taking her face in"
his hands he kissed her good-bye.
"Now, accustomed as was the Girl to the strange comings and goings of the"
"men at the camp, it did not occur to her to question him further when he"
"told her that he should have been away before now. Moreover, she trusted"
"""Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you"
know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing
"on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you"
"know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and"
your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific
"stock, too."""
"I was so excited I just had to yell: ""Gee, Sis, say _yes_!"""
*       *       *       *       *
"My sister's voice was steaming with scorn. ""And what makes you think"
"that I'd consider you a desirable husband?"""
"He spread his hands genially. ""Figure if you wanted a poodle, you're"
pretty enough to pick one up on Earth. Figure if you charge off to
"Venus, you don't want a poodle, you want a man. I'm one. I own three"
islands in the Galertan Archipelago that'll be good oozing mudgrape
land when they're cleared. Not to mention the rich berzeliot beds
offshore. I got no bad habits outside of having my own way. I'm also
"passable good-looking for a slaptoe planter. Besides, if you marry"
me you'll be the first mated on this ship--and that's a splash most
"nesting females like to make."""
There was a longish stretch of quiet. Sis stepped back and measured him
slowly with her eyes; there was a lot to look at. He waited patiently
while she covered the distance from his peculiar green boots to that
head of hair. I was so excited I was gulping instead of breathing.
Imagine having Butt for a brother-in-law and living on a wet-plantation
in Flatfolk country!

"During the first week of Bettina's illness she was too sick to talk,"
therefore we did not remain long with her. But as she grew better our
"visits lengthened, and my poor resolutions grew weaker day by day because"
my love for the girl was growing stronger and stronger hour by hour.
"On one occasion while Frances's back was turned, Betty impulsively"
"snatched up my hand and kissed it, dropping it instantly, blushing"
intensely and covering her tracks by humming the refrain of a French
"lullaby. I longed to return the caress, but did not, and took great"
credit to myself because of my self-denial. Betty understood my sacrifice
"and appreciated it, feeling sure that she need not thereafter restrain"
herself for the purpose of restraining me.
During those times I was making an honest effort to do the right by this
beautiful child-woman and to save my own honor unsullied from the sin of
making her unhappy for life through winning her love beyond her power to
"recall; and my effort toward the right, like all such efforts, achieved"
at least a part of the good for which I strove.
"One day after our visit to Betty's room, Frances asked me to take her to"
"see George. I suspected that she had seen him frequently, but was not"
"sure. I objected, but changed my mind when she said:--"
"""Very well. I prefer going alone."""
I shall not try to describe the scene between them. We found George
"alone, and she sprang to him as the iron springs to the magnet."
"Alicia huddled herself in a heap on the sofa, turning her face to the"
wall. She felt Lady Eynesford's scornful rebuke like the stroke of a
"whip. She had descended to a vulgar wrangle, and had been worsted in it:"
the one thing of all which it concerned her to hide had by her own act
been opened to the jeer of a stranger; she had violated every rule of
good breeding and self-respect. No words--not even Lady
Eynesford's--were too strong to describe what she had done. Yet she
could not help it; she could not hear a creature like that abuse or
"condemn a man like Medland--though all that he had said she had said,"
"and more, to Medland himself. She was too miserable to think; she lay"
"with closed eyes and parted lips, breathing quickly, and restlessly"
moving her limbs in that strange physical discomfort which great
unhappiness brings with it.
"A footstep roused her; she sat up, hurriedly smoothing her hair and"
clutching at a book that lay on the table by her. The intruder was her
"brother, and fortunately he was too intent on the tidings he brought to"
notice her confusion.
"""Great news, Al!"" he cried. ""They've offered me Ireland. We shall start"
"home in a month."""
"""Home in a month?"" she echoed."
"""Yes. Splendid, isn't it?"""
"""You're pleased, Willie?"""
"The Governor was very pleased. He liked the promotion, he liked going"
"home; and finally, pleasant as his stay in New Lindsey had been on the"
"whole, there were features in the present position which made him not"
sorry to depart.

A MISTAKEN IDEA
'Yet Australia has been talking freely enough about the Japanese
menace.'
'I know. It is quite a mistaken idea of the Australians that if Japan
triumphs in the present war she would be a menace to Australia. They say
that if we win we shall be masters of the East and the paramount power
"in Eastern waters. What, they ask, is to become of Australia, if we take"
it into our heads to make a descent upon their shores?'
"Baron Suyematsu again laughed boisterously, as one who can afford to"
make merry at an extravagant idea.
"'The whole thing is so utterly preposterous,' he went on, 'that it"
would not be worth considering were it not typical of what is being said
all over Europe. Our fight for national existence against Russia has
been misconstrued everywhere. We seem to have filled the Western world
"with all sorts of vague fears, France is saying that we shall soon"
deprive her of Indo-China. Germany declares we have designs on
Kiao-chau. The Dutch say that Java is no longer safe from our
"machinations. Never was such nonsense talked of a country which, after"
"all, is but fighting to preserve its national existence.'"
'And you say Japan has no intention of arming the Asiatics against the
Europeans?'
'The whole idea is absurd. Japan wishes to become one with the European
nations. I might even say she aspires to become a member of the European
family. It is a mistake to think that Japan is going to form a
Pan-Asiatic Association. Japan is the only country in the East that can
rise on European lines. Her example could not be followed by other

"correspondence.  This is, for the Captain, ""an abundance of drinks,"" as"
he himself calls it.  He always notices how the merchants make this

"""Do you know her?"" she asked."
"""I do not know a 'wretched hussy' who is the daughter of the innkeeper,"""

"gentle truth and up to all that was hard, cruel, and selfish in life. A"

her twentieth year.
"While I did not blame Mary for what she had said relating to Bettina,"
still I was angry and longed to do battle with any one who could fight.
"After we had been together perhaps ten minutes, some one claimed her for"

"eager hesitancy and a fluttering show of anxiety, ""Have you had news"
"recently of my brother George?"""
"Of course I could not tell her the truth, so I answered evasively: ""I"
suppose you have heard the news spread throughout the court that he has

hinted that he threatened to take the king's life. Surely he did nothing

would cease speaking of George and would ask a question or two concerning
myself.

Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the
"accents, eloquently addressed to the fair Aileen. They writhed in their"
"chairs to gaze around and over the impending form of Tildy, that"
Aileen’s pulchritude might season and make ambrosia of their bacon and
eggs.
And Tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if Aileen could receive
the flattery and the homage. The blunt nose was loyal to the short
Grecian. She was Aileen’s friend; and she was glad to see her rule
hearts and wean the attention of men from smoking pot-pie and lemon
meringue. But deep below our freckles and hay-coloured hair the
"unhandsomest of us dream of a prince or a princess, not vicarious, but"
coming to us alone.
There was a morning when Aileen tripped in to work with a slightly
bruised eye; and Tildy’s solicitude was almost enough to heal any
optic.
"“Fresh guy,” explained Aileen, “last night as I was going home at"
"Twenty-third and Sixth. Sashayed up, so he did, and made a break. I"
"turned him down, cold, and he made a sneak; but followed me down to"

"one, side of the face. Then he give me that eye. Does it look real"
"awful, Til? I should hate that Mr. Nicholson should see it when he"
comes in for his tea and toast at ten.”
Tildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration. No man had
ever tried to follow her. She was safe abroad at any hour of the
twenty-four. What bliss it must have been to have had a man follow one
and black one’s eye for love!

Cabrera looked at the papers. There was a Carlist commission in the name

"the staff, commending all the four by name and description to all good"
"servants of Don Carlos, as trustworthy persons engaged on a dangerous"
"and secret mission. Most of all, however, he seemed to be impressed with"
"the ring belonging to Etienne, with its revolving gem and concealed"
portrait of Carlos the Fifth.
"He placed it on his finger and gazing intently, asked to whom it"
"belonged. As soon as he understood, he summoned the little Frenchman to"
"his presence. Etienne came at the word, calm as usual, and twirling his"
moustache in the manner of Rollo.
"""This is your ring?"" he demanded of the prisoner. Concha tried to catch"
Etienne's eye to signal to him that he must give Cabrera that upon which
his fancy had lighted. But her former lover stubbornly avoided her eye.
"""That is my ring,"" he answered dryly, after a cursory inspection of the"
article in question as it lay in the palm of the _guerillero's_ hand.
"""It is very precious to you?"" asked the butcher of Tortosa,"
suggestively.
"""It was given to me by my cousin, the king,"" answered Etienne, briefly."

one another and made a sour joke about Mandas. Then the black-cap turned

"""Can you understand Sardinian?"" he said."
"""Somewhat. More than Sicilian, anyhow."""
"""But Sardinian is more difficult than Sicilian. It is full of words"
"utterly unknown to Italian--"""
"""Yes, but,"" say I, ""it is spoken openly, in plain words, and Sicilian is"
"spoken all stuck together, none of the words there at all."""
He looks at me as if I were an imposter. Yet it is true. I find it quite
"easy to understand Sardinian. As a matter of fact, it is more a question"
of human approach than of sound. Sardinian seems open and manly and
"downright. Sicilian is gluey and evasive, as if the Sicilian didn't want"
"to speak straight to you. As a matter of fact, he doesn't. He is an"
"over-cultured, sensitive, ancient soul, and he has so many sides to his"
mind that he hasn't got any definite one mind at all. He's got a dozen
"minds, and uneasily he's aware of it, and to commit himself to anyone of"
them is merely playing a trick on himself and his interlocutor. The
"Sardinian, on the other hand, still seems to have one downright mind. I"
"bump up against a downright, smack-out belief in Socialism, for"
example. The Sicilian is much too old in our culture to swallow
Socialism whole: much too ancient and rusé not to be sophisticated about
any and every belief. He'll go off like a squib: and then he'll smoulder
acridly and sceptically even against his own fire. One sympathizes with
him in retrospect. But in daily life it is unbearable.

Rollo was not wholly comfortable on his couch of grain. The bonds about
"his feet galled him, having been more tightly drawn than those of his"
companions in virtue of his chiefship. Nevertheless he got a good deal
"of sleep, and each time that he awoke it seemed to him that El Sarria"

nearer.

"But because his heart was not of iron, and there are few men that can"

"fled away one night, the girl and the slave, taking with them her jewels"
"and some money. They travelled rapidly and in great fear, and did not"
"rest till they came to a city far away where the merchant would never,"
"they thought, think of searching for them."
"Here, in this city where no one knew of their history, they lived in"
"great happiness, husband and wife, trading with the money they had with"
them.
And in time a little child was born to them.
About two or three years after this it became necessary for the husband
"to take a journey, and he started forth with his wife and child. The"
"journey was a very long one, and they were unduly delayed; and so it"
"happened that while still in the forest the wife fell ill, and could not"
"go on any further. So the husband built a hut of branches and leaves,"
"and there, in the solitude of the forest, was born to them another"
little son.
"The mother recovered rapidly, and in a little time she was well enough"
to go on. They were to start next morning on their way again; and in the
"evening the husband went out, as was his custom, to cut firewood, for"
the nights were cold and damp.

effect on Captain Dove's somewhat contemptuous demeanour. The little
"policeman in charge of it pending its opulent owner's return, came"
"forward, touching his képi, which further impressed Captain Dove,"
"uncomfortably. Slyne handed Sallie into the tonneau, and Ambrizette"
"after her, tossed the policeman a further tip which secured his"
"everlasting esteem, took his own seat at the wheel, and was hastily"
followed by Captain Dove.
"""Where are we bound for?"" asked Captain Dove, holding his top-hat on"
"with both hands, as Slyne took the road toward Sampierdarena at a round"
pace.
"""Don't talk to the man at the wheel,"" answered Slyne, and laughed."
"""We've a hundred miles or so ahead of us. Better chuck that old tile of"
yours away and tie a handkerchief round your head; you'll find that less
"uncomfortable."""
"The old man, at a loss for any more effective retort, pulled his"
"antiquated beaver down almost to his ears, folded his long arms across"
"the chest of his flapping frock-coat, and sat silent, scowling at the"
baggy umbrella between his knees. Nor did he open his mouth again during
the swift journey.
But when they at length reached their destination and Slyne stopped the
"car quietly before the imposing pile that forms the Hôtel de Paris,"
Captain Dove's jaw dropped and his mouth opened mechanically.
A resplendent porter came hurrying forward and bowed most humbly to the
magnificent Slyne.
"""I did not send for one--I sent for you,"" was her response."
"""But we must call a doctor at once,"" I urged.  ""If you have suspicion of"
"foul play we should surely know if there is any wound, or any injury to"
"account for death."""
"""I did not consider it necessary.  No doctor can return her to me,"" she"
"wailed.  ""I sent for you because I believed that you would render me"
"assistance in this terrible affair."""
"""Most certainly I will,"" I replied.  ""But in our own interests we must"
"send for a medical man, and if it is found to be actually a case of foul"
"play, for the police.  I'll send a line to Doctor Deane, an Englishman"
"whom I know, who is generally called in to see anybody at the Embassy"
"who chances to be ill.  He is a good fellow, and his discretion may be"
"relied upon."""
"So saying, I scribbled a line on the back of a card, and told the man to"
"take a cab down to the Rue du Havre, where the doctor occupied rooms"
over a hosier's shop a stone's throw from the bustling Gare St. Lazare.
A very curious mystery was evidently connected with this startling
"discovery, and I was anxious that my friend, Dick Deane, one of my old"
"chums of Rugby days, should assist me in clearing it up."
"The Countess de Foville, whose calmness had been so remarkable while"
"speaking with me before we entered the death-chamber, had now given way"
"to a flood of emotion.  She sank back into her chair, and, burying her"
"face in her hands, cried bitterly."
"I tried to obtain some further information from her, but all that"
escaped her was:
have stolen from you. I _am_ called Ramerrez; I _have_ robbed; I _am_ a
"road agent--an outlaw by profession. Yes, I'm all that--and my father"
"was that before me. I was brought up, educated, thrived on thieves'"
"money, I suppose, but until six months ago when my father died, I did"
not know it. I lived much in Monterey--I lived there as a gentleman.
When we met that day I wasn't the thing I am to-day. I only learned the
truth when my father died and left me with a rancho and a band of
"thieves--nothing else--nothing for us all, and I--but what's the good of"
going into it--the circumstances. You wouldn't understand if I did. I
"was my father's son; I have no excuse; I guess, perhaps, it was in"
"me--in the blood. Anyhow, I took to the road, and I didn't mind it much"
after the first time. But I drew the line at killing--I wouldn't have
"that. That's the man that I am, the blackguard that I am. But--"" here he"
"raised his eyes and said with a voice that was charged with feeling--""I"
swear to you that from the moment I kissed you to-night I meant to
"change, I meant to--"""
"""The devil you did!"" broke from the Girl's lips, but with a sound that"
was not unlike a sob.
"""I did, believe me, I did,"" insisted the man. ""I meant to go straight"
and take you with me--but only honestly--when I could honestly. I meant
"to work for you. Why, every word you said to me to-night about being a"
thief cut into me like a knife. Over and over again I have said to
"myself, she must never know. And now--well, it's all over--I have"
"finished."""
"""An' that's all?"" questioned the Girl with averted face."
"""No--yes--what's the use . . .?"""
The Girl's anger blazed forth again.

PREFACE
"This book was written in 1915, for the amusement of my wife and myself"
at a time when life was not very amusing; it was published at the end
"of 1917; was reviewed, if at all, as one of a parcel, by some brisk"
"uncle from the Tiny Tots Department; and died quietly, without"
seriously detracting from the interest which was being taken in the
"World War, then in progress."
It may be that the circumstances in which the book was written have
"made me unduly fond of it.  When, as sometimes happens, I am"
introduced to a stranger who starts the conversation on the right
"lines by praising, however insincerely, my books, I always say, ""But"
"you have not read the best one."" Nine times out of ten it is so.  The"
"tenth takes a place in the family calendar; St. Michael or St. Agatha,"
"as the case may be, a red-letter or black-letter saint, according to"
whether the book was bought or borrowed.  But there are few such
"saints, and both my publisher and I have the feeling (so common to"
publishers and authors) that there ought to be more.  So here comes
"the book again, in a new dress, with new decorations, yet much, as far"
"as I am concerned, the same book, making the same appeal to me; but,"
"let us hope, a new appeal, this time, to others."
"For whom, then, is the book intended?  That is the trouble.  Unless I"
"can say, ""For those, young or old, who like the things which I like,"""
"I find it difficult to answer.  Is it a children's book?  Well, what"
do we mean by that?  Is _The Wind in the Willows_ a children's book?
special interest in his spotless Lady Geraldine.
[Illustration: He stood quite still to watch Lord Sandford lead away the
fair Geraldine (page 155).]
"""I trow so,"" was the carelessly-spoken reply of Lord Sandford, as he"
adjusted his wig and suffered his valet to spray some delicate perfume
"over his person, as a finishing touch to his toilet.  ""The Lady"
Geraldine is no longer to lead the life of a nun.  It has been decreed
"that she is to show her lovely face abroad, and add thereby a lustre to"
"her mother’s charms."""
"""A lustre her ladyship would well dispense with,"" laughed another.  ""She"
would sooner pose as the stepmother than the mother of a grown-up
"daughter—ha, ha!  How comes it that this young beauty hath never been"
shown before to the world?  Other damsels make their _début_ at sixteen;
"but the Lady Geraldine can scarce be less than twenty, and has the"
"dignity of matronhood."""
"""A vast deal more dignity than the most part of our matrons do show"
"forth,"" spoke Lord Sandford incisively.  ""Doubtless she learned it from"
"her grandam, her mother’s mother and her father’s aunt; for my Lord and"
"my Lady Romaine are cousins, and Mrs. Adair was trusted and revered by"
"both.  Young children are in the way of such gay ladies of fashion,"
"wherefore the babe was sent to its grandam, and remained with her till"
"the virtuous and discreet old lady died, having bequeathed her store of"
"wisdom and discretion to the beautiful maid she had reared."""
"""And her fortune too,"" sniggered one gay dandy. ""Do not forget that"
"item, my lord.  It is whispered that it will make the biggest of her"
"charms.  What is the figure?  Doth anybody know?"""
breath. She knew it was over the price to be paid for her that they were
"disputing, but that knowledge had ceased to be any novelty. The wrathful"
voices of the two disputants seemed to come from a great distance. She
felt as if the whole affair were a dream from which she might at any
moment awake on board the _Olive Branch_ again.
"""There isn't money enough in it to pay you so much for a mere"
"affidavit,"" she heard Slyne say, and Mr. Jobling, under his glance,"
confirmed that statement emphatically.
"""A hundred and twenty-one thousand is the last limit--a thousand down,"
"to bind the bargain, and the balance the day of my wedding with Sallie,"""
"Slyne declared. ""If that doesn't satisfy you--there's nothing more to be"
"said. And I'll maybe find other means--"""
"""Show me even the first thousand,"" requested Captain Dove, and Slyne"
"counted out on to the table, at a safe distance from the old man's"
"twitching fingers, five thousand francs of the amount Lord Ingoldsby had"
paid him for his car.
"""All right,"" said Captain Dove gruffly, and snatched at the notes. But"
Slyne picked them up again.
"""As soon as you've given Jobling your statement,"" he said, ""and signed"
"whatever other documents he may think necessary, I'll hand you these and"
"my note of hand, endorsed by him, for the balance remaining due you."""
Mr. Jobling picked up a pen and Slyne pushed a sheet of foolscap toward
"him. Captain Dove, with a grunt of disgust, sat back in his chair and,"
"while the lawyer wrote rapidly, related how he had found Sallie."
"When he had finished, Mr. Jobling read his statement over aloud, and"
"blowed ter bits. Oh, it's 'ard when yer've bin together all the time an'"
"shared everythink."""
He buried his face in his hands and made no further sound except an
occasional sniff and a hasty drawing in of the breath through trembling
lips.
"""It's bloody murder up the line,"" said a full Corporal. ""We were in a"
trench four feet deep and up to our waist in water. A Jerry sniper
"spotted us and one man got biffed, [killed] and then the next, and then the"
next all along the trench. We were packed together like sardines and had
no cover at all for our heads and shoulders. I got the wind up terribly
'cause I knew my turn was coming. He only gave me a Blighty though--I
"reckon I'm bloody lucky!"""
"""We was ready for to go over the top an' waitin' for the whistle to"
blow. We didn't 'alf 'ave the wind up. You could 'ear the teeth
"chatterin' all along the trench. I was shiverin' all over, I...."""
"""Next man!"" The conversation stopped while the next man went across, but"
"having once begun to tell their experiences, the men would not stop"
"altogether, and after a brief silence an elderly little man with a"
bandaged foot said:
"""What I couldn't get over was insomnia. I could never sleep at the"
right time and I was always dead tired on duty. Once I worked
forty-three hours at a stretch and after that I had to do a guard in our
trench. I felt sleepy all of a sudden. I pinched myself and banged the
"butt of my rifle on my toes, but everything seemed to swim round me."
"Then, I don't know how, I went off to sleep. I was awakened by an"
officer who shook me and swore at me. I was a bit dazed at first and
then suddenly it struck me what had happened. I never had the wind up so

"Thwaites was sent ashore by the captain to buy some sheep, but did not"
"return to the boat and, it being supposed he had been assassinated, the"
"ship sailed without him. The fact was that young Thwaites, who spoke"
"Turkish and Greek, had accepted an invitation to enter the Ottoman"
"service. Embracing the Mohammedan religion, Thwaites was put in command of"
a forty-four gun frigate.
"His first engagement was with the flagship of the Tunisian Admiral, which"
"he took and carried to Algiers. He soon brought in another prize, and so"
"pleased the Dey that he presented him with a scimitar, the hilt of which"

PEACOCKS
Early the next day Pola appeared with Mr. Dugald in Sunset Lane in a
simple garb that must have satisfied even her exacting cousin. Her mood
was in accord with her attire as though she had left her sophistication
"behind with her silks and her rouge. She declared she felt as ""peppy as"
"they make them"" and ready to do anything anyone suggested. And Mr."
"Dugald, resigned to wasting two weeks to entertaining his young cousin,"
"of whom he was really very fond, promptly offered an astonishing"
assortment of suggestions from which he commanded the girls to choose.
"""Why, you wouldn't believe there were so many things to do!"" cried Pola"
"with real enthusiasm. ""Sidney, you'll have to decide."" And Sidney at"
once decided upon a tramp to Peaked Hill on the ocean side with an
early picnic supper.
"In the days that followed, Sidney's first admiration for Pola returned."
Though Pola would never again be the idol she was much more enjoyable
"as a chum. Her spirits, though an affectation, were infectious and gay;"
in her pretty clothes and with her pretty face she made Sidney think of
"a butterfly, a fragile, golden-winged, dainty flitting butterfly. She"
professed to enjoy everything they did--even to the picnics. She
tramped endlessly in her unsuitable shoes without a murmur of fatigue
and Sidney suspected that she really _did_ care a great deal for her
cousin Dugald's approval.
With Mr. Dugald they motored to Highland Light and to Chatham. They
toured the shops at Hyannis. They sailed with Captain Hawkes on the
_Mabel T_. They rose very early one morning and went to the Coast Guard
Station to watch the drill and then ate ham and eggs with Commander
Fluffy Reubens winked at the others:
“I don’t see that this chap Anthony Bickersteth’s work is a snap better
than Caroline Baddlesmere’s; and he’s prigged a lot of her ideas----”
"Aubrey turned round to the room, took up a picturesque literary"
"attitude, elbow on mantel, his cheek leaning on his long fingers,"
"legs crossed, essaying to realize the portraits of the thirties, and,"
"rousing from his adoration of himself, he said petulantly:"
"“My dear fluffsome Robbins, I have repeatedly told you that Caroline"
Baddlesmere lacks breadth of view and a man’s humour--to say nothing of
that certain something of subtle atmosphere that is called genius....
You really ought not to give me the trouble of reiterating these simple
truths.... You compel me to feel as blatantly insistent as a bookmaker
on a race-course----”
"He was interrupted by the entrance of the old butler, ushering in"
Bartholomew Doome and Andrew Blotte--Andrew in very much crushed and
"wrinkled evening dress, and looking unutterably shabby, Doome well"
groomed.
Bartholomew Doome laughed:
"“Yes,” said he, “yes, yes--I heard what Aubrey was saying; but Aubrey"
"is a poet, not a critic.”"
Lovegood laughed a funny deep nasal laugh.
But Rippley had turned to the strange figure of Andrew Blotte. He smote
him on the shoulder with strong genial hand:
"""No, sir—far from it.  Let me hear you to the end.  I did see you take"
"forth a roll of paper from your breast as you came in.  That action,"
"together with your face, told me much.  You have the gift of a creative"
"fancy.  You have written a poem or a play."""
"""Neither the one nor the other, but a romance,"" answered Grey, the"
colour flushing his face as it flushes that of a maiden when the love of
"her heart is named by her.  ""I scarce know how to call it, but methinks"
it savours more of a romance than of aught besides.  When I was rudely
"awakened from my pleasure-loving life, saw the folly and futility"
"thereof, and desired to amend, I did take a quiet lodging high up in a"
"building off Holborn, and there I did set myself to the task, and right"
"happy was I in it.  I had a score of gold pieces still left me, and my"
"needs I did think modest; though, looking back, they seem many to me"
"now.  The weeks fled by, and my work reached its close.  When my romance"
"was finished, my money was all but spent.  For the past week or more I"
have been seeking a publisher for it.  In my folly I did think that it
would bring me gold as fast as I wanted.  My eyes have been rudely
"opened these last days."""
The Old Lion nodded his head many times.
"""You made a mistake in seeking a publisher, young sir.  You should first"
"have sought a patron."""
"Grey’s face flushed slightly, and he hesitated before he spoke."
"""Others have said the same to me; but there are difficulties.  I have"
not learned to go cap in hand to cringe for patronage to the great ones
"of the earth.""  But, as Grey saw a slight smile flicker in the old man’s"
"eyes, he added rather hastily, ""And then I desire not to be known and"
"reward in the proverbial ""nice young man."""
"Mr. White agreed with her on every point but this. ""If she deserted"
that household it would fall! She's the only one that isn't like her
"father."""
"""Then she must find someone who'll take the family with her,"" Mrs."
White asserted determinedly. But having no godmother's fairy wand she
"had not been able, during the summer weeks, to bring the prince to"
Edgeacres; her husband's acquaintances were too bald and round to play
the part of princes.
Trude had not minded the dearth of young men. Since her unhappy
experience on a former visit she was glad of that dearth. The serenity
"of the summer, the relaxation and rest from responsibilities had"
"brought a lovely freshness to her face, a brightness to her eyes that"
was not all a reflection of the brightness about her. The sheer luxury
"of loafing, of not having to think out petty problems or worry one"
"single minute was all her old-young heart now asked. Once in awhile, of"
"course, she fretted because Isolde was not enjoying Edgeacres with her,"
or getting to know how really nice Aunt Edith White was. Where Vick and
"Sidney were concerned she had no remorse for Vick was seeing new lands,"
"doubtless conquering them, and Sidney was happy at Cape Cod; but she"
could not help thinking that Issy must be working too hard at the
Deerings--getting up early in the morning and typing all through the
hot day and doubtless fussing over the housework and the small babies
as well.
Trude thought of the mail. Again there had been no letter from either
Issy or Sidney! Sidney really _ought_ to write. Perhaps it _had_ not
been wise to let her go off alone with relatives of whom they knew
nothing!
face had lighted at the girl’s words.
"""Methought I had come to a world where naught was dreamed of save"
"fashion and frippery, false adulation and falser scorn.  I am well-nigh"
"stunned by the clamour of tongues, the strife of parties, the bustle of"
"this gay life of fashion."""
"""Oh, and I too—I too!"" breathed the girl softly: and he flashed at her a"
"quick, keen glance of sympathy and interest."
"""I was bred in the country; my grandam brought me up.  I lived with my"
"books, amid silvan solitudes, the songs of birds, the scent of flowers."
This great glittering world of folly and fashion is like a fiery wheel
"going round in my head.  Ofttimes I could cry aloud for mercy, the pain"
and bewilderment are so great.  I know there must be noble men and good
"in this strange Pandemonium; but I know not where to find them, and my"
heart grows sick.  Would that I could go back to my books and my dreams!
"But alas! a maiden may not choose for herself."""
"""Still there is life here,"" spoke Grey quickly, ""and it behoves us to"
know men as well as books.  I have studied both.  I will study them
"again.  I would fain learn all that life has to teach, whether for weal"
or woe.  No hermit-monk was ever truly a man. Yet there be times when
"one shrinks in amaze from all one sees and hears."""
The chord of sympathy was struck.  They passed from one thing to
another.  She found one at last who knew and loved the poets of her
"childhood’s dreams—who could talk of Spenser and Sidney, of Watson,"
"Greville, and Drayton, quoting their verses, and often lighting upon her"
"favourite passages.  Here was a man who knew Milton and Clarendon,"
"Hobbes, Herbert, Lovelace and Suckling, Lord Herbert of Cherbury and"
"Izaak Walton.  He had read eagerly, like herself, poetry and prose,"
"to Slyne's; both of whom met it without winking, although Captain Dove"
was no doubt glad of the protection of his smoked glasses.
"""I'll have to go through the proofs, of course,"" said his lordship"
"reflectively and let his gaze rest on Sallie again. ""But--if"
"everything's as you say, I don't think it will be long before Lady"
Josceline finds herself in full enjoyment of all her rights and
"privileges. If everything's as you say, I'll do whatever lies in my"
power to expedite matters; I think I can promise you that the case will
"be called immediately the vacation is over. Meanwhile, however, and till"
"I have looked through the proofs, I can make no further order."""
"He rose, and they also got up from their chairs as he came round from"
"behind his desk and confronted Sallie, a tall, stooping old man with a"
wrinkled face and tired but kindly eyes.
"She looked up into them frankly, and he laid a hand on her shoulder."
"""Yours has been a very sad history so far, my dear young lady,"" he said,"
"his head on one side, still studying her. ""I hope it will be all the"
brighter henceforth. I knew--the last Earl of Jura--when we were both
"young men--before he married. You remind me of him, as he was then, in"
"many respects. Good day to you now; my time here is not my own, you"
"know. But some day, perhaps you will allow me to pay my respects to"
"you--at Justicehall, since we're to be neighbours; my own home isn't"
"very far from yours."""
"Outside in the corridor, Mr. Jobling shook hands rapturously with every"
"one, even with Captain Dove."
"""We've turned the trick already,"" he declared. ""You heard what his"
"lordship said. With him on our side, the whole thing's as good as"
"drama and epic, lyric and sonnet.  He could speak of Poetry as one who"
had loved and courted her as a mistress.  The girl longed to ask him if
"he had written himself, but maiden shyness withheld her.  Yet her eyes"
"brightened as she talked, and the peach-like colour rose and deepened in"
"her cheeks; and Lord Sandford, turning back once again from the mother"
"to look at the daughter, was struck dumb with admiration and delight."
"""There is a rose worth winning and wearing, though the stem may not be"
"free from a sharp thorn,"" he said to himself; and Lady Romaine, who"
chanced to catch sight of Geraldine during a shifting of the admirers
"who surrounded her, gave something very like a start, and felt a curious"
thrill run through her in which pride and envy were blended.
"""Gracious!  I did not know I had so handsome a daughter!  I must wed her"
"as fast as may be, else shall I find my beaux going from me to her,"" was"
"her unspoken thought; and aloud she said, tapping Lord Sandford with her"
"fan, ""Pray tell my daughter that I am about to depart.  We have had"
"enough of the naiads and dryads, and I am tired and hungry.  Who will"
"come home with me to supper—to take pot-luck with us?"""
There was an eager clamour in response; but when the supper-party
assembled round Lady Romaine’s chocolate tables in her favourite private
"parlour, she noted that Geraldine had disappeared to bed, and that Sir"
Grey Dumaresq had not availed himself of her open invitation.
*CHAPTER VII.*
*A FAIR FACE.*
"""Yes, master, and so I am; and this is the hostelry at Hampstead where I"
have taken up my quarters with the horse; and hither it was that you
"came yestere’en, with Lord Sandford and his friends, to be ready for the"
match to-day.  But beshrew me if I did think yesterday you would be fit
for the saddle to-day!  Is it strange I should mutter and grumble to
"myself when such things happen?"""
"""Nay now, what things, good Dicon?  I pray you tell me,"" spoke Grey, as"
"he drained at one draught the ice-cold water, and drew a long breath of"
"relief. ""I feel like a man waking from a strange and fevered dream; for,"
"in sooth, I know but little of what has been passing these last days."
Some strange madness seems to have possessed me.  I had meant to say
"farewell to Lord Sandford and his world, and seek mine own fortunes in"
some other field.  Yet methinks I have not made the break.  I have
visions of wild orgies and furious gaming—such as I held aloof from
"before.  Dicon, I fear me I have made a desperate fool of myself, and of"
"my fortunes too.  Tell me, what money have I with me now?"""
"""Not much, master.  I took what you had—a matter of some twenty guineas"
perhaps.  I have it safe in a bag.  But surely that is not all.  You had
"won a fortune, you did tell me—"""
"""Ay, and now I have lost it.  I can recollect how the guineas flew, and"
"how the stakes were doubled, and how I lost again and yet again.  I take"
"it I am a ruined man, good Dicon.  These twenty guineas saved from the"
"wreck are all the fortune I possess, and belike it is better so—better"
"so."""
"""Better!"" echoed the dismayed Dick; ""nay, my master.  But you will win"
it back again.  The luck cannot always be against you.  Think how it was
"at the first!"""
"caring for her little ones, fearful to leave them alone, till at last"
"the gray light came down, down from the sky to the branches, and from"
"the branches to the ground, and she could see her way. Then, with her"
new-born babe in her arms and the elder little fellow trotting by her
"side, she went out to search for her husband. Soon enough she found him,"
"not far off, stiff and cold beside his half-cut bundle of firewood. A"
"snake had bitten him on the ankle, and he was dead."
"So Ma Pa Da was alone in the great forest, but a girl still, with two"
little children to care for.
"But she was brave, despite her trouble, and she determined to go on and"
gain some village. She took her baby in her arms and the little one by
"the hand, and started on her journey."
"And for a time all went well, till at last she came to a stream. It was"
"not very deep, but it was too deep for the little boy to wade, for it"
"came up to his neck, and his mother was not strong enough to carry both"
"at once. So, after considering for a time, she told the elder boy to"
"wait. She would cross and put the baby on the far side, and return for"
him.
"'Be good,' she said; 'be good, and stay here quietly till I come back;'"
and the boy promised.
The stream was deeper and swifter than she thought; but she went with
"great care and gained the far side, and put the baby under a tree a"
"little distance from the bank, to lie there while she went for the other"
"boy. Then, after a few minutes' rest, she went back."
"She had got to the centre of the stream, and her little boy had come"
"down to the margin to be ready for her, when she heard a rush and a cry"
"avenue, distancing the enthusiasts who would have had the horses out of"
"the shafts. They passed a long row of carriages, belonging to people who"
"had not feared to come and look on from a distance, and at last, knowing"
"the procession would go back another way, Medland bade his driver stop"
"under the trees, and lit a cigar."
"""And I wonder if it will all make any difference!"" said he, puffing"
delightedly. He had all an old political organiser's love for a big
"meeting, which does not exclude scepticism as to its value."
"""Oh, you gave it 'em finely,"" said the Treasurer."
"""I believe it'll frighten two or three anyhow,"" observed Norburn."
"""I _know_ we shall win to-morrow,"" cried Daisy, squeezing her father's"
arm.
"""Ah! here's a special Sunday evening paper--how we encourage"
"wickedness!"" said the Premier, seeing a newsvendor approaching. ""Let's"
"see what they say of us!"""
"""I've seen it all for myself,"" remarked Daisy, and she went on"
"chattering to the other two, who were ready to talk over every incident"
"of the meeting, as people who have been to meetings ever are. On they"
"went, reminding one another of the bald man in the third row who cheered"

"fanned herself all the time, of rude things shouted about Messrs."
"Puttock and Coxon, and so forth. The Premier, listening with one ear,"
opened his paper; but the first thing he saw was not about his
"procession. He started and looked closer, then gave a sudden, covert"
"glance at his companions; they were busy in talk, and, with breathless"
"haste, he devoured the meagre details of Benham's wretched death. The"
"""I do not think that he regards them at all! He has scarcely looked at"

"Sergeant Cardono groaned, seemingly greatly perturbed in spirit."
"""I feared as much,"" he said, shaking his head; ""he hath not the right"
"wandering eye. Now, that young Frenchman is a devil untamed! And the"
"Englishman--well, though he is deeper, he also hath it in him. But the"
colonel is all for fighting and his duty. It is easy to see that he will
rise but little higher. When was there ever a great soldier without a
"weakness for a pretty woman and a good dinner? Why, the thing is"
"against nature. Now, my father fought in the War of the Independence,"
and the tales that he told of El Gran' Lor'--he was a soldier if you
"like, worthy of the white plumes! A cook all to himself closer at his"
"elbow than an aide-de-camp--and as to the women--ah----!"""
Sergeant Cardono nodded as one who could tell tales and he would. Yet
the Sergeant Cardono found some reason to change his mind as to Rollo's
qualifications for field-officership before the end of their first day
apart from Cabrera.
It was indeed with a feeling of intense relief that the little company
of five men separated from the white and red _boinas_ of the
butcher-general's cavalcade. Well-affected to them as Cabrera might be
"for the time being, his favour was so brief and uncertain, his affection"
"so tiger-like, that even Sergeant Cardono sighed a sigh of satisfaction"
when they turned their horses' heads towards the far-away Guadarrama
beyond which lay the goal of their adventuring.
Presently the tongues of the little cavalcade were unloosed. El Sarria
"and Sergeant Cardono having found subjects of common interest, communed"
he who is laughing at the others.
“The other day he said to me in his macaronic Italian:
"“‘Mr. Spaniard, I have good eyesight, good hearing, a good sense of"
"smell, and... lots of sentiment.’"
"“I didn’t exactly understand what he meant me to think, and I didn’t pay"
any attention to him.
"“It seems that the Norwegian is going away soon, and as the day of his"
"departure approaches, he grows funereal.”"
_THE SADNESS OF LIFE_
"“I don’t know why I don’t go away,” Cæsar wrote to his friend another"
time. “When I go out in the evening and see the ochre-coloured houses on
"both sides and the blue sky above, a horrible sadness takes me. These"
"spring days oppress me, make me want to weep; it seems to me it would"
"be better to be dead, leaving no tomb or name or other ridiculous and"
"disagreeable thing, but disappearing into the air or the sea. It"
doesn’t seem natural; but I have never been so happy as one time when I
"was in Paris sick, alone and with a fever. I was in an hotel room and"
"my window looked into the garden of a fine house, where I could see the"
"tops of the trees; and I transformed them into a virgin forest, wherein"
marvellous adventures happened to me.
“Since then I have often thought that things are probably neither good
"nor bad, neither sad nor happy, in themselves; he who has sound, normal"
"nerves, and a brain equally sound, reflects the things around him like a"
"good mirror, and feels with comfort the impression of his conformity to"
"There was an Old Man of Cape Horn,"
Who wished he had never been born;
"So he sat in a chair till he died of despair,"
That dolorous Man of Cape Horn.
"Now, except in case of very young children, this could not possibly be"
taken seriously. The least observant normal boy or girl would recognise
the hollowness of the pessimism that prevents a man from at least an
attempt to rise from his chair.
The following I have chosen as repeated with intense appreciation and
much dramatic vigour by a little boy just five years old:
"There was an Old Man who said, “Hush!"
I perceive a young bird in this bush!”
"When they said, “Is it small?” he replied, “Not at all!"
It is four times as big as the bush!”[32]
One of the most desirable of all elements to introduce into our stories
is that which encourages kinship with animals. With very young children
"this is easy, because in those early years when the mind is not clogged"
"with knowledge, the sympathetic imagination enables them to enter into"
the feelings of animals. Andersen has an illustration of this point in
his “Ice Maiden”:
“Children who cannot talk yet can understand the language of fowls and
"ducks quite well, and cats and dogs speak to them quite as plainly as"
"Father and Mother; but that is only when the children are very small,"
and then even Grandpapa's stick will become a perfect horse to them
"that can neigh and, in their eyes, is furnished with legs and a tail."
"With some children this period ends later than with others, and of such"
"nothing is wasted.  But a baby!""  And he chirruped his lips. ""Well;"
"courage!  We shall do things yet!"""
Gyp turned her head away to hide the quiver of her lips.  The scent of
"latakia tobacco that had soaked into things, and of old books and music,"
"a dark smell, like Monsieur Harmost's complexion; the old brown curtains,"
"the sooty little back garden beyond, with its cat-runs, and its one"
stunted sumach tree; the dark-brown stare of Monsieur Harmost's rolling
"eyes brought back that time of happiness, when she used to come week"
"after week, full of gaiety and importance, and chatter away, basking in"
"his brusque admiration and in music, all with the glamourous feeling that"
"she was making him happy, and herself happy, and going to play very"
finely some day.
"The voice of Monsieur Harmost, softly gruff, as if he knew what she was"
"feeling, increased her emotion; her breast heaved under the humming-bird"
"blouse, water came into her eyes, and more than ever her lips quivered."
He was saying:
"""Come, come!  The only thing we cannot cure is age.  You were right to"
"come, my child.  Music is your proper air.  If things are not all what"
"they ought to be, you shall soon forget.  In music--in music, we can get"
"away.  After all, my little friend, they cannot take our dreams from"
"us--not even a wife, not even a husband can do that.  Come, we shall have"
"good times yet!"""
"And Gyp, with a violent effort, threw off that sudden weakness. From"
those who serve art devotedly there radiates a kind of glamour.  She left
"Monsieur Harmost that afternoon, infected by his passion for music."
Poetic justice--on which all homeopathy is founded--was at work to try
"and cure her life by a dose of what had spoiled it.  To music, she now"
"gave all the hours she could spare. She went to him twice a week,"
"For my part, I would unhesitatingly give to boys and girls an element"
of strong romance in the stories which are told them even before they
are twelve. Miss Sewell says:
"“The system that keeps girls in the schoolroom reading simple stories,"
"without reading Scott and Shakespeare and Spenser, and then hands them"
"over to the unexplored recesses of the Circulating Library, has been"
shown to be the most frivolizing that can be devised.” She sets forward
"the result of her experience that a good novel, especially a romantic"
"one, read at twelve or fourteen, is really a beneficial thing."
At present many of the children from the elementary schools get their
first idea of love (if one can give it such a name) from vulgar
"pictures displayed in the shop windows, or jokes on marriage culled"
"from the lowest type of paper, or the proceedings of a divorce-court."
What an antidote to such representation might be found in the story of
"Hector and Andromache,"
"Siegfreid and Brunhild,"
"Dido and Æneas,"
"Orpheus and Eurydice,"
St. Francis and St. Clare.
One of the strongest elements we should introduce into our stories for
children of all ages is that which calls forth love of beauty. And the
"beauty should stand out, not necessarily only in delineation of noble"
"qualities in our heroes and heroines, but in beauty and strength of"
language and form.
In this latter respect the Bible stories are of such inestimable
"Before the curtains of history lifted, one feels the world was like"
this--this Celtic bareness and sombreness and _air_. But perhaps it is
not Celtic at all: Iberian. Nothing is more unsatisfactory than our
conception of what is Celtic and what is not Celtic. I believe there
"never were any Celts, as a race.--As for the Iberians--!"

"Wonderful to go out on a frozen road, to see the grass in shadow bluish"
"with hoar-frost, to see the grass in the yellow winter-sunrise beams"
"melting and going cold-twinkly. Wonderful the bluish, cold air, and"
"things standing up in cold distance. After two southern winters, with"
"roses blooming all the time, this bleakness and this touch of frost in"
"the ringing morning goes to my soul like an intoxication. I am so glad,"
"on this lonely naked road, I don't know what to do with myself. I walk"
"down in the shallow grassy ditches under the loose stone walls, I walk"
"on the little ridge of grass, the little bank on which the wall is"
"built, I cross the road across the frozen cow-droppings: and it is all"
"so familiar to my _feet_, my very feet in contact, that I am wild as if"
"I had made a discovery. And I realize that I hate lime-stone, to live on"
lime-stone or marble or any of those limey rocks. I hate them. They are
"dead rocks, they have no life--thrills for the feet. Even sandstone is"
much better. But granite! Granite is my favorite. It is so live under
"the feet, it has a deep sparkle of its own. I like its roundnesses--and"
"I hate the jaggy dryness of lime-stone, that burns in the sun, and"
withers.

"who was shot, as was Edith Cavell, for nothing more than assisting"
young Belgians to escape from German-occupied Belgium.
"She witnessed the air-raids of the Allies, when only comforting"
"papers were dropped on Brussels city, but bombs on the German"
aerodromes outside; and she also saw the Germans turn their guns
from the aeroplanes--which soared high out of their reach or skimmed
"below range--on to thickly-inhabited streets of the poorer quarters,"
to teach them to cheer the air-craft of the Allies!
"She beheld--or she was told of--many acts of rapine, considered"
cruelty and unreasoning ferocity on the part of German officials or
soldiers; yet saw or heard of acts and episodes of unlooked-for
"kindness, forbearance and sympathy from the same hated people. Von"
"Giesselin, after all, was a not uncommon type; and as to Minna von"
"Stachelberg, she was a saint of the New Religion, the Service of"
Man.
CHAPTER XVIII
THE BOMB IN PORTLAND PLACE
Mrs. Rossiter said to herself in 1915 that she had scarcely known a
"happy day, or even hour, since the War began. In the first place"
Michael had again shown violence of temper with ministers of state
"over the release from prison of ""that"" Miss Warren--""a convict doing"
"a sentence of hard labour."" And then, when he had got her released,"
"The mail arranged, Trude sat back in the cushions of a great wicker"
chair and with a long breath of delight enjoyed the beauty around her.
Each day Edgeacres enraptured her anew and roused in her a wonder as to
"why it should be her lot to be there. ""It ought to be Vick or Issy,"""
"she would apologize to the nodding flowers or to Mitie, the yellow"
warbler.
And as might be expected Trude had found innumerable ways of making
herself useful to Mrs. White as an expression of her gratitude. There
"were telephone calls she could answer, letters she could write,"
"shopping she could do, ordering, she even conferred with old Pepper and"
"Jonathan, the gardener. She drove with Mrs. White in the afternoon and"
served tea to the callers who flocked to the house from the nearby
summer hotels.
"""I do not know how I ever got along without you, my dear,"" Mrs. White"
"had said more than once. ""What do you do to make yourself so"
invaluable? It seems as though just to look at you one leans on you!
Even Pepper is saying 'Miss Trude thinks this and Miss Trude thinks
"that--'"""
"Her benevolent interest in her husband's wards, a certain pride in"
"saying to her friends: ""My husband, you know, is looking after the"
"daughters of Joseph Romley, who was a college friend of his,"" had grown"
"into a real fondness for Trude. ""I have never appreciated the dear girl"
"when she's been with us before,"" she declared to her husband. ""I"
"suppose it was because we were in town, then, and I was too busy to get"
"acquainted with her. Why, she's really pretty. And she makes such a"
slave of herself to her sisters! She hasn't any life of her own. I
"don't believe they appreciate it, either. It's a shame she doesn't"
"marry some nice young man--"" Mrs. White's kind always found virtue's"
"valuables, slung them somehow on her left arm, while with her other"
she piloted the nearly swooning Mrs. Warren into the court.
They were at once stopped by a non-commissioned officer who asked
"them in abrupt, scarcely understandable German what they wanted."
Vivie guessing his meaning said in English--she scarcely knew any
"German: ""This is our house. We have been absent in Brussels. We want"
"to see the officer in command."" The soldier knew no English, but"
likewise guessed at their meaning. He ordered them to wait where
they were. Presently he came out of the Villa and said the Herr
Oberst would see them. Vivie led her mother into the gay little
hall--how pleasant and cool it had looked in the early morning! It
was now full of surly-looking soldiers. Without hesitating she took
"a chair from one soldier and placed her mother in it. ""You rest"
"there a moment, dearest, while I go in and see the officer in"
"command."" The corporal she had first spoken with beckoned her into"
the pretty sitting-room at the back where they had had their early
breakfast that morning.
Here she saw seated at a table consulting plans of Brussels and
"other papers a tall, handsome man of early middle age, who might"
"indeed have passed for a young man, had he not looked very tired and"
"care-worn and exhibited a bald patch at the back of his head,"
rendered the more apparent because the brown-gold curls round it
"were dank with perspiration. He rose to his feet, clicked his heels"
"together and saluted. ""An English young lady, I am told, rather ..."
"a ... surprise ... on ... the ... outskirts ... of Brussels..."" (His"
"English was excellent, if rather staccato and spaced.) ""It ... is"
... not ... usual ... for ... Englishwomen ... to ... be owners ...
of chateaux ... in Belgium. But I ... hear ... it ... is ... your
"mother ... who is the owner ... from long time, and you are her"
daughter newly arrived from England? Nicht wahr? Sie verstehen nicht

dream of murder after eating pheasant at night; this time it was she
"herself who was to be killed, and she awoke imagining that she was"
struggling with the would-be murderer.]

"[Footnote 94: Dreams of railway travelling, and especially of losing"
"trains, are not always associated with headache or any other recognisable"
condition. They constitute a very common type of dream not quite easy to
"explain. Dr. Savage mentions, for instance, that in his own case scarcely"
"a week passes without such a dream, though in real life he scarcely ever"
loses a train and never worries about it. Wundt considers that the dreams
in which we seek something we cannot find or have left something behind
are due to indefinite coenaesthesic disturbances involving feelings of
"the same emotional tone, such as an uncomfortable position or a slight"
irregularity of respiration. I have myself independently observed the same
"connection, though it is not invariably traceable.]"
"[Footnote 95: E. H. Clarke, _Visions_, p. 294.]"
"[Footnote 96: An amusing, though solemn, interpretation of an ordinary"
"dream of murder, railway travelling, and impending death, as experienced"
"by Anna Kingsford, is furnished by her friend and biographer, Edward"

appeared to be magnified at least ten times. Clinching the fingers and
opening them again produced the feeling of their moving through a space of
several feet.']

"[Footnote 114: Horace Hutchinson, who in his _Dreams and their Meanings_"
"(1901), has independently suggested that 'this flying dream is caused by"
"some action of the breathing organs,' mentions the significant fact (p."
128) that the idea of filling the lungs as a help in levitation occurs in
the flying dreams of many persons.]
[Footnote 115: We have an analogous state of tactile anaesthesia in the
early stages of chloroform intoxication. Thus Elmer Jones found that this
"sense is, after hearing, the first to disappear. 'With the disappearance"
"of the tactile sense and hearing,' he remarks, 'the body has completely"
"lost its orientation. It appears to be nowhere, simply floating in space."
It is a most ecstatic feeling.']
[Footnote 116: Lafcadio Hearn describes the fall as coming at the
"beginning of the dream. Dr. Guthrie (_Clinical Journal_, June 7, 1899),"
"in his own case, describes the flying sensations as coming first and the"
"falling as coming afterwards, and apparently due to sudden failure of the"
power of flight; the first part of the dream is agreeable but after the
"fall the dreamer awakes shaken, shocked, and breathless.]"
[Footnote 117: The disagreeable nature of falling in dreams may probably
be connected with the absence of rhythm usually present in dreams of
flying. Most of the psychologists who have occupied themselves with rhythm
"have insisted on its pleasurable emotional tone, as leading to a state"
"bordering on ecstasy (see _e.g._ J. B. Miner, 'Motor, Visual, and Applied"
were demanded and gradually the psalter appeared with tunes. Early tune
"versions put the melody invariably in the tenor. The latest edition,"
"printed in 1929, by the Oxford Press, contains the best Psalm tunes"
"which had gradually come into use, many of them arranged with"
“Faux-bourdon” (wherein the congregation sings one or more verses to the
"melody while the choir supplies the harmony), and “Descant” (a second"
melody over that of the tune).
"f. _The New Version_, Tate and Brady, London, 1696. This version"
"gradually supplanted the _Old Version_ of Sternhold and Hopkins, and"
held its place in the worship of the church for 150 years. It was
"adopted, in 1789, by the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United"
States and bound with the prayer book of that Communion.
The above versions are only a few of the large number of psalters that
"were published by the Calvinistic churches on the Continent, in Great"
"Britain, and in America. The metrical psalms were designed for the"
singing church. They were intended to restore song to the people in
"their worship, serving in this respect a similar purpose to the chorales"
in Germany.
"Some of the psalm books were published without music, some with the"
"melody only, and others in four-part harmony. The statement is"
frequently made that Calvinistic Protestantism approved only unison
"singing. The appearance of numerous books, complete with four voice"
"parts, points to the contrary. It is true that Calvin at first"
"encouraged unison singing only, regarding harmony more in the nature of"
amusement than the worship of God; but upon observing the effectiveness
"of singing in Germany, he soon changed his views and became more liberal"
in this respect.
"make the most of her remaining time. Sophia Wilmington, for whom she"
"had called, had already gone out. The Canon, who was engaged over his"
"correspondence, she was to meet later at the Kursaal. It was a lovely"
"morning. The line of white hotels, with their al fresco breakfast tables"
"spread temptingly on the terraces, gleamed in the sun. The _digue_ was"
"bright with summer dresses. The sands below alive with tennis players,"
"children making sand-castles, and loungers, and bathers, and horses"
moving among the bathing-machines. Yvonne tripped along with careless
tread. Her heart was in harmony with the brightness and movement and
"the glint of the sun on the sea. Once a man, meeting her smiling glance,"
"hesitated as if to speak to her, but seeing that the smile was addressed"
"to the happy world in general, he passed on his way. It was easy to"
kill time. She went down the Rue Flammande and looked at the shops. The
jewelry and the models of Paris dresses delighted her. The display
of sweets at Nopenny’s allured her within. When she returned to the
"_digue_, it was time to seek the Canon at the Kursaal."
The liveried attendants lifted their hats as she ran up the steps and
passed the barrier. She gave them a smiling “_bonjour_.” Neither the
"Canon nor any of the friends being visible on the verandah, she entered"
"the great hall, where the morning instrumental concert was going on."
"She scanned the talking, laughing crowd as she passed through. Many eyes"
"followed her. For Yvonne, when happy, was sweet to look upon. She was"
"turning back to retrace her steps, when, suddenly, a man started up from"
a group of three who were playing cards and drinking absinthe at a small
"table, and placed himself before her."
“_Tiens! c’est Yvonne!_”
She stared at him with dilated eyes and parted lips and uttered a little
gasping cry. Seeing her grow deadly white and thinking she was going to
"faint, the man put out his arm. But Yvonne was mistress of herself."
girl anyway--so much for Pola's education. And culture--what benefited
all the culture of Europe if Pola found enjoyment only in the company
of youths her mother would not permit in the house?
"Pola mistook Sidney's silence for hurt. ""You goose, I'm not saying I"
think I'm any better than _you_ are! But you must see that neither of
"us are a bit like that native girl!"" Which admission Pola considered"
most generous.
"""I wasn't thinking about whether you are any better than I am or not."
"I've been brought up, you see,"" with a rueful laugh, ""to believe that"
my father being a poet set _me_ a little apart from everyone else. And
I've hated it. What I was thinking was that there really isn't any
"class difference in people--except what we make ourselves, like the"
League building a barrier around me and you thinking you're in another
class from Mart because you're rich. Maybe it isn't really the outside
"things that count, maybe it's the big things we have got or haven't got"
"inside us--"""
"""Like what?"" demanded Pola."
Sidney was thinking of Lav's self-effacing ambition to serve the world
"from the seclusion of a laboratory, of Mart's cheerfulness in the face"
of her lot and her loyal affection for her exacting and rheumatic
"grandmother; of the courage of Mart's grandfather, Ambrose Calkins, who"
had lost his own life in going back to his sinking schooner for the
"cook who could not swim; of her own ancestor, Priscilla Ellis. _Those_"
"were the things which set people apart from their fellows, Sidney"
"thought, but the understanding was too new in her own heart for her to"
"find words in which she could tell Pola of it. ""Like what?"" Pola"
demanded again and this time her voice was a little haughty.

"My neighbor Olaus can't do any more either, even if he builds a place"
that's ten times as big. Look over there--now he's building another
"house--a shed, I'd call it--and he's got three grown men working on it so"
he can get it done by next summer. But it won't be much bigger than my
"place at that, and anyhow, the gentry don't want to be bothered walking"
all that distance to his place when here's my house right at the car stop.
"And besides it was me that started it, and if I was Olaus I wouldn't have"
wanted to imitate me like a regular monkey and started keeping boarders
which I didn't know the first thing about. But he can't make himself any
"different from what he is, so he puts up a few old bits of canvas and rugs"
and cardboard inside his barn and gets people to sleep there. But I'd
"never ask the gentry to sleep in a barn, a storehouse for fodder and hay"
"for dumb beasts, if you'll excuse my mentioning it! But of course if"

have been not a whit more perplexed at the prospect. As for John he had
the sensation of living in a fantastic dream. A child of six would have
"been a more practical ally. In the course of befogged conversation,"
"however, it was arranged that Miss Lindon should transfer to the new"
"house her worldly belongings, of which she was to give him an inventory,"
"including Dandy and Dickie and her maid Phoebe, a most respectable"
"girl of Baptist upbringing, who had been cruelly jilted by a prosperous"
"undertaker in the neighborhood, whom, if you had seen him conducting a"
"funeral, you would have thought as serious and God-fearing a man as the"
"clergyman himself; which showed how hypocritical men could be, and how"
"you ought never to trust to appearances. It was also settled that, as"
soon as Unity could be rescued from the guardianship of the orphanage
authorities and comfortably installed in a convalescent home by the
"seaside, Miss Lindon would journey thither in order to make her ward's"
acquaintance. In the meanwhile John would go house-hunting.
"“Walter Herold will help me,” said John."
"“That's your friend who acts, is n't it?” said Miss Lindon. “I have n't"
"any objection to theatres myself. In fact, I often used to go to see"
Irving when I was young. You meet quite a nice class of people in the
dress-circle. But I don't think ladies ought to go on the stage. I hope
Mr. Herold won't put such an idea into Unity's head.”
"“I don't think he will,” said John."
“Young girls are sometimes so flighty. My old friend Mrs. Willcox had
"a daughter who went on the stage, and she married an actor, and now has"
"twelve children, and lives in Cheshire. I was hearing about her only the"
other day. I suppose Unity will have to be taught music and drawing and
French like any other young lady.”

GUAYMI INDIAN MAN
Note the tattoed marking of face and the negroid lips]
The Choco Indians are one of the smaller and least known tribes of the
Darien. Prof. Pittier--who may without disrespect be described as the
most seasoned “tropical tramp” of all Central America--described them so
vividly that extracts from his article in the National Geographic
Magazine will be of interest:
"“Never, in our twenty-five years of tropical experience, have we met"
"with such a sun-loving, bright and trusting people, living nearest to"
nature and ignoring the most elementary wiles of so-called civilization.
They are several hundred in number and their dwellings are scattered
"along the meandrous Sambu and its main reaches, always at short"
"distance, but never near enough to each other to form real villages."
"Like their houses, their small plantations are close to the river, but"
mostly far enough to escape the eye of the casual passer-by.
“Dugouts drawn up on the beach and a narrow trail breaking the reed wall
"at the edge of the bank are the only visible signs of human presence,"
"except at the morning hours and near sunset, when a crowd of women and"
"children will be seen playing in the water, and the men, armed with"
"their bows and long harpooned arrows, scrutinizing the deeper places for"
"itself.""[7] The mere Ã¦sthetic sensibility makes but a new artist; what"
"makes the critic is his philosophy. Here also, however, as during the"
"whole course of our inquiry, we must not identify philosophy with the"
"official history of philosophical disciplines, which offers a large"
number of theories of Ã¦sthetics only remotely related to the concrete
"works of art, to the concrete processes of Ã¦sthetic creation, but with"
"the whole history of human thought, with the working out of particular"
problems successively presented to the intelligence of man by the
"actual developments of poetry and art. The Ã¦sthetic judgment, like"
"every other judgment, is a synthesis of the individual intuition, or"
"subject, and of the universal category, or predicate; and this is but"
"another way of stating the identity of Ã¦sthetic criticism, as of all"
"forms of history, with philosophy. The critic must be endowed with a"
"power to give new life, within his own mind, to the intuitions of the"
"artist, but this is for him but the soil in which his thought must"
"spread its roots; it is true that without that power, no criticism"
"is possible, but it is equally true that no philosophy of art can"
grow on any but that same soil. The ultimate test of the validity of
Ã¦sthetic thought is in its capacity to expand our sphere of Ã¦sthetic
apprehension; and pure Ã¦sthetics is but the methodological moment of
Ã¦sthetic history or criticism.

"Daphne Wing sighed out: ""Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen!"" and, bending over that hand,"
"kissed it.  Gyp saw that her new glove was wet.  Then the girl relapsed,"
"her feet a little forward, her head a little forward, her back against"
"the door.  Gyp, who knew why she stood thus, was swept again by those two"
"emotions--rage against men, and fellow feeling for one about to go"
through what she herself had just endured.
"""It's all right,"" she said, gently; ""only, what's to be done?"""
Daphne Wing put her hands up over her white face and sobbed.  She sobbed
so quietly but so terribly deeply that Gyp herself had the utmost
difficulty not to cry.  It was the sobbing of real despair by a creature
"bereft of hope and strength, above all, of love--the sort of weeping"
"which is drawn from desolate, suffering souls only by the touch of fellow"
"feeling.  And, instead of making Gyp glad or satisfying her sense of"
"justice, it filled her with more rage against her husband--that he had"
taken this girl's infatuation for his pleasure and then thrown her away.
"She seemed to see him discarding that clinging, dove-fair girl, for"
"cloying his senses and getting on his nerves, discarding her with caustic"
"words, to abide alone the consequences of her infatuation.  She put her"
"hand timidly on that shaking shoulder, and stroked it.  For a moment the"
"sobbing stopped, and the girl said brokenly:"
"""Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I do love him so!""  At those naive words, a painful"
"wish to laugh seized on Gyp, making her shiver from head to foot.  Daphne"
"Wing saw it, and went on: ""I know--I know--it's awful; but I do--and now"
"he--he--""  Her quiet but really dreadful sobbing broke out again.  And"
"again Gyp began stroking and stroking her shoulder.  ""And I have been so"
"awful to you!  Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, do forgive me, please!"""
"All Gyp could find to answer, was:"
We were shown everything that we desired to see except the
transmission room and the upper conning tower--the twin holy of holies
"in a commissioned ship--and slipped away, escaping the Captain by a"
"bare two minutes. Which was lucky, as he would probably have had us"
"thrown into the ""ditch."""
"The end of the day was as weariful as the beginning, and we were all"
"glad--especially, I expect, Mrs. Cary--to go early to bed. That"
"ill-used lady, to whom we could disclose nothing of our anxieties,"
must have found us wretched company.
We had finished breakfast the next morning--the Saturday of Dawson's
gamble--and were sitting on Cary's big fireguard talking of every
"subject, except the one which had kept us awake at night, when a"
servant entered and announced that a soldier was at the door with a
"message from Mr. Dawson. ""Show him in,"" almost shouted Cary, and I"
"jumped to my feet, stirred for once into a visible display of"
eagerness.
"A Marine came in, dressed in the smart blue sea kit that I love; upon"
his head the low flat cap of his Corps. He gave us a full swinging
"salute, and jumped to attention with a click of his heels. He looked"
"about thirty-five, and wore a neatly trimmed dark moustache. His hair,"
"also very dark, was cropped close to his head. Standing there with his"
"hands upon the red seams of his trousers, his chest well filled out,"
"and his face weather tanned, he looked a proper figure of a sea-going"
"soldier. ""Mr. Cary, sir,"" he said, in a flat, monotonous orderly's"
"voice, ""Major Boyle's compliments, and could you and your friend come"
down to the Police Station to meet him and Chief Inspector Dawson. I
"have a taxi-cab at the door, sir."""
"""Certainly,"" cried Cary; ""in two minutes we shall be ready."""
"And without so much as turning his head again, Grey Dumaresq walked off,"
"his head held high, neither observing nor returning the many salutes and"
bright arch glances shot at him from the lane of bystanders through
"which he needs must pass, but walking like a man in a dream, and so"
disappearing from view along the white road which led Londonwards.
Round Lord Sandford men were buzzing like bees disturbed.
"""Insolent young jackanapes!""  ""What did he mean?""  ""What was his motive"
"in such an insult?""  ""What will you do, my lord?""  ""Whither has he gone?"
"Whither will he go?""  ""Is it true that he is ruined?""  ""He has lost his"
"horse, at least. None will give him a score of guineas for the beast"
"now.""  ""How did it chance?""  ""Was it an accident?""  ""What meant he by"
"his words?""  All were pouring out these and like questions; but there"
"was none to answer them, till Lord Sandford himself spoke."
"""The fellow’s wits are gone astray,"" he cried in his loud, dominating"
"tones.  ""It is the Dumaresq blood.  Sir Hugh was just such another—mad"
"as a March hare half his time, flinging his gold to the winds, and"
"quarrelling with every man he met.  Like father, like son.  It has been"
coming on for days. I misdoubted me if ever he would ride this race. He
"came and told me he must reform.  That was ever his father’s cry, and he"
"would disappear into the country for a while, and reappear again as gay"
"as ever.  ’Tis the same with the son.  I saw it then, and I strove to"
combat the madness; but ’tis ill dealing with the lunatic.  You see what
we get for our pains!  Tush! let the fellow alone.  I did wrong to
"answer him.  Let him go his own way, and we will think of him no more."""
"And Lord Sandford, with a heavy cloud upon his brow, and a look about"
"the corners of his mouth which warned those about him to say no more,"
"but leave matters as they were, flung away from them, and made his way"
"back alone to the inn, from which he was presently seen to issue forth"
Equally strong in fascination and vigour is “The Splendid Idle
"Forties,” but as far removed from “The Conqueror” as were the"
Eastern and Western seaboards of this country in the times of
"which the stories treat, “the long, drowsy, shimmering days"
"before the Gringo came,” to the California of which she writes."
"“Pointed, spirited, and Spanish” are these “rich and impressive”"
stories; “such as could hardly have been told in any other
country since the Bagdad of the ‘Thousand and One Nights.’ The
"book is full of weird fascination, and will add to Mrs."
"Atherton’s deservedly high reputation,” says _The Athenæum_."
“In this book even more than in her others is shown that
imaginative brilliancy so striking as to set one
wondering what is the secret of the effect. . . . For
"the rest, her charm lies in temperament, magnetic,"
"restless, assertive, vivid.”—_Washington Times._"
In close relation to “The Conqueror” stands Mrs. Atherton’s
"still more recent selection of “A Few of Hamilton’s Letters,”"
chosen from the great bulk of his state papers and other letters
in such a way as to bring to the average reader the means of
estimating the personality of this remarkable man from his own
words. Incidentally it is the surest refutation of some of the
"hasty criticisms upon the picture of him in “The Conqueror,”"
"where, as Mr. Le Gallienne justly observes, “it was reserved for"
Mrs. Atherton to make him really alive to the present
generation.”
"modesty. ""When I heard how the enemy plotted and Dawson"
counter-plotted with all those skilled workmen in his detective
"service, it occurred to me that an enemy with imagination might"
counter-counterplot by getting men inside Dawson's defences. I
"couldn't see how one would work it, but if German agents, say, could"
"manage to become trusted servants of Dawson himself, they would have"
"the time of their lives. So far I was guessing at a possibility,"
however improbable it might seem. Then when Dawson told us that he had
sent Trehayne into the _Antigone_ and that he was the one factor
common to both vessels--the workmen and the maintenance part were all
different--I began to feel that my wild theory might have something in
"it. I didn't say anything to you, Cary, or to Dawson--he despises"
"theories. Afterwards Trehayne came in and I spoke to him, and he to"
"me, in French. He did not utter a dozen words altogether, but I was"
absolutely certain that his French had not been learned at an English
public school and during short trips on the Continent. I know too much
of English school French and of one's opportunities to learn upon
Continental trips. It took me three years of hard work to recover from
"the sort of French which I learned at school, and I am not well yet."
The French spoken by Trehayne was the French of the nursery. It was
"almost, if not quite, his mother tongue, just as his English was."
Trehayne's French accent did not fit into Trehayne's history as
retailed to us by Dawson. From that moment I plumped for Trehayne as
"the cutter of gun wires."""
"Dawson had been listening, though he showed no interest in my speech."
"When I had quite finished, and was basking in the respectful"
"admiration emanating from dear old Cary, he upset over me a bucket of"
very cold water.
"""Very pretty,"" said he. ""But answer one question. Why did I send"
"Trehayne to the _Antigone_?"""
dead friends to receive the blessing of the archbishop after the battle
of Roncevalles[35]; and of Napoleon sending the sailor back to England.
There is a moment in the story of Gunnar when he pauses in the midst of
"the slaughter of his enemies, and says, “I wonder if I am less brave"
"than others, because I kill men less willingly than they.”"
And in the “Njal's Burning” from Andrew Lang's “Book of Romance” we
"have the words of the boy Thord when his grandmother, Bergthora, urges"
him to go out of the burning house.
"“You promised me when I was little, grandmother, that I never should go"
from you till I wished it of myself. And I would rather die with you
than live after you.”
Here the moral courage is so splendidly shown; none of these heroes
"feared to die in battle or in open single fight, but to face a death by"
fire for higher considerations is a point of view worth presenting to
the child.
In spite of all the dramatic excitement roused by the conduct of our
"soldiers and sailors,[36] should we not try to offer also in our"
stories the romance and excitement of saving as well as _taking_ life?
I would have quite a collection dealing with the thrilling adventures
"of the Life-Boat and the Fire Brigade, of which I hope to present"
examples in the final Story List.
"Finally, we ought to include a certain number of stories dealing with"
"Death, especially with children who are of an age to realise that it"
"must come to all, and that this is not a calamity but a perfectly"
natural and simple thing. At present the child in the street invariably
connects death with sordid accidents. I think they should have stories
XVIII
"Fiorsen's bedroom was--as the maid would remark--""a proper pigsty""--until"
he was out of it and it could be renovated each day.  He had a talent for
"disorder, so that the room looked as if three men instead of one had gone"
"to bed in it.  Clothes and shoes, brushes, water, tumblers,"
"breakfast-tray, newspapers, French novels, and cigarette-ends--none were"
ever where they should have been; and the stale fumes from the many
cigarettes he smoked before getting up incommoded anyone whose duty it
"was to take him tea and shaving-water.  When, on that first real summer"
"day, the maid had brought Rosek up to him, he had been lying a long time"
"on his back, dreamily watching the smoke from his cigarette and four"
flies waltzing in the sunlight that filtered through the green
"sun-blinds.  This hour, before he rose, was his creative moment, when he"
could best see the form of music and feel inspiration for its rendering.
"Of late, he had been stale and wretched, all that side of him dull; but"
"this morning he felt again the delicious stir of fancy, that vibrating,"
half-dreamy state when emotion seems so easily to find shape and the mind
"pierces through to new expression.  Hearing the maid's knock, and her"
"murmured: ""Count Rosek to see you, sir,"" he thought: 'What the devil does"
"he want?' A larger nature, drifting without control, in contact with a"
"smaller one, who knows his own mind exactly, will instinctively be"
"irritable, though he may fail to grasp what his friend is after."
"And pushing the cigarette-box toward Rosek, he turned away his head.  It"
"would be money he had come about, or--that girl!  That girl--he wished"
"she was dead!  Soft, clinging creature!  A baby! God!  What a fool he had"
"been--ah, what a fool!  Such absurdity! Unheard of!  First Gyp--then her!"
He had tried to shake the girl off.  As well try to shake off a burr!
"How she clung!  He had been patient--oh, yes--patient and kind, but how"
"not born a princess! It goes to my heart to make her a prisoner!"""
The Sergeant uttered a guttural grunt which intimated that in his
opinion the influence of the petticoat on the career of a soldier might
"be over-done. Otherwise he maintained his gravity, speaking only when he"
was directly appealed to and giving his judgment with due submission to
his superiors.
Finally it was judged that they should make a night march over the
"mountains, find some suitable place to lie up in during the day, and in"
the morning send in La Giralda and the Sergeant to San Ildefonso in the
guise of fagot sellers to find out if the gipsy boy of Baza had spoken
the truth.

San Ildefonso and La Granja are two of the most strangely situated
places in Spain. A high and generally snow-clad Sierra divides them from
Madrid and the south. The palace is one of the most high-lying upon
"earth, having originally been one of the mountain granges of the monks"
"of Segovia to which a king of Spain took a fancy, and, what is more"
"remarkable, for which he was willing to pay good money."
"Upon the site a palace has been erected, a miniature Versailles,"
"infinitely more charming than the original, with walks, fountains,"
"waterfalls all fed by the cold snow water of the Guadarrama, and fanned"
by the pure airs of the mountains. This Grange has been for centuries a
"favourite resort of the Court of Spain, and specially during these last"
"years of the Regent Cristina, who, when tired with the precision and"
"etiquette of the Court of Madrid, retired hither that she might do as"
she pleased for at least two or three months of the year.
one hand and a dart in the Heart with three drops of Blood proceeding from
"it in the other."" They took nine Portuguese vessels off the coast of"
"Brazil, out of which they took plunder of very great value."
"Quelch now had the audacity to sail back to Marblehead, where his crew"
landed and quickly scattered with their plunder. Within a week Quelch was
"in gaol, and was taken to Boston, where his trial began on June 17th,"
"1704, and he was found guilty. The days between the sentence and the"
"execution must have, indeed, been trying for the prisoner. We read in a"
"pamphlet published at the time: ""The Ministers of the Town used more than"
ordinary Endeavours to Instruct the Prisoners and bring them to
"Repentance. There were Sermons Preached in their hearing Every Day, and"
"Prayer daily made with them. And they were Catechised, and they had many"
occasional Exhortations. And nothing was left that could be done for their
"Good."""
"On Friday, June 30th, 1704, Quelch and his companions marched on foot"
through the town of Boston to Scarlil's Wharf with a strong armed guard of
"musketeers, accompanied by various officials and two ministers, while in"
"front was carried a silver oar, the emblem of a pirate's execution. Before"
the last act the minister gave a long and fervent harangue to the wretched
"culprits, in all of whom were observed suitable signs of repentance except"
"Quelch, who, stepping forward on the platform, his hat in his hand, and"
"bowing left and right to the spectators, gave a short address, in which he"
"warned them ""They should take care how they brought Money into New England"
"to be Hanged for it."""
"QUITTANCE, JOHN."
One of Captain Quelch's crew of the brigantine _Charles_. Tried with the
"rest of that crew at the Star Tavern at Boston in June, 1704."
"soul, possessed him,--and the comprehension of Christ's Sacrifice was"
"no longer a mystery! Yet he was so certain that death, sudden and"
"speedy closely, awaited him that he seemed to feel it in the very"
"air,--not like a coming chill of dread, but like the soft approach of"
some holy seraph bringing benediction. It mattered little to him that
"he was actually in the very plenitude of health and strength,--that"
perhaps in all his life he had never felt such a keen delight in the
"physical perfection of his manhood as now,--death, without warning and"
"at a touch, could smite down the most vigorous, and to be so smitten,"
"he believed, was his imminent destiny. And while he lingered on the"
"bridge, fancy-perplexed between grief and joy, a small window opened in"
a quaint house that bent its bulging gables crookedly over the gleaming
"water, and a girl, holding a small lamp, looked out for a moment. Her"
"face, fresh and smiling, was fair to see against the background of"
"dense shadow,--the light she carried flashed like a star,--and leaning"
"down from the lattice she sang half-timidly, half mischievously, the"
"first two or three bars of the old song.. ""Du, du, liegst in mein"
"Herzen ... !"" ""Ah! Gute Nacht, Liebchen!"" said a man's voice below."
"""Gute Nacht! Schlafen sie wohl!"""
"A light laugh, and the window closed, ""Good-night! Sleep well!"" Love's"
"best wish!--and for some sad souls life's last hope,--a ""good-night and"
"sleep well!"" Poor tired World, for whose weary inhabitants oftentimes"
the greatest blessing is sleep! Good-night! sleep well! but the sleep
"implies waking.--waking to a morning of pleasure or sorrow,--or labor"
"that is only lightened by,--Love! Love!--love divine,--love"
"human,--and, sweetest love of all for us, as Christ has taught when"
both divine and human are mingled in one!
"Alwyn, glancing up at the clustering stars, hanging like pendent"
"fire-jewels above him, thought of this marvel-glory of Love,--this"
seem that the Emperor's power is in danger rather than Luther and his
"adherents. 'If I had been present', writes Erasmus, 'I should have"
endeavoured that this tragedy would have been so tempered by moderate
arguments that it could not afterwards break out again to the still
greater detriment of the world.'
The imperial sentence was pronounced: within the Empire (as in the
Burgundian Netherlands before that time) Luther's books were to be
"burned, his adherents arrested and their goods confiscated, and Luther"
was to be given up to the authorities. Erasmus hopes that now relief
will follow. 'The Luther tragedy is at an end with us here; would it had
"never appeared on the stage.' In these days Albrecht Dürer, on hearing"
"the false news of Luther's death, wrote in the diary of his journey that"
"passionate exclamation: 'O Erasmus of Rotterdam, where will you be?"
"Hear, you knight of Christ, ride forth beside the Lord Christ, protect"
"the truth, obtain the martyr's crown. For you are but an old manikin. I"
"have heard you say that you have allowed yourself two more years, in"
"which you are still fit to do some work; spend them well, in behalf of"
"the Gospel and the true Christian faith.... O Erasmus, be on this side,"
that God may be proud of you.'
"It expresses confidence in Erasmus's power, but at bottom is the"
expectation that he will not do all this. Dürer had rightly understood
Erasmus.
"The struggle abated nowise, least of all at Louvain. Latomus, the most"
"dignified and able of Louvain divines, had now become one of the most"
"serious opponents of Luther and, in so doing, touched Erasmus, too,"
"indirectly. To Nicholas of Egmond, the Carmelite, another of Erasmus's"
"compatriots had been added as a violent antagonist, Vincent Dirks of"
"Haarlem, a Dominican. Erasmus addresses himself to the faculty, to"
"defend himself against the new attacks, and to explain why he has never"
"too. Besides, Josephine has little to play and be cheerful for; things"
"have gone badly this year, and may grow worse as time goes on. The"
"prospect is not a good one. ""But something will turn up,"" says Josephine."
"She need not worry, for she has money in the bank, and no doubt there is a"
"young man in the offing, on the other side of the fjeld."
"Oh, yes, Josephine will always manage; she thinks of everything. The other"
"day, for instance--when Miss Torsen and her friend left. The friend could"
"not pay his bill, and all he said was that he had expected money, but it"
"hadn't come, and he couldn't stay any longer because of his private"
"affairs. That was all very well, but when would the bill be paid? Why, he"
"would send it from the town, of course; that was where he had his money!"
"""But how do we know we'll get the money?--from him, anyway,"" said"
"Josephine. ""We've had these actor-people here before. And I didn't like"
"the way he swanked about outside, thinking he was as good as anybody, and"
throwing his stick up in the air and catching it again. And then when Miss
"Torsen came in to say good-bye, I told her, and I wondered if she couldn't"
"let me have the money for him. Miss Torsen was shocked, and said, 'Hasn't"
"he paid himself?' 'No,' I said, 'he hasn't, and this year being such a bad"
"one, we need every penny.' So then Miss Torsen said of course we should"
"get the money; how much was it? And I told her, and she said she couldn't"
"pay for him now, but she would see the money was sent; we could trust her"
"for that. And I think we can, too. We'll get the money all right, if not"
"from him. I daresay she'll send it herself...."""
And Josephine went off to serve me my dinner.
"Paul is on his feet now, too. Not that his step is always very steady, but"
at least he puts his feet to the ground. But he takes no interest in
things; he does little more than feeding the horses and chopping some
wood. He ought to be clearing the manure out of the summer cow houses for
"sullen. He looked frowningly at me, and I watched him equally"
"frowningly, and took him for a thinker, an Ibsenite whose imagination"
was lost among the ice of his own country. Now and then I would see
"him walking up and down the corridor, rubbing his hands together so"
continuously and so frantically that they made a noise like bones.
"“Suddenly, this gentleman is transformed as if by magic; he begins to"
"joke with the servants, he seizes a chair and dances with it, and the"
other day I saw him alone in the salon marching around with a paper hat
"on his head, like children playing soldiers, and blowing on a cornet,"
"also made of paper.” I stared at him in amazement, he smiled like a"
"child, and asked if he was disturbing me."
"“‘No, no, not in the least,’ I told him."
"“I have asked in the hotel if this man is crazy, and they have told me"
"that he is not, but is a professor, a man of science, who is known to"
have these strange fits of gaiety.
"“Another of the Norwegian’s doings has been to compose a serenade, with"
"a vulgar melody that would disgust you, and which he has dedicated ‘_A"
"la bella Italia_.’ He wrote the Italian words himself, but as he knows"
"no music, he had a pianist come here and write out his serenade. What"
he especially wants is that it should be full of sentiment; and so the
"pianist arranged it with directions and many pauses, which satisfied"
the Norwegian. Almost every night the serenade ‘_A la bella Italia_’
"is sung. Somebody who wants to amuse himself goes to the piano, the"
Norwegian strikes a languid attitude and chants his serenade. Sometimes
"he goes in front of the piano, sometimes behind, but invariably he hears"
"the storm of applause when it ends, and he bows with great gusto."
"“I don’t know whether it’s the other people who are laughing at him, or"
"about eleven.  With the instinct to take all the respite she could, and"
"knowing no more than before how she would receive his return, she went"
out in the forenoon and wandered about all day shopping and trying not to
"think.  Returning at tea-time, she went straight up to her baby, and"
"there heard from Betty that he had come, and gone out with his violin to"
the music-room.
"Bent over the child, Gyp needed all her self-control--but her"
"self-control was becoming great.  Soon, the girl would come fluttering"
"down that dark, narrow lane; perhaps at this very minute her fingers were"
"tapping at the door, and he was opening it to murmur, ""No; she's back!"""
"Ah, then the girl would shrink!  The rapid whispering--some other"
"meeting-place!  Lips to lips, and that look on the girl's face; till she"
"hurried away from the shut door, in the darkness, disappointed!  And he,"
"on that silver-and-gold divan, gnawing his moustache, his"
"eyes--catlike---staring at the fire! And then, perhaps, from his violin"
"would come one of those swaying bursts of sound, with tears in them, and"
"the wind in them, that had of old bewitched her!  She said:"
"""Open the window just a little, Betty dear--it's hot."""
"There it was, rising, falling!  Music!  Why did it so move one even when,"
"as now, it was the voice of insult!  And suddenly she thought: ""He will"
"expect me to go out there again and play for him. But I will not, never!"""
"She put her baby down, went into her bedroom, and changed hastily into a"
"teagown for the evening, ready to go downstairs.  A little shepherdess in"
"china on the mantel-shelf attracted her attention, and she took it in her"
"hand.  She had bought it three and more years ago, when she first came to"
"London, at the beginning of that time of girl-gaiety when all life seemed"
"a long cotillion, and she its leader.  Its cool daintiness made it seem"
"the symbol of another world, a world without depths or shadows, a world"
No foot is allowed to touch the _Scala Santa_; it must be ascended
on the knees. A number of people were going up in this way when
"we entered, pausing on each step to repeat a prayer, for which"
indulgences are granted by the Pope. There are stairways on each
"side, by which those who have thus crawled up may walk down. The"
"only man I know of that ever walked down the Holy Stairs themselves,"
"and the most illustrious man that ever crawled up them on his knees,"
"was Martin Luther. When he had mounted slowly half way up, step by"
"step on his knees, he seemed to hear a voice saying, ""The just shall"
"live by faith."" Martin Luther rose from his knees, walked down the"
"staircase, and left the place a free man so far as this superstition"
"was concerned, and shortly afterwards became the most formidable foe"
that ever assailed the falsehood and corruption of the Romish Church.
[Sidenote: The Miraculous Portrait and the Shoes of Christ.]
At the top of the Scala Santa we saw through a grating the beautiful
silver tabernacle containing the great relic which has given to this
"chapel the name of _Sancta Sanctorum_, viz.: the portrait of Christ,"
"held by the Romish Church to be authentic, having been drawn in outline"
"by St. Luke and finished by an angel, whence its name ""Acheiropoëton,"""
"_i. e._, the picture made without hands. The relic chamber here"
"contains fragments of the true cross, the sandals of Christ, and ""the"
iron bar of Hades which he brought away with him from that doleful
"region,""[10] but we did not see these."
"[Sidenote: The Inscription on the Cross, and the Finger of Thomas.]"
A short walk beyond the Scala Santa and the Lateran brings us to the
"Church of S. Croce in Gerusalemme, which is specially rich in relics."
Here our party was shown a piece of the true cross of Christ and the
a nearby roof garden. They struck green magic from the glassy blot
"that was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things"
"as eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked"
the white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the
Institute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially
across the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and
"the ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room."
And in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers'
"Foundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr."
It was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America

"Not one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triple-paned,"

"Foundation, yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute,"
or almost. Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the
"phrase, ""... applying tensor calculus to the nucleus,"" he took a"
"deep, even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and"
"his knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with"
"impartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning."
"Employing a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory"
"chains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep."
"These chores completed, he held his finger on a bedside button, which"
"his family and friends, but, finding a certain demand for the fruit,"
later began to import it systematically. From this casual start the
United Fruit Company and its hustling competitors have grown. The whole
business is the development of a few decades and people still young can
"remember when bananas were sold, each wrapped in tissue paper, for five"
"or ten cents, while today ten or fifteen cents a dozen is a fair price."
"The fruit can be prepared in a multitude of fashions, particularly the"
"coarser varieties of plantains, and the Fruit Company has compiled a"
"banana cook book but has taken little pains to circulate it, the demand"
for the fruit being at times still in excess of the supply. There seems
every indication that the demand is constant and new banana territory is
being steadily developed.
[Illustration: DRYING THE COFFEE BEANS]
Several companies share with the United Fruit Company the Panama market.
The methods of gathering and marketing the crop employed by all are
"practically the same, but the United Fruit Company is used as an"
illustration here because its business is the largest and because it has
so closely followed the Isthmian Canal Commission in its welfare work.
The banana country lies close to the ocean and mainly on the Atlantic
"side of the Isthmus. The lumber industry nestles close to the rivers,"
mainly in the Bayano region. Cocoanuts need the beaches and the sea
"breezes. Native rubber is found in every part of the Republic, though at"
"present it is collected mainly in the Darien, which is true also of"
vegetable ivory. The only gold which is mined on a large scale is taken
from the neighborhood of the Tuyra River in the Darien. But for products
requiring cultivation like cacao and coffee the high lands in the
Chiriqui province offer the best opportunity.

"She had a little money from her late husband (the real one), and had"
been lavishly paid for her services during the war. War prices in London
seemed quite moderate to her after the extortions of France and Italy.
She re-occupied her old rooms near Shaftesbury Avenue--and incidentally
made homeless a pair of exiled Belgians--and fed after the fashion that
she loved in the restaurants of Soho. Madame enjoyed her food. She
"always scoffed at Beauty Specialists. ""Look at me,"" she would say. ""Look"
"closely at my skin, at my hair, at my teeth if you like. What you see is"
God's gift improved by exact care for my health. I do physical exercises
for twenty minutes every night and morning. I plunge all over into cold
"water whenever I can get together enough to cover me, and I eat and"
drink whatever I like. I shall go on living for just as long as I am
beautiful and healthy. When I have to think of my digestion or of the
"colour of my skin, I shall say Good-bye and go West in a dream of"
"morphia."" Superficially, Madame is a Roman Catholic; at heart she is a"
Greek Pagan.
It was at La Grande Patisserie Belge that Madame stumbled across the
lawyer who was fated to introduce her to the Cannibal of whom she told
me in Whitehall.
"It was a melancholy afternoon in January, peace had not brought"
plenty--especially of coal--and Madame was fortifying herself against
the damp chills of London by long draughts of the hottest coffee and the
sweetest and stickiest confectionery which even she could relish. About
"six feet distant, on what one may describe as her port quarter, sat a"
middle-aged Englishman whose bagging clothes showed that war rations
"had dealt sorely with his once ample person. Madame, who without turning"
"her head examined him in critical detail, judged that his loss in weight"
"was three stone. He had the clean, shaven face and alert aspect of a"
lawyer or doctor. In fancied security a little to the left and rear of
"There is a song well known to all the Burmese, the words of which are"
"taken from the sacred writings. It is called the story of Ma Pa Da, and"
"it was first told to me by a Burmese monk, long ago, when I was away on"
the frontier.
It runs like this:
"In the time of the Buddha, in the city of Thawatti, there was a certain"
"rich man, a merchant, who had many slaves. Slaves in those days, and,"
"indeed, generally throughout the East, were held very differently to"
"slaves in Europe. They were part of the family, and were not saleable"
"without good reason, and there was a law applicable to them. They were"
"not _hors de la loi_, like the slaves of which we have conception. There"
"are many cases quoted of sisters being slaves to sisters, and of"
"brothers to brothers, quoted not for the purpose of saying that this"
"was an uncommon occurrence, but merely of showing points of law in such"
cases.
"One day in the market the merchant bought another slave, a young man,"
"handsome and well mannered, and took him to his house, and kept him"
there with his family and the other slaves. The young man was earnest
"and careful in his work, and the merchant approved of him, and his"
"fellow-slaves liked him. But Ma Pa Da, the merchant's daughter, fell in"
"love with him. The slave was much troubled at this, and he did his best"
"to avoid her; but he was a slave and under orders, and what could he do?"
"When she would come to him secretly and make love to him, and say, 'Let"
"us flee together, for we love each other,' he would refuse, saying that"
"he was a slave, and the merchant would be very angry. He said he could"
"not do such a thing. And yet when the girl said, 'Let us flee, for we"
"love each other,' he knew that it was true, and that he loved her as she"
loved him; and it was only his honour to his master that held him from
"were reprinted by Froben. On his return journey, Erasmus, whose work had"
"been hampered all through the summer by indisposition, and who had, on"
"that account, been unable to finish it, fell seriously ill. He reached"
"Louvain with difficulty (21 September 1518). It might be the pestilence,"
"and Erasmus, ever much afraid of contagion himself, now took all"
precautions to safeguard his friends against it. He avoided his quarters
"in the College of the Lily, and found shelter with his most trusted"
"friend, Dirck Maertensz, the printer. But in spite of rumours of the"
"plague and his warnings, first Dorp and afterwards also Ath came, at"
"once, to visit him. Evidently the Louvain professors did not mean so"
"badly by him, after all."
[Illustration: XVIII. Title-page of the New Testament printed by Froben
in 1520]
But the differences between Erasmus and the Louvain faculty were deeply
"rooted. Lee, hurt by the little attention paid by Erasmus to his"
"objections, prepared a new critique, but kept it from Erasmus, for the"
"present, which irritated the latter and made him nervous. In the"
"meantime a new opponent arose. Directly after his return to Louvain,"
Erasmus had taken much trouble to promote the establishment of the
"_Collegium Trilingue_, projected and endowed by Jerome Busleiden, in his"
"testament, to be founded in the university. The three biblical"
"languages, Hebrew, Greek and Latin, were to be taught there. Now when"
"James Latomus, a member of the theological faculty and a man whom he"
"esteemed, in a dialogue about the study of those three languages and of"
"theology, doubted the utility of the former, Erasmus judged himself"
"concerned, and answered Latomus in an _Apologia_. About the same time"
(spring 1519) he got into trouble with the vice-chancellor himself.
Erasmus thought that Ath had publicly censured him with regard to his
"'Praise of Marriage', which had recently appeared. Though Ath withdrew"
"at once, Erasmus could not abstain from writing an _Apologia_, however"
the Vakutans have never fished for kaloma in the Sanaroa Lagoon.
Now let us describe the technicalities and the ceremonial connected
with the fishing for kaloma. It will be better to give an account
"of how this is done in the Lagoon of Sinaketa, round the sandbank"
"of Nanoula, as this is the normal and typical form of kaloma"
"fishing. Moreover, when the Sinaketans do it in Sanaroa, the"
"proceedings are very much the same, with just one or two phases"
missed out.
The office of magician of the kaloma (towosina kaloma) is hereditary in
"two sub-clans, belonging to the Malasi clan, and one of them is that"
"of the main chief of Kasi'etana. After the Monsoon season is over,"
"that is, some time in March or April, ogibukuvi (i.e., in the season"
of the new yams) the magician gives the order for preparations. The
"community give him a gift called sousula, one or two bringing a"
"vaygu'a, the rest supplying gugu'a (ordinary chattels), and some"
"food. Then they prepare the canoes, and get ready the binabina stones,"
with which the spondylus shell will be knocked off the reef.
"Next day, in the morning, the magician performs a rite called"
"'kaykwa'una la'i,' 'the attracting of the reef,' for, as in the"
"case of several other marine beings, the main seat of the kaloma is"
"far away. Its dwelling place is the reef Ketabu, somewhere between"
"Sanaroa and Dobu. In order to make it move and come towards Nanoula,"
it is necessary to recite the above-named spell. This is done by the
magician as he walks up and down on the Sinaketa beach and casts
"his words into the open, over the sea, towards the distant seat"
of the kaloma. The kaloma then 'stand up' (itolise) that is start
from their original coral outcrop (vatu) and come into the Lagoon of
"Sinaketa. This spell, I obtained from To'udavada, the present chief"
"of Kasi'etana, and descendant of the original giver of this shell,"
"says, ""we were not overstocked with powder."""
"It was in March, 1710, that Rogers brought his little fleet into the"
"harbour of Guam, one of the Ladrone Islands. Although at war with Spain,"
the captain soon became on his usual friendly terms with the Governor of
"this Spanish colony, and gave an entertainment on board his ship to him"
"and four other Spanish gentlemen, making them ""as welcome as time and"
"place would afford, with musick and our sailors dancing."" The Governor"
"gave a return party on shore, to which Rogers and all his brother officers"
"were invited, partaking of ""sixty dishes of various sorts."" After this"
"feast Rogers gave his host a present, consisting of ""two negro boys"
"dress'd in liveries."" One other instance of Woodes Rogers adaptability"
must suffice. In the year 1717 he was appointed Governor to the Bahama
"Islands, at New Providence, now called Nassau. His chief duty was to stamp"
out the West India pirates who had made this island their headquarters for
"many years, and were in complete power there, and numbered more than 2,000"
"desperadoes, including such famous men as Vane and Teach. Rogers's only"
"weapon, besides the man-of-war he arrived in, was a royal proclamation"
from King George offering free pardon to all pirates or buccaneers who
would surrender at once to the new Governor. At first the pirates were
"inclined to resist his landing, but in the end the tactful Rogers got his"
"own way, and not only landed, but was received by an armed guard of"
"honour, and passed between two lines of pirates who fired salutes with"
their muskets.
"Most of the pirates surrendered and received their pardons, but some, who"
reverted shortly afterwards to piracy and were captured and brought back
"to New Providence, were tried and actually hanged by Rogers's late"
buccaneer subjects.
Woodes Rogers eventually died in Nassau in the year 1729.

My first visit in Robat was to the officer who had been commanding
"the scattered British forces up to that date. He was a very sick man,"
and had been holding out with the utmost difficulty until he could be
"relieved. Here I met Major Landon of the 35th Scinde Horse, one of"
the three Intelligence Officers employed by the Indian Government in
Persia.
I very quickly realised that Landon was an officer of very high
"intelligence, as well as an Intelligence Officer, and that he had a"
"fund of information concerning the country, and the conditions and"
characteristics of the inhabitants of both Persia and Baluchistan. In
"fact, I judged that he would be such an asset that, then and there, I"
"invited him to become my Brigade-Major, although I ruefully remarked"
"that I had, at present, no brigade!"
"He was keen to accept, but did not know how the authorities at Simla"
"would view his acceptance of such a post, and asked me whether I"
should be willing to shoulder the responsibility of annexing him for
"the campaign. Considering that my shoulders were broad enough, I"
promptly replied that my orders had been to take command of all the
"scattered forces I could find and co-ordinate them, and that I looked"
"upon him as my second ""find,"" Idu and his two companions being the"
"first. Further, that he was here as Intelligence Officer and would"

"Miguel lived on the banks of the Chagres River, about half way between"
Cruces and Alhajuela. To him Cruces was a city. Were there not at least
thirty huts of bamboo and clay thatched with palmetto like the one in
"which he lived? Was there not a church of sawn boards, with an altar to"
"which a priest came twice a month to say mass, and a school where a"
gringo taught the children strange things in the hated English tongue?
Where he lived there was no other hut within two or three hours poling
"up the river, but down at Cruces the houses were so close together you"
could almost reach one while sitting in the shade of another. At home
"after dark you only heard the cry of the whippoorwill, or occasionally"
"the wail of a tiger cat in the jungle, but at Cruces there was always"
"the loud talk of the men in the cantina, and a tom-tom dance at least"
"once a week, when everybody sat up till dawn dancing to the beat of the"
drums and drinking the good rum that made them all so jolly.
But greater than Cruces was the Yankee town of Matachin down on the
banks of the river where the crazy Americans said there was going to be
"a lake that some day would cover all the country, and drown out Cruces"
and even his father’s house. They were paying all the natives along the
"river for their lands that would be sunken, and the people were taking"
the pesos gladly and spending them gaily. They did not trouble to move
"away. Many years ago the French too said there would be a lake, but it"
never came and the French suddenly disappeared. The Americans would
"vanish the same way, and a good thing, too, for their thunderous noises"
"where they were working frightened away all the good game, and you could"
"hardly find an iguana, or a wild hog in a day’s hunting."

just see by the night-light's glow.  The afternoon had shaken her nerves.
Nor was Betty's method of breathing while asleep conducive to the slumber
"of anything but babies.  It was so hot, too, and the sound of the violin"
"still in her ears.  By that little air of Poise, she had known for"
certain it was Fiorsen; and her father's abrupt drawing of the curtains
"had clinched that certainty.  If she had gone to the window and seen him,"
she would not have been half so deeply disturbed as she was by that echo
of an old emotion.  The link which yesterday she thought broken for good
was reforged in some mysterious way.  The sobbing of that old fiddle had
"been his way of saying, ""Forgive me; forgive!""  To leave him would have"
been so much easier if she had really hated him; but she did not.
"However difficult it may be to live with an artist, to hate him is quite"
as difficult.  An artist is so flexible--only the rigid can be hated.
"She hated the things he did, and him when he was doing them; but"
"afterward again could hate him no more than she could love him, and that"
was--not at all.  Resolution and a sense of the practical began to come
"back with daylight.  When things were hopeless, it was far better to"
recognize it and harden one's heart.
"Winton, whose night had been almost as sleepless--to play like a beggar"
"in the street, under his windows, had seemed to him the limit!--announced"
"at breakfast that he must see his lawyer, make arrangements for the"
"payment of Fiorsen's debts, and find out what could be done to secure Gyp"
against persecution.  Some deed was probably necessary; he was vague on
"all such matters.  In the meantime, neither Gyp nor the baby must go out."
"Gyp spent the morning writing and rewriting to Monsieur Harmost, trying"
"to express her chagrin, but not saying that she had left Fiorsen."
Her father came back from Westminster quiet and angry.  He had with
"difficulty been made to understand that the baby was Fiorsen's property,"
"so that, if the fellow claimed it, legally they would be unable to"
"resist.  The point opened the old wound, forced him to remember that his"
very name of Elleray breathes of poetry and romance. Our father and
"mother had, of course, known it in its glorious prime, when our"
"grandfather, ""Christopher North,"" wrestled with dalesmen, strolled in"
his slippers with Wordsworth to Keswick (a distance of seventeen
"miles), and kept his ten-oared barge in the long drawing-room of"
"Elleray. In these days they had ""rich company,"" and the names of"
"Southey, Wordsworth, De Quincey, and Coleridge were to them familiar"
"household words. The cottage my mother was born in still stands,"
overshadowed by a giant sycamore.'
We can easily imagine the effect which society such as this would have
"on a young man's mind. But more than that, the friendship with the"
"attractive cousin, Margaret Wilson, developed into something warmer,"
"and an engagement was finally formed, which culminated in his marriage"
in 1837. Not many of James Ferrier's letters to his cousin during the
long engagement have been preserved; the few that are were written from
"Germany in 1834, the year in which he went to Heidelberg; they were"
"addressed to Thirlstane House, near Selkirk, where Miss Wilson was"
"residing, and they give a lively account of his adventures."
"The voyage from Leith to Rotterdam, judging from the first letter"
"written from Heidelberg, and dated August 1834, would appear to have"
begun in inauspicious fashion. Ferrier writes: 'I have just been here a
"week, and would have answered your letter sooner, had it not been that"
I wished to make myself tolerably well acquainted with the surrounding
"scenery before writing to you, and really the heat has been so"
"overwhelming that I have been impelled to take matters leisurely, and"
have not even yet been able to get through so much _view-hunting_ as I
should have wished. What I have seen I will endeavour to describe to
"you. This place itself is most delightful, and the country about it is"
"magnificent. But this, as a reviewer would say, _by way of"
"anticipation_. Have patience, and in the meantime let me take events in"
"When I was sixteen, after I had spent eight years in Devon, and four"
"of those years at an English public school, I was in speech and almost"
in the inner fibres of my mind an Englishman. Your naval authorities
"at Plymouth and Devonport, as serenely trustful and heedless of"
"espionage as the mass of your kindly people, allowed my father--whom I"
"often accompanied--to see the dockyards, the engine shops, the"
"training schools, and the barracks. They knew that he was an Austrian"
"naval officer, and they took him to their hearts as a brother, of the"
common universal brotherhood of the sea. I think that your Navy holds
those of a foreign naval service as more nearly of kin to themselves
than civilians of their own blood. The bond of a common profession is
more close than the bond of a common nationality. I do not doubt that
my father sent much information to our Embassy in London--it was what
he was employed to do--but I am sure that he did not basely betray the
wonderful confidence of his hosts. Our countries were at peace. My
father is no Prussian; he is a chivalrous gentleman. I am sure that he
did not send more than his English naval friends were content at the
time that he should send. For in those years your newspapers and your
books upon the Royal Navy of England concealed little from the world.
I have visited Dartmouth; I have dined in the Naval College there with
"bright sailor boys of my own age. It was then my one dream, had I"
"remained in England, to have become an Englishman, and to have myself"
"served in your Navy. It was a vain dream, but I knew no better. Fate"
and my birth made me afterwards your enemy. I would have fought you
"gladly face to face on land or sea, but never, never, would I have"
stabbed the meanest of Englishmen in the back.
When I was sixteen years old I left England with my parents and
returned to Triest. I was a good mathematician with a keen taste for
"mechanics. I spent two years in the naval engineering shops at Pola,"
and I was gazetted as a sub-lieutenant in the engineering branch of
gave me a extra week or two in 'orspittle. I 'ad to go in the end
"though--the M.O. didn't 'alf give me a tellin' orf. Jesus Christ, didn't"
I 'ave the wind up when we went up the line! An' now I'm scared at the
"slightest sound, an' I sometimes wake up out o' me sleep shiverin' all"
over. When I was on leave a motor-car backfired in the street--it didn't
'alf make me jump; me mate 'oo was with me said I looked as white as a
"sheet. The longer yer out 'ere the worse yer get--it's yer nerves, yer"
"know, they can't stand it. In the line it's always the new men what's"
"the most reliable...."""
"""That's a bloody fact. When we first come out, I thought all the Belgian"
civvies a lot o' bloody cowards takin' cover whenever Fritz came over.
"_We_ used to stand an' look at 'im. They wasn't cowards, it was us who"
"was bloody fools. They knew summat about it, we didn't. All the same, I"
know one or two old reg'lars 'oo was in it from the first an' never 'ad
"the wind up any time--there's not many like that though, generally it's"
the old soldiers what's the worst o' the lot for wanglin' out o' risky
"jobs."""
"""Napoleon was right,"" observed a small, red-haired lance-corporal, whose"
"remarks generally had a sardonic touch, ""when he said the worse the man"
the better the soldier. It's only people who have no imagination and no
intelligence who are courageous in modern war. Nobody with any sense
would expose himself unnecessarily and rush a machine-gun position or do
"the sort of thing they give you a V.C. for. Of course, there are a few"
"cases where it's deserved, and it isn't always the one who deserves it"
"that gets it. I'm quite certain the refined, sensitive, imaginative kind"
of man is no good as a soldier. He may be able to control himself better
than the others at first--educated people are used to self-control--but
in the long run his nerves will give way sooner. Moral courage is a
"thing I admire more than anything, but there's no use for it in the"
"army, in fact it's worse than useless in the army. The man who's too"
"a pariah, except among the poor of Brussels in the Quartier des"
"Marolles. Here she was only regarded as a kind Englishwoman,"
"unwearied in her efforts to alleviate suffering, mental and bodily."
"And meantime, silence, a wall of silence as regarded"
England--England which she was beginning to look upon as the
paradise from which she had been chased. Not a word had come through
"from Rossiter, from Honoria, Bertie Adams, or any of her Suffrage"
friends. I can supply briefly what she did not know.
Rossiter at the very outbreak of War had offered his services as one
deeply versed in anatomy and in physiology to the Army Medical
"Service, and especially to a great person at the War Office; but had"
been told quite cavalierly that they had no need of him. As he
"persisted, he had been asked--in the hope that it might get rid of"
him--to go over to the United States in company with a writer of
"comic stories, a retired actor and a music-hall singer, and lecture"
on the causes of the War in the hope of bringing America in. This he
"had declined to do, and being rich and happening to know personally"
General Armstrong (Honoria's husband) he had been allowed to
accompany him to the vicinity of the front and there put his
theories of grafting flesh and bone to the test; with the ultimate
results that his work became of enormous beneficial importance and
"he was given rank in the R.A.M.C. Honoria, racked with anxiety about"
"her dear ""Army,"" and very sad as to Vivie's disappearance, slaved at"
War work as much as her children's demands on her permitted; or even
put her children on one side to help the sick and wounded. Vivie's
Suffrage friends forgot she had ever existed and turned their
"attention to propaganda, to recruiting for the Voluntary Army which"
"our ministers still hoped might suffice to win the War, to the"
"making of munitions, or aeroplane parts, to land work and to any"
Huh?
"Well, seems we still mean more to him than- than that old memory."
Yeah.
"Hey, hey, wait a minute."
You better come inside before you change your mind.
"Come on, tough guy."
Come on.
"All right, kid, shake it up."
Shake it up.
"Oh, that's grand music."
Yes.
That's grand music.
"Aw, that's grand music."
Yeah.
That's grand music.
That's lovely.
Come on.
Shake it up.
All right.
You tired?
Hmm?
"All right, come on now."
Let's pull.
Together.
"One, two..."
- three-
- Oh!
"Well, we weren't together."
"- Oh, I wish you hadn't."
- Why not?
I haven't let myself think about us.
- I didn't dare.
Angle out.
There you go.
"Show me you can throw one, two, three."
You need to get that elbow over your shoulder.
Not this.
This.
"One, two, three."
- All right?
- Can I do that again?
"""Let's do it again,"" she says."
You want to do it again.
"One, two, three."
Good.
Look where you're standing.
All right?
- In and out.
- Okay.
Right?
Get used to missing.
"I want you to throw one, two, and then just keep it away from me, all right?"
"One, two."
Good.
That's it.
See?
"You're moving, you're moving, you're moving."
Keep me away from you.
Move that head.
Good.
And keep moving.

Nice!
Again.
"I mean, that's what they deal ya."
That's what they tell ya.
Yep.
Well...
"Sorry to take your time, Jack."
You have a good day.
We're almost there.
Wait.
Oh shit.
"No, forget it."
"Let's go, let's go!"
Come on.
"Look, baby, we're so close."
You can do this.
Let's go.
I can't.
"Vivian, how long have you been down here?"
Weeks.
"Once, I don't know."
This is your chance to get out.
We have to go.
I cant.
Fuck it.
Leave her.
You can't leave her.
Beautiful land you got out here.
Thank you kindly.
I guess it was just kids playing around with the phone.
Take care.
"Sorry you had to drive all this way, Sheriff."
Don't go!
"Wait, wait!"
But I am not that proud.
I am not that selfless.
"I am begging you, please, please, to give her and our baby priority."
"I'd like to help, really, but..."
You can have my spot.
Richard White.
That's me.
Go.
Thank you.
Honey.
"Oh, great."
"We're out of candles, and now the ice cream is melted."
"Honey, please."
Stop worrying.
Stop worrying ?
We're about to be washed out to sea.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
I'm...
I'm right ?
I thought I was exaggerating.
I'm going up there.
To do what ?
To go swim out to shore ?
I don't know.
Assess the situation...
figure it out.
I'm your mother.
It's my job.
Wait.
You can't do that.
Why not ?
Let's go.
Call or fold.
Make a decision.
- Can we try to finish?
- I'm 40 light.
You mind?
- What?
"- No, there's no going light in my game, pal."
Come on.
It's more for you if you win.
Doesn't cost you if you lose.
- Go ahead.
"- Aw, man."
- Write that down.
"- What am I, your secretary?"
Yes.
Beat his ass.
- Three nines?
"- Yeah, three nines."
Told ya.
Good.
Good.
You deserve it.
"Hey, I was a fan."
Give me at least half.
Why don't you run over to that A.T.M.
"Yeah, right."
You can finally pay me back.
"Oh, damn."
You know what?
I must have forgotten my debit card.
"Oh, what a shock."
"How are you, Captain?"
Am I intruding?
"Sure, it's after midnight."
Where are you?
In a hotel.
I'm out till tomorrow night.
On a leave.
Wasn't a jailbreak.
I gotta see you fast.
"Tonight, I can't."
You'll regret it.
"Meet me in 1 hr at ""Swann's""."
Same again?
"No, thanks."
Camille OK?
She's fine.
When did you buy this?
We'll talk cars later.
What's up?
Nice welcome!
You haven't seen me in 4 years.
Don't I rate a smile?
This is a favor for a pal inside.
You made me cross Paris for a lousy scam?
I got a hot tip.
You're a piece of shit.
What is it?
Heavy duty stuff.
Real hot tip.
Want it or not?
What's the deal?
Just stay with me.
- He is not much more than a cloud.
I'll come back to you.
I'll never see him again.
Just stop these silly heroics.
You have placed me in an impossible position.
All I have left is a show of strength.
"Besides, women like that sort of thing."
Are you insane?
Pretty dress.
"Are you ready, gentlemen?"
And... one.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
- This man has fainted!
- That man is wounded.
Too bad!
Help us lift him.
Wait!
Come back!
I knew it!
It's the frail one!
"Oh, my God!"
Is he dead?
I hope the damp hasn't killed him.
- Show us your finest room.
You come.
We make you strong.
Cool... you want some?

They're really good!
They're my favorite!
- They're really really good!

A lot.
Would you still like me... even if I wasn't a girl...?
...What do you mean...?
I don't know...
I guess Why?
No reason...
So where are you guys from?
How come you moved here...?
We... move around a lot.
"Yeah, but why would you move here?"
Nobody moves here I hate it here
Someday I'm gonna get out...
And I'll never come back...
I'll watch over you.
You'll be safe.
Thank you.
(Grunting)
(Panting)
(Grunts)
What happened here?
It's where the final battle was.
Give me your hand.
What?
Your hand... it's cut.
Let me help you.
- No.
No.
It's fine.
"- No, it's not."
So now you're gonna be a gentleman?
"(Whispers) Giants can smell blood, and I'm always a gentleman."
(Cork pops)
(Cork thuds)
Ah!
Oh!
What the hell is that?
It's rum.
A bloody waste of it.
(Panting)
Here's the plan.
We wait for the giant to fall asleep.
"When he does, we'll sneak past him into his cave."
"It's where the treasures are, where the compass lies."
And then?
And then we run like hell.
- Okay.
- Okay?
All right.
Here's the first thing I need you to do.
"You gotta curl up like this, into a ball."
"Real tight, like that."
As tight as you can.
Okay?
That's gonna keep you warm.
I'm gonna see what that light is.
"I'll be back as fast as I can, all right?"
Like a ball.
Like that.
Now sit tight.
All right.
"- Ben, can you hear me?"
- Yeah.
- All right.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Did you find something?
Come on!
"Hello, is anybody there?"
It was blocked.
- I'm so cold.
"- That's all right, buddy."
Can you wiggle your toes?
No.
That's okay.
How about your fingers?
Can you move those?
There you go.
Concentrate.
Pardonme.
Can I point out your heart rate just increased?
Yeah.
"Well, it should have cos there's a huge crazy spider."
You see a spider?
- You don't... you don't see that?
- No.
Don't...
Don't walk.
Don't...
Holy shit!
"Tough guy like you, scared of spiders."
"Yeah, I'm just not fond of them."
It's worked out you're an arachnophobe quickly.
It's probing for weak spots.
God damn it.
Fucker!
Yeah!
Um...
Okay.
"Yeah, well, yeah."
Whole lot more realistic than the gopher game.
It's good.
It's good graphics.
"It's good, uh..."
Yeah.
Weak sauce.
- What is it?
- Just...
Nothing.
Nothing.
Right!
Right!
isn't it better to open the bag and check?
Right!
- No!
Now it's not about the bomb exploding!
It's about my honour!
Now until the bomb doesn't explode..
..Give me the gun!
Hey!
- Give me the gun!
Give me the gun!
Otherwise I will shoot!
Give me the gun!
- Give the gun!
Otherwise he will shoot himself!
Please!
Give the gun!
- Quiet!
You don't say anything!
I will explode you before the bomb explodes!
"Albert, come here!"
- Fine..
I am normal with you!
Go and buy two batteries from the shop.
Go.
I don't have change.
Change!
I will give you.
But bring it quickly.
Go.
Go.
What's going on?
I'd really rather not discuss it.
Not discuss what?
When a person says he'd really rather not discuss it...
Is it about the show?
No.
"So, then...?"
"Believe it or not, some things are not your concern."
"Well, tell me what it is, and I'll see if I agree."
"Is it, like, something serious?"
I'm not having this conversation.
"Yeah, we are."
Come on.
I care.
Tell me.
No!
"Okay, you're starting to freak me out."
"Is it, like, cancer?"
"No, it is not cancer."
"Well, I don't know."
Is it... is it bev?
Does she have...
No.
No one has cancer!
Ed has cancer.
What?
It's okay.
You didn't know.
Jesus Christ.
What is going on?
She slept with rob.
Who?
I'd like to be brought back to the barracks.
I want to be with my brothers.
We shoot the tires.
Take out the guards.
"With machine guns, we won't make it 50 feet."
He's right.
We don't have the gunpower.
Hey!
Steady.
"You all right, mate?"
Ah!
Eric!
- Did you see that?
- Poor bastard.
I don't think the guards did.
Eric!
Eric!
Come on!
Oy!
You bloody goon!
"- Whoa, whoa!"
- You see what you did?
- You did this to him!
- Alfred!
What the bloody hell!
He was my brother!
You did this to him!
Shut your mouth!
"You make one more sound, I shoot you right there!"
Get back to work.
Schweinhund.
Anybody else have a problem?
"I thought so, too."
- What else do you do?
- I'm a nurse.
I'm a nurse.
I'm better at nursing...
- Better?
- Better than at acting.
God!
I can't believe I'm in such a foul mood.
"Listen, you don't have to talk to me."
I just didn't want to be rude.
"Hey, welcome."
I can't find it.
"Oh, God, where are we?"
Go back the way we came.
Take the next right.
Are you OK?
Turn left in the village.
"Well, thanks."
Are you OK?
I'll be OK.
Thanks.
Wait a second.
Do you like to go to the movies?
Not really.
- Which movie do I have to see?
- Anything you like.
They're free tickets.
Thanks.
Amen.
"Are we getting a new horse, Dad?"
We're not going to make it.
For my brothers.
They are all I think about.
Are they even alive?
I don't know.
Because I'm...
Stuck here.
Yeah.
There's something here.
It's from my team.
This means the new moon.
- The light.
- When's that?
- Tonight.
- And this?
It means they can only hide five men.
You and four more.
***
It's the best chance we have.
It's your call.
The truck is hidden in the woods.
Aurora has the keys.
Good.
Gun.
- Why would I give you a gun?
- You need help.
I can help.
What do you know about guns?
You aim and squeeze and your target dies.
How do I know I can I trust you?
You don't yet.
What's going on?
These men have experience training soldiers.
"Well, I don't like to see a dog killed either."
"But after all, 250 bucks is 250 bucks."
"All right, I told you I'm buying him, and I am."
- We ain't got no time to fool with him.
"- Quiet, quiet."
Whose money is this?
"Listen, you, you're my dog, and I'm your boss."
"The sooner you learn that, the easier it's going to be for both of us."
Come on.!
Mush.!
Mush.!
Ho!
Ho!
Right there!
Hey!
Go on!
Get back there!
What'd you bring this baboon along for?
- That big guy don't like him.!
- That's just too bad!
He'll learn to like him!
- Come on!
Let's go!
Mush!
Mush!
- Get your teeth out of him.!
Come on!
Get up there!
"Come on, gray boy!"
"Come on, Buck."
- What's the matter?
- Nearly took my wing off.
It won't be a problem at all.
Good.
We're on.
What's really funny is that fucking bank job in Secaucus.
I'm in the weeds lying down.
Resting.
Here?
"This ain't no beach or park."" ""I'm resting!"" I said."
this and that.
My usual.
Nothing.
you'll tell me something today.
go fuck your mother.
Anthony.
My head was out like this.
I'm coming around and who do I see in front of me?
"""What do you want to tell me now?"
What are you doing here?
I said to go fuck your mother.
I thought he'd shit.
The fuckers.
I wish I was big just once.
Funny.
You're really funny.
I'm funny?
you know.
It's a good story.
You're a funny guy.
You mean the way I talk?
What?
you know.
You're just funny.
Get some air.
Go on.
- God.
- Take it easy.
"Breathe in, breathe out."
All right.
"I'm gonna stand up, all right?"
Because I got bad knees.
That's better.
"Okay, now listen."
The three of us are gonna work this out.
Yeah?
How?
"First thing, you'll put a dollar in my pocket, both of you."
"You want attorney-client privilege, don't you?"
So that everything you say is strictly between us.
I mean it.
Put a dollar in my pocket.
"Come on, make it official."
"Come on, do it."
"That's it, come on."
Just a dollar.
"All right, now you, ski bum."
Come on.
Give with the dollar.
- Go on.
- Be smart.
What?
- All I got is a five.
- I'll take a five.
"Come on, already."
Come on.
I just didn't know if you'd like it.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's for covering blood.
It doesn't have to match the drapes.
You want to hold him?
"He's fed, changed and burped... happy."
It's the perfect time.
"Well, you... you've got him."
Violet...
"Okay, breathe in and out."
"Shh, shh, shh."
Remember what we said?
"This time, you're just gonna breathe in and out."
You're just gonna stand there and wait.
Shh.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
"No... yes, you're just gonna stand there and wait until I open the door."
Breathe in and out.
Do not go in...
The closet.
"I told you, don't ring the bell."
"Oh, oh."
Did I wake him?
No.
She's in the closet again.
Don't worry.
I'm handling it.
"Yeah, no, no."
I can...
I'm FBI damn it.
Fuck you.
Special agent brant.
They fucked up.
Special agent brant.
They fucked up.
"Good try, asshole."
Speaking Japanese speaking Japanese
what happened?
We got ambushed.
We're lucky to get out.
We got ambushed.
We're lucky to get out.
We lost taka.
What about the guns?
Gone.
It wasn't a complete loss though.
Kuauo got it out.
We got it out.
"Wow, this is great."
"This is your new place, huh?"
"No, yours."
Mine?
Mine?
You don't like it?
"No, no."
I mean yeah!
It's just that it's so big.
"You know, for one person."
Perhaps that will change.
What kind of bullshit is that?
You told me to do whatever it takes to stay in.
What is it?
You won't tell me.
I'm hungry.
We can go to my place.
- Who did you inherit it from?
- My great-aunt.
She was great.
She loved collecting things.
She hooked a rich building speculator... and traveled.
This was her depot.
- Her depot?
- So to speak.
You'll see.
"The whole family died of envy, and in the end... everyone came away empty-handed."
Almost everybody.
Yeah.
She saved my life.
Just because you went shopping once!
"OK, OK."
Forget it.
- Lf I'd only known before.
- What?
That you're such a great roommate.
Where are you going?
What?
"I have to pee, you dumb cow!"
Or maybe not.
Hello.
Good-bye!
Shit!
Just a minute.
Great.
My God!
Now look... hear me out!
"Yawning like a princess, eh?"
Aren't you ashamed?
What is this?
A finger.
What else?
Acting smart!
Here goes...
That's one finger.
How many are these?
Two.
And how many are these?
Your finger is swollen!
Naturally!
I gave you a blow!
But I won't spare you...
Why are awakening me only to hit me?
Will you realise it if you're bashed up unconscious?
That explains it!
No!
Call the police!
You're an ill-mannered man!
No!
What are you up to?
!
The poor man will die!
He teases women in our area!
What nonsense?
!
I'm glad you've come!
Save me from this bear!
Red Cross!
- Hello?
- Hey!
Hello.
Is your mom home?
"No, she's not home."
She's not upstairs?
We heard something.
"No, that was our dog."
- She's not home?
- No.
It's our dog.
When does she get back?
She'll be home soon.
Can we wait?
Where can we wait?
Let's see how much we raised.
- The money also?
- I can count everything.
- What a bad handwriting.
- Yes.
Like a doctor's prescription.
Barely legible.
You want to go to school again?
- Well ...
- It starts soon.
- Where did you go to school?
- In Vienna.
"It's a lot busier there, huh?"
We have already picked up a nice sum.
"If everyone continues to give as much, we did well."
We'll see how much more we get.
"Master, he's right!"
Seems like he's not bad
What did you say?
Master is angry!
No wonder you can't win over him!
Dad!
"I'm sorry, Master!"
Master's technique is good
But now he can't even stand still
He was defeated in at least six or seven stances
He picked up the brick
The brick?
You bastard!
Master!
Stay there!
Don't run
It's me!
"Master, stop it!"
Stop it!
You bastard!
How dare you beat me up!
I didn't mean it!
"You did, too!"
And you beat me so hard?
It's just a mistake!
Mistake?
It's more than one time
"No, Master can't take it"
Dad!
"T ell me, who taught you those stances?"
Me
I taught him!
- Yeah.
What did you want to tell me?
"You know, it..."
It's just work.
I should go.
Big day today.
Thanks for the coffee.
Every time.
Bring up retail.
"How may I assist you this morning, Mr. Larson?"
I wanna buy something for my wife.
What's the occasion?
Just because.
May I suggest jewelry?
I thought you might.
How about a ring?
A silver band.
Lined with amethyst.
Is amethyst your wife's favorite stone?
I just think it would look nice.
"Hey, that one."
It's perfect.
[pop music playing]
Pretty.
Can I have it?
No.
Don't touch that.
I got an idea.
♪
Don't move.
I'm gonna smack that ball into Lake Michigan.
[grunts]
Why did it have to be curry?
You like curry.
Since when?
What's wrong with her?
All right.
Wait!
You can't do it like that.
"She's a bride, she should look like a bride."
Like this.
What do you think?
"It's good, right?"
"Yes, it's fine."
"- Okay, you can take it."
"- All right, I'll take the picture."
Look here.
"Three, two-"
Wait!
"Hyang Gi, don't stick too close."
Why is the bride smiling so much?
"Hold the flower up, and you come out a bit, so that your face will come out smaller."
"- Good, right?"
- Yes.
"So that your face will be smaller, right."
"Okay, okay..."
Okay...
- Are the lights fine?
- Yes.
Can you take the picture slightly lower?
Right?
I think that'll be better.
"Ji Hyung, smile!"
Smile!
- And how.
- But you seem to be doing well.
- I'm great.
- But you seem to be doing well.
- I'm great.
"Why wouldn't you be great, with a friend like Russ here?"
- Yeah.
"Look at that, huh?"
"- Oh, jeez."
"Oh, boy."
How about that?
"Don't say a word, not one."
"Cause if i hear one comment like, ""What are you talking about?""..."
- I'm gonna call the cops.
- What?
Wh-What do you mean?
It slipped out.
We're listening.
Go ahead.
"I chewed on it for three days, and I'm convinced I have evidence to fuck you both up big time."
Bull.
You don't have any evidence.
What is that?
- Stop it.
Shut up.
You shut up.
- You shut up.
Shut up!
No.
That's bullshit.
"Dick, you have the floor."
You have the floor.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
"So, get over here as fast as you can."
What the...?
Where'd she go?
"- Pop that shirt off, and we'll start punching."
"- Oh, my God."
Really?
"- Yeah, man."
Every time I'm gonna take...
- Why can't you just take it off?
- Just take it off.
- You're ruining the moment.
- What is with you and the moment?
You know what?
Forget it.
Forget it.
- Who do you want to punch you first?
- I don't care.
- That was good.
"- Well, you caught me off guard."
That was a big part of it.
- That was the same spot.
"The same, exact spot."
- Yeah.
"Charlie, if we keep this up, you're gonna be... the best underground street fighter ever, bro."
- Okay.
Okay.
Deandra.
- Just 10 more minutes.
"- No, no."
That's it.
"Dee, that's..."
- I love it.
I need more of it.
It's dangerous.
Enough.
Flank right.
Don't move!

You killed Will.
And your parents.
You're deadly.
That's enough!
"No one's gonna love you, Tris."
They're never even gonna miss you.
"It's an island rum, infused with the essence of the coconut fruit."
Delicious.
Yes?
You like?
Very much.
Yes.
That's yummy.
It is yummy.
"It's yummy, yummy, yummy, isn't it?"
Mmm.
Yes.
"Oh, oh..."
"Slow down there, killer."
"You see, this island has so many healing curiosities."
"You know, it is good to have a drink and have a good time."
Then do it!
"Well, I guess we just go around, huh?"
"No, we gotta go through."
The path ends.
"We go off the path, we get lost+ Come on."
"No, hey, we'll make a new path."
What if there's people in there?
Joey!
"Be careful, sweetie."
"Ronnie, I'm Cynthia."
I'm always careful!
Yes!
Okay.
Okay.
Get in there.
"You,re leaving fingerprints!"
I don't know what you're doing...
Jesus!
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
"Well, where the hell were you?"
"Watch it, watch it."
- What are you doing?
- For the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!
"Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster."
Ah...
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
"Just get ready to run, whatever happens to me."
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
Damn it!
Don't you leave me down here by myself!
Indy!
Here we go!
Get ready!
"Indy, the torch is going out!"
Indy?
Marion!
Look.
Look.
They're going to fly it out of here.
"When that Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on the plane."
!
I told you dumbasses to shovel the walk!
Crap.
It's Dad.
He's coming for us.
We're so dead!
You get your asses out of there before that thing collapses and traps you in an icy tomb.
Stay strong.
We're untouchable in here.
Untouchable?
I'll show you untouchable!
He's shimmying!
"Oh, no!"
He's entering the snow fort!
I never thought this would happen!
Ah!
I'm stuck!
I can't move my arms!
My arms are stuck!
How are your arms stuck?
It's snow.
It's soft.
I'm wedged in!
My circulation's failing me!
I can feel it!
I'm gonna die in here!
He thinks he's dying.
Stop laughing!
Stop laughing at me right now!
Why are we hiding from this man?
Look at him.
These are my last breaths!
Are you a cop?
Talk to this man!
She's like your sister...
Your sister maybe!
"To me, she looks like a ravishing film-star!"
Don't touch me.
Or else...
I haven't yet.
But here goes!
I'll show you now...!
Let me see what you have.
Let go of my hand!
Let go of her hand first.
"Go away, Janki."
"Come along, aunty!"
Take the doctor and leave!
"Take Mom away, Bharti!"
"Let's go, Mom!"
Please!
I'm about to lose my temper!
Let go of my hand!
No one dares touch me here!
Bloody rat!
You can touch women!
"But women can't touch you, eh?"
I want to ask your Mom what she ate before delivering you!
Shera!
Ashok!
Kaliya!
I spare you because you're a woman.
Or else...
Don't just stand here!
"You are the most beautiful boy, you are the most beautiful fucker."
We want to see you fuck her.
Fuck her!
"Get him, Margaret you whore."
Do it!
Give it to me baby.

I can't.
Come on!
You can do it!
You whore.
Do it!
Come on Margaret.
Do it!
Let's go!
What for?
Let's go!
You made me do it.
This pussy has teeth no one should fuck me ever.
"What did you do with him, Margaret?"
I can't...
So where's the body?
I don't know.
Would somebody look on the roof.
Nothing out here.
What's in the box?
Was it a magic trick?
"No, Ann, it's no magic trick, I keep dead bodies in so I can fuck 'em."
"Adrian, you should leave me alone."
You should leave me alone.
What are you talking about?
I can.
The bell rang!
I'll murder that guy!
I'll murder him!
They're trying to pull a fast one!
We've been crossed!
I'll kill that tagger!
He called me a fink!
- What's he talking about?
"- Tell him, Tiny!"
Tell him!
- It looks bad!
- Yeah!
- I can see all right!
"- Okay, it's your funeral!"
"Hurry up and tell him, Tiny!"
"We ain't got much time, so listen!"
"You got to lay down, Stoker!"
- Lay down?
- It's in the bag!
There's 20 bucks extra in it for you!
Maybe 30!
- But I can stop him!
"- No, you can't, Stoker!"
This is Little Boy's fix!
He's paying us to go in the tank!
You know Little Boy if you cross him!
You gotta go down!
Go down on the first good punch!
- Take the count!
Let's get out of here!
- Yeah!
Ten seconds!
I got you!
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!
Snakes!
"Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!"
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the führer matters.
"I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind."
"It was not to be, chérie."
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!
Indiana Jones... adieu.
No!
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
Thank you.
"Oh, my God, this whole place is slithering."
Indy!
Ow!
Jesus!
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
"Well, where the hell were you?"
"Watch it, watch it."
What are you doing?
For the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
I'm working on it!
"If you do this well, there are more jobs coming."
"Doc, don't worry."
I won't break my promise.
Hey...
You can't charge your laptop here.
"Sir,"
I really need to download some work.
Just a little while?
Yes.
This medicine may make you sleepy.
I'm taking it doc.
Shit!
Damn it!
Only half an hour left.
Are you done?
Here.
Thank you.
Just half for now.
Tomorrow morning I will send you the rest.
You haven't finished it yet?
This is a big project.
"Je, what are you doing?"
I'm calling Jerd.
Why are you calling him?
Tomorrow you will get it.
Yoon.
"Je, don't call."
Send it now or we're screwed.
"Je, stop dialing."
You have another 50% to finish.
It's not...
Doesn't matter.
There's no other woman.
At my age.
At your age.
You keep fit enough.
You're sweet.
I know you're not cheating on me.
I'd notice it in seconds.
You would?
How?
Everything.
I know you through and through.
Ab.
What are you doing?
What are you up to?
Talk to me.
"If you don't know, you can't tell."
Can't tell?
"Can't spill the beans, you mean."
We can never forget this.
We owe it to Arie.
Ab!
Hello!
-Wait a moment.
We've not seen each other for so long.
Come in.
I have to finish something for a party.
Before the children come out of the cinema.
You're a better grandpa than me.
"-Yes, but they're not my grandchildren."
They're my children.
-Oh.
Late happiness.
"No one, right?"
That's where people come in.
That what people see.
"No, this is the wrong..."
It's 0-3.
That's not 0-3.
You're pretty.
You have a pretty mouth.
"All the pretty girls in the hallway, you know?"
And you can come with me.
It's good.
You look good.Who the fuck?
Who the fuck?
It's gonna be a long day.
Nadia!
I look awful.
Can we try something new?
What kind of statement would you like to make?
Something that says... don't fuck with me.
Fuck!
Shit!
Perfect.
Just sprucing up for some marathon shmoozing.
"Sorry, I'm just looking for an earring."
I think you look perfect as you are.
Very funny.
It's nice.
It suits you.
Is it new?
You don't remember?
I was wearing it the night we met.
the opera.
Congratulations.
"Well, thank you."
Hey.
Hey.
So we made an A.
Did we really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's cool, right?"
Congratulations.
It was the best grade in the class.
Thank you.
"Also, I made you something."
"I sensed a bit of reluctance on your part to embrace the cheese that is power metal, so it's your very own power metal mix."
Wow.
It's actually...
"You said, ""Parking lot mix"" on here."
"It's like heavy metal parking lot, you know?"
Do I have to listen to it in a parking lot?
"No, cars, bedrooms, whatever."
Bedrooms.
Wow!
Sweet.
Whatever.
Anyway.
But it was nice seeing you.
I'll see you around.
"Well, I appreciate it."
"Bye, guys."
Yeah.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Mr. Crusoe.
I thought you'd forgotten us.
Are you going to be leading us?
I'll leave that to you.
Right.
"I need to help a friend, but I'll be back."
Lancaster.
Unshackle the men.
"Come on, let's go."
"Get up, Velasquez."
The prisoners are out!
"Arm yourselves, you drunken sots!"
They're in disarray.
Let's have at them!
Fire!
Fire.
Reload!
No!
"No, wait!"
Hold your fire.
One more shot and I kill her.
Papa!
Lower your weapons.
We have lost.
Not just yet.
Back to your mother.
Lock 'em up!
A night away to bury my brother and what do I come back to?
Taylor and his officers got out.
It's in the nature of captives to want to escape.
It's the jailer's job to stop 'em.
They had help.
"Come on, hurry!"
Shit.
Who the fuck are you?
What the hell?
"Stop, goddamn it!"
"Stop it, you dirty slut!"
You whore!
"Eat this, too."
"Man, you're heavy."
I'm getting too old for this.
Don't be ridiculous.
Old ladies tell me men can still get it up after 70.
Then buy me some herbal supplements.
I keep having fucked-up nightmares.
What're you doing in there?
Oh hell.
Shit!
Nothing!
Get away from the car.
- Don't open it!
- What are you doing?
For crying out loud!
Dad!
Dad?
Look.
How do I look?
Pretty.
Freakishly pretty.
How long were you watching?
How much did you see?
"Don't worry, I won't tell."
So you saw everything.
"- Damn right, it's an error."
POLICE OFFICER:
Unless he set you up.
- (GUN CLICKS)
"- Hands above your head, please, miss."
Wait.
Why?
Possession of stolen goods.
He left you holding.
I have nothing.
"Sorry to tell you, but your boy took off."
Probably in Canada by now.
He called in a tip.
Told us to take a look at the surveillance footage at the train station.
Give me the watch.
Now!
You know your rights?
EMMA:
Yeah.
Good girl.
Turn around.
Where's the rest of the watches?
Gone.
They're not coming back.
Let's go.
EMMA:
"So, it's just in here somewhere."
HOOK:
Allegedly.
"Give me a boost, would you, love?"
So I can't see what you're pocketing?
No way.
You are too... a child.
It's dangerous to go alone!
I wonder if it is God's messenger.
Kill me...
I beg you....
Kill me...
This are the demon seeds...
Before they birth...
Kill me I beg you!
This is terrible....
Terrible...
Please stop it!
Don't look away.
Pray!
You prayed for help...
You must believe until the end...
But...
If you pray...
Pray for death!
Devil!
Shoot!
Gambo.
Thank you!
What....?
Explain it!
What is this white bear?
I think....
You may not believe it...
"Well, when you get discharged... what will you do?"
"Jin-san has been here for so long, he well deserves a big payroll."
If that's so...
It's good.
Ride 'em in.
Rawhide.
MUMBLE:
Okay.
This 'berg needs to topple.
Find yourself an elephant seal and show them the moves.
"Penguin, how's a bit of fancy dancing gonna move that?"
"With enough oomph, we can shove enough snow."
Pack it in behind.
It'll go.
BRYAN:
It's not gonna happen.
That's a whopping pile of 'berg!
Just try it.
Hit the beat hard!
And together!
"I know how to hit things hard, okay?"
- And I'm telling you...
- Come on.
The impact force of compact ice under pressure is equiv...
"Just give it a go, you big wuss!"

- Hello.
- Yeah.
Here we go.
"Now you're talking, Bryan!"
"You with me, boys?"
"Oh, yeah!"
ALL [SINGING]:
Pressure.
Then I'll just get back to work.
"Trevor, not yet."
I need to ask you for a UA.
Look like rain.
Radio says there's a storm on the way.
They said right.
I'd say it's already here.
You are on the first shift?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
"Funny, I never seen you before."
I've been here.
I work in the pit.
I just picked up Reynolds' shift.
Where's Reynolds?
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.
I'm Ivan.
Trevor.
"Well, I guess I'd better begin by..."
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.
You got that right.
I'll see you around.
What's wrong?
I just want to lie here.
We can do that.
I'm so tired.
"You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter."
That is the problem.
I can't sleep.
Nothing helps.
Don't worry about it honey.
I'll look for her later!
I was dead.
"I mean,"
I was really dead.
Really.
Tell me about it.
What's it like to be dead?
I'd got loose.
It were as if I was getting out of my body.
"My body was staying here, and I..."
I was flying.
You were floating?
Yes.
"I heard that dog, and a woman screaming."
"They were around me, panicking and... then I heard that noise."
It was like a whistle.
"A very, very loud whistle."
I saw... a light.
A light?
Yes.
It was alive.
It was alive as if it were waiting for me.
I was in the light.
I felt good.
- Didn't you want to come back?
- No.
But you did come back.
Yes.
Why did you come back?
I just did.
Something made you come back.
Is there something you're holding back?
- Who?
Finnerman?
I won't let her.
"I couldn't protect you before, Allison."
But I can now.
"Dad, what have you done?"
You weren't supposed to see this.
You should go.
"Dad, no!"
No!
"Help us, someone, please help us!"
Protect... protect the innocent ones.
No!
"No, Dad."
"Hey, stay with me, okay?"
You're gonna be okay.
Just...
Just stay with me.
"Stay with me, okay?"
"Please, someone help us!"
(engines revving)
(cars accelerating)
JARED (over radio):
Hold your line.
"Keep your speed up,"
Dana.
You're doing great.
"I'm doing so great, how come you're right up on my ass?"
I'm drafting you.
"(laughs) Not for long, you're not."
(gears shift)
Look...
"Yeah, that's cool."
'Cause I don't see no bwoy.
"Well, I suppose that is a matter of opinion."
I suppose.
(grunts)
Oh--
You're home early.
Mmhmm.
They changed my shift.
I'll get you food.
"I like dat, you should wear it more often."
Well it doesn't help much with finding work.
(kisses teeth)
Excuse me?
"Listen girl, no decent folk is going to hire any deportee, alright?"
That's just great.
"Alright, alright, listen!"
None of dat is my business anyway.
But you?
You have a problem.
But I tied him up.
Fine!
Fine.
I will go find him then--
"But I bet you could, right?"
It's doubtful.
That's almost $200!
"Uncle Archie, I can't afford that!"
"Well, Marva, there are other ways to pay for tings."
Hm?

- R-Right.
Turn the right tap.
- He's messing with you!
It's up to Chris.
He's saying left so that you'll pick right.
Maybe it's because I don't wanna hurt Gemma.
You don't care who you hurt.
One.
Left.
- I choose the left tap.
- Left tap turning on.
"Good call, Chris."
"Babe, babe, I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry, babe, he made me choose."
I suppose a date's out of the question now.
I'm so sorry.
"He made me choose, all right?"
He just made me.
"Round, and round, and round it goes... where it stops... nobody knows."
All right.
I'll play.
Truth.
Why us?
Why you?
Why us five?
Why did you choose us?
A photograph by Felix's bed.
Five faces scratched out.
- Your faces.
- That doesn't prove anything.
"- Fucking hell, a photograph."
- It was good enough for Felix... it's good enough for me.
Why do you ask?
Might she remember?
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
She's going to be well?
"Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me."
"Now, did you?"
"No, not me."
I didn't.
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?
"Of course, I didn't."
I didn't put it.
"Excuse me, madam."
What?
-A man to see you.
-What man?
You're a very nice lady.
-Thank you.
-You're a nice man.
I'll come back when she's feeling better.
"No, she was heavily sedated."
It's serious?
"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts.
"A draft in the fall, when the house is hot, is a magic carpet for bacteria."
"Excuse me, madam."
Anything else?
"No, Karl, we're fine."
Thank you.
It's all right.
- You changed your mind?
- They saw your gun and your wire cutters.
What can I say?
Hope is contagious.
- But Death Valley...
- We have a plan.
"We, uh... cut the phone cords and the power to the watchtower lights first."
- Safer in the dark.
- George!
Wait.
Danny.
"Danny, I'm sorry, lad, but we can only take five."
I want to help.
No.
Stay inside.
Stay safe.
Lifted it from the guards' latrine on cleaning duty.
What's it for?
Protection.
I won't allow it.
"Don't do anything daft, Danny."
How long does it take the guards to reach the far side?
Two minutes.
"OK, then."
"Two minutes from now, we run."
"Go, go, go."
Cut the wire!
Hey!
What are you doing?

For real?
Yup.
Do you want jumping rabbits in the background?
"Okay if the client wants it, I'll do it."
"Being in relationship isn't a waste of time, really?"
It is.
But I made my choice.
Actually it's quite fun.
I've learned new things.
Learned what?
Not telling.
I don't want to spoil anything.
Holding back on me now.
I've learned how to love.
How was that for a sweet answer?
But don't you argue?
It's a lot of hard work.
Surprisingly it feels good.
Weird huh?
So did you hit it yet?
Hell there's nothing to hit!
Rash: 0
Shit!
They're all gone!
Shit.
They're all gone.
So I don't have to go see the doctor anymore?
March.
I thought you weren't coming.
Why are you late today?
Well I couldn't sleep last night.
Oh!
He's in the Army.
At Angelras.
That so?
Is cozier like this.
Isn't this nice?
What do you want?
Not a thing...
Can't a guy count his money?
Your guy got a pass?
Yes.
When you'd see him last?
Two months ago.
"Oh, boy!"
What a time you're going to have!
Where'll you go?
I don't know.
A hotel...
Here...
Thas for you.
What for?
I'd like you to stay in the fanciest hotel in town.
In the most expensive room.
With a bathroom for your smelly boyfriend.
Come all over a great big bed.
Order champagne on a silver tray and drink it in bed.
Sound good to you?
Yes...
But you have to earn it.
How?
I'd like you to nurse my buddy...
He's an orphan and he loves milk...
He'd enjoy it...
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Yeah?
Has he ever caught you?
Yeah.
Many times.
"Well, listen."
Since I already lost my deposit and all maybe we should light up.
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you wanna do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
I just have to go is all.
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And, you know, pot is like stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
So you wanna go grab some dinner?
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."
We...
We cool?
What?
Maybe there.
"Let Ricky talk, and you take a good look."
Yes?
"Excuse me, are you Mr. Maurice Leon?"
Yes.
"Sorry to disturb you, we need your help."
- With what?
- We're looking for...
Give me the photo.
Do you know this woman?
"No, I don't know her."
Sorry.
- Why are you looking for her?
- We aren't looking for her.
She died three weeks ago.
Are you sure you don't recognize her?
"No, I'm sorry."
I can't help you.
You'll excuse me.
I don't think I've ever seen him.
Are you sure?
Did you see how he reacted to the photo?
- How?
- He trembled.
Didn't he tremble?
- What are you doing?
- Knocking.
- What for?
I told you I can't help you.
What do you want now?
"- Sorry, we just wanted to ask..."
All right.
Go!
Good-dye!
I can't take any more!
A little trout for my little princess.
What's wrong?
Why are you crying?
Is it that dastard who's making you cry?
I'll kill him!
Luigi!
Renato!
Hello.
Renato.
Hello.
Don't scream.
Not a word.
The others are out there.
Just act natural.
That's fine.
Just like that.
You dastard!
Who's that?
Some nut.
Come on!
What adout Aldin?
So the microfilm got to Italy... to the top of the mountain on its own.
I don't give a damn adout the microfilm.
I just want to find Aldin.
You detter give a damn.
It may de our only means of getting him dack.
Why?
If it is the list of their agents... we'll know exactly where to find him.
Got a little trick
I've been working on.
Ooh.
"It's up to you now, Jefferson."
"Gray, listen."
"If we're going to do this, we got to do it together."
"It's going to take the two of us, all right?"
- You're right.
- Okay.
"Come on, Gray!"
"Oh, man."
You got my boots wet.
"Jefferson, you did it!"
"We did it, man."
"Gideon, take us back to Rip."
Damn it!
I wanted to be the one to kill him.
"Again, I mean."
Um...
I don't think our problems are over yet.
I'm on it.
On what?
It's not working.
The radiation buildup is too progressive.
I got this.
I don't understand.
I must be all out of power.
What happens if only one of these goes off?
Uh...
time will remain intact.
The world?
Not so much.
How the hell is this a surprise?
This is the most cliche thing in the world.
Je.
We've been together for many years.
"If you're so happy, you cry."
Tomorrow I'll kick you in the head.
Will you marry me?
Alright.
"I'm sorry, I didn't cry."
It's okay.
Hold on.
I'm crying.
Shit!
What the hell!

"How could you make the wrong diagnosis, doctor!"
?
"This is a person's life, not some pig, dog, or chicken!"
You shouldn't be a doctor!
Go do something else!
"Please calm down, sir."
Calm down please.
Doc.
Here a New Year's present for you.
Last time you didn't come.
So I'm giving it to you now.
Thank you.
Let's have a look.
Rash: 24 spots
Better.
See you again next month.
Any medicine left just tell the pharmacist.
"Oh, grow up, Robin."
There's no such thing as ghosts.
"Nate, can you please help me?"
Technically...
He's right.
- What?
- Yes.
I... but you're also right.
It feels...
Very wrong.
- Yeah.
- But that is not for you to judge.
"You know, if... if he wants to do this..."
I do.
"And she, for some reason, wants to do this..."
"- Yes, please."
- Nate:
And she approves...
"- Yes, of course."
- Then...
"Well, it sounds like we just completed our vows."
"Robin, let's make this official."
Somebody please object.
I object!
Because I love her!
- [Speaks Russian]
- I know so much about you!
I know you like snack chips.
I like snack chips!
You're a side sleeper.
"I'm a side sleeper, right?"
You read a magazine on the potty.
Can't swim...
"Oh, you're such a pussy."
I can't.
You just don't want to.
Lie back.
That's it.
You're OK.
It's easy.
Just float.
Excuse me.
"Come here, please."
Come on...
Bit naughty.
Never mind.
Up you come.
- Tony - is that right?
- Yes.
"Now, Tony, the thing is, we're not really supposed to go in the pool."
It's really only for sporting events.
And the Super Irony Fun Splash Club.
"And the Super Irony Fun Splash Club, too."
You're supposed to be on the tour.
"There was this girl, but she's gone."
"Don't go with her, Tony."
- What?
- You should join us.
What?
Yes.
We'll find you somewhere you can dry off.
"You should get out of those wet clothes, too."
I'd really like to see you out of those clothes.
I'll lend you my cagoule.
Would you like to purchase?
Hey.
Hey.
You're not knocking anymore?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
Uh...just busy.
You're always busy.
That's the price of fame.
"I gotta go, Dad."
They found Ryan.
Or spotted someone who meets his description.
There was a fight down by the pier.
Really?
Which means he's probably still in the area.
We should go try to find him before the authorities do.
Before he gets into any more trouble.
"Actually, do you need me to go?"
I was going somewhere.
Seth.
He's your friend.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey!
So what's up?
You've been all weird-acting lately.
Yeah?
I don't know.
I guess...
It's just...
Do you ever wonder what your life looks like through someone else's eyes?
I was a little afraid.
Good.
"By the way, have you seen my pen?"
I Ieft it here.
really?
Sometimes we pick up things without thinking.
"But we didn,t!"
May I?
Are you kidding?
please.
"We don,t have your pen."
"That,s enough!"
"We don,t have it!"
Sixteen seconds.

Sixteen seconds?

Very good.
Thank you.
See you tomorrow.
"- I can,t stand this."
- Sure you can.
"It,s not so bad."
"Besides, it,s for science, right?"
My model sweetie pie!
- All right.
Yes?
- What's your name if it's no secret?
- Tanya.
"Tanya dear, some tea, please."
"I guess your tea isn't strong enough, so don't bother, I'll make it myself."
I've got such little bomb...
Just bring me some boiling water.
- So it's you?
"- Yes, me."
It means...
- With me?
- I guess so.
- You alone?
- Alone.
All right...
How about you...
None of your business.
Miss!
- Go away mister!
"- I apologized, didn't I!"
Miss!
I'm not going like this.
- What's up?
- Don't you have women's beds?
You put me up with some...
Don't you see...
How come?
- Is he making passes?
"- What do you mean, passes?"
"I can't change, can't put my slippers on."
"Go back to your compartment now, we'll find something for you."
Abduct the mandible.
- I need to sit down.
- Don't move.

"C- spine, chest and pelvis."
"Gallant, why don't you go get yourself some air?"
Want a facial CT?
"Yeah, good idea."
Why don't we get a full head series?
Call RT.
Let's get a vent.
"Give him four of Ativan, seven of Pav."
"Nice work, John."
Bet that was a new one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Look, I'm sorry."
I just thought I was gonna be sick.
It's better if you keep your head down.
It'll be okay.
"It just caught me by surprise, you know?"
Relax.
Take a minute.
"You know, sometimes I don't think I can do this."
Are you gonna call me?
I'll call you.
"Unlock the door, Jenna."
I'm packing.
Come back later.
The house will be empty.
No.
You have to come talk to me.
Things are not going to end like this.
- Like I did this.
Move your foot.
- I panicked.
I made a huge mistake.
Fuck!
"Jenna, open the door!"
Michael?
- Is anything wrong?
- Everything's fine.
I locked myself out.
"- Jenna, you're having our baby!"
"- Yeah, well, maybe I won't keep it!"
"Don't you ever say that, Jenna."
Don't ever say anything like that ever again!
I can do whatever the hell I want.
"We're not married, remember?"
"- We're both free, just like you wanted."
- I made a mistake.
You're right.
"Too late, man."
Move your goddamn foot.
Hi.
"Hi, darling."
Okay.
"Thank you, Brian."
Thank you very much.
It's okay.
We're just gonna look.
My God.
Here you are.
We were just making sure there was adequate closet space.
Good.
"Well, this house is yours if you want it... but you have to decide right now."
We'll take it.
-Really?
"Oh, my God!"
You know what I kept thinking when we were looking at that house?
That we should get a mattress for that closet.
I kept thinking that it felt like a dream come true.
Come here.
- How fast can you drive this thing?
- Really fast.
Let's see.
Okay.
"- We bought a really, really..."
- Excuse me.
We bought a house.
We bought a big house.
¡Mary!
¡Mary!
¡Mary!
"Mary, are you all right?"
"Mary, talk to me."
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
We can wear as many rings as we want on our fingers.
But women wear only one matrimonial necklace around their neck.
Laxi!
You're not in the mood!
But that's all right.
I'll await your answer.
And I'll wait for my husband!
...my God!
Aunty!
Here comes the detective for you!
"Hey, wait...!"
I've got to follow the woman!
Not the vehicle!
Watch where you're going!
Mister... does the dog bite?
No.
Out of my way...!
You said it wouldn't bite!
It's not my dog.
Laxmi!
Haribhai?
!
"Don't call me ""bhai"" (brother)!"
Anything else will do!
All right.
I have something important to say to you.
Of course.
Come inside...
No.
Keep walking...
"You gave me a rose, right?"
Did I?
Was that a person?
Wife
The rat fell into the trap.
"You all right, baby?"
You Okay?
I'm okay.
Come here.
You're okay now?
You're okay now?
Drink up.
Good girl.
Leaveit
I want to tidy up a little.
Leave it.
We've got the shaman to thank for everything.
Get some rest.
You must be exhausted.
Shaman
Damn fool.
Suspect arrested in the mushroom-tonic case...
Victims have developed severe mental derangement...
Mr. Yang E-sam?
Yes.
The landlady was a victim.
"Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too."
It's turned the town upside down.
We've gotta bring him in.
You should get a lawyer.
"After all, he's a victim, too."
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?
Get out.
Boss.
- What's her name?
The one in green.
- Macarena.
Give her this and another round.
- It's strange.
- What is?
"He's good-looking, he could have any girl."
Why does he do it?
You look tired.
You should go to bed.
"Take the car, I don't mind."
I'll walk back.
Wednesday morning 200 workers with pickets blocked the national highway at four different spots...
- Evening.
- Evening.
I'm coming!
I'm alone.
- Can I come in'?
"- Yeah, sure."
Just a moment.
What can you tell me about this?
- That she has nice tits.
"- It's Carmen, she's dead."
She had nice tits.
- What can I tell you?
- Whatever you know.
- Where did you get it?
- That's not your concern.
- I'm a journalist.
- Don't make me laugh.
- Send it to Madrid.
(STOMACH GURGLING)
Just hold that thought and stay right there.
Oh-oh.
(MANSLEY SIGHS)
DEAN:
Little lower.
Little bit lower...
Hey.
I thought you were in trouble.
DEAN:
That sucks.
Let me just...
Up a little.
I had to ditch this weird guy who's staying at our house.
It took me hours to shake him!
I kill myself to get out here!
And you have him doing...
Arts and crafts!
"You got a problem with arts and crafts, little man?"
"He's a giant robot, Dean."
It's a little undignified.
Yeah?
"Well, smart guy, what would you have him do?"
(MAKES ENGINE SOUNDS) Main systems on.
Main engines.
"One, two and three."
All systems go.
"Five, four, three two, one!"
Blast off!
(SCREAMING)
We're landing.
We're landing!
I see your giant elephant's cock.
I want it inside me.
I really do.
Now it's inside me.
-Right.
Are you there?
There's no one here.
"Hi, daddy."
Are you crazy?
What if the boss sees that?
Do you like me at all?
-I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Do you?
-Do you know what'll happen - if my vegan friends find out I'm chopping lamb all night?
I'm coming.
No problem.
I'll never sleep with you if you go now.
I hate you and your barometer.
I'd rather marry Peku than you.
"I hate you, Peku!"
"Kaitsu, I mean!"
Any explosives?
-Come on!
No way.
How about the fireworks stuff that got banned?
You're a genius!
I'll get them.
Two rolls of wide duck tape.
This is all we've got.
One price for all.
And here's some fuse.
Keep the change.
"Oh, yes..."
I am.
"- Hey, douche bag, get out of there!"
- What does this mean?
"- Come on, fuckface!"
"- Alright, pig... get out here!"
Come on!
"- Come on, come on!"
- Get out here.
"Don't hurt me, I'm just a poor college student!"
"Poor, poor?"
Then we'll find someone who'll pay for you.
"No, not my mother!"
"Please, not my mother."
"- Guys, what should we do?"
- Let's knock him off!
"No, no."
Please!
I'll give you everything I have!
- Like what?
"- Everything, everything."
Candies?
"No, I don't like breath mints."
This linen handkerchief.
My mother gave it to me for my birthday.
- It's not worth anything.
- Come on.
Come on!
I have 16.600 liras to last me to the end of the month.
- I'll take that.
- What about me?
You get nothing!
I'm... very hungry.
- This is Storm Island?
- That's right.
- And what do you do here?
- Sheep farmer.
- Really?
- I'm going to bed.
My back's playing up.
You're a fool.
Lucky to be alive.
Why were you out in the storm in the first place?
Because I had no idea it was going to be so severe.
Give me two.
I want to sleep.
I can do that.
Good night.
- Would you like some more soup?
"- No, thank you."
It was delicious.
There's some brandy next door.
Would you like some?
Do sit down.
"Where do you live, Mr Baker?"
I used to live on that boat.
I suppose I am a damn fool.
I moved from London about a month ago.
- Really?
I haven't been there for years.
- When were you last there?
Four years ago.
And that was to have a baby.
- You've been here four years?
- I just got a daughter.
- Congratulations.
- Do you have a wife?
- No.
- You haven't married?
- No.
A girlfriend?
No.
- Is it rude of me to ask?
"- No, no."
- Why don't I get that wine?
- Good idea.
"When I went home, I thought you would follow me."
I thought so too.
I thought you would come back.
You did?
But we didn't.
We should go to India.
- Why?
- It's warm.
They've got good hotels.
Stop it.
Why?
Look at this apartment.
We're lying on a mattress.
There's lots to do.
- It doesn't matter.
- It does.
- And we're going to Val d'lsere.
"- We can go there, but not India?"
Give me a break.
"Ever since you met your real, holy father   you've been really irritating to be with."
"Eddie, don't..."
Can you...
I got to go.
"[click, dial tone]"
Fuck.
Fuck.
[spit] [flush]
"You were in there a while, Eddie."
I was just...
I don't know how many times I got to tell you guys.
"If it's a big one, take it upstairs."
"Christ, did you even spray?"
- No.
There was...
- Look at you.
You look like shit.
- Yeah.
- What's going on?
- I feel...
"- What is it, first night back jitters or something?"
- Maybe.
Maybe.
- All right.
"Well, just relax, okay?"
This is probably inevitable.
"Look, I'm gonna put Tate on the big table."
You can deal razz to those English pricks.
- No.
No.
- I'm gonna ease you back in.
"Yeah, that's what we're going to do."
- You sure?
FINN:
I think I know where he might be.
(KEYS JINGLING)
JASPER:
Christ.
What's he keeping in here?
FINN:
I don't know.
Him and the previous manager added this door years ago.
"God, please, oh, please, don't let him be in there."
There's no way.
"If there was a dead body in there, we'd be able to smell it."
"(GASPS) Oh, God."
What?
Is he in there?
"Oh, my God."
"Close it, close it."
What happened to him?
It looked like he was burned.
"Yeah, I don't know about that."
Did you see his suit?
It was fine.
It wasn't even touched.
Isn't it obvious?
"I mean, you read his journal."
He broke the cardinal rule.
You don't fuck with time.
"Jasper, please take his hat off."
It's my thinking cap.
What the hell is there to think about?
"We need to call the police, guys."
Hang on.
- Hello?
- It's me.
You ready?
"Listen, tell Michael not to let the sauce stick."
Keep stirring it.
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.
"- Listen, you know what to do?"
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Don't ""yeah, yeah"" me, Lois."
This is important.
Make sure you leave the house when you make the call.
You understand me?
You hear me?
Call from an outside line.
I mean it.
"Jesus, you must think I'm dumb."
Why are you bugging me?
I know what to do.
"You little hick, just make sure you do it."
You can be such a pain.
- Hey!
Just do it!
- Okay.
Un-fucking-believable.
All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.
- What did he say?
- Nothing.
What does she do after she hangs up with me?
After everything I told her?
"After all her ""yeah, yeah"" bullshit?"
"Chloe, the magical waitress Chloe from Albuquerque, or Donny, the angry busboy who shot Luke ?"
I'll go with Chloe on that one.
Good.
That's what I figured.
That's what I figured.
Okay.
Okay.
Desert island.
"Sadie, the tough as nails yet soulful jewelry maker or Lindsay, my grandfather's illegitimate, bookish love child ?"
"I can't, Seth."
Sure... sure you can.
It's very easy.
Go on.
Just go.
I'm not going to go alone.
"We need help, man."
I need help.
"Just sit me down, okay ?"
All right.
"Okay, but I'm going to come right back."
I know.
Do you hear that ?
No.
Exactly.
It's quiet now.
Maybe they moved on.
Or... maybe they're just faking us out.
There we go.
Locked and loaded.
Just how mama likes it.
"Taylor, a gun ?"
Where did you get that ?
-It's nothing.
"Hey, it's me."
Why can't you tell me?
Okay.
Sit down.
There's this woman that I like a lot.
But it can't happen.
She's not a Tribbiani?
No!
So is she someone from work?
Yes.
"Well, does she like you?"
Sometimes I think she could.
But I can't do anything about it.
Why not?
It's complicated.
She was with this other guy for a long time.
Someone from work too.
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.
"Wait, I thought you hated everyone at work."
"No, no."
I only say that..
so Chandler won't feel threatened because I'm his only friend.
Excuse me?
"Sorry, sorry."
And I'm your only friend too.
"So this guy she used to go out with, is he still in love with her?"
"-No, I don't think so."
-Okay.
Is he a good guy?
"Yeah, he's the best."
1000)}TODAY
Where am I?
At the hospital.
You were in a coma.
I can't feel my legs.
Don't worry.
It will gradually come back.
Do you know your name?
I think.
So?
Lucy Clarsen.
Do you remember what happened to you?
What is it?
Why are you staring at me?
You're a miracle.
268)}What's going on?
268)}There's nothing more we can do.
The plant is flooded.
268)}You can't just leave.
You said... 268)}You should do the same.
There's no point in staying.
There must be something we can do.
Nope.
We tried everything.
The power won't come back.
Crowbar.
What the hell are you doing?
Please have a seat.
I have nothing to offer.
Will the power be back soon?
You can come to the Helping Hand.
We have a generator. and dorm rooms if you need to stay.
Huh?
You're the type of woman... who needs a man you can control.
"Well, guess what..."
I'm not that man.
I'll show you!
You little whore!
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Emma, let me see your hand."
You keep the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!
How the fuck could you let her get out alone?
"You crossed the line, John."
You put the girl in jeopardy.
"Yeah, well, I didn't lose her."
She's reckless because of you!
To get to you!
"Now, I'm gonna go get her, bring her home... and handcuff her to the fucking banister!"
She's gone!
"Oh, man!"
She's probably at the EI.
Come on.
No.
No way!
You stay out of this!
You fucked up enough already!
Come on.
Couldn't you have said something... she wanted to hear?
Anything?
Couldn't you have lied?
I did lie.
Help!
Help me!
Like where?
Neverland?
I'm serious.
We could do this.
Where?
- Where?
I'll tell you where.
- Pfft.
Close your eyes and point.
"Whatever spot you pick, that's our home."
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
"Yeah, it's Florida."
Everything's near a beach.
"Okay, then."
Tallahassee it is.
Tallahassee it is!
Are you sure?
Is this what you really want?
What I really want is you.
What is that?
It keeps the time.
You have somewhere to be?
We can mark watches.
Take turns sleeping.
"We'll most likely have to walk through the night again, so we should rest while we can."
- I'll take first shift.
- I'll stay up with you.
Okay.
When's the last time you slept?
I don't really sleep now.
That dog belongs to me.
"I bought him, Smith, and I don't allow my dogs to be shot."
"That is, of course, unless I shoot them myself."
That's all right.
I'll give you twice what you paid for him.
He's not for sale.
"Just as you say, my good man."
Just as you say.
"Well, what others have you?"
"- Uh, here."
Hitch 'em up.
- These two will do.
I ordered a collapsible bathtub from Seattle.
Did it get here?
It's a bathtub.!
It's a bathtub.!
You sweet meats.
You're losing your home.
Easy with ye.
Come on.
Out.
Come on.
Come on.
"Come on, Harmon."
"Here ya are, Mr. Smith."
We thought it was something to pile wood in.
The only bath a person gets up here is by the sweat of the brow.
How interesting.
Mush!
"Been a great pleasure, gentlemen."
A great pleasure!
Nice guys.
You've got your million.
"No, jim, i haven't."
"Oh, of course you have."
What do you mean?
I gave it all to nick.
"I had to, jim."
He needed money desperately.
I had to help him.
Don't you see?
"Sure, i see."
Try to understand.
I understand.
I'm just beginning to understand.
"We know you're in there, jim fisk!"
"Come out, you yellow-bellied crook!"
What's the matter?
Are you afraid?
Come on out of there!
"Jim, you can't go out there."
They'll mob you!
You think i'm afraid of a mob?
Jim!
"You stay here, josie."
This is one time the colonel is going to be at the front of his regiment.
Jim!
Jim!
"What's the matter, boys?"
Losing your nerve?
"This is no joke, fisk!"
This is no joke!
"If it is a joke, it's on me!"
You can't talk yourself out of this!
"They can help you, Dr. Bryar."
Not any more.
- Let me know when HRT's ready.
- Got it.
"Gideon, you send those guys in there, hostages are going to die."
Yeah.
"You don't do something, they're going to die anyway."
It's not gone.
I know.
"Well, you said when the chip came out, it would go away."
It's...
I still hear it.
Then there must be more of them.
"You said it was the only one, Leo."
I can still feel the buzzing.
The burning.
- Dr. Bryar?
- What?
- Reid.
"- It's all right, Elle."
Is there another one?
You know there isn't.
"- Lf there were, Leo would have told you."
"- Don't listen, Ted."
Make it stop!
I know what it's like.
- Make it stop!
- I know what the voices are like.
He's trying to trick you.
The voices.
They won't stop.
They've been talking to you since you were a child.
To concentrate for a few days.
"I see, where to?"
There's this town called Shinduri.
On the west coast.
But I heard a sandstorm's on its way.
And it's supposed to be nasty.
- Sandstorm?
Again?
"- Yes, a nasty one, too."
So why don't you wait a couple of days and then go?
I have a strange feeling about today.
Okay.
"Well, I'll work hard on it."
"Producer Jung, everything's fine with you, too?"
"So, do you still have some money left for expenses?"
"Ah, yes."
A little.
"Later perhaps, you can..."
Thank you.
"Well, take care."
Good luck with your script.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Sit here!
"- No, the backseat's fine."
"- Please, sit here."
"- No, I'm okay."
Hello.
We're off.
"Wow, it's a new car."
Really nice.
Did you pay for it?
I can see it now.
It's gonna be great.
Lex.
It's Gina.
Please call me back.
I found who you've been searching for.
I know who the traveler is.
"After the funeral, I plan on taking some time off."
Get the jet ready.
Zurich.
You can't run away.
"No matter where you go, I'll always be there."
You can't get rid of me.
You need my help.
There's still good inside you.
I know it.
I don't want your help.
Don't go to Zurich.
I'm going.
I have to.
Dad was right.
"If you open the box, it will destroy you."
It's all I have left.
It's not true.
You still have me.
I'm done listening to you.
You make me weak.
Long night.
It's good to see the sun again.
It's too bad Lionel's not here to see it.
Lex closed the funeral to any and all guests.
"In other words, Lex is the only one invited."
"""Where's Behzad?"""
"She said, ""He took a towel and went out."""
You weren't down near the spring.
I tried the other side but you weren't there either.
You weren't at the spring.
How can you cross?
There's a bridge.
You don't ask how I am?
Where were you?
We've had no news from you.
Nothing!
I work in the fields.
You're always working or at school.
Or sleeping.
Mind you don't fall.
- You call that a bridge?
- Yes.
Your personal bridge?
All the children use it.
- How are you?
- Okay.
How's the invalid?
Who?
You still ask who?
It's obvious.
"- Oh, Mrs Malek?"
- Yes.
She didn't eat the soup from Mash Hajer and the others.
How many cooks does she have?
They're not her cooks.
The soup is an offering.
All right.
Daddy lets us play.
I don't care what your father does.
This is important.
I want you to look at me.
- Alright then.
- Excuse me?
Nothing.
The doctor told me to rest.
And I expect support.
There are some new rules.
I want absolute silence in the house.
I need sleep.
"If it's important, you knock."
And no visitors.
"If someone asks, tell them mom's sick."
We keep the curtains closed.
I need to avoid sunlight.
"You play alone in the garden, very quiet."
You take nothing inside.
"No branches, no animals ..."
What are you doing?
We start over.
Well?
We need to keep this family together.
One for me and one of Luke.
Very nice.
I meant what I just said.
"We're sticking to this plan, huh?"
Good.
Now it's bedtime.
Goodnight.
- She is so different.
Here.
This isn't too bad.
Here.
Jones...
Jones?
"We never seem to get a break, do we?"
What is it?
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.
What's happening?
We have most important friends.
Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
Don't you touch me.
What about Jones?
"There's no trace yet, sir."
Jones is dead.
I killed him.
He was of no use to us.
"This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed."
She'll bring a very good price.
Mmm?
"Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken- if it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl."
It would reduce our loss on this trip.
Savage!
"Gosh bro, this isn't hard to understand!"
Love is like a disease.
You can treat it.
I will prescribe you some medicine.
"Here, shrimp dumplings."
Just eat this yummy stuff you like.
It will help.
"One more thing, you have to find something to do."
So you won't be free to think too much.
Working is good.
Way back when I was like you broken-hearted.
I almost flunked out of college.
I kept working.
"Then forgot everything, even being broken-hearted."
"Stop being sad, no time for that."
Just worked.
It works!
Songkran I am free.
A 2-day deadline that's doable.
Yes.
"Yes, sir."
Hi everybody.
I am back!
Rash: 1 spot
I've got my life back.
Hello.
Hello.
This is Peng.
Are you free?
I have a job for you.
I'm free.
That's what I like about you.
I hope you don't mind that we opened things up.
Long as you pay for them.
"Not planning on drinking that beer and driving, are you?"
LILA:
No.
No.
We wouldn't do that.
This is for later.
Just kidding.
"CASHIER: $7.95, please."
Y'all have a nice night.
Y'all too.
"She's too young for you, Bill."
I like them young.
Shit!
"That trooper's behind us, man."
Don't look back.
Just be cool.
What do we do if he pulls us over?
He ain't going to pull us over.
"Slow down, Ray."
Don't panic.
"He recognized me back there, man."
I know he did.
"If he did, he would have arrested you."
He was just looking us over.
"White boy and a nigger girl in Texas, that's all it is."
Right now he's probably running our plates.
FEMALE RADIO DISPATCHER:
5-42.
"5-42, go ahead."
"On your out-of-state plate,"
How you know?
Change the tags.
Here how?
The hotel staff is here.
"Its big job Papa, yeah it is."
Go tease the girl who is standing being me.
Who me?
"Yeah who elss, go tease her."
"She will shout, help... help... i will come and beat you, hotel's staff will gather here."
At the same time they will change the tags.
No one has ever tease a girl in my whole family.
"You are saying i tease her, i don't even know it."
"There is not much to do, go near her and say."
Coming?
And that's it.
How will you say?
Coming?
Ma am.
Ma'am?
Is she your sister?
No...
coming?
Coming?
"No... no... which one, the one behind me."
Right or left behind you?
Left one.
You left or mine?
Your left.
There are two girls in my left.
The pink one.
"There are two with pink, light pink or dark pink."
Laxmi Narayan do one thing.
"- No, I love it."
It's perfect.
- Good.
- One with everything on it.
"- Make that two, please."
"So, how's..."
- Luke?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- He went fishing.
- Fishing?
Yeah.
He didn't catch anything though.
- He probably used the wrong bait.
- Yeah.
That's a common fishing blunder.
So he's good?
"Yeah, he's good."
I can tell him hello for you if you want.
Whatever.
Thank you.
- My God.
This is really good.
- I'm glad you like it.
"- So, how much time you got?"
- I got a bit.
There's a record store you should check out.
It's run by this insane freak who's a walking encyclopedia... for every punk and garage band record ever made.
Catalog numbers.
He's crazy.
The place is right out of High Fidelity.
- Let's go.
"Mr. Lawrence, I told you I wasn't an actor."
I'm so sorry.
Sorry about what?
That you did such a terrific job?
That the phones are lighting up like crazy?
They love you.
And those little ad lib things you did?
You were wonderful.
Wasn't she wonderful?
"So, what do you say?"
About what?
About doing it full time.
It's just three nights a week.
I promise it won't interfere with your day job.
"I mean, I don't know."
You really thought I was good?
I told you when I met you.
You're a natural.
Mr. Monk?
"Well, I..."
Why don't we think about it?
Okay.
I will.
I just did.
I want to do it.
"Oh, Mr. Monk, I'm so sorry."
But I could really use the money and I think it could be fun.
There you go.
A star is born.
No.
Don't worry.
It's not going to change a thing.
"Sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post and he said, ""I'll keep you posted""?"
"Oh, yeah."
I heard about that.
"Yeah, everybody heard about it."
"I mean, people were repeating it."
It was famous.
This is even better.
This is a classic.
If you say so.
"Yeah, I just need to pick the right moment."
Captain?
"If you're ready to release the body,"
I can take her downtown.
Okay.
I still don't get it.
Who would want to kill the lotto girl?
I guess her number came up.
Hey!
What are you doing?
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"That was my line, man."
What are you talking about?
I just said the exact same thing two seconds ago.
Ask the Captain.
"Randy, this is a crime scene."
For God's sakes...
No.
You heard me.
Yeah.
You know what?
He must have heard me.
Huh?
But it's no longer a Chinese's place.
It's a British colony now!
I don't care!
I won't let anyone bully me.
Alright.
Leave me alone!
"The salary which you haven't paid me, if it's convenient... may I get it back?"
What did you say?
The salary which you...
The previous line.
No.
"You told me to leave you alone, didn't you?"
Good!
Very good!
It's what you said!
"Master, you love chicken's kidney's very much."
Eat more.
More rice.
Let me do it...
"Master, your rice."
Don't you know I am on diet?
I want half rice!
Let me do it...
"Bastard, what a useless guy!"
Half!
"Look, half bowl of rice which you want!"
Eat it!
"You do this in my place, you are not giving me face, are you?"
You said you would leave me alone.
"You lost, Chan Mon-gut!"
Peace!
Peace!
Are you a cop or not?
Now you come up with this story and I'm supposed to believe you.
When was the last time you saw this girl?
He's putting them in the water so I'll find them.
- He wants me to find these girls.
"- You're crazy, that's it."
- He called me.
- He called you?
- That's right.
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.
- You dreamed it.
Get in your little boat and get the fuck out of here!
You're an alcoholic.
You need help.
- Get your head examined.
- Maybe you need a drink.
- It'd ease the pain of being wrong.
- Get out of my sight.
Keep those people out of here!
Am I talking to myself?
Put Grandpa back on.
Just a second.
She sounds good.
Yes.
"Okay, bye-bye."
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you all right?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Okay.
This is it. 16 months ago.
Sats 88.
He's not talking anymore.
Why is he not talking?
Because he can't.
Let's Betadine the whole chest just in case.
- You need any help?
- Yes.
With his wife.
She's bleeding.
- I'm not his wife.
- Then you shouldn't be here.
- Where's the rapid infuser?
- Got it.
We need that blood.
Let's get her on a monitor.
She refused treatment for chest pain at the scene.
I'm Dr. Kovac.
Come with me.
- No.
Somebody needs to be with him.
"- Okay, I'm in."
- Hook me up.
- Let us take care of him and Dr. Kovac will take care of you.
Please.
What are you doing down there?
"Lewis, what are you doing up there?"
This guy's got no DP pulse.
It's called a trauma assessment.
"Lungs clear, chest tones normal."
- Got the Doppler.
- Give it to me.
- Sweet Jesus!
And she got her head chopped off
So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man.
She married her country.
Forget boys.
Keep your eye on the prize jenny humphrey.
You can't make people love you
But you can make them fear you.
For what it's worth
You're my queen.
I choose you.
Thank you.
It's already been over an hour.
The bar's closing soon.
She's gonna come.
I know she is.
Whoa Whoa whoa.
Wait.
Wait.
Dan is gossip girl?
Gossip girl?
You crazy?
Then what are you doing here?
I loopt you.
Are you waiting for gossip girl?
And I know you don't approve.
I'm gonna go close the tab.
This grudge match thing--
It d--it doesn't seem like you.
What's--what's going on?
I don't want to be irrelevant.
Irrelevant?

Please listen to me.
I'm a doctor.
I'm on your side.
I'm on the president's side.
I can tell you where the guerrilleros are.
I saw them marching towards San Juan.
We'll see about that.
Call the Capitán.
- Come on!
"- Hurry, over there."
We need more material.
Hurry up.
"You need to work faster, come on."
Unit 3!
There's someone lying there.
Let's see if he's still alive.
Careful.
There's another one down there.
Fire!
There are even more of them!
Come over here!
I always come at the right time.
Where's Smithy?
He stayed down there.
I lost sight of him.
It all happened so fast.
- Do you think he's dead?
"- If he isn't, I hope they won't get him."
"- Come on, get up there."
- Hurry up.
Come on.
I wonder what your father would have said about this ruckus.
"Listen, I don't like this either, but I need to talk to her now."
- Come in.
- Thank you.
Wait here.
"Helene, we have a guest."
- Wanna play football?
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming yesterday.
- My pleasure.
- Can we offer you something?
- No.
"Helene, can we talk?"
- I was going to call.
- But you didn't.
Do you have a minute?
Of course.
Yes.
- Let's go out to the kitchen.
- Good idea.
Let's go to the kitchen.
- Or would you rather be alone?
"- No, I'd like you to come."
"Boys, stay with Anna and grandmother."
"- Jørgen, is everything okay?"
"- Yes, unpack your presents."
All this running to and fro.
You old grump...
- Did you lose again?
- Yes.
Don't come here like this.
You should have waited for me to call you.
- You didn't call.
I have to pee really badly.
Hot.
- What?
- Hitchcock!
"- Guys, enough!"
- Sarge...
"Yeah, I know!"
"You got to pee, I got it!"
"- No, brake lights!"
"- Oh, crap."
Everyone hang on!
There's no side-impact airbags!
Did you get breakfast?
"I tried, but I got recognized."
Do I know you from somewhere?
Do you watch a lot of pornography?
'Cause I'm in most of it.
"Oh, boy."
What if you were followed?
I don't think it's safe to stay here.
Where are we gonna go?
- The cops?
- Or Figgis!
Do we have any weapons?
I have the pipe we pulled out of me.
I would sooner surrender than go anywhere near your gooey body pipe.
"Oh, no, I'm gonna do it."
- Oh!
- Jake?
Amy...
It's so good to see you.
Thank you guys so much for coming.
"Keep it... here, give me that."
Hey!
Shh!
Now... stop it.
Are yous all listening?
I'm in hurry.
Will you get on with it?
Shut up!
He has to sit on the wall all day and do nothin'.
"You go and shite you, you stupid bitch... what?"
"Don't you ""what"" me, Sonny Curley."
No language like that in this house.
- Exactly!
"- Don't start, you."
- You never hit her!
- I do so!
I'm not taking this!
Have a nice day!
You better watch yourself... or you'll find yourself... packing your shampoo and spot creams.
"I'm sorry, you'll have to discuss it with my solicitor."
Don't you start.
Now...
Sharon has a bit of news for yous.
I can't help it.
"I'm sorry, Sharon."
"Go on, love."
I'm going to have a baby.
"- That's massive, Sharon."
- Is that all?
"Women, what?"
Right.
Where's your bump?
Not at all.
"The only drawback of cupping is, it leaves a suction mark."
It can bruise a little.
Cupping?
"Yes, ancient Chinese secret."
All the celebrities do it.
"It draws out toxins, boosts metabolism."
You'll feel good.
[ Exhales deeply ] Who knew?
[ Yawns ]
"Oh, excuse me."
It's just so relaxing in here.
It's the aromatherapy.
The lavender really packs a punch.
Huh.
Ahh.
Geez.
That's wa-a-a-rm.
[ Snores ]
[ Snoring ]
[ Slurping ]
Flojo.
"You got time to lean, you got time to clean, huh?"
I'm starving.
What do we get to eat?
Same as the clients.
They expect us to eat this rabbit food?
It's not rabbit food.
It's super food.
I'm not eating it.
[ Sighs ]
"At Canyon Valley, we're supposed to lead by example."
That too without a weapon.
"Baby, in this life, I am the tiger."
Got it?
I'll bite if someone tries to touch me.
- Tiger?
- Yes.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Let's go.
What?
"Everything's set, right?"
"Yes, everything is set."
I'll take a plane and go straight to Budapest.
From there I'll go to the embassy and then I'll come to get you.
"Otherwise, you'll get stuck in the water."
And no one has seen my face so there is nothing to worry about.
Everything will be...
- You are scared.
- Very scared.
Scoundrel...
I too am scared.
- You look after yourself in the boat.
- I will.
We will take Lord's name.
everything will be fine.
Shiv...
- What?
She is You.
One should be ready to face danger for her.
"You take care of yourself, got it?"
You are my life.
Let's go?
"You could have it all, my empire of dirt."
I will let you down.
I will make you hurt.
"I wear this crown of shit, upon my liar's chair."
"Full of broken thoughts, i cannot repair."
"Beneath the stain of time, the feeling disappears."
"And you are someone else,"
And I am still right here.
What have i become?
My sweetest friend.
"Everyone i know, goes away in the end."
"You could have it all, my empire of dirt."
I will let you down.
I will make you hurt.
"If i could start again, a million miles away."
I would keep myself.
I would find a way.
-One more try!
-One more try!
"-No, that didnt count!"
Thats...
"-Yeah, really..."
"Oh, we get a light, we got a ...."
Woo!
All right!
Awesome.
This way?
We can go this way...
Polaroid!
.
-Ready?
-OK!
I'm okay!
No need to be worry!
"I'd rather be the one who git hit, instead of you getting hurt!"
Do you know how afraid I was?
"How come you are still like a child, playing these?"
I haven't played them for a long time.
What a beautiful necklace!
I think I saw it somewhere.
It's nothing!
Get back!
"Xiamu, do you have a girlfriend?"
No!
Give it back to me!
- Tell me about her!
"- No, I swear!"
Give it back!
"Obviously you bought it for the girl you like, stop quibbling!"
I don't have any girlfriend!
Xiamu!
I... like you!
"Xiamu, it's only your sense of dependence."
I have been treating you like my brother.
Don't talk to me!
Keep it on your neck!
Ah...
Why are we here?
Surprise!
Are you?
It was joking!
Hello?
My dear!
Have you lunch yet?
We will manage any expense.
Please go on and make necessary arrangements.
- Sure.
What's wrong with you?
I know what I'm doing.
The way my son saw me before 10 years
The way he likes to see me.
That's exactly how I'm dressed up.
He will cry out asking if this is what he got his vision back for!
You are jealous.
He won't even be able to identify you.
Shall I stick a mustache?
Mom!
Mom!
- Sir.
Please sit.
It's a hospital.
- Where is my mom?
She will be here.
- Who are you?
Varun!
- Mom!
Where were you?
I have no clue.
What is happening?
Nothing.
You are in a hospital.
You met with an accident.
"Varun, please don't strain."
Be calm.
You were hit by a car while getting back from the restaurant.
How long have I been kept here?
"Franz, let us wear our old clothes and..."
- What else happened?
- Nothing!
Where did you first meet him?
On the streets?
"And I drive around, risking my life!"
You're a whore!
Leave me alone!
You whore!
I risk my life and work so hard!
Get out of my apartment!
Leave me alone!
Open the door!
It's my apartment!
Out!
Get out of here!
But I saved your life!
Get out!
Scoundrel!
Get out!
Out!
"Yes, she's so soft and faithful!"
I was on the verge of killing you.
Just like Ida.
I wanna be a decent man but it's so hard.
We just remain in the gutter.
"I'm going to drive to the countryside, I can't stand it here anymore."
"We still have a lot to do out there, in Weißensee."
Revenge.
Ede and Biberkopf gotta come along.
"- So, you're taking Franz with you?"
- Yes.
Kusuma.
I am sheik bin-Khalid's living son.
Only god will decide when I die.
"Now, put your gun away."
We have work to do.
You shouldn't be here.
Yeah.
"Well, you hung up on me."
I was... worried.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Hey.
Look at me.
You have to finish mixing the explosives.
Have you forgotten what these people did to you?
What they said about you with those other students?
Have you?
No.
"They destroyed your marriage, and now they're trying to destroy your career."
"No, no."
"Amira, please, stop."
Amira?
I knew you were lying to me.
"Oh, my god!"
He was the one you were texting?
"God, Amira."
You are sick!
You are a sick bastard!
I'm gonna tell everyone...
The door!
Lock the door!
If I catch even a whiff of you dog whistling these guys...
Yes.
Don't worry; the shorts won't fit him!
That's his problem!
So?
He's been following me!
Following you?
!
Don't worry!
I'll fix him!
Keep this...
Make a hole in this and have it.
Okay?
I'm secretary to Bhardwaj and Bhardwaj the name is Banwarilal Pandit.
Have you seen the woman?
Which woman?
The well-endowed one.
She was...
Are you talking about Laxmi?
You know her?
You are God-sent!
I am God-sent and I'll give you some of God's offerings now!
You tease women in our area!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Have you no womenfolk at home?
"How are you, Shantabai?"
Are they having a fight there?
Yes.
Which is why I've brought these coconuts for you.
Make a hole in this and have it.
I know that.
"But, aunt..."
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- Mamma wishes you to leave at once.
Excuse me.
Edward promised he would bring the atlas to Barton.
I'll wager he will do so in less than a fortnight.
Dear Edward...
Hello there!
Sir John...
Dear ladies!
Upon my word!
Here you are!
"- Sir John, your kindness..."
- None of that!
"Hush, please!"
"Here is my dear mamma-in-law, Mrs. Jennings."
You must be Mrs. Dashwood.
Was yourjourney tolerable?
Poor souls!
Why did you not come up to the park first?
- We saw you pass.
- I made John call the carriage.
- She would not wait.
- We have so little company.
I feel as though I know you already.
Delightful creatures!
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily.
- Dear Sir John.
We cannot...
No refusals!
I'm quite deaf to them.
But I insist!
Let us settle in.
Never a rumpus here.
Most orderly.
"It's that girl, lvy, that barmaid."
Pretty girls always cause trouble.
- I'd throw her out if I were you.
- What?
Lvy?
I can't do that to Ivy.
A great man can always change his mind for a reason.
"Yes, sir."
"Why, certainly, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"A troublemaker, that's what she is."
Out she goes.
"Yes, but now, while the evening is still young."
"- Yes, sir."
"Certainly, sir."
"- Yes, certainly."
What happened?
I've done nothing.
Just minding my own business.
"- That's my decision, my girl."
- Stop pushing!
- Don't hang about here.
- Who's hanging about?
- Go on.
Don't argue the point.
"- Oh, good riddance."
What's happened in there?
"- Is there some trouble, lvy?"
- Trouble?
"I was sacked, that's what!"
What's up with step one?
You've skipped step one and two.
What's step three again?
You ask me what's wrong!
Got it.
Good.
You bet.
Go ahead.
Where?
- Step three.
- What's step three again?
(EXHALES)
We'll skip step three.
I'm just going to tell you what's wrong.
That should have been step one.
Wrong.
Step one and two are fundamental steps.
"You missed steps, Stewart."
How?
"Step one, become angry with someone."
"Step two, tell that someone that you're angry."
"Step three, resolve anger with that someone."
- Step four...
- (SCOFFING) Step four.
"Step four, resume peaceful existence."
Your logic is frighteningly bewitching.
Phantasmagoric.
It's time for you to go.
What?
Where?
Leave here?
It was a rebound.
The ambulance is saying 15 to 20 minutes.
- I can take him.
- Caroline can take me.
"- No, I didn't drive."
- Then I'll wait.
You will not wait.
"Okay, you need to see a doctor."
- Tyler's driving.
End of story.
- Fine.
- Go.
- I'll bring my car around.
- I see you're packing.
That's a good sign.
- It won't be long now.
- Did you get the missing piece?
I am a fucking bastard.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Are you gonna come over and hit me?
you've been waiting your whole life.
I'm in a chair.
Come on and hit me.
I'm not going anywhere.
Come over here and hit me.
I'm in this chair.
Now's your chance.
So hit me.
I'm nothing fucking like you-- nothing.
I'm never gonna be like you.
I'm not that little boy anymore.
Can I ask you something?
what's up? just packing your bags just leave?

"The length looks great, it's beautiful."
I want it to be perfect.
He likes lace.
I'm not misinterpreting.
Your dad came in like he wanted to chop me off at the knees.
And I'm telling you that's not my dad.
I recognize him from the picture of everybody on the glacier.
- I'm serious.
- So am I. I act like I'm not in love with his daughter.
He's acting like he wants to challenge me to a duel over your mother.
- I don't understand.
- I do.
- He hates me.
- He doesn't hate you.
He hates me or he's crazy.
"No, he does not hate you."
He couldn't.
Then he's crazy.
Pam.
"Oh, hey, Ella."
Not everywhere.
Damn it.
I got nothing.
That's because it's not down here.
Shhh!
"Blair, give me the gun."
No.
Well then give Riley the gun.
My gun.
"Yeah, it's his gun."
"Now look, I'm making an executive decision here."
"We're gonna go after this sick fuck, and we're gonna take him out."
Are you fucking kidding me?
We just saw what he's capable of.
I'm not going after him with one bullet.
Blair.
I found something.
I bet you the jammer's down here.
No.
Ah.
"Mm-mmm, mm-mmm."
"Ah, that's right."
You're claustrophobic.
Fuck claustrophobia.
"Dude, you never ever go into a dark underground layer."
That's the smartest thing
I've ever heard you say.
Ever.
Stop insulting my crew.
I was complimenting him.

"If you believe this, whatever it is, and I don't bring it forward in this day and age..."
I'm not willing take that risk.
You've shitting me right?
I've known you too long.
Thank you.
There's a flight at 7.30 am.
"- You got a hotel here, right?"
- Yeah.
I'll pick you up first thing.
"We're gonna figure this out, Ray, you and me."
We're gonna gat all this squared away.
This ***.
Where I am?
"You are where you need to be, honey."
"You don't have to this, Chase."
This is the only way to ensure the project success.
What project?
What are you talking about?
What is he doing?
Chase?
It's ok.
Don't worry about what he's doing.
What is that?
What is he doing?
Marcus?

It's just an experiment.
But one I'm sure will work.

-Here's Report.
-It's Not necessary.
But it is the latest version.
"We have what we need, thanks."
Shall we proceed?
-Yes.

"Thus, it is so ..."
It's so disrespectful.
"Yes, it must have been a shock."
Where is Lars?
I need to call him.
"No, wait a minute."

PWG is the only card we have.

There's something wrong here.
This is wrong.
This is very wrong.
"This is very, very..."
Wrong?
This was no random mugging.
This was all about her.
He was after her.
He took her purse and some jewelry.
He wanted us to think robbery.
She was stabbed six times.
That's right.
Two in the neck.
Four in the back.
"Or, was stabbed three times."
Look at the pattern.
"It's two, two and two."
Three times.
With a pair of scissors.
Yes.
That's possible.
Who brings scissors to a mugging?
Scissors say what?
Spur of the moment.
Not planned.
Plus the mud on her shoes.
There's a mud puddle near the exit.
But there's a light right there.
"If she was walking, she would have seen that."
"So, she was running when she left the building."
Terminated.

I heard that Hybra Tech is sponsoring one of the monster trucks for the big rally next week.
Really?
I didn't know that.
I was wondering if you can score some tickets for me and Zeke?
Or not.
Becky!
Hi Julian!
Look out!
"Beck, are you alright?"
"Grap my bag, I'll get your bike."
How many bikes is it this month?
"I don't know, four?"
Hi Becky.
How are you doing?
"Oh, I am doing fine."
How are you?
Hi Guys!
Hi Katie.
Hi Baby.
What's wrong?
No kiss for the former-boyfriend?
You smell like farm wather.
"I got it, calm down."
I take it as he's not handling the break-up to well?
No.
Hi Guys!
Are you going to check out my gymnastics today?
"Oh yeah, bet you look real good bent over the bar."
Up your!
"Name the time, You got 4 more years to get a piece of this solid man."
What did he mean?
"""May I try a pirouette?"
"- Oh no!"""
"""How about a kiss?"
- Goodness!
"No!"""
"""Let me fly with the wind"""
"""God!"
"Help me"""
"""The chill in the breeze sets my body afire"""
"""I feel like..."""
"""making love to you"""
"""This never happened before"""
"""I've taken my first step"""
"""Let me fly with the wind"""
"""God!"
"Help me"""
"""May I have a jig?"
"- Oh no!"""
"""May I try a pirouette?"""
"- Oh no!"""
"""Give me a kiss?"
- Goodness!
"No!"""

"""Let me hold you in my eyes"""
"""Oh, I'm drunk"""
"""God!"
"Help me"""
"""May I have a jig?"
"I guess that would've been structural letdown, huh?"
You know this place?
Yeah. it's a fleabag hotel.
"They say that Bret Easton Ellis, he got drunk... and he threw up in a flag tree."

- He's a very good writer.
Just relax.
Thanks.
- I'll wait here for you.
- Thank you for your help.
Walt.
We're not done yet.
We gotta find Alex.
My whole first chapter hangs on that.
Go home and use your imagination for chapter one.
Hi.
Last time I was here I stayed in room 323.
Kind of a good luck thing.
It's available?
Nope.
But I got 305 across the hall.
That's fine.
Sign.
"Good evening, Mr. Dzasokhov."
"You're a very pretty girl, Alex."
You know that?
Thank you.
Will you do me a favor?
The band is too loud.
It's a birthday party.
Addons All gifts.
Addons The decision is yours.
If you want to keep a good boy.
I quit.
Addons
- Gwen.
- Yes.
Addons you recognize this?
"recently,youhavecompleted online tests, such as that."
"Yes, and?"
Addons This test is called:
"""What kind of lover are you?"""
Addons So ...
What kind of lover you are?
Yes ...
Let us know!
Addons
- Repeat the question.
"- No, that's good."
"I say that the test is the mistress, sadist."
I know.
That's why I was good.
But that stupid test.
I make time to go.
The test was wrong?
Is not it?
Well ...
"I'm not sadistic, implies that if."
"Your answer was given to Addons and results, but lying a few questions, right?"
I do not know ...
"I have not taken seriously, to be honest."
Addons This is a question to the 4 ...
Slut?
"""Kim""?"
You have her number programmed into your cell phone?
- Who is this dirty whore?
- I didn't sleep with her!
- Who is this fucking whore?
- I didn't sleep with her!
- No.
"But you wanted to, right?"
- No!
- Bullshit.
Is she prettier than me?
- No!
- Liar!
"- No, Jen!"
"What am I supposed to do now, huh?"
What the fuck am I supposed to do now?
You've ruined everything!
Will you listen to me?
Nothing happened!
Nothing?
You kissed her.
You were out with another woman all night.
I'm pregnant.
- Is that fucking nothing to you?
- Yes!
No!
How many times did you kiss her?
Don't you dare lie to me.
Several times.
"Oh, God, you make me sick!"
"But it didn't mean anything, baby."
Trying to get into shape.
Some other shape other than hot dog or igloo.
I can't think of nothing new.
"You know, there's more than just those two shapes?"
There is?
Let's try this one.
An octagon.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Like that Chuck Norris movie?
That ain't Chuck Norris.
And it's not an octagan either.
"Hey, do Octopussy."
Like this here?
That's what I'm talking about.
There you go.
You know what?
I gotta go take a dump.
I don't know.
All these shapes just freakin' hurtin' my kidneys.
Why can't people just like me for me?
"But sadly, no one does."
Not even the president.
"He's a great guy, though."
"If I don't come up with some new shapes,"
I'm gonna lose my damn job.
He says he don't need me.
I be the first to go.
I have an idea.
That will cost you $20 dollars.
What do you want?
Shake:
Get your car washed.
"- Come in, have a drink."
"- No, thanks."
I'm in a hurry.
You're always in a hurry!
"- Mrs Keka, a letter for you."
- Thank you.
Put it away.
It'll rain in the afternoon.
Thank you.
Mr. American!
Here it is.
From America.
"Good, good."
Do you save those things for me?
Of course I do.
I'll get to you.
"Tesla, turn it off."
What can I tell you?
He gets scared shitless when he hears this.
Pensions are finally safe!
- It really scared me.
"- Go on, have a drink."
"Tesla, I can understand your inventions, your ideas..."
"I support that, but..."
Can you tell me how many pension robberies we had here?
I've got no idea.
Of course you don't.
- Do you want me to tell you?
- Go ahead.
Not one!
Not a single robbery!
Who on earth would attack me here and steal the pensions?
Should I throw in two wreaths and wait for the Père Lachaise to open?
Coming?
Just a sec.
Time enough to waste this jerk first.
- Are you retarded or what?
- He touched Martine.
This rat is jinxed!
Here they come!
"I'm warning you, lying is my speciality."
You're not what's lying.
- What is?
- Poverty!
"If one lies, it's to get... one shouldn't ever get!"
"Here, it's okay."
"Jeez, my clog!"
We can't stay here!
- Do you have money?
- No!
"It's full of memories, this place."
I started when I was thirteen.
I never hurt.
I made supermen out of them.
"Don't worry, my tiptoes are always cold."
The ice queen doesn't want to die.
To sleep... to die... to kill... to make love...
Same battle.
What are you?
- Hatchet man?
Pocket knife?
- Pardon?
Friend of a friend?
Where did Mickey unearth you?
No.
Not as far as I know.
Why?
I don't know.
He's just weird.
He's my brother.
Don't worry.
He's just a half brother.
Then I just half embarrassed myself.
Mr. Pedro Paulo's office.
It's Sharon.
"Sharon, the intern."
"Hello, who is this?"
Since when do you have an intern?
Jealous?
Me?
Jealous?
Are you mad?
I'll be right with you.
Take a seat.
I just called to check something.
I'm filling out a questionnaire in a magazine.
Did you ever make number two in front of me?
What?
Number two.
"You know, in the bathroom."
Poop?
"No, of course not."
I knew it.
Thanks for clearing that up.
Good-bye.
Seven years of marriage... and we never made number two in front of one another.
I'm going up.
Are you OK on your own while I get you something to wear?
Will you tell Simon I'm here?
Of course.
Got your plastic tits yet?
No.
But I will get some as soon as I'm 18.
"- Hi, Patricia."
- Sofie's here.
She's crying.
She's crying again?
- Sofie.
"Are you OK, baby?"
- I just feel so low.
- Where have you been?
- Sleeping in the park.
- Why didn't you go down to the boat?
- You can't help me.
- Of course I can.
- What's up?
- My mum.
- She'll calm down again.
She's thrown you out.
Tell the bitch I did the right thing.
- It's dead embarrassing for me.
- What the hell is going on?
"Morning, girls."
Is something wrong?
- What's this?
- Check out the centre spread.
"- No, thank you."
- You've got to see it.
"People, please."
We had a total of 76 cards that came out of the deck.
Twenty-three were high cards with a value of minus one.
"Seventeen were neutral with no value at all, and the rest were low cards with a value of plus one."
- How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.
The count.
It's plus 13.
Yes.
Pull up a chair.
Stop.
- What is it?
- Plus 12.
Eggs.
Twelve eggs in a carton.
- Now what?
- Plus 9.
Cats have nine lives.
Cat.
Sweet 16.
Every card had a value.
"A high card, minus one."
"A low card, plus one."
"The rest, zero."
Plus 13.
Plus 8.
Plus 9.
Plus 12.
"I was studying all day, every day."
"But it wasn't physics, chemistry and engineering."
"I was back to simple math, used in ways I could never have imagined."
The team had a system.
You'll never have to do another one...
Promise?
Promise!
Promise!
Promise!
Yeah!
Don't throw my beer!
Don't throw my beer!
Can you say...
lawsuit?
"Ready, number 4..."
Ready?
I'm just caught up in another of her spells.
"Well, she's turning me into someone else."
Everyday i hope and pray this will end.
"But when I can, I do it all again."
And if she says:
"come inside, i'll come inside for her."
And if she says:
"give it all, i'll give everything to her."
I am justified.
I am purified.
"I am sanctified, inside you..."
I am justified.
I am purified.
I am sanctified.
inside you...
Are you ready ?
Yeah...
Yeah...
This is the first day of my last days.
"I built it up, now i take it apart."
Okay.
Okay.
Stop laughing!
Bella?
"Okay,okay,okay."
Holy cow.
Okay.
"God,be careful!"
What was the plan here?
"You know,to show Augie that he's an idiot."
"I figured he'd see some hair,come on to me, and then,you know..."
I take advice from you?
Hey.
Good morning.
Did I wake you?
No.
"No,I..."
I thought you were gone.
I was gonna make you some breakfast.
Come back to bed.
Come here.
Are you okay?
I'm in bed with the girl of my dreams.
Why wouldn't I be okay?
I'm so glad we talked yesterday.
"I was really overwhelmed and ready to bolt, and you were just so cool and understanding."
I don't want to make the same mistakes I made last time.
You know...
"I think that I am going to have to write,like, a couple million songs about you."
"Oh,yeah?"
Is that okay?
"Or do you need me to,like,taper back?"
Likewise!
"Come on, boy!"
Come on!
Schnapps?
"Well, Sam, here's to your very good health."
- Skoal.
- Prosit.
"You know, that's a lot of money that fellow offered you for your dog."
Yeah?
That's a lot of dog too.
Ja!
"- Hey, boss, let's head for the hotel, huh?"
"- No, no, no, not yet."
Maybe somebody we know will show.
Ole!
Ha-ha!
How are you?
I got lots trouble.
"Nowhere I can get two dogs, cheap."
"What matter, huh?"
I got load of thousand-pound flour...
I got to get over to 40-Mile Creek.
"Two of my dogs, they die."
It's too big load for the other four dogs to pull.
"Quiet, now!"
Yo!
"That's one fine dog, mister!"
"You want to sell, maybe?"
"- No, I don't."
- I'll say he don't!
"You know, that fellow back there... just offered him 1,000 bucks."
- One thousand bucks?
Good to know.
- Where's Jackson?
- Change of shift.
"Come back for more, have you, tough guy?"
"Oh, you're looking a whole lot worse than I am."
Whatever.
Where are you going?
Tequila and tacos.
You want?
"Come back inside, we need to talk."
- I'm done talking.
- Let's head inside.
"Ah, shit."
Seriously?
Okay.
I get it.
"Jackson's hatchet, man."
Come on.
"Here I am, do it."
"Go back inside the house,"
"I'll grab my service weapon, tell Jackson I made a move on you."
He doesn't have to know.
"I'll take it from here, Agent Briggs."
Let's take a drive.
She's beautiful.
"I envy you, your emotional responses to things, I..."
I train myself out of it.
But there has been a cost.
"Well, maybe you should stop with the daddy routine."
Let people figure it out themselves.
"You're right, Flynn."
I can't fix you.
Really nice name.
Thank you.
- Ozone Overseas.
It's a small company.
Maybe you have heard the name.
Your style of calling a big company small..
..and thus calling yourself big is great.
"You are late, Mr. Bajaj."
Umbrella Creations' conference is over.
It doesn't make any difference.
He is a victim of overconfidence.
He thinks he is going to get Umbrella Creations' order.
"Continue dreaming, Mr. Bajaj."
This time we will get the order.
Okay.
"Anyway, see you."
- Sure.
All the best.
See you.
- Bye.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
'Because she loves sex as much as I do.
Okay?
'
"'Sex is just an activity to you, isn't it?"
'
Let's utilize our Sunday.
Let's rearrange the furniture.
Actually.
"Come on, Gul."
Let's do it.
I thought that was you.
"It's you, right?"
Yeah.
I guess it is.
Yeah.
Natalie Teeger.
"Oh, my God."
I hate to bother you.
Would you mind?
We really do have to...
"Oh, sure."
We should head up.
"Mr. Monk, do you mind?"
The Captain probably...
Mr. Monk?
Bend.
Bend a little.
"Bend, please."
Bend.
I never know what to say.
I know what to say.
Did I write those letters?
Of course I wrote the letters.
My name is on them.
I'm not going to deny that.
Did you bother reading them?
"Yes, sir, I have."
"Well, then, you know I didn't threaten anybody."
I offered the producers and the lottery commissioners some constructive criticism.
I don't know why they don't listen to me.
I know more about this lottery system than any living American.
"I'm sure you do, Mr. O'Dwyer."
"Hi, Christo."
Manou's resting in her room.
I'll tell her you're here.
Let her rest.
She OK?
Just OK.
Still after that van gang?
Still am.
I hear they hit again.
"Near the beltway, right?"
My only advice is:
"when you bust 'em, shoot first!"
You know anything?
I'm not a snitch.
Ask your questions elsewhere.
Who worked over Manou?
What do you mean?
Leo...
"I'm 46, I spent 1 8 years in jail."
She's the best thing that happened to me.
"Someone hurt her, I gotta know."
"If I tell you, what'll you do?"
That's up to me.
You're in trouble any time you step out of here!
"You're a hood, Christo."
With a record for armed robbery.
"If you smack your neighbor over a trifle, you go back to jail!"
Manou needs you:
"if you go down, so does she."
Screw your cop morality.
"Anyway, it's settled."
I dealt with it.
That must have been cute as hell.
"But yeah, she lost the lisp."
"She grew into a beautiful, smart woman."
"Look, I know what Audrey did to you."
"And as far as I can see, right now, this is your chance to get back at her."
Ahem.
Didn't you say you were gonna buy me a drink?
- Is she in?
- Of course she's in.
You got to pay her tab.
Pay the tab.
Son of a bitch.
"All right, so when we get the money and I put it in the safe, I'll let you call Audrey,"
- and you can be the hero.
"- Yeah, absolutely not."
"You're not coming with me, and I'm not giving you the money."
Raven.
"Raven, it's okay."
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
It's okay.
"You sure you're okay, Mia?"
Of course.
A little fall never hurt anyone.
"Uh, what's her name?"
The girl with the wild horse.
Her name is Zoe.
And she's our friend.
"Let's go, let's go."
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.
- He's been causing me a lot oftrouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.
- Don't bother.
- No need.
- Please be careful.
"- Take care,Jenny."
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.
"Jeffrey, take care ofyour friend, meanwhile."
"Make yourselfat home, Dumbo."
"I am, Mickey Mouse."
"Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage?"
He paid me a thousand bucks to keep you talking.
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am I?
Lets wait and see.
You're always the loser.
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.
Let's put your preparations to the test.
- Are you always so determined?
"- Yes, that's my style."
Mine too.
So we have something in common.
Is that what you think?
Definitely.
That means... we pretend that we've done nothing for two weeks.
"Put him on, I want to talk to him... I want to talk to him..."
At least give him my message.
I simply can't do that.
No.
Why do they want the material?
"No, answer me."
Why do they want the material?
We don't want to use it as a pillow.
"Yes... ln any case, that's impossible."
Yes... lt sounds as if we're guilty!
I'll contact him myself.
I'll call...
Good-bye.
"Hello, are you well?"
"- Yes, thank you."
- What do you want?
Can I have a word with Farzad?
Sohrabi?
Yes.
He's sitting an exam.
I know. lt won't take a minute.
Please call him for me.
Sohrabi!
You're wanted.
Are you well?
Yes.
Are you sitting an exam?
Yes.
is there a question that you can't answer?
"No, I know them all."
I want to apologise about this morning.
When he was high.
That went on for about 3 or 4 years.
Until one day he strangled me.
And I'd had enough.
I told him he should let me go.
I'd come right back.
"I put my daughter to bed, left her room and stabbed him with a knife."
Six.
Seven.
Ow!
Twelve.
- Come now.
"- Thank you, Master Walter."
Good girl.
It's not even warm yet.
And then I met Marcel.
He was the first man.
I got into SM with.
"He showed me all kinds of things, candle wax and everything."
Until alcohol also came into play.
When he was drunk he had no taboos.
"He tortured me to the extreme with needles, whips, you name it."
Until I ran away covered in blood.
I was in hospital.
laid charges against him.
He got 4 years.
Which he had to serve.
And that was that.
One.
- Two.
- A children's toy.
"From Toys ""R"" Us."
That's not true.
I'm not going to have a child until there's peace in the world.
You just confuse me when you make declarations like that out of the blue.
"OK, I take it back."
I'll put it this way:
"Until the world becomes a peaceful place,"
"I'll be dancing alone, waiting all by myself."
How's that?
"Sounds like something out of a religion called ""dance""."
Good morning.
Thank you.
You're early.
"Yes, yes."
Just a moment.
"Tomoko-san, the phone is for you."
OK.
Excuse me.
"Hello, hello, this is Tomoko."
Yes.
Yes.
Alright.
"I'm sorry, but may I go out for a bit."
"Yes, certainly."
Sorry about this.
Tomoko.
Yes?
"Things are difficult for you, aren't they."
I'm certain about that.
I can tell.
"Yes, there is."
I'll tell you later.
"Pick a good time, but let's talk soon, OK?"
And for dinner.
Your secret room rocked my world.
"Yeah, it did."
But I am gonna give you a deadline.
A deadline?
For our date...
A real date.
It's got to happen tonight.
You get dressed up.
So do I.
"I pick you up... not here, but at your apartment."
"Where is that, by the way?"
"- Oh, it's not far... at all."
"- Okay, good."
And we'll go to my favorite restaurant.
"And afterwards, I show you my place."
Mm.
I-I need a little bit more advance notice.
"How... how about the last Saturday of this month,"
- 'cause tonight I have this...
- Cancel it.
"Look, if you don't do this for me, I..."
I don't know.
"Because your life is here, but... mine is not."
I got it.
You're right.
- I'll meet you by the elevators.
- Mm-hmm.
6:00 P.M.?
And if you aren't there...
I won't be back again.
Mother.
We were doing so well.
She never even got to see my penis.
Ta-da!
Who wants some more coffee?
"Thanks, yeah."
Sure.
Let me help you.
Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
"""Gals""?"
"Who are you, Fred Flintstone?"
This trip to India sounds fun.
"Yeah, I think it will be."
Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
A little.
They're very old-fashioned.
"Well, I wouldn't worry about it."
"It's not like you guys are getting engaged, right?"
"Oh, God, no."
We're not there yet.
Not engaged.
Very interesting.
I have to tinkle.
You've been in there a lot tonight.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Are you writing a book?
Why are you getting upset?
I'm not upset.
Maybe you're upset.
What's up with you?
Bernadette?
I can't do this anymore!
He must be someone famous.
Stand back.
I'm going to jump.
"Go ahead, you first."
Rm lumping now.
Go ahead.
I'll wait for my turn.
I'm jumping because nobody loves me.
Nobody loves me either.
I'll get the fireworks going and jump into the garbage can.
How could anyone love someone in this world?
I'm the least loved person in this world.
Me too.
Marjukka doesn't love either of us.
-No.
Let's count to three.
One...
You could've made a good father for me but Mom's too difficult.
Three.
You skipped two.
I'm sorry.
I'll try again.
One...
Two...
I knew you'd chicken out.
There's an ostrich down there.
-What?
Look...
Let's make sure there are no feathers on the scooter.
Then we're out of here.
Do you really think that ostriches would like it here?
It's gotta be around here...
Can't stand it!
Can't stand it!
Why are they treating this car like it's a hotel?
What's wrong?
Why did you suddenly stop?
It's no fun.
Okay.
I can get out.
What are you doing?
Are you teasing me?
What's the matter?
Did something happen?
Just restrain yourself for another 2 minutes.
We will be arriving at the hotel in 2 minutes.
"Hey, who do you think you are?"
"If I say I can't help it, what will you do?"
Hey?
!
"Even if I am prepared to be understanding,"
"I just can't stand you people, I can't drive you anymore."
I'm not driving!
I quit!
I quit!
Hey!
Drive.
I'm not driving.
I quit.
You!
We originally agreed that I will get 20 000 Won for driving you there.
Just give me 10 000 won.
What?
"I've worked, so you need to at least pay right?"
You must have dropped it.
Thank you.
Is everything there?
Yes.
I didn't touch anything.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
Home.
May I walk you there?
I've got nothing to do.
"Yes, but I'm going home."
"Yes, of course."
Good.
I couldn't live without dancing.
And I love watching it.
Do you like dancing?
I guess so.
"Well, yes."
But I've never gone to see anything.
"What else do you do, besides dancing?"
"I love traveling, and I go to the Cinematheque a lot to see films."
Recently I've discovered silent cinema.
It's my favorite.
Silent cinema?
Yes.
What do you do when you go out?
I don't go out.
You must go out sometime.
"I was looking after my mother, but she died two months ago."
I'm sorry.
"My mother died too, but a long time ago."
"Well, we're here."
"One call to Dale, we're back on track."
Absolutely!
Let's do it.
What is wrong with you?
He threatened us.
Just remember that.
- It is extortion.
- Does that mean he's gotta be dead?
- We're not giving him our money.
- What money?
That worthless scrap of shit?
"Yeah, okay."
"Maybe it's time for your friend, the drug-addicted carpet installer."
"- Oh, Scatter."
- Scatter!
Yeah!
He could help.
This is killing me.
I have slept five hours this whole week.
"- Oh, God, here we go."
- I have dandruff with big flakes.
I've gained two pounds!
Listen to my voice.
I'm losing my instrument.
Shouting isn't helping.
"- [Woman] Hey, Gig?"
- Yeah?
There's a couple of cops in the club asking for you.
- I'll be right in.
"- Oh, great!"
Cops in the club.
I've always wanted to give an inmate fame.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
I can't believe you guys are both here again.
Neither can I.
I can't believe it even more.
"Uh, I thought we agreed Lana was off limits."
"No, I wasn't there for Lana."
"Okay, I care about Noel."
Noah.
His name is Noah.
"It is, right?"
Wait.
Now Noah sounds wrong.
Wait.
"Why are you scolding me, man?"
You were the one bringing her flowers.
They were for norm.
Noel.
Man...
"All right, look, look."
We're both wrong.
"Hitting on Lana is a total violation of several commandments, many edicts, and at least one mores."
Or hang on.
I'm about to blow your mind.
It's only bad if we like the dude.
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, I'm listening."
"Yeah, this guy owes me eight bucks!"
You know what?
He does not return phone calls promptly!
Let me ask you this.
What if he's a racist?
boss?
- You know the drill.
- Pick up my goddamn hat.
Get the hell out of here.
boss?
- Fuck off.
Go!
You've had training.
Some.
don't wake her yet.
Let her sleep another hour.
Logan... without a doubt the most perfect night I've had in a very long time.
But I don't deserve it.
Do I?
I did something.
Something unspeakable.
I've remembered what happened in Westchester.
This is not the first time I've hurt people.
I didn't know.
You wouldn't tell me.
So we just kept on running away from it.
I think I finally understand you.
Logan...
He's fantastic.
You said you only needed the girl!
I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear.
Your friends had every chance.
And so did you.
Nate?
Put her down.
Honey.
Will!
She could be fucking him right now.
She could be fucking him in Ojai or in a fucking sailboat for all I know.
I appreciate your candor.
I'm both embarrassed and illuminated.
You did nice work today.
Are you gonna be with us tomorrow?
- Every day.
- Indeed.
"Yeah, have you seen Ryan today?"
"Um, he's with his dad dealing with some heavy shit."
"But it's not about you, so don't sweat it."
I don't.
Goddamn right you don't.
Alicia Mendez sweats no man.
- [Chuckles]
"- Yes, ma'am."
[Music playing]
Alvey:
Nate!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Hey, what are you doing?"
Sparring with Juan.
"No, no, you're..."
"No, no, you're not."
Come here.
I said no sparring until your head's right.
I'm fine.
You're not fine.
You're not fine.
You're not cleared.
"You're not fucking training until you are, okay?"
Done.
Why would he fight back for that bit of money?
"Regardless it is a robbery or murder,"
I want to find the guy who did it.
Sawadee Club
"Mr. Lin, this way please."
Enjoy your dinner here.
All these for the two of us?
All your brother's favourites.
"David, simple meals will do next time."
Don't waste food.
Yes.
Hi!
Lincoln.
Remember me?
This is Roger and Mr. Law.
Hi!
We met before.
Your brother introduced us last time.
I must have been drunk and left early.
Pity your brother has passed away.
We missed him.
Our condolences.
Thank you!
We're having boating party next week.
You brother will never miss it.
You must join us.
"Let's have fun, okay?"
I'll check my schedule and see.
Alright.
See you.
"I'll see you out, Mr. Law."
Why bother?
"We'll go at eight bells, same as before."
"Now, Morrison, get up on deck and warn everyone you meet."
"Wagstaffe, go and tell Dawlish."
You?
Get up aloft.
This time let's hear you cheer.
- Who's on watch?
- Ponsonby.
Where's Scott-Padget?
Where is he?
"All officers confined to their quarters, under guard by Marines."
Listen to me.
I'm warning you.
"You use that knife, and you're a dead man."
"All right, lads."
No rushing on deck.
And wait for the cheer.
"Now, take some more, sir."
You'll stand better what I've got to do.
"Now, get ready."
"Now, grab him."
Look lively!
Put your backs into it!
"All right, you."
Start on number four gun.
Hip-hip-hooray!
What's happening there?
- Leave me alone.
- Shut your mouth.
"Don't move, sir!"
"- This means your death, Vizard."
- Take him below.
- Better than tits you'll ever get mate!
"All right, I'd spunk over the big ones, and they're not better than I'd get."
Bollocks.
"Here, Steve..."
- Speccy here... reckons he has better!
- Stop that.
- I have.
"- Fuck off, you're a virgin!"
- Classic virgin.
- You're wrong.
I did it last year.
With a girl I'm seeing tonight.
"Yeah, sure."
Yep!
"She's fit, she's older than me, and she goes like a porn star."
"- Oh, right!"
"- Yeah, and she's got massive titties and I..."
"Well, I... fucked her hard and all night long."
What are you and this dirty horn bucket up to this weekend then?
I might come and check her out.
"Going to an under-18 disco where she works, so you won't be able to."
I could go.
- What?
- I could go.
I'm 17.
You're 17!
?
- You're 17?
"- Yeah, yeah"
- I just look older.
There's looking older and then there's that.
You look about 30!
"Hey, man."
"It's all good, right?"
"Look, you get a little money in your pocket."
Nothing wrong with that.
"Just for now, right?"
Plus it's always good to have a roommate that can pay his half of the rent.
"Hey, what do you say you and me head down to the rec center?"
Got a pick-up rugby game going on.
"Then afterwards, maybe go get me some ribs, some corn."
Some hot chicks.
Maybe she got a friend for you.
But one of them ugly ones.
"Buck-toothed and, you know, just got the fangs."
"Got the fangs happening, huh?"
Know what?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Just give me a couple minutes to change and then we'll head on out.
"Oh, dinner's on you tonight."
You still owe me...
"I think, what is it, $19.40?"
"Oh, you're serious about that?"
So...
Yeah.
Dinner and girls.
Both on you tonight.
"No, the girls will be on me."
I...
We'd been here all night.
"June's mixed up, he's getting old, he don't see very well."
Lying son of a bitch!
I'll make him talk.
He's not gonna talk.
It's his sister.
Can I speak to the boy?
"How are you this morning, Byron?"
Just fine.
Pretty sleepy?
"Yeah, I guess so."
Did you go stay someplace with your uncle Ronnie last night?
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
"You didn't see a lady, a pretty lady?"
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
Did your uncle Ronnie tell you to say that?
Yeah.
So this has just been pretend?
Yeah.
What do you say we stop playing pretend and play really?
Okay.
"And I think you really ought to spend a night or two in jail, so you don't tell your sister."
Dale...
You got to let me go.
"I can't do that, Lila."
You can't let them put me in jail.
"What's going to happen to our baby, with me in jail?"
Your mom will keep taking care of him.
-See you later.
I'm going to have to rent a tuxedo.
Rent a tuxedo!
"Oh, there's got to be a peasant in every outfit."
"He's never changed, has he?"
"Good old... ""Rent a tuxedo."""
"That's laughable, isn't it?"
(chuckles)
Take care.
I'll see you later.
(chuckling):
"""Rent a tuxedo."""
Who do I call about renting a tuxedo?
(phone ringing)
Hello.
Sergeant...
"uh, Mr. Bilko's room."
Long distance where?
"Roseville, Kansas?"
Fort Baxter?
"Tell them I'm not, uh..."
"All right, put them on."
"Hey, Sarge, we just called to see how you're doing."
"Hey, did you see your old squad yet?"
"Hey, what did they say when they seen you with all them stripes?"
"A master sergeant, huh?"
"They really flipped, huh?"
"Hey, wait a minute."
Henshaw wants to say hello.
"Hey, I was next!"
"By rank, Doberman."
By rank.
Saira!
You have five minutes.
Leave before this cigarette gets over.
I cannot leave.
What story will I tell our kids?
That papa got scared so he ran away?
I forgot!
This story has an armour too!
No..
No..
No..
No..
No..!
"Come on, leave this world."
'A stormy sky...'
'A ferocious moon...'
"It's time, Jilaan."
Stop it!
No!
No!
'If they do not make it through the ocean of fire...'
'One last breath would forever remain a desire.'
"Bodies meet, bodies perish."
"Souls meet, they together forever flourish."
Shiv!
Shiv!
Okay.
If you wouldn't have come for me...
Then what stories would you tell our kids?
Prayer.
Listen carefully.
Your mom might sometimes say that you were Karan-Arjun in your past life.
- If she hurt you...
"- No, no."
She... she didn't lay a hand on me.
"I'm fine, really, I'm just..."
I'm just tired.
Whose body am I in?
You've seen Liana.
"That's what happened to your face, isn't it?"
"Dad, tell me the truth."
"Where did this, me, come from?"
I need to know.
Musa sent you to us from a breeding camp.
"Your mother found you a human skin, even though I knew what it meant... an innocent."
Did it have a name?
The baby?
Allison.
"From the day you became Allison,"
I vowed to protect you with my life.
But...
I failed you.
No.
Yes.
We should have left.
Gone on the run.
"I'm so, so sorry."
"Dad, don't."
You did everything you could to protect me.
I always will.
I don't know what you're saying.
I'm saying that I love you.
"As long as I'm alive, you're in danger."
- They'll use us against each other.
"- No no no, not yet."
Don't you just love the city at night?
I wish I was one of those insomniacs.
I could live my whole life at night.
"Well, except I'd probably get rickets or something."
- Try a doughnut?
"- No, I'm alright, thanks."
Where is she?
In there.
So what's the story then?
"Just look after her, make sure she's OK."
Help her settle in.
- Be kind.
"- Yeah, good."
Ready?
Brit!
"No, I should check it."
Let me guess: work?
What?
We have finally finally traced the mobile of the victim from the scene where we found your friend's DNA.
Her name's Annie Green.
"For the best bit, it's turned on."
- You saying we track it?
- Already on it.
Alright.
I have to go.
"Momma, my sister, I have to go."
- Go.
- I'll see you later.
- I'll come back.
- Go.
Chopper is on the way there now.
There doesn't seem to be any problems with his eye.
Just a cut on his lower eyelid.
The match can't continue.
It's fine.
Stop joking.
Captain Tezuka is worried too.
I want to play.
Ten minutes.
"If you don't win in ten minutes, I'll substitute you."
Tezuka.
Alright?
No problem.
Sorry for the wait.
Still playing on?
"Just a little cut, no reason to make a big fuss."
That guy's left-handed.
No way.
You'd better admit defeat.
Nitouryu.
Note:
This name refers to Ryoma's ambidexterity.
Seigaku Tennis Team.
Congratulations on your victory.
Thank you.
Players of the tennis club.
"Today, my idiot son lost his game sorry to bring you guys trouble."
It's okay we won in the end.
- It's my treat today.
- Thanks.
"Eat, eat."
"- Everyone, let's toast."
- Okay.
Thank you.
- Is everything there?
- Yes.
- I didn't touch anything.
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
May I walk you there?
I've got nothing to do.
"- Yes, but I'm going home."
"- Yes, of course."
Good.
I couldn't live without dancing.
And I love watching it.
- Do you like dancing?
- I guess so.
"Well, yes."
But I've never gone to see anything.
"What else do you do, besides dancing?"
"I love traveling, and I go to the Cinematheque a lot to see films."

It's my favorite.
- Silent cinema?
- Yes.
- What do you do when you go out?
- I don't go out.
You must go out sometime.
"I was looking after my mother, but she died two months ago."
I'm sorry.
"My mother died too, but a long time ago."
"Well, we're here."
Thanks for the wallet.
Wow!
You know what I think?
I don't think you're gonna do a fucking thing...
"I think you're just gonna stand there, like the little girl you are..."
And I'm gonna grab that stick...
and ram it right up your ass...
And then...?
You're goin' swimming.
hey hey quickly
Dude....
Zoric is over there checking us out let it go...
We'll beat his little ass later...
Give me the stick...
Give me the stick...
Holy shit!
Are you fucking crazy!
?
Hey!
Okay.
"Please, move back."
move back
"Give me one reason I shouldn't suspend you, Owen..."
Can you think of one?
Don't you know what could've happened...?
You seem like a smart kid.
I just don't want to see you going down the wrong path...
He's a good boy... he really is...
Hello...?
Is John there...?
Excuse me...?
This is his wife who's this...?
"hello, Cindy..."
I always loved watching him sleep.
I take it you're setting out for Candor in the morning?
Yeah.
"Listen, I only want what's best for him."
You hardly even know him.
"You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?"
"But deep down, I think you're scared"
I know him all too well.
I'm not scared.
Of course you are.
You're scared he'll finally see you for what you really are.
Deadly.
You don't believe me?
Ask him.
(PANTING)
FOUR:
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What?
To Candor.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What are you talking about?
What's your plan?
You guys are gonna find the rest of Dauntless.
Then what?
"You attack Erudite, assassinate Jeanine, start a civil war?"
"I'm sorry, I'm just not..."
I'm not cut out for that.
I'm not like you guys.
"Oh no, don't shoot!"
I hate violence!
I'm here to tell you a secret!
Put your pistol away!
What secret?
Get it out!
"Alright, but I have one condition!"
What condition?
I want Yoyo to kiss me once.
Supermac 99!
I order you to kiss her.
"Lucky you, kiddo!"
"In the name of our country, kiss her!"
Go on!
- You have to close your eyes!
- O.K.!
"Hey, wake up. lt's done!"
Japan cabled today.
Hiroshima only has a phoney Formula.
You have the real one!
We all know that!
That's why the other secret is even more important!
What other secret?
"I'll tell, but I have to kiss Yoyo this time."
What a pity!
Serves you right!
"Alright, but you have to close your eyes again!"
Sure thing!
My first kiss!
"Don't faint, wake up!"
"Now, what's the secret?"
My father Fat Pig is coming with his troops to get you.
- Fuck!
Watch out for cheetahs!
This is cheetah turf.
- What?
- OK.
Fuck.
We hit ocean.
What do we do now?
All right.
"Hey, look, look!"
Excuse me.
You guys going to America?
"Sí, vamos."
"Yes, we're going."
Thank you.
- Es mío.
"- Vamos, vamos."
"I'm telling you, Jorge... the first thing you have to do when you get to America... buy a device called TiVo, OK?"
Freedom means nothing if you're a slave to regular programming...
I promise you that.
"And now, how about you focus?"
We gotta figure out what to do when we get to the States.
We don't have wallets.
We don't have any ID.
We've got nothing.
"Well, I figure we're gonna land somewhere around Miami, right?"
There's only one guy we know who lives down there.
- Who do we know that--Raza.
- Yeah.
We gotta go see Raza.
- Adiós.
- Hasta luego.
We're having a dress rehearsal Monday afternoon.
- The scenery must be there.
- I doubt if we can finish it.
That gives us only three days.
You've got to finish it!
The show opens Monday night.
"- Oh, alright."
- Fine.
Here you are.
"Now remember, we must have the costumes Monday morning."
[snaps]
- What about those amber spots?
- 'Right away.'
They should be on when the curtains come through.
Do you realize we open tonight?
- What's next?
- The Bill Robinson number.
Off with the footlights.
"Johnny, take your curtain cue from the music."
Alright shoot.
Ready!
Take it away.
[fast-paced music]
[music continues]
[fast-paced music]
[peppy music]
[knocking]
Come in.
"What's the matter, honey?"
What are you crying about?
Tell the man.
"I can't pay my rent, Mr. Mayor."
You won't?
You really won't do as I say?
Director Kim.
Director Kim!
Director Kim!
"Director Kim, get back here, right now!"
"Director Kim, come here now!"
I'm not going to let this one go.
I'm serious.
I can't stand it when a person mistreats another.
Can't stand it?
So what?
"I still like you, even if you've done wrong."
I respect you as a director.
"Now, go and apologize."
I'm serious.
Go say you're sorry.
That's the right thing to do.
You apologize if you like.
Why should I?
Because you treated him like dirt!
You really won't apologize?
"If you don't, I'm going back to Seoul."
You won't?
"Okay, I'm leaving."
Let's go!
Seriously?
Back to Seoul?
What's gotten into you?
"Alright, I did wrong."
Let's stop this!
"No, you have to go and apologize."
What do you mean?
Let me free.
No way.
The law is right.
Come on.
Why are you being so stubborn?
Law is dead.
But we are alive.
Why don't you be a little more sensible.
"Come on, look."
"I'll give you $10,000, you can do as you want."
"Eh, well then?"
Officer Jeng?
I refuse!
You keep quiet.
You want me to charge you with bribery?
What?
"Well, bribery would just make one more charge."
It won't make much difference.
Huh.
"I wanna ask you, did you come from Wayne County?"
Huh?
(Laughing)
"I've been around, in all parts of this area."
But not as far as a county of Wayne.
"You were an accountant, that right?"
"Me, accountant?"
"Can't make a good living these days, don't you agree?"
One thing.
"Was your name Lun Taichen, and did you know Cheng Tachwan?"
Cheng Tachwan?
Cheng Tachwan?
That was your first lie.
It's inevitable.
"You're gonna get old, Stefan won't."
Forever doesn't last very long when you're human.
"I'm sorry, but I don't have what you're looking for."
Sit down.
And tell your boyfriend to walk away.
- I want the invention.
- I don't have it.
I know that.
But Damon does.
- And you're gonna get it for me.
- He's not gonna give it to me.
Then the blood will be on your hands.
"It was nice meeting you, Elena."
"Hey, Anna."
"Uh, where are you?"
What's up?
Uh...
Give me a call when you get this.
How is Anna?
I like that girl.
She has fire.
"Uh, I don't know."
- She won't return my calls.
- Girl trouble?
"No, no trouble."
"Anna just owes me a call, that's it."
Is that the girl that I saw you with at the Founder's Pageant?
"So you two are getting pretty hot and heavy, huh?"
When was the last time you saw her?
- Why?
- Faiz!
Sheen!
Sheen!
Are you fine?
What have you done?
Jumped from the vehicle?
What if something happened?
Nothing will happen to me.
I thought I would be separated from you.
I could never bear that separation.
And I jumped!
"Tell me brother, do you need some help?"
"Can we get a place to stay, somewhere?"
A place to stay?
It's some distance from here.
It's difficult to find transport here.
"Sit on my bike, I shall leave you there."
I am going that way.
Okay?
- Okay?
- Come on!
"- Okay, come!"
"Go inside, there is place to stay here."
Okay!
Thanks!
Hello!
Is anybody there?
- Sheen!
- Look how beautiful it is.
But there is no one here!
Can't find anyone.
Let's look inside.
"I mean, you're supposed to wait a little while, make sure you're ready."
Uh...we should go.
"Lulu, Alvin wanted me to tell you he's gone to the track."
"Hey, do you have a second?"
Yeah. I'll be right there.
I think that Alvin's trying to get me to fire him.
Do it.
[sighs]
- Are you busy with that case?
- Yeah.
"Well, I heard that woman died when you were there."
"I mean, I didn't think about your mother."
That's not important.
- l should've thought about it.
- l'm fine.
"Well, I'm sorry, Nick, to have to send you there."
Thank you.
Ready?
"One, two, three."
"One, two, three."
"One, two, three."
One--and make a little turn.
And that turns into a box step.
- Hi.
- Hey.
"No, don't stop."
"That was excellent, sweetheart."
She's learning the fo_rot as well.
"Oh, great, great."
"So, you want to-- you want to dance?"
- Burton.
- No?
Hello?
"Look, you tell me, and I'll tell her."
Even the phones don't work.
"Your sister says you've had an offer of £87,000 for your house in Brighton."
"87,000?"
Give it to me.
"Don't be a fool, Stephanie."
"92,750 I said, and I'm not taking a penny less."
You tell him that.
Why don't people listen?
Well?
"Well, let's scrub that 32p then, shall we?"
Let's enjoy ourselves.
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Oh, Major!"
Major!
"Um, can I have it now?"
"- What, old boy?"
- The money.
The money I gave you last night?
What... what is all this about?
You remember I gave you some money just before you went to that remembrance service?
- Remembrance service?
- Yes.
"I don't remember that, old boy."
It was for a chap you didn't like.
"You know, he was..."
one of those...?
One of those what?
Well...
Pansy?
Yes.
"No, it's not."
So now you're gonna be a gentleman?
(WHISPERING) Giants can smell blood.
And I'm always a gentleman.
(CORK POPS)
(CORK THUDS)
(GASPING) Ah!
What the hell is that?
It's rum.
Bloody waste of it.
(EMMA PANTING)
Here's the plan.
We wait for the giant to fall asleep.
"When he does, we'll sneak past him into his cave."
That's where the treasures are.
Where the compass lies.
And then?
And then we run like hell.
I don't have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep.
"The powder Mulan gave us, we need to use it."
We've gotta knock him out.
That's riskier.
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to?
Point taken.
"Ooh, you're a tough lass."
You'd make a hell of a pirate.
"Who's Milah, on the tattoo?"
Someone from long ago.
Where is she?
She's gone.
Gold.
Rumplestiltskin.
Where are you going?
I don't know yet.
Can I come?
You guys are unbelievable.
Real friends you turned out to be.
"Well, we got to do what's in the photo."
"Right, bro?"
Where we going?
Nowhere.
I don't want to abandon Jasper in case something goes wrong.
Are we okay?
I got jealous.
This is a- it's a very complicated situation.
You're doing your best.
"And I, obviously, am- I'm not handling it well."
(SIGHS)
You got jealous?
(EXHALES)
Tell me more.
"So, Ivan, I mean, what a surprise."
You said that already.
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, can I get you something to drink?"
"You know what I like about you, Jasper?"
You never welched on a bet.
I have never had to send Marcus over here to collect.
And I can appreciate that.
I can.
Is that yours?
You mind if I see it?
(CHUCKLES)
Come on.
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.
But I am earning double time.
There's a bright side.
"So, when the laziest boy in the world wakes up, tell him he better wash those sneakers."
"And I said ""Bye."""
And tell him to let them air dry this time.
I don't want them banging the hell out of my dryer.
What?
"What, you don't even get casual Saturday?"
"No, it's just you..."
You look nice is all.
"It's work, Walt."
Everybody's gonna be there.
Ok.
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
Ok.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi.
"You've reached Walt, Skyler, and Walter Junior."
"Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you."
Skyler?
Are you there?
I... don't know what to do.
I need to talk to you.
"Hey, Marie."
It's me.
What's up?
Yesterday I got home and found him.
He didn't even tell me he was coming.
- A man was killed?
Number...
"I mean, how hard is that?"
"I mean, a talking monkey could do her job."
It's embarrassing.
"Actually, that's 16."
"See, you're holding it upside-down."
"Oh, it's..."
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
It's no big deal.
"Look, I've seen it my whole life."
I've never seen it under the six.
"Why don't we ask Natalie, then?"
"Well, she's the expert."
Okay.
Okay.
But I see your point.
About the monkey.
All I'm trying to say is it's not the same Natalie.
"If you knew her, you wouldn't know her."
"Last night, after the show, she got somebody fired."
Really?
One of the crew.
Sound guy.
There were some wires on the floor.
She was...
"You know, complaining."
"And, I mean, I met the guy when I was there."
He was a nice kid.
You have to get me out of here!
I can not go back.
I know.
We're going to America.
Thank you.
I love you.
We've got to track Zana.
-Sensato.
We will continue with the broad options.
Something will take us forward.
VG
-Tangen is out there.
-Falou With him?
"I told all I know, but it is not great."
He gave me a double and Coca-Cola sandwich.
Yes?
I am here.
I will not let it go.
But it is so serious that I will tell you first.
We have tips from a cocaine package by which Christer was responsible.
Right?
-you Do not know?
This is an interview or a complaint?
I can know about the whereabouts of this package.
Yes?
Camilla Bjerke?
We will take you in for questioning and searching his apartment.
Why is that?
-how Come?
-Recebemos A complaint.
-A Complaint?
About what?
"Yeah, actually, Gibbs..."
No.
That's it.
Thanks.
We should have told Gibbs.
Later.
"Come on, McGee, answer."
Aren't you gonna get that?
Yes?
Don't tell Gibbs it's me.
Okay.
Yes?
The air marshal I mentioned before--
I need you to dig up anything you can on him.
Name is Mike Beers.
"Well, that could take a while."
TSA personnel files are always tightly wrapped.
What's this about?
Bishop knows the guy from somewhere.
She's trying to figure out why.
"Soon as you can, McGee."
Yeah.
Don't look at me.
Just do it.
Is everything okay?
What took so long?
"The air marshal, where'd he go?"
"He's, um... the charging station."
"What was that about, Tony?"
Nothing I'm gonna tell Gibbs until we're sure about this guy.
Sure about what?
"Well, that joke I told back there."
It was just a question of time.
"Shall we go, son?"
Now?
You wouldn't want to worry Mama.
"No, I wouldn't."
Take good care of him.
"Oh, he'll be taken care of."
I don't want to go.
"Why, Wilbur?"
"Yes, tell her why."
"Well, because, you see, I'm not really a little..."
I like it here.
I want to go to school here.
This is a girls' school.
That's why I like it here.
"Now, Wilbur, you mustn't hurt your father's feelings."
"You wouldn't do that, would you, Wilbur?"
No.
You know how sensitive I am.
He's very sensitive.
"You're choking him, Mr. Hoolick."
Oh.
(COUGHS)
"Come along, son."
You don't have much time.
"It's been nice meeting you, Mr. Hoolick."
"It's been very nice meeting you, Mrs. Brendan."
"Goodbye, Wilbur."
"Don't say that, Mrs. Brendan!"
"All right, you."
Where is it?
Why did you tell Mrs. Brendan you're my father?
"65,000 children."
That's more than are born in Denmark in a year.
Think of what that money could do.
You could really do something.
- What do you get out of this?
- Nothing.
I keep my good life.
I buy remission for my sins.
And we're almost family.
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm assuming you're interested.
"Yes, damn it."
Of course I'm interested.
"Jacob, stay here."
You'll get to know Anna better.
You could take out Helene for dinner.
I'm going to to Sweden with the twins.
We're going fishing.
"You're a strange man, Jorgen."
She has to eat.
She's a terrible cook.
"- Take care of yourselves, okay?"
"- We will, mother."
- Don't lose too much online.
- I won 235 dollars last night.
Congratulations.
Try and hang on to them.
- Mom did it up wrong.
- We can't have that.
There.
Hop inside.
Thanks.
Just army.
"Why are you here, Harper?"
You boneheaded Paddy!
So...
"The Chosen Men, eh?"
Well...
I didn't choose you.
But remember this
I know you all i've always known you you and your kind all my life
All I know is how to fight.
"So if there's any man amongst you expecting a quick ramble through this war, now's the time."
Be sure now.
Right.
Join the column.
"At the double, left face!"
Trail arms!
Quick march!
Halt!
"Company, halt!"
"It's that way, sir."
We'll wait for dawn.
Sergeant Williams!
Sir!
- We'll make camp now.
- Sir!
"All right, lads, make camp."
"Fletcher, Jones, Edwards - fetch firewood."
Morris and Brown - sentries.
Column dismissed!
Not you Sharpe
Take your men up that slope and see what the terrain is like for tomorrow.
"Well, you heard him."
It's an Audi.
Give me that.
How fast does it go?
"I don't know. 140, I think."
What fish are they?
They're meant to be sharks.
But I think they're sort of catfish.
Do they cost a lot?
"Yeah, they cost $100 billion."
"""Smoking kills."""
"Thank you for that, cheers."
I'd forgotten.
"You know, Will, you've got a nice flat."
Thank you.
"Only one bedroom, though."
Largely because I find I can only sleep in one bed at a time.
You could get a bigger place.
"I mean, if you needed to."
"Would you like anything to drink, Marcus?"
"Thanks, just got a Pepsi."
Who are these people with the saxophones and trumpets?
Saxophonists and trumpeters.
Why have you got pictures of them?
'Cause they're cool.
What's cool about them?
I don't know.
They took drugs and died.
A vowel.
"""A."""
- And a final consonant.
- And a consonant.
Thank you.
Okay.
Are you moving in?
Just temporarily.
I think
I could get more more money for the house if I did some work in the backyard.
"Why are you telling me this, Peter?"
"Look, I don't want you to worry about these... decisions."
This is all temporary.
I'm not trying to...
Colonize our past?
"Well, I don't think I'd exactly put it that way, but yes, I don't want these decisions to be misunderstood."
Okay.
I won't.
"So... we're making this work, right?"
"Oddly, yes, we are."
I heard Cary is back with you guys.
"- Yeah, starts today."
- Oh.
He's a good guy.
Wish him luck.
"So, we'll need you out here until we get an office cleared out,"
- if you're all right with that.
- I am.
Good.
It'll just be a few weeks.
"Welcome back, Cary."
Whew.
AN:
Yeah?
"Um, is this FE Construction?"
Hello?
Who is this?
Johnny was she sleeping with him?
"If I'd have seen something like that, I would tell you."
You think that maybe he was just an old friend?
That's all there was?
We didn't talk.
He didn't seem impressive.
I handed him an envelope.
- He wasn't?
- No.
He's gone and he knows not to come back.
"You know, that would be just like her."
"You see, you know, always looking to help someone."
"I'm dying, John."
- You okay?
- Yeah.
"It's gonna be okay about this guy, so forget about it."
- I let Jimmy down.
"- No, you didn't."
He's gonna die now...
- ...and he thinks I don't love him.
"- Listen to me, he knows you love him."
"And all he wanted was a little more time, where it didn't hurt so bad."
And he's gonna get it.
WEXLER:
Robin?
Yeah?
WEXLER:
You got my soup?
KELLY:
"Go ahead, you'll be fine."
"Yeah, Jimmy, just a sec."
[HELICOPTER BLADES whirring ]
- Do me a favor.
"Finish this beer upstairs in my office, quick."
Huh?
Higgins is here.
It's after 6:30.
"If he catches you in here without a jacket, he's gonna string me up alive."
"No, he won't."
What?
"I can guarantee ya, five gets you 50, he's gonna lay that old line on me that he's on the board of directors."
He's gonna tell me to throw your butt out of here.
Money's up.
[ Sighs ]
You're on.
"Hi, Hig."
And how is your investigation progressing?
"Oh, not too well."
- Are you sure there's nothing more I can do to help?
- [ Rick ] To help?
No.
Positive.
"Well, if there is anything, please don't hesitate to ask."
- Put Magnum's beer on my tab.
- I always do.
- Tomorrow at 3:00?
- I'll try.
Thank you.
You believe that?
"You're catching flies, guys."
Give that guy a drink.
?
[ Lounge Piano ]
?
Yeah.
"Would you, please, be so kind to describe them... to better understanding of how good it looks now?"
Sure.
His arm was shot off below the elbow... and the leg shot off below the knee.
- And there was a...
- Did you happen to see his head?
- Yes.
- Do tell.
"The skull was dented in and there was this, um..."
"His eyes were missing and, um... the bottom half of his jaw was shredded to pieces."
Just all right.
"I'm bleeding, too."
That was a little extraneous.
Stay close.
Henry!
Hurry up!
Close it.
"Henry, come on!"
"Henry, try to keep up!"
Come on.
Kick it in.
Come on.
"If Akan gets a hold of my work,"
Men like these will be brought out from the dead to form his army.
Go!
"Henry, no!"
Henry!
Take my hand!
Escape pod initiated.
- There are two pods.
- One.
- Marty?
It looks like there's some tidy minge here.
"Yes, it's tidy because there's no hair on it."
"Oi, Si, Hannah Fields is over there."
It's her who write your Valentine?
"Oh, yeah, shit."
She looks quite fit actually.
"Right, I'll go over and tell her you fancy her."
- No.
- Why?
"Well, you going over and telling her I fancy her, seems a bit, y'know, childish."
When in Rome.
That's how you got to play it with younger girls.
You go over...
"Shit, she's coming over here."
So did you get my valentine's card then?
"Oh, yeah, great."
Thank you.
- Do you want a drink?
- I've got one thanks.
"No, I mean a proper drink."
Oh... right.
"Yeah, thanks."
You're fit.
- Sorry?
"- Oh, forget it."
Come on.
"You're well sexy, I used to stare at you in assembly."
Right.
"Ooh, you're so horny."
Tongue me!
"Um, how old are you?"
"Blimey, that didn't take long."
Doesn't matter.
See?
You keep to yourself some things too.
But it's not the same.
-Why not?
You're 13...
Daniel is 18...
I'm your father...
And I want to know what you're doing with an 18 years old boy!
"Well I go out with him, to the movies, we dance, laugh, argue, tell jokes, we go to the theater.."
And nothing else!
Had he kissed you?
I said nothing else.
Won't you have slept with him!
That's why you're worried.
The whole point was this.
It's not funny.
What if I'd answer yes.
Nothing.
What could I do?
Who knows..
The first thing would be telling mom.
Do you think I should tell her?
You should know.
So you've slept with him.
If you say so...
Want to make me angry?
That's what you said when I was little.
And what are you now?
If I were so little you wouldn't ask me this.
"It's true, but now..."
-Now everything changed right?
You ever get your hands dirty?
"If you need anything, then..."
just ask.
Morning.
I've come for Peter.
He's my son.
You want it.
Yeah.
Why can't you get better for me?
We had so much and it's all fucked up forever.
I'm so lonely.
I know.
Do you remember when you rode with me in the ambulance after I tried to kill myself?
Of course.
That's what love feels like.
What are you doing?
Lovely Sid and lovely Michelle are fucking.
We're not...
Not in the way you're thinking.
Effy?
What's wrong?
It keeps happening.
OK.
Lie down.
- Do you mind?
- No.
"I like this story, anyway."
Thanks.
"""Orpheus was the greatest poet who ever lived."
"""His music was so beautiful that when he played rivers would stop flowing,"
"""winds would stop blowing,"
It isn't that I...
Thank you.
Lin?
You're a brave woman.
"No, just a woman praying that her family will forgive her."
There is nothing to forgive.
I thought you'd never get here.
- Choppers are coming up the valley.
- Where's Doc?
"Caught one in the back, but he's going to be all right."
Let's get the colonel.
MULDOON:
LZ is a meadow just over that rise.
Let's move out!
MULDOON:
Petersen!
Bastards!
Move out.
Move out.
"You heard him, let's go!"
BECKWORTH:
What area's designated as offloading ramp today?
M. P:
"Last pad over, next to the water."
- See that runway over by the beach?
- Yeah?
That's where your Peter-san's going to be coming in.
You take care of yourself.
Thank you.
"- Mister, you Beckworth?"
- That's right.
"If you want to go where the war is, this is the way."
Kevin.
I'm Frank.
Brad.
-Hey.
"-Oh, hey."
"Oh, God."
"Come on, come in."
Excuse me.
What do we do now?
Just ask her to...
you know.
You kids see a lot of hookers?
"No, this is our first one."
Why do you have a picture of Grace Kelley?
'Cause I'd like to be like her:
Marry a prince and never get old.
"When you take your clothes off for money, do you get cold?"
Depends on the room.
"I have this dream that I'm naked at school, and I have to get home without anyone seeing me."
"I have that dream, too."
"Last time I had that dream, there was an alligator chasing me."
You ever get that one?
Nope.
Do you ever watch cartoons?
Yes.
Are you married?
"Boy, you ask a lot of questions."
The meter's ticking.
She's on the bed.
She's on the bed!
"Now, how do you want to do this:"
standing up or on the bed?
Is that what you want?
"If we stay around here, we're dead."
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
Busting his balls or what?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Very good.
Glad to hear it.
You know what kind of questions they're asking him?
"Jimmy, I don't know."
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money...
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.
Tell him he's got to call me.
Okay?
"As soon as you talk to him, e's got to call me."
It's very important.
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
- Take this.
It's a couple of thousands.
"- Thanks, Jimmy."
"Don't worry, everything will be all right."
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?
Pick out a few for yourself.
- You get 50?
For what?
- For facilitating.
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
"All right, all right, all right."
"So, what do you think?"
They see us?
"No, man, I think we're good."
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me.
"Oh, no."
Where the hell is Jimmy?
Should've been here 10 minutes ago.
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is...
Wait a minute.
"- Oh, no, no, no."
- What?
I just wanna walk.
How is he?
"Well, he's doing pretty good, considering."
Do you think she ever really loved him?
It doesn't look like that matters.
"- Breathe, Harriet, breathe."
- I am breathing.
We need to come up with a better game plan for that next contraction.
You're doing just fine.
- Let's just have a look at you.
- Okay.
You're going to feel a little pressure.
A little pressure might be a nice change.
Where's Dr. Gettis?
He was due in here 10 minutes ago.
- I don't know.
I paged him.
- Get him in here.
- What is it?
- I need you to roll over on your side.
- I need Dr. Gettis right away.
- Okay.
Get that pillow down.
Yes.
- Don't push yet.
- What's happened?
Just something the doctor needs to look at.
They can't find him.
I've got Dr. Chadway.
"Doctor, we have a prolapsed cord."
The baby's heart rate is showing decels.
"Yes, sir."
"You're in big trouble, mister."
- No.
"Oh, God."
- Yup.
- You're gonna have to pay for it.
"- I told them, Officer."
"I said it was stupid at the start, but nobody listened to me."
That's good.
Remorse.
Nice candy.
"'Cause, for starters, we're looking at three big ones."
"Oh, God!"
Three big
- Three years?
Three hundred dollars.
What?
For the windshield.
"Plus, there's this little baby right here."
"You'll have to put that together with tape, but it still counts."
- This-
- This is a ticket.
- Yeah.
For operating a class-two vehicle without a license.
Weight class two.
Can't this wait?
Mr. Richards is suffering from a concussion.
- We're talking.
- There's nothin' on it.
My pen ran out of ink.
"Officer, i really must insist."
"From doing paperwork all night, between you and saving your boss."
- My boss?
She thinks she's doing her job.
I am going to pull him from her class.
Don't overreact.
The agency said there was gonna be emotional scarring.
"Hey, give it back!"
How could you like to be his parents?
Where are my baby fish?
Mr. Michaelson bought them for his aquarium.
They were mine!
They were grown up.
It was time for them to have their own home.
You had no right to sell them!
"- Mikey, what's wrong with you?"
- They were mine!
Calm down.
They were only fish.
You don't care about how I feel.
You don't love me.
I hate you
Calm down.
Stop it.
"When Daddy gets home, we'll talk about it."
He's not my real daddy.
You're not my real mother!
I hate you!
I wish I never met you!
"Mikey, wait!"
( Door Slamming )
I'm sure there's an explanation.
If we could just get him to talk.
I don't know.
Maybe they're right.
Marjukka.
Your dad's about to die.
Who's stroking your hair now?
Who's enjoying my happiness?
I hope he's better Than I would've been for you
My heart still sings for her
My red-haired girl she is
Although you're not by my side
Let my thoughts come to you
Silence!
"In front of this congregation, I'd like to apologize to you, Jesse."
Your childhood was ruined because I studied plastic bags.
"Forgive me, Jesse."
I love you.
Dad...
-What?
The fire devil...
I've settled my score with him.
Really?
I'll be damned...
Then I can die in peace.
Can lemma mm my hand?
"Yes, she can."
"Bye then, grandpa."
Nice to die when it's not raining.
What next?
"Take good care of Jemina, will you?"
-I will.
She likes you.
She's like her Mom.
And her Dad.
Your flame is burning bright
"But when the lights came back on, it was the donkey who was taking a shower!"
"Oh, my goodness!"
Why would I do that?
Ha ha!
"And right behind you, there was danger!"
"- Oh, man."
- You were paralyzed!
It was a donkey-eating waffle.
"It was packing heat, and it wanted revenge."
I want revenge!
The donkey ran.
But how far can you run when you are on a plate covered in butter wearing a pink tutu?
- No!
- And a sombrero.
- No!
- And a coconut brassiere!
And about to be eaten alive!
"No, please!"
"Please, I'll switch to pancakes!"
- Aah!
"- Num, num, num!"
And the donkey was never seen again.
Hoo hoo hah hah hah hah hah!
But what Puss didn't know is that right behind him was the one thing he feared more than anything else.
- No.
You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You didn't!
- I did!
No!
Anything but that!
No!
Liz:
The drug will take her soon.
Narcan.
Heroin antidote.
All the agents looking for you have it.
"[Gasps, coughing]"
"Liz Kenyon, you killed Kevin Whitfield, didn't you?"
I took him to protect him.
"Yeah, well, now I'm taking you."
[Police radio chatter]
[Handcuffs click]
James:
Just breathe.
Just breathe.
So why would you ever promise those parents you'd find his killer?
Because...
"They believed in him so much that it made me believe in him, too."
[Young woman coughs]
You're a hell of a lawman.
"Thank you, son."
So are you.
But I got to ask you to stay away from Gracie...
Until I figure this out.
Figure what out?
She's my granddaughter.
She misses me.
Yeah.
Because you died.
Just give me some time with this.
[Bell jingles]
[Sighs]
"So, this is Peng's."
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean--
- Don't bother.
It's not worth it.
What do you think?
It's not very good.
It's not very...
Buckley.
"It's not your fault, you know."
It really isn't.
"You'd better go home, Mrs. Cole."
Exterior train.
Station.
"A full moon, a clear sky."
A man sits by the shore.
There has been a quarrel.
A woman is walking away from him.
Now she turns back.
"""I didn't mean what I just said."
"And, anyway, you said worse."""
It was a declaration.
"- ""Stupid bloody fool"" was good."
Did you think of that beforehand?
"Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Mrs. Cole?"
No.
What I'm trying to say is that... if all of this stopped... the sparring and the jibing and the insults and the arguments...
I'd miss it.
"Even if I were dead,"
I'd still miss it.
The Catrin Cole School of Dialogue.
On and on and on and on and on.
"Look, I've never met anyone like me before."
"Apart from the first time, and that was mostly fighting him off."
Badly.
Please.
No-one's ever taught me how to do this.
"Adam, here's the thing, right?"
I don't care.
"Yeah, like I want to hang out with some whiffy Goth anyway."
Excuse me?
Just cos you're a vampire doesn't mean you have to smell like the undead.
"One word, Mitch."
Deodorant.
Tch!
"- Oh, good."
You two have met.
- He's just leaving.
You want to watch yourself with this one.
She's been giving me the glad eye ever since I arrived.
- Loves a bit of fang.
- I do not!
That is a terrible thing to say.
I do not like a bit of fang.
"Not his fang, or anyone else's."
"Er... you know, I'm not ruling it out."
Just if the right fang came along.
But I haven't even thought about it.
At all.
For ages.
Oh.
"OK, ladies."
I'll catch you later.
Can we?
I think I can stand that.
[Greta snarling]
DAVE:
Scrub right here.
[Shower running]
[Monique gasps]
What the?
Oh well.
"Hey, this isn't so bad."
[Monique giggling]
"Dave, what's that?"
[Doorbell ringing]
I'd better see who it is.
I'm gonna check the breaker box.
The breaker switch jumped off for some reason.
"Hey, who was at the door?"
MONIQUE:
"Whoever it was, they left."
"OK, Richard."
"Stand there by the front, over there"
A little closer to the center.
That's about right.
"OK, now, I'm gonna kick the car out of gear."
"OK, you got it."
Can you hold it?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I can hold it."
I'm not gonna push it far off hill though.
"Well, uh, tell you what, now."
What I want to do is to kind of ease up on it a little bit.
"Like, you know, let it... as if you"
Were gonna let it roll forward and pick up a little momentum.
"- Ok, ok."
"- They make a good team, you know."
"Jin-san, I wonder if even now you are being discharged, you want to stay."
"Hold on, Captain."
Before when we were running under the bombing... you know I could have done it alone.
Don't you?
But... we are trained to don't let no one behind.
Fool!
Nobody is going to praise you...
""" Thank you "" you should say..."
Male here.
I found the main point.
It was true... there's a special warhead...
Male here.
Entered inside the TL.
Good.
"Start the access, I'll go as soon as possible."
Yankee.
Can you immediately put together a log?
Yankee?
What's going on?
Yankee?
"Gimlet here, over!"
"Male, reply!"
Gimlet here.
Male here.
Can't contact Yankee.
I'll send a scout team to the surface to investigate.
To the surface?
Hey!
Male!
Didn't earn your points yet?
Incidentally you might ask your daughter if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings in her room that night.
"Look, he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room."
"I know, I realize, but if certain British doctors never asked, ""What is this fungus?"" we wouldn't today have penicillin."
Correct?
"When she's better, I'll ask her."
It couldn't hurt.
In the meantime....
That's okay.
"I really hate to ask you this, but for my daughter, could you please give an autograph?"
Of course.
Where's a pencil?
Right here.
She'd love it!
What's her name?
I lied.
It's for me.
The spelling is on the back:
Kinderman.
"You know that film you made, Angel?"
I saw that six times!
Really?
It was beautiful.
Thank you.
-'Bye.
-'Bye.
"Please, no!"
-Do it!
"-Please, don't!"
You bitch!
Do it!
"Please, no!"
Let Jesus fuck you!
What can I do then?
I got an idea.
What is it?
I can guarantee success with my idea.
- Your Highness will have to be patient.
- Why?
"If you can be patient,"
I'll guarantee you'll have the books of Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine Sword.
Brother!
What is it?
Fung-wu killed his master!
He killed his master?
How can it be?
How can it be?
It's true!
Fung-wu's master was playing chess with His Highness.
"Suddenly, he held a sword in his hand and plunged it into his master's body."
That's unreasonable.
How can it be?
I saw it myself.
His master told him before he died that he'd done the right thing.
Done the right thing?
That's strange.
What happened afterwards?
His Highness arrested him for murder.
Did he resist?
It was useless!
He's helpless!
"Yan-ling, don't be sad!"
I'll find out the truth.
"1, 2, 3!"
"1, 2, 3!"
Master!
Master!
Why did you kill Law Ching?
Why did you force my master to die at my sword?
I didn't force him!
Now I understand.
This is your filthy trick to get our book.
Nonsense!
It was the Shaolin!
Shaolin?
Impossible!
Impossible?
Why?
The poison your master drank is familiar to the Shaolin.
Shaolin temple!
Stop!
Sung Chi!
Execute him for the murder of his master.
"Your Highness, Law Ching has cheated you."
His student definitely knows 8-divine Sword.
Arrest him!
8-divine Sword?
Don't stop!
How are you?
Speak!
"Yes, or you'll have to suffer more!"
But I don't know 8-divine Sword.
How can I tell you?
"Your Highness, please stop!"
Why?
The man has the same temperament as his master.
He won't tell you even if you kill him.
- We doubly accept.
Does anyone else want to join our little contest?
- I'm in!
"- Ja, wonderbar!"
- Huzzah!
- Okay.
I think I'm going to take the kids out and terrify a few more trick or treaters.
- Will I see you later?
- The night is young.
Trick or treat.
Ahem.
Ahem!
I shall begin.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
"There was this crazy albino guy with a hook, and he lived in a mirror!"
"And if you even look at him, you'd wake up in bathtub full of ice with your kidneys gone!"
Well...
"Hey, hold on."
I didn't say we were doing this here.
- Uh...
What?
- You named the terms.
I name the place.
"Okay, fine."
Where we gonna do this?
- Castle Duloc?
"- Oh, ha ha."
"Very funny, Shrek."
But this is where Lord Farquaad lived!
Ja.
Und died.
I heard it's haunted by his ghost!
Mr. Yagami?
We were in the same class.
But we did not go.
"I saw him yesterday, to my work."
He had to return to that time.
I see!
Good!
Sorry for inconvenience.
The person whose name is written in the notebook dies
Cardiac arrest is systematic absence of cause in .
It's that 'an accident.
The small breakfast ready?
I am in a rush.
I do it on.
I want bread.
I freaked out yesterday.
Sakota
"During his run, he had a pain."
"Sometimes you what, Sakota?"
"It crashed into the train, and is the result."
"It's been what, in fact ?"
- This would be a heart attack.
- A heart attack?
This is not true...
This is not true...
I can not believe.
This is impossible.
No...
No...
Do not be sad guy.
- Huh?
- It was a night protection.
"Okay, I'm making out with this guy..."
PG stuff.
"And he mentions that he's going out of town, he's gonna be out of touch."
Run.
But maybe he is going out of town.
Where?
Where's he going that he's gonna be out of touch?
Where are you going out of town to again?
Um...
Uh...
Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh.
Run.
"So, what, now I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?"
Yeah.
There's not gonna be anybody left.
I don't know why I'm saying this but I think I know a nice guy who might actually like you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
He's friends with my brother.
His name's Bill.
We'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.
"So, I mean, I'm in his bathroom right now."
What do I do?
"Well, you gotta come out eventually, right?"
But I'd take my time in there.
I'd let him sweat.
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
[SIGHS]
BEN:
"Yeah, the boat looks great."
You're confused.
He's confused you.
- It's very confusing.
- Don't move!
"I said, don't move.!"
I mean business.
Goddamn it.!
Would you think about what you're doing.!
This guy's a scumbag.!
He doesn't want you!
He's only using you!
Come on!
Put the gun down!
Back away from Jack now!
- You've gone completely crazy.
You know that?
- Thanks for noticing.
How do you plan to get us out of this one?
Watch me and weep.
"It takes all kinds, Dalt."
"Okay, Bill, Wendy, I hope you're getting this."
They are walking directly towards the helicopter... and they're staring at me like a couple of crazed dogs.
I'm gonna try to get a word from them if I can.
"This is unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen."
This...
"- Oh, my..."
- Get out of there.
"- Let's go, pal."
Let's go.
- I'm being asked...
- Come on!
Go!
I just got so nervous.
- You were great.
- It's like a tax on the stupid.
"Come on, Randy."
We're parked out front.
Good job.
"Well, thank you, mr."
Monk.
- It was fun.
- Yeah.
I'm glad you did it.
What a fun thing to do only one time and never try it again or mention it again.
"Natalie, where you going?"
"Mr. Lawrence, I told you I wasn't an actor."
I'm so sorry.
Sorry about what?
That you did such a terrific job?
The phones are lighting up like crazy.
They love you.
And those little ad lib things you did.
You were wonderful.
Wasn't she wonderful?
So...
what do you say?
- About what?
- About doing it full-time.
It's just three nights a week.
I promise it won't interfere with your day job.
"I mean, I don't know."
You really thought I was good?
I told you when I met you you're a natural.
Mr. Monk?
Can't say I blame them.
There's nothing I hate more than a damp cold.
Let's check this out.
Howdy folks.
Who are you?
Sheppard.
"This is Teyla, Ronon, McKay."
You from Matira?
No.
Over the mountains then?
A little further.
Then you've come a long way.
You'll be in need of food and drink.
Sit.
"Take it, you don't get many strangers around here?"
No.
Especially not those who travel near dark.
Why's that?
- You really don't know?
- Callum.
What's your business here?
"No business really, we're just travellers."
Then you best keep travelling.
Ya...
Alright then.
Wait!
"Goran, you can't send them out there."
They look like they can take care of themselves.
May not even start tonight.
"It's been three months, how much longer do you think it will wait."
"Hi, what are you talking about?"
The Daemus.
"How you doing, Ed?"
Ooh.
Terrible.
I feel like that drill was driving right through the top of my head.
It might be a good idea at that.
Let out that beer you slopped up last night.
"- Quit riding me, will you?"
- I ain't even started on you yet.
- Come on.
Let's eat.
"- No, Frank, I couldn't."
"Come on, do you good."
You gotta eat.
- I got just the thing to straighten you out.
- What is it?
Some nice ice-cold oatmeal smothered with lard.
Go get some more.
Yeah?
Let's get some more.
Come on.
"Tomato juice, eh?"
Hmm.
"Well, next best thing in the world for a hangover."
Yeah?
"Well, what's the best?"
Heh.
Laying off of the booze entirely.
What time did he roll in last night?
"Oh, I wouldn't know that."
- I never check up on me boarders.
- Your daughter's checking on him.
Whatever happened started inside.
There was some kind of fight.
He grabbed some scissors and chased her out here.
Find me the station manager.
I want a list of every employee that was here last night.
"Make that every employee, period."
"Yes, sir."
Any idea on motive?
I guess you could say that there were 12 million people with a motive.
"Myself, included."
This was the lotto girl.
She broke my heart three times a week.
What is that?
What is what?
On her fingertips.
Is that paint?
Yeah.
Looks like it.
"Hey, Gabby."
Take a sample from her left fingers.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Mr. Monk?
I have a nephew.
He's 10 years old.
He's your biggest fan.
He...
He clips articles.
He thinks you're cooler than Spiderman.
Really?
Kids.
"If I could get your autograph, he'd think I'm some kind of hero."
It's written in my notebook right here.
See that?
"""It looks like her number came up."""
Let's see your notebook.
I didn't write it down.
I just thought of it.
"Please, come on!"
Can you believe this guy?
You know what?
"I'm gonna have your badge, officer Kil."
"Come on, Shecky, let's walk it off."
Excuse me.
I'm Stan Lawrence.
I'm the station manager.
- Here's that list you wanted.
"- Great, great."
I'll make sure they get it.
How long did she work here?
Not long.
Just a few weeks.
I still can't believe it.
I should've put more lights back here.
"No, you can't blame yourself."
It was after midnight.
The parking lot was empty.
More lights wouldn't have made a difference.
"Thank you, officer."
That's very nice of you to say.
I'm not an officer.
I work with Mr. Monk.
Is that Adrian Monk?
I've heard of him.
"Boy, what a night!"
I'm so glad that is over with.
"- Oh, well, nothing lasts forever."
- In sports...
Together forever.
- Together forever.
- What a nice surprise.
Together forever.
Hey!
"So, what's up?"
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever.
"- Gosh, your eye is pretty."
"Look, I know you're upset, so..."
Why don't we just sit down and discuss this!
Then they ate me.
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I gotta go.
They were my ride.
Wait a minute.
"If they eat you, how is it that you're still here?"
Did you not say this was a true story?
Busted.
"You made it up, didn't you?"
I...
"Hey, look!"
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Doody heads!
And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
"I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell."
It was a dark and stormy night.
We need a new set of jerseys for the under-fifteen lads.
They've all grown bigger since the start of the season.
"Here, we'll take a few for Sharon's snapper, will we?"
That's a very good idea.
No!
"Here you go, Georgie."
Here.
There.
"Thanks very much, lads."
That's great.
"Oh, give a little."
Helps a lot.
- Gobshite.
- Absolutely.
Listen...
Do you think she'll get married?
What's that?
"Oh, no."
No.
"Jesus, no."
"They've more cop-on these days, eh?"
"I mean, would you get married... if you were that age again... these days?"
- What?
- I think I'm going to cry.
"Anyway, I wouldn't want Sharon getting married that young."
She's her whole life ahead of her.
Exactly.
Unless she drinks an iffy pint.
Having a baby's the most natural thing in the world.
- That's right!
"- Oh, good shite!"
"Olé, olé, olé, olé"
I don't want to let them down.
"No, of course not."
"Well, I leave on Monday, and I'll be back in London for the exhibition."
I suppose it's not so very far off.
"No, it's not so very far off."
And I'll come and visit as often as I can.
"Right, then."
Veal's off.
I've ordered cutlets Milanese... and semolina... pudding.
You are Mr. Ambrose Hilliard?
Yes.
"I'm Sophie Smith, Sammy's sister."
Ah.
His office.
"Last night, he was working late."
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I am unable.
Mr. Hilliard?
Mr. Hilliard?
"I'm afraid, my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did so myself.
"You see, Sammy Smith has two fingers missing from his left hand."
"I'm sorry, we try very hard to... to make a whole person."
For the relatives.
Oh!
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent.
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
bob?
bob?
[baby crying]
- have you seen tim?
- no. why?
- he isn't here?
- i don't know.
i just got here.
- why don't you ever know anything?
- i... i know she's -  he might not even -  hey.
you're all here!
come on. come on in.
- honey.
"oh, honey, what happened to your hair?"
and where are your glasses?
"- look at me, mom."
i'm cool!
"- i don't understand why she -  can you calm down, you beast, okay?"
his haircut ain't gonna cost you nothing.
"it's a freebie, and i can't believe i'm even saying that."
all right. hop down.
[grunts] - aah!
"- i think you might still need these, though."
come here.
- this is lovely.
"yeah, he's got it."
"- so you just remember that cool comes from the inside, okay?"
mwah!
hee-haw!
- how did you pull this off?
- let's just say that... mama made me do it.
"- mama, can we open our presents now?"
Farewell.
Tahile?
"You think you can escape from us, the Magic Knights of Estabul?"
What's happening?
An enemy raid from Estabul!
Red-armored knights are flooding in!
They're attacking us...
Red armor?
The Estabul Magic Knights?
"All hands, retreat!"
"Run into the woods, fall back and regroup!"
Sion!
Are you safe?
"No, not Tahile..."
He had left to fetch water.
He said we'd be safe as long as we stuck with Sion!
- What happened to Kiefer?
- I don't know.
Let's split up here.
"Tony, Fahle, you two go ahead."
We'll stall them here.
Sion!
Don't worry.
Go!
"There may still be survivors, including Kiefer."
You're going to save them?
It's impossible!
It does seem that way.
- See them?
- No.
What's wrong?
"Hurry and run, Roland brats!"
[Phone rings]
Hello?
Who is this?
"Oh, Detective Burris."
"No, it's all right."
I needed to get out.
What would you want with the dog?
"All right, then, but she's not here."
Hester took her to the vet.
You'll have to pick her up over there.
"No, just bring her here after."
And Mr. Burris?
Take good care of her.
[Dogs barking]
"Detective Burris, this dog's a pussy, let me tell you that."
There's no way that I'd ever make her a violent.
"When a dog acts like that, she's never going"
To have a killer instinct.
"Well, thanks a lot."
You just shot my best theory right in the ass.
"Come on, Greta."
"Let's go, girl."
Come on.
There we go.
[Dogs barking]
Oh.
Going a little fast.
"OK, Greta."
"I'll go buy you a hamburger, all right?"
"[Dog barks, kids playing]"
Think you let me win today.
I never let anyone win.
"Me, too."
"Money or not, I'll stay."
I'll need a third.
"Sorry, Captain."
I have a family.
I'm not crazy.
"Captain, three men can't hold off a party of Ree, much less some boys."
"Besides, $70 ain't gonna buy nobody a new set of ears."
"A hundred, then."
This man is the only reason we're still alive.
We were 45 men when this started.
Now we're ten.
Almost nine.
HAWK:
He's my father.
He can have my share.
JIM:
"Mine, too."
He can have my share also.
All right.
"If Mr. Bridger feels the same way,"
I'll lag behind with them.
You?
Yep.
You already lost my share of the pelts so I got no choice but to make it up by some other means.
Sticking around for another day or two don't make no difference.
$300...at least I get to go home with something.
"Glass is to be cared for until, understood?"
Yeah.
You have my word.
I understand.
HENRY:
I heard that you were in an accident...
How are you feeling...?
As you can see...
So you're okay...
I'm good.
I'm a little itchy.
This body has allergies.
So...
You have a lot of rocks in the house.
Oh...
It's a hobby of mine.
So people collect rocks too...
That's something.
Ouch!
You shouldn't be touching those...
These rocks represent my family
The large black one...is me.
The pretty white one is my wife.
The nice smooth one is Da Ran!
And this tiny little one...is Choong Sik!
"It's a rock family, a rock family!"
Dad rock...
Mom rock...
Child Rock!
"(The way it's pronounced, it sounds like Idol)"
Yeah...
"Well, since you're a part of our family too now...."
Let's find your own rock that we can put next to Da Ran together.
No thanks!
Why would I want that?
Shall we look for one?
A son-in-law rock?
I need you to sleep at the loft.
Lily.
Jenny Humphrey.
"Uh, yeah?"
You bitch.
"You told me you were selling me oxy,"
But those pills were antibiotics.
"Yeah, I didn't get high."
I got a yeast infection.
¶...
For an audience of one ¶
¶ ooh ¶
Dad.
"Look, I can explain."
I came here to tell you.
"Jenny, please save your breath."
Like I'm gonna believe a word out of your mouth.
Get your things and come with me.
We're going home...
To Brooklyn.
"¶ ooh, ooh ¶"
What did you want to talk about that couldn't wait?
"The producer from CNN just flew into town,"
And I'm gonna meet her for drinks in 20 minutes.
I want you to take the internship.
"Come on, Dan."
I don't want us to be making decisions based on fear.
All right?
"So whatever happens, we'll figure it out."
Thank you.
"I, uh..."
Got you some stationery
What is it?
What's wrong?
"Sorry, it's just..."
Didn't know I'd put it on.
Old habits...
It's cooler.
"Yeah, it is, isn't it?"
It is very cool.
Bow ties are cool!
"No, the room."
The room is getting colder.
She's coming back!
What's she going to do?
Is she going to punish me?
Uh... uh...
She's learnt not to melt.
"Of course, she's not really a governess, she's just a beast."
She's going to eat you.
Run.
"Children, what is exp..."
Who the devil are you?
!
What are you doing in my house?
It's OK!
"I am your governess' gentleman friend, and we've just been upstairs... kissing!"
"Captain Latimer, in the garden, there's snowmen!"
"And they're just growing, out of nowhere, all by themselves - look!"
"Good evening, I'm a lizard woman from the dawn of time and this is my wife!"
This dwelling is under attack!
"Remain calm, human scum!"
So!
Any questions?

[BOTH grunting ]
We've got some unfinished business in Texas.
JOSlAH:
All right.
Take him away.
I know you wanted him alive.
You did what you had to.
I can't clear my name if I'm dead.
Well...
"... youwin,Mother."
You alwaysdo.
"Well, of course, darling. I've known you since you were an itty-bitty baby."
That's always gonna be my trump card.
That's a mother's advantage.
"Now, come here and give me a kiss before I leave."
EZRA:
You're leaving?
But your place is a gold mine.
It's booming.
"Well, that's the whole idea."
You buy a depressed property.
You get it going...
... andsellit at  the height of it's popularity.
I made a fortune.
"Spend it in good health, Mother."
"Oh, I already did."
I reinvested it in another very depressed property.
You aren't.
He doesn't mix with dirty Arabs like you!
Dirty Arabs?
Reminds me of waterboarding.
You got a bathtub in here?
Buildings and Investments operate through the Pole Pot Bank.
"Forget the bank, I want the banker!"
"Apart from banking, what does the banker do?"
Walk his dachshund through the park?

The theater.
He took a shine to some piss pot actress.
Care to impart her pseudonym?
Aglaé.
Gla Gla!
That tip would have saved your hide.
"Unfortunately, I have a kiss from Mary."
- What can I do for you?
- Nothing!
Why do I make a show of it?
Because... you're my friend.
"You know what I feel, right now, here?"
I'll tell you.
I'm gonna barf.
What am I good for?
Nothing gives.
Makes a void inside.
You got religion?
No!
Here.
Someone]
Whoa!
Nana!
How you doing?
Looking hot in the tracksuit.
Gym's on the second floor.
[J.D.] Date time.
Dude.
There you are.
Two things.
"First, aliens are here wearing tracksuits."
"- Oh, no, that's Nana."
- Second...
I got a job.
- Nice.
"- If you hadn't pushed me to do that extra mile stuff, that wouldn't have happened, so thank you."
You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar.
You go get her!
- Where were we?
- Do I smell banana conditioner?
"That's one of my conditioners, yes."
"[J.D.] As great as this was, I couldn't stop thinking about what Turk said..."
This girl really digs hair.
It's hard getting what happens at the hospital out of your head.
Ah!
How was your first stress-free day?
Horrible.
You?
Worse.
Let's make a baby.
"If it doesn't work this time, I'll kill myself."
Not helping with the stress.
Enough.
"Come on, what the hell has gotten into you the last couple of days?"
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You think I can't do this by myself?
You think I'm on something?
"- ""On something""?"
- Yeah.
- I never said you were on something.
- Then don't.
Don't start.
"Hey, now we're talkin' here."
She's a killer.
You're goddamn right I'm a killer.
You look like a Holocaust victim in pageant makeup.
"- I will eat your babies, bitch."
- Bring it!
- Nobody's eating babies.
"- Hey, you lookin' to spar, little girl?"
- No.
No fight.
She's not ready.
"- Oh, I'm ready."
"- No, you're not ready."
- I'm ready!
Let me eat her babies.
"- What about next Friday, huh?"
- Yeah.
How's Friday?
- You're crazy.
- How's Friday to you?
"What's the matter, ""Frankie Fat Hands""?"
- You're afraid she's gonna get knocked out just like you did?
That land was already sold to the state when you planted your mine.
No one's taken that trail in 50 years.
Hauser.
But thanks for telling me where to dig.
So have you found the twin tree?
It's you.
You're here.
And so are you.
"Officer Hauser, the twin tree..."
any leads?
Not yet.
But I'm working on it.
- Day and night.
"- Well, I'm here to help."
In those shoes?
"Well, I thought we could start with you asking me to dinner."
I found the twin tree.
And Petty's last bomb.
So much death from something so small.
You know her methods?
Fix her.

Doctor Tarras?
I'm a patient.
Máximo Gascón.
"Yes, please."
"It won't take long, just a minute."
Doctor Tarras?
I don't know if you remember some days ago you put me a tooth cap.
And... it's moving.
I'm sorry.
Didn't know it was that late.
"Alright, at the clinic."
I'm sorry for waking you up.
Goodbye.
Thank you very much.
Federico?
It's Max.
Were you having dinner?
"Well, don't worry."
It's not urgent.
"No, I just wanted to end the other day discussion."
Because...
I think you cut the conversation in a very frivolous way.
Yes.
You said I was a fanatic intellectual..
From the 17th century searching for the absolute truth.
Well...
I'm not trying to sermonize you.
I just wanted to end the discussion.
"Okay, go eat your dinner."
"Normal saline, wide open."
"Four milligrams morphine, IV Push, PRN."
"Immobilize that spine with a collar, side head supports, and straps."
Be very careful.
"Okay, that's a roger."
The respiration is rapid and shallow.
"Oh, yeah."
Easy.
Did he say anything about who hit him?
"No, man, he didn't say anything."
Easy.
There we go.
Sugar.
"Ollie, he's going to crump on me."
Can you...
Do you want me to pull over?
"I got it, I'm styling."
Just get us there.
Watch for Mary.
Listen for her bell.
It's a death bell.
"I'm bagging away here, but I'm getting airway resistance."
Has his trachea deviated?
"Big time, to the right."
Fudgebar.
He's going V-Fib.
"The fun never ends, huh?"
Clear.
"Come on, Danny."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're back."
"Liz, get a cutdown tray ready for chest tube insertion, please."
You okay with this one?
You watch your job!
I don't understand him.
What's this man talking about?
"Come on, boys, don't be crazy."
Because of you all the gang is at a stand-still.
"-Boys, come on."
-No boys.
Look.
-Reproduction artists.
"-We are starting a new life, boss."
"-Here is the agreement, master."
"-""Group Biceps""."
-We are going down the artistic road.
-Therefore... we can fuck this job.
"Cursed, fucking job!"
"Excuse me, do you have some cursed, fucking job for us?"
And now we will play for our Rose from the canteen.
This is a magnificent feeling!
Splendid.
Indeed.
How does it work?
What's wrong with you?
"Well, what's up?"
Nothing.
I'm working.
"Well, you're working, but this isn't working."
You're right.
And does yours work?
I can't see a button anywhere.
Maybe it's centrally controlled somehow.
A kind of central control.
Hallo!
"Have you got a cold, Ed?"
I didn't have a minute... didn't have a minute ago.
"Scratch me there, will you?"
- Here?
-(sneezes)
"Boy, this usually only happens when I'm... when I'm around dogs."
(sneezes)
- You got a dog?
"-Uh, yes, I have, Ed."
- Maybe you'd better go.
-Huh?
"Oh, no, no, no."
I'm all right.
"It's just, uh, the..."
Whose dog is it?
It's mine.
I got it at the pound.
But please don't say anything to Ralph about it before I do.
He doesn't think we should have a dog in the apartment.
"Oh, no, no, no, I won't."
I won't.
I won't.
"I'd like to look at the dog, if you don't mind."
"Well, do you think you should, Ed?"
"Oh, I'm-I'm all right."
It's just... (begins to sneeze) ...just after the initial attack is over then I'm all right.
I want to look at the pooch.
Where is he?
"Hi, there, little poochy boy!"
"Oh, what a beautiful dog this is."
Hey!
Hey!
Alex looks nervous.
"Oh, God, I hope I'm doing the right thing."
I think you are.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the party is about to get started."
The dance floor is all yours!
"Okay, girls, lick your lips."
Come in close.
It's good to see ya.
Tell Claire I'm looking for her.
Your husband's a lucky guy.
- Mmm.
- Oh!
- Waiter!
Can we have more dressing?
- We were separated at birth.
"Two more drinks when you get a chance, please."
That would be nice.
This looks delicious.
I'm so happy.
I can't believe he's married.
I can't believe he chose Claire over you.
- I can.
- I told you not to introduce them.
"Well, she already had a husband."
I thought it was safe.
- How are you handling all this?
- I've learned my lesson.
No more fantasies about good-looking men.
You never know.
There's a guy out there somewhere for you.
"Oh, yeah?"
Who?
There's been a breach in the sim room.
JEANINE:
Get me a remote feed.
I wanna see who the hell is in there.
"The cameras are down in the sector, too."
I'm sending guards there now.
Let's go.
Bring up every cell.
Now.
Show her.
Tori finally found a way to get 'em out safely.
EVELYN:
How many others?
Every last one.
Let's go.
SOLDIER:
"South corridor, 40 yards down."
Tris?
"Tris, come on, we gotta move."
"Tris, we have to move."
I can't.
I can't.
My mom died protecting whatever's inside of this.
I have to open it for her and I think I know how.
"Tris, if we don't leave now, we're not gonna get outta here."
I have to do this first.
"Look, I know it doesn't make any sense, but you have to trust me, please."
"With my life, apparently."
MAN ON PA:
"All security teams, be advised, breach in..."
Do it.
MAX:
We had you in the top three for St Trinian's with Ricky from Kaiser Chiefs.
Did he do it in the end?
Yeah.
You weren't available.
LAUGHTER
Cheers(!
) That was a narrow miss.
Yeah.
What did you do before you became fabulous?
You were a beautician?
I was a beauty school dropout.
"Oh, lovely."
From Grease.
Now you're getting down to my level.
So that means you can look at people and make judgments.
Be very honest.
OK.
"Noel Fielding, Rob Brydon."
Two out there guys.
If you had to...
Give me a minute.
"If you had to pick, if you had to single out one for being a little bit styly..."
"Oh, I don't know."
It depends whether I like smart guys or Camden guys.
Suddenly there's a rivalry between us.
I like a bit of both.
Do you?
Oh...!
LAUGHTER
Did I?
"I wasn't, was I?"
I just didn't imagine I'd be having a threesome with Rob Brydon.
You didn't tell me about Amiri.
What's that got to do with it?
The difference between us is that I don't bug you.
Hide as much as you like.
"No, Dorona, the difference between us is that Ricky is crazy about you, God knows why."
"Amiri, on the other hand, just doesn't love me."
That's why he left.
"And yes, I'd love to be a surrogate mother for you if I could."
"Sure, sure."
"Look who's here, Elijah the Prophet."
Raziya says it's okay.
What?
You could have asked what my size is.
I asked Haziya.
You can come in it's a public place.
- Why did you come?
- To the sauna?
I'm cold.
To Paris.
Was it my brothers' idea?
- Then why?
- Because I love you.
- Those are just words.
"- True,"
- but they're kind words.
- For who?
- You're so beautiful.
"- Yeah, sure."
You're naked!
So what?
This is Europe.
Everyone goes in the sauna naked.
General Zavros has a point.
"Let's go, professor."
The Treasure of Atlantis awaits.
Lord Cleeve is right.
We cannot afford to have you follow us.
"Oh, MacGyver!"
"Kelly, try to get this rope over your head."
Come on.
Ohhh!
Come on.
Oh!
You okay?
I can't believe Atticus would do that.
Oh.
"His passion, Cleeve's greed."
It makes sense.
I'm sorry.
I know you looked up to him.
Used to.
We did exactly what Cleeve wanted us to.
"Now he and Zavros are going to steal the Treasure of Atlantis, thanks to us."
Maybe not.
Cleeve's estate.
Let's find it.
Kind of looks like they're planning a trip.
We can't let them take off with the artifacts.
I know.
Wait here.
Just look at it.
Unlike anything the world has seen in thousands of years.
It is truly magnificent.
Probably the finest item I'll ever acquire.
[Laughs]
[Gasps]
Daddy?
I consider myself a reasonable merman.
"I set certain rules, and I expect those rules to be obeyed."
"But, Dad, I..."
Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?
I had to...
Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.
"Ariel, you know that!"
Everyone knows that.
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.
"Spineless, savage, harpooning fish-eaters incapable of any feeling..."
"Daddy, I love him!"
[gasps]
No!
Have you lost your senses completely?
He's a human.
You're a mermaid.
I don't care.
"So help me, Ariel, I am going to get through to you."
"And if this is the only way, so be it!"
Daddy!
No!
No!
Please!
"Daddy, stop!"
I'm not going to help you.
This is hilarious.
She's also dating an astronaut.
Wow.
That's very impressive.
Yeah.
"But Leonard's impressive, too."
Thank you.

"The word I was looking for was ""befuddled."""
Knight to old woman... six-and-a-third.
Brilliant move.
Thank you.
Will the two of you excuse me?
I need a hug.
"Sorry, I have company."
"Come on, Sheldon, open the door."
I don't want to hug you.
"I don't want to hug you, either."
I was just feeling blue.
"Blue, as in depressed."
"Well, not so much depressed as lonely."
I don't know what color lonely is.
- What?
- Red is angry;
yellow is frightened;
green is jealous;
and blue is depressed.
Perhaps we can assign a color to lonely.
Nothing rhymes with orange.
It's probably lonely.
All right.
"A moment, please."
Get out.
Get out of my life.
Get out of France.
But you have everything you ever wanted.
And more power than you.
I'm your mother.
I am ruling scotland
For you...
Do that.
"And mind me, do it well."
"When I return to scotland, to our home,"
"It will either be because you have failed,"
Or because you are dead.
Mary:
"After dinner, your usual game of catch"
"With anne, james is going"

Promise me you'll try.
"One year of marriage, it isn't enough."
"Fight, francis, please."
I will give you children.
Don't give up on our dreams.
On the life we could have.
Such a beautiful dream.

"No, francis, don't leave me."
Catherine:
So many years before them.
It's all right.
What are you talking about?
"Baby, you just hit a home run"
On your very first try!
I think you're actually the first kid in history
To ever do that.
"come on, you have to be a little bit excited."
Did you see those parents' faces?
Everybody was like-- they were screaming!
I was screaming!
It was so good!
We have to do my family tree.
"No, that's not due for another week."
It's due tomorrow.
No.
"No, it's due on the--"
"The 27th, i think."
"I put it in my calendar, 'cause i didn't wanna forget that..."
"Oh, fuck."
What did you say?
Nothing.
Sorry.
are you fucking kidding me?
Hey.
God.
Hey!
Thank you so much.
Do not worry.
We've got this.

We came out anyway.
So you walked over me?
Why is that so important?
We got out and that's it.

I can't believe this. I can't believe this. I hate everyone.
Obviously I told my mother.
But all I said was you were hot for him.
Why did you even tell her that?
"Now, my mother thinks we slept together."
Okay.
Do you want my mother to call your mother...
and tell her you didn't sleep together?
I could do that.
- H i honey.
- Hey fag.
Go to hell.
Maybe later.
I have something for you.
is that perfume I smell?
"You know you are boring, don't you?"
- Turd head.
You need something?
But I beat them black and blue.
My name's inspector Zoravar Singh.
I can make arose stink.
Give a swine swine-flu.
And give lice to a bald head.
Listen.
You can't even lie properly.
- Shiv the truth is...
- Kamini!
He's no brave officer.
Kamini!
- He's a coward cop.
- Kamini.
- What?
- Kamini.
Kamini.
Calm down.
He's been beaten up by the local thugs.
You're not worthy of being my husband.
I say you're not worthy of this uniform either.
Inspector!
What did she hurl at me witch.
Nephew.
It's like this.
I'm actually a sub-inspector.
I couldn't become an inspector.
You see.
I had been appointed for the security... of that crazy ACP Ayushman Thakur's sister.
Now how do I go with this broken hand?
You don't get it.
See.
What are you doing?
(Gasps)
"But really, you could've just asked me for the keys."
Once Upon A Time 2x06
"- Tallahassee Original air date November 4, 2012"
Just drive.
It's fine.
I just stole your car.
Your life could be in danger.
Neal Cassidy.
"Yeah, I'm not telling you my name."
"No, I don't need it to have you arrested when the robbery's in progress."
Emma.
Swan.
Good name.
"So do you just live in here, or are you just waiting for the car to be stolen?"
Why don't I tell you over drinks?
- Excuse me?
- Hey.
Eyes on the road.
(Horn blares)
I am not having drinks with you.
You might be a pervert.
"I might be a pervert, but you're definitely a car thief."
I said I was sorry.
"You didn't, actually."
(Siren whoops)
Oh.
Damn it.
"That's why I said, ""eyes on the road."""
Screwdriver.
(Grunts)
License and registration.
- What?
"- They stole it, it's ours!"
"I'll show you.0100 years, for that pigeon!"
- Won't Elisa be pleased.
"- Yes, she will."
Mind you don't hurl it.
"Fly home quickly, to Elisa."
Tell her we're coming!
"I said I'd fulfil your every wish, right?"
"Yes, your Highness."
And I shall!
You saved my life.
But this will be my keepsake.
"Never take it off, I got it from the devil."
How did you know we wouldn't drown?
I can't swim.
"A miller and water, we're body and soul."
And I'm friends with a watersprite.
"I name you my highest commander,"
I'll give you a house in the city and every year on this day...
Isn't it enough?
Just tell me.
"No, your Highness"
I don't know what I'd do with that.
But if I can really have a wish...
Henry!
Elisa!
"Terry, come, quickly, daddy's back!"
Theresa...
Welcome home.
That's our pigeon!
Look...
"You know, we gotta ask god's will"
"In your life, and he'll change things."
I think he talked to me today.
I'm sure he did.
"Oh, regina."
"Oh, baby."
"- Oh, look at me."
- ma.
"Now you know, like saul,"
"You can pick yourself up,"
Dust yourself off and go on forward.
You know?
"And listen,"
I owe you an apology.
I don't ever want you to think
"That i'm not proud of you,"
Because i am.
You're a very ambitious woman
And a very strong woman.
You're my daughter and i love you dearly.
"i want my daughter back, ma."
I owe her so many apologies.
- Oh baby.
- I don't know what to say.
I think i have missed every opportunity.
I...
I'll never have a chance to be a good mother.
"- Oh yes, you will."
- And i lost the man that i love.
"Oh regina, it's not over."
"And i'm gonna apologize to you, mama."
"- For what, baby?"
- Who else lives in this house?
- Nobody.
- Who?
- The watchman.
- What's his name?
- Antonio.
- Who is Sebastian?
- I don't know.
- Stop.
- Where is Sebastian?
I said stop!
Sit down.
Do you know who Carmen and Estrella were?
"Before they killed them, they tortured them."
With a hunting knife and pliers.
They ripped off their nipples.
They cut off their toes.
They stuck something in their ass and vagina until they bled.
They were awake the whole time.
You can't imagine how much pain a person can bear before fainting.
I didn't know.
"I didn't know, I didn't know..."
Look at me.
What's the watchman's name?
Sebastian.
He came looking for work and I hired him.
His mother was my friend.
- He needed to hide.
- Hide from what?
I don't know.
He had changed a lot.
I hardly recognized him.
- Henry's right.
"- You're out, too."
"- Hey, wait a minute, Henry."
We had a deal.
"I help you, we take it down together."
The deal's changed.
I don't want anyone else to die.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Who's going to die?
Since when did you become altruistic?
What the hell's going on?
It was a mistake to involve you.
Wait a second.
"You know who it is, don't you?"
Anyone else dies Henry and I am holding you personally responsible.
I work better alone.
Stay out of my way.
She's too powerful.
Henry!
That's great!
I mean that's just great.
So now I've got two of them running around the city.
He's doing it to protect us.
She's been watching him.
She's probably been watching him all night.
She?
And he's figured out who it is and he's protecting her.
The woman behind the vampire...
Christina.
And who the hell is Christina?
Trouble.
What?
You know who that is?
You may have met Ted and Alma.
- Ted is still -
"- Oh, I know them."
You know them?
Ted is still volunteering up on the palliative care.
- I knew them very well.
- Yes.
Okay?
So you know some of these people?
Um -
This is the original deed... for the house down on Cecil Street... in 1918.
"It was found recently, and we've had it framed to go with the photographs."
Okay?
That's where Baycrest came from - a house all those years ago.
- And my husband's somewhere here too.
- Yep.
Yeah.
Isn't that great?
This is the auditorium.
- And -
- That should be him.
I should remember this.
[Chattering]
And this is the gift that Al gave us.
He gave us all these photographs that you see here.
All the way down the walls.
Look.
But you come and have a look here.
"- Now - - [Ida] Oh, for goodness' sake."
How do ya like that one?
Find her!
(YELPlNG )
Find the scent of human girlNand earn your freedom.
as well?
Everyone will go home.
(sniffing )
(BARKS )
Dogs will believe anything.
(chuckling )
It looks like you ran afoul of somethingNwith wicked claws.
And I'm still dreaming.
What did that to you?
-Banner or Bander...
N-The Bandersnatch?
I'd better have a look.
What are you doing? or it will fester and putrefy.
I'd rather you didn't.Nl'll be fine as soon as I wake up.
At least let me bind it for you.
-What do you call yourself?
N-Alice.
The Alice?
-There's been some debate about that.N-l never get involved in politics.
You'd best be on your way.
What way?
All I want to do isNwake up from this dream.
Fine.
but that's the end of it.
Coming?
(MARCH HARE snoring )
(JAZZ music playing )
(EX claims )
(YAWNlNG )
Oh...
Out of time.
You found two answers...
And what you are looking for was transformer.
"This is the stuff you know, guys, isn't it?"
"Difficult to find in the hive, though."
Not particularly.
Not that kind of physics.
Not electronics.
"Well, not bad then, in that case."
"You got two points, well done."
"Team Araucarians, over to you."
Which topic would you like?
We have left...
We're good on...
"Music's not good for any of us, is it?"
No.
"Well, maybe me."
I work in technology.
"Technology, yeah."
Go for it.
Technology.
You've chosen technology.
You're looking for typefaces.
You've ten seconds to confer.
Typefaces?
"Helvetica, Comic Sans, Garamond, Arial, Times New Roman..."
Helvetica - we've had that.
Yeah.
Courier...
Time's up.
"Simon, at the far end, we're going to start with you."
Was that Damon Salvatore you were with?
The one and only.
Do you know him?
We go way back.
He still live out by Miller Lane?
He lives in the old boarding house.
By Wickery Bridge.
He's still in there if you wanna say hi.
I'd rather stay here and talk to you.
Oh.
Nice.
Very smooth with the shoe and the flirt.
But I'm a little drunk.
And hot guy plus drunk me equals very bad things.
I'm pretty sure you'd like it.
I'm sorry.
That was a seriously lame pick-up.
I'm sorry.
That's a nice scent you're wearing.
What is it?
I don't know.
"Ha, ha."
It was a gift.
"And that is a cab, so..."
Vervain.
Making it hard to find something to eat in this town.
- Caroline.
- I don't wanna talk about it.
You're being ridiculous.
"And insecure and stupid, but that doesn't change the fact that Matt's in love with you and I'm the backup."
- You're not the backup.
"- Yes, I am."
"No hat, no problem."
Another score for the cat fan.
Hey.
Hey.
Want some necklace?
"How about you, man?"
Ew.
You got it all spitty.
Tastes better that way.
Good.
"Hey, Harriet, what are you writing?"
Notes.
Can we read them?
Can you read this?
"Okay, okay."
I just wanted to know why you're always writing like a maniac.
I want to remember everything.
I want to know everything.
"Well, you must realize, Harriet, knowing everything won't do you a bit of good unless you use it to put beauty in this world."
True or false?
True.
Of course it is.
"Harriet, your mother called."
She's going to be late.
"Come on, Sport, Janie."
I'll have you home before dinner.
Golly always takes us places.
She sees things other people barely notice.
She's my nanny and...
"well, she's Golly."
"Okay, survey of the day."
Today's question is:
"What an interesting palm you've got, Christine."
Can you read palms?
A bit.
"This line here, for instance, means lots of love but not every love is a happy love."
So?
Tell me.
I don't know enough about it.
I might frighten you.
Why?
is it scary...or dangerous?
I see more loves in your present life than just me.
There's someone else...
Tell me I don't mind.
Yes.
I see a young man.
He's beautiful.
Yes.
He lives in... I see letters.
"K, and O with dots on top..."
is that German?
"Yes, Köln, or Cologne is where he lives."
You're really good at it.
"If you want me to go on, I need something tangible of his."
Something tangible?
- A key or a lock of hair or...
- A letter.
- Could work.
You got one?
- l'll get it.
- Here.
"- No, I don't want to read it."
Or you'll think it's all a trick.
Splendid.
- Your time's running out.
"- Uh, I think it was closer to the waterfall."
"You see, I buried it at night, and I..."
Find it!
Yes.
- Roger!
- Babs.!
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't.
It was too dangerous.
You might get hurt.
Oh.
Terrific idea.
"Now, look, you better find it or..."
You buried the money here?
A year ago.
Only everything's changed so much I haven't been able to find it.
"I'm not a thief, Babs."
Well...
Really I'm not.
It was just so tempting.
But I decided to turn it in for the reward money.
Only I had to find it first.
And today's the only day I could get in here without making everyone suspicious.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Even if you wanted to keep the money and be a thief.
Just tell me you wanted to marry me.
Of course.
Didn't you get my proposal?
The postcard.
"You heard what I said, keep playing."
"I told you I never wanted to see you in these parts again, Black Bart."
I'll have to blow you away.
[fires cap gun]
"I got you, fall down."
"Okay, you want to play?"
I'll play with you.
Come on out.
"Let's see if your gun's as loud as your mouth,"
Sheriff.
I'll pick where to make my stand.
[fires and giggles]
Hold it.
"Smile, cowboy."
"I got it, Harry."
[laughs]
"[Billy] Bang, bang, bang!"
Whoo-hoo.
"mom, you should of seen it."
This outlaw chased me all over and then he tried to shoot me.
But he shot the head right off this fake Indian.
- Were you scared?
- No.
"Hey, I told you you'd like it."
"Thanks for bringing me, Mom, it's excellent."
"Well, here you go, you guys."
"Uh, I'm gonna go upstairs for a while, I think."
"You have a good time, okay?"
"Uh, say, uh,"
I think we ought to talk.
"See, uh..."
I know this is real hard on you.
"Hogarth, we've been through this before."
No pets.
"But he's not a pet, Mom."
He's a friend.
We've got to rent a room if we're gonna make ends meet...
... andnoonewants shredded upholstery.
You won't know he's there.
I'II cage him.
until you feel sorry for him and set him free in the house!
"Do you remember the raccoon, Hogarth?"
I remember the raccoon.
"please, Mom, at Ieast look at him."
AII right.
Where is this guy?
I can't read this handwriting.
"That one should have lettuce, tomato, extra mayo."
"I will go get him, okay?"
So he wants us to hold the mayo and the mustard.
How about just hold the flavor altogether?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sir?
Excuse me--!
-What's that?
-please don't move.
My pet's under your table.
Don't look!
"If you make a scene, my mom won't let me keep him."
"-What kind of pet, kid?"
-A squirrel.
He's friendly.
"I'm telling the truth, dang it!"
"As long as she's breathing, we've got fate up against the ropes."
There he is.
"All right, so the bike was stolen in Emeryville."
Head back towards the Bay Bridge.
Okay.
There's your man.
Go to the toll plaza.
- There!
- Yes!
"Okay, the wrist."
Can you max that image?
Can I max that image...
"What can you tell from a tattoo, or whatever that is?"
You're looking at a guy that solved a triple murder in Cole Valley off a bent coke spoon.
Can you make that any clearer?
Not with the tools at hand.
"All right, send me a screen cap."
I'll send it to Jenny.
She'll work on it.
Go back to where he stole the bike...
Hollis and 38th.
He had to have put on the helmet somewhere.
"All right, so, here he is at 60th... 57th..."
That's weird.
Okay.
It's okay.
I'll get him at 48th.
Is the camera broken?
"No, they're different cameras."
Go back to 60th.
What?
Somebody's erasing this... right now.
- Yes.
- Go!
- OK!
- Spend a good night?
-Yes.
"I bought a good one, boyo!"
"- What's up, Felix?"
"- Nothing, pal!"
- Did you make move?
- I'm on Gemma.
"Want a teammate, anything wrong?"
That's not true as you said.
The set is definitely not gold.
No matter how much we might want him to.
It's just a matter of confidence.
And this is an area that I maybe help you out.
"My side, honey."
"Come on, I'm so excited."
Anyway you like!
"Hi, Gemma."
"- Hello, Felix."
- Can we talk?
Okay.
"I mean, obviously, you are my league, but I thought it out just because it worths me."
As what?
If you would like to go out with me sometime.
Something like a coffee or a film.
Sit.
Paul?
I do not think of you in the same way as you expect.
But I'm sure there's someone else helps it out.
You just have to be brave and keep looking.
So why didn't they--
Why didn't they use Dave?
Because Dave was late to get in makeup.
"But by the time we did the scene, he was ready."
They just said no.
"I don't know, really."
Hi.
"I got you, man."
I got you.
We had people standing by.
We had no idea what we could do without Toxie.
And nobody could call.
But let's just-- can we get past this?
All we did was this long shot with a fucking
Shitload of smoke.
"Yeah, can we do it again with me?"
All right.
Let's see what I can do.
DAVE:
Tell me what you want me to do.
All right.
Trent give me some blocking here.
TRENT HAAGA:
Do you want to pick this one up from that point?
Just have him get up--
Can we just fill him up with smoke
And have him bring the kids on again?
Why?
I don't want to do it again.
-All right.
-Absolutely not.
"In fact, if it happens again, there's gonna"
I...
I think what you're doing is wonderful.
You came to see him?
He'll be here.
Just have to wait.
Come here.
Come here.
What's the matter?
Something wrong?
Myocardial metastases.
Cancer of the heart muscle.
"Super rare, right?"
They wrote an article about me in a magazine.
"It's in my room, if you want to see it."
"Apparently, I could croak from one day to the next... from one minute to the next."
- Jeremy.
- Nathan.
"What do you do, Nathan?"
I'm a lawyer.
Do you know if he's going to be long?
"The first doc I saw, you know what he called it?"
"""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."""
Wow.
Can you believe that guy?
"You and me, we're gonna slap that that son-of-a-bitch with a lawsuit."
What do you say?
"Legally, that's not exactly my bag."
"Jeremy, hello."
- Up already?
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday.
"- Yeah, thanks."
Cheaper than plastic surgery.
How's the bite?
I'm not howling at the moon.
There is no moon.
- How did it go?
- What?
The meeting.
It was boring.
You went?
Yeah.
"I just said it was boring, didn't I?"
"Sorry, they didn't give me a card."
You went for you or because you promised me you would?
Is this guy gonna look like hamburger?
More like ground chuck.
I went for you.
- You're gonna need some more people.
- Why?
"Come on, hard restraints!"
- No IV?
-20 of morphine before he pulled out.
"- Sir, we need you to hold still."
"- Come on, Gallant, keep him on the table."
"-100 of fent, two of Ativan."
"- Page Surgery, Plastics, Head and Neck."
- Could be PCP.
- Or the gunshot wound.
"Sir, we're gonna help you."
But you gotta hold still...
- ... while we get the morphine into you.
"- Okay, pressure 100/80."
"- Pulse, 150."
These gentlemen came to see the house.
They were just leaving.
Good afternoon.
- Who is that?
Do you know him?
- The watchman?
Never seen him in my life.
"Take a stroll, Jesus."
Drive.
I'll tell you where to go.
Go inside.
Go on.
Have a seat.
"Eugenio, give them something to drink, it's hot."
"The heroin Rodrigo found was mine, but he didn't find it, he stole it."
But I didn't kill anyone.
That's Fermin over there.
Angelita is his wife.
You've already met.
She's not psychic.
Fermin was at the farmhouse the night the girls were killed.
He knows more than what was in the well.
But there's a price.
What do you want?
Withdraw the Civil Guard from the Point.
Okay or not?
- Okay.
"- Tell them, Fermin."
I saw the man who threw the bag in the well.
- What did he look like?
"- I didn't see his face, it was too dark."
"But he was normal, a normal person."
"Shut, fucking you, right!"
She's just want to bring you up.
So easy!
I'll go to another announcement.
I got a placement to work and gone.
"Congratulations, dude."
6 months.
And I am to start in September.
And...?
"The fucking practice,"
"All do I ... shippings, all the high power plants,..."
Shipping costing world!
Smile everyone!
"It's not ideal, obviously, but..."
Are you to need a train right away?
It isn't America or something?
You're deciding too fast!
I just found out this afternoon.
Look!
"Look, look, look!"
"You're right, I shall discuss with them."
"What's up, guys!"
He's the laugh dog.
Luke!
"What's up, bro?"
So...
- What do you get for us?
- For Paul also...
"How about a drop of the white stuff, tickle soft?"
"Paul first, doen't he?"
I should not...
"- Almost for Paul, man."
Interesting.
No judgment here.
"- Sarge, I have to pee now too."
- Seriously?
"You, Diaz?"
"Look, I'll turn off at the next exit, okay?"
- I have to pee really badly.
- Hot.
- What?
- Hitchcock!
"- Guys, enough!"
- Sarge--
"- Yeah, I know!"
"You got to pee, I got it!"
"- No, brake lights!"
"- Oh, crap."
- Everyone hang on!
There's no side-impact airbags!
- Did you get breakfast?
"- I tried, but I got recognized."
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- Do you watch a lot of pornography?
'Cause I'm in most of it.
"- Oh, boy."
What if you were followed?
I don't think it's safe to stay here.
- Where are we gonna go?
- The cops?
- Or Figgis!
Do we have any weapons?
- I have the pipe we pulled out of me.
- I would sooner surrender than go anywhere near your gooey body pipe.
SvenPense!
"He saw his eyes, all terrified."
You said he was.
I chose to save that poor life.
What?
"-He will tell their friends, spread terror."
There's a new predator in the area.
-You're crazy!
-Someone needs to control the number of individuals of species.
-I deserve.
Wearethechampions My friends
And we'll keep fighting until the end
If -sees!
-I am the champion!
-Am champion!
It's a musical delight.
Will is the first sign of madness.
We champion
-How is the shoulder?
-Okay.
Boot a little ice it improves.
Thank you.
"No, I thank you."
"Thank you, friend."
"Brian, the king of the beach, will have another season."
That made you a friend of elephant seals.
"As we speak, children?"
"Thank you, buddy to bring Daddy back."
"-I owe you, my friend."
"-Health, Brian."
"No, I mean it."
You only need to ask.
"Oh, right, yeah."
Them the ones with the pointy houses?
"Pyramids, yeah."
"Please, guys, you can call me Rambo."
"I said Rambo could join us for dinner tonight, eh, Grumio?"
"Fine, yeah."
There is no dinner.
Right.
First-class slaving.
It's cool.
I've got my dad's charge card for the Emporium if you wanna run and grab some stuff.
Wicked.
"I mean, I'd rather not run but..."
"So take the sedan, if you like."
Yeah.
I do like.
Excuse me.
"No, no, no, not you again."
Shoo!
Hop it.
I will not allow you to ravage our luxury foods.
"How about I buy 'em, then?"
Ptolemy Hachmenenet?
"Is the name of my master, yes."
He sent me to fetch his scran.
"And I am absolutely delighted you chose us, sir."
Pray tell what your master is craving and I will do my utmost to help.
I thought you might.
"Well, he mainly likes meat."
Lovely.
Shall I fetch a basket?
"Get a trolley, I would."
"Vic, come on."
"It's, uh... been a pretty rough ride lately..."
Enough I'm thinking about gettin' off the train.
You wanna give up your badge?
I'm lookin' for a sign.
Seen any around?
You don't wanna give it up.
–Retirement's been pretty good to you.
–A forced retirement.
Believe me.
I still miss it.
We can hit the links together every day.
What's bothering you now?
"When, uh..."
When we were ridin'... you ever feel like you went too far?
Yeah.
"Couple times, maybe."
Probably.
Definitely.
"Hell, you can't always land just right."
Goin' too far will get you fired.
Not goin' far enough will get you killed.
I never lost any sleep over it though.
"Anyway, we always did more good than bad, right?"
Right.
That's the key.
–Yeah.
"That's him, all right."
–Yeah.
–Good.
–Anything else we can do?
She was such a nice girl.
Boy:
Shake it!
Shake it!
Shake it!
But Jules and Laurie are!
What?
How?
We're going in!
"Laurie, this is why I love you!"
I can do anything when I'm with--
Laurie?

Come in.
Merry Christmas.
It's been a long time.
It is Christmas.
You don't have to explain a gift.
Thank you.
Come in.
Let me take your coat.
I can only stay a moment.
I have to deliver a few more things.
- Can I fix you a drink?
"- No, thank you."
"Well, come in, sit down."
"Well, I really came to... ."
Is it true that you might go to Portland?
"Well, I've received the offer."
"It's a larger school, and naturally, much more money."
- You'll take it.
- I don't know.
I have a week to make up my mind.
Sit down.
- Michael?
- Yes?
You were right.
I never thought I could say it but you were right.
- About what?
"During the past months, I've been able to come to a few conclusions about myself."
- And what were they?
"- Well, Michael, I've lied so long."
"I was everything you said, especially that night in the kitchen."
I wanted you more than you wanted me.
- I had no right to say those things.
Miss.
Are you scared of going with me?
No.
"I'd like to see for myself, what you're going to offer him."
You're insane!
"Why, you as well?"
!
Who are you?
"Tell your leader,"
I'm So Seo-No from Yeon Ta-Bal's clan.
I want to see the bandit leader.
"Came by yourself, didn't you?"
You really are something.
"The Commander isn't here now,"
"Until he comes back, throw this girl into the cell."
Yes.
Miss!
Miss!
What's going on?
Is the entire fleet captured?
"Not that,"
Miss decided to come on her own accord.
What?
Are you crazy?
How can you deliver yourself to him?
A blessing to see you're doing well.
"Seriously,"
Did you really come here yourself?
Yes.
Now... what exactly were you thinking?
Are you hurt?
Miss!
- That's it!
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.
"Thank you, King."
"Well, Tex, you've been good to me all these years."
It's the least I could do.
"Whatever happens, you're a winner to me, you old daddy rabbit."
"Thanks, dear."
Wouldn't be nothing without you.
Kch-i-ka-chow!
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.
"We're, like, your biggest fans!"
Ka-chow!
I love being me.
"- OK, girls, that's it."
"- We love you, Lightning!"
"Hey, buddy."
You're one gutsy racer.
"Oh, hey, Mr. The King."
You got more talent in one lug nut than a lot of cars has got in their whole body.
- Really?
"Oh, that..."
- But you're stupid.
- Excuse me?
"- This ain't a one-man deal, kid."
You need to wise up and get a good crew chief and a good team.
"You ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you, and you let them do their job, like they should."
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.
Yeah...
Ka-chow!
- Can...
"Can we think about going to the doctor, please?"
Oh.
"Edwin, did you hear my grandson?"
He says I have to go to the doctor.
Is that so?
I was a doctor for 47 years.
How do I look?
"- Oh, okay by me."
Yeah.
- [Chuckling]
- Appointment done.
"- Meemaw, please."
Have something to eat.
The steaks are a buck.
I'm not hungry right now.
Why not?
Is there something wrong with you?
"No, I just..."
I promised Mom that I would take you to the doctor.
That's all.
I'm trying to be a good person here.
I'm trying to be a good son.
I'll tell your mom how fabulous you are.
I'm trying to show her that I have responsibility as well.
Okay?
But you're doing something responsible.
You're-
- You're elongating my life
Because you took me to have a good time with my friends.
- Yeah.
- What could be better?
And I got my period at a very young age.
"Oh, my God,"
I-I got to get out of here.
I-I can't breathe.
I don't know why I let myself get close.
"Christine, hold on."
I don't want to hear any more jokes.
"Come on, you joke about New Christine all the time."
"Like how she's so dumb, she has to take off her shirt to count to two."
"Or when you killed that moth, and you said she moved up on the brain donor list."
"Well, that's different."
That's funny.
"Anyway, it's not just your lame jokes, Richard."
It's everything.
It's the pancakes and the princess and the periods.
She's not my daughter.
I don't want to be her mother.
I thought you liked Papa Jeff.
I do.
I did.
I-I don't know.
I just...
I've just got to get home.
Wait.
What do I tell people?
I don't know.
Just tell them I got sick.
That was my mother-in-law.
She had to leave.
Her broom was double-parked.
It's funny.
"Oh, I'm glad you're home."
You're damn straight I did.
"I endorsed your reinstatement, Ranger."
That means you shit the bed and I gotta clean the sheets now.
"Thing is, sir, captains don't endorse reinstatements."
- They don't?
- Nope.
"I don't know who the hell you are, but you sure as shit ain't Chance Holbrook."
[laughs]
"Well, you got me there."
"Déjà vu, Rinche?"
You son of a bitch.
Holbrook was a good man.
"Ooh, are you sure about that?"
Because he was going to finger you for Tony's murder.
[grunting]
"- Come on, come on..."
"- Hey, hey!"
"- I wouldn't do that, Kate."
- Scott...
Agh!
"Holy shit, you shot me!"
[grunting]
Let's go!
Come on!
[grunting]
"- [pounding on door] - [Carlos] Open up, rinchesito!"
"It's too late, Carlos."
Your boss already took the key.
It is useless without the map.
"Hand over the bonds, because I am not leaving without them."
"Well, then I guess you're not leaving."
[loud grunt]
- He can find himself another hit man.
- I'm sure.
- I'll tell if you tell me.
- No!
"OK, kids, lunch is ready!"
You should get yourself a new map.
No.
This is my only school prize.
- The names are out of date.
- I know.
The old maps are the best.
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - that's a brilliant name for a country.
Are you gonna talk to me?
What do you want to know?
How did you get out so early?
Where are you living?
What are you gonna do with your life?
I'm out on licence.
I'm living in a kind of halfway house.
My life
"- I don't know, Jess."
I need some more time on that one.
- Is that it?
- Course it's not it.
- I did it for you.
- No.
I killed them for you.
- You did it for yourself.
"- Why did you write to me, then, Jess?"
Because I love you and you were the only person I could turn to.
"You're all I've got right now, Jess."
Promise me you won't go away again?
"Operator, you have got to be kidding!"
I have been on this line for 20 minutes!
Jesus Christ.
Can you believe this?
He doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for Christ's sake.
Maybe the circuit is busy.
"Oh, circuits, my ass!"
He doesn't give a shit!
"Why don't you let me-- no, I've got it, Sharon."
It's all right.
"Operator, don't tell me there's no answer."
It's the hotel excelsior in Rome.
"Would you try it again, please, and let it ring?"
Hello?
Yes.
"No, operator,"
I've given you the number 4 times.
"What do you do, take an illiteracy test to get that job?"
"Don't tell me to be calm, God damn it!"
[Ring]
[Ring]
Yeah?
You're kidding me.
Ok.
I thought I just went to bed.
Yeah.
"Hey, what are we doing, scene 61?"
Ok.
"Oh, just remind flo about that blue belt."
"Yeah, I'll see you."
What are you doing here?
My bed was shaking.
"Your Grace, we've got it!"
In a Cage!
"How did you catch it, Jean?"
You have to be smart
- No more love-turtling for you.
- No more letters.
"She'll forget in time, and your day will come."
A pretty little widow she'll be.
Let me finish it.
"No, I like it, it's like a teeny weeny hell."
You'd do better to make some doughnuts.
We haven't had them for ages - yesterday.
"It's so far, it takes time for the pigeon to find him."
It'll come flying in soon.
I've waited for so long.
It could have lost its way.
Maybe it can't find Henry.
"I told you umpteen times that with my kerchief on, he can't have anything bad happen to him!"
"Henry, d'you hear me?"
- Jacob!
- I brought you some food.
- Have you seen the pigeon?
-No.
Could all my loved ones have forgotten me?
Henry!
What's happening?
Good gracious!
"Jacob, what's going on?"
Jacob?
!
Let me out!
"Oh God, a bad omen."
Go!
"Konichiwa, Jessie."
"You know, I like you, I think you're a fantastic personality,"
I just don't think this is the way to achieve your objective.
That's all I'm trying to say.
Last suspect was sweet shop owner Alan Sugar.
"We had to be quick, because like a badly stocked spice rack, we were running out of time."
Hello?
Hello?
No-one home.
No.
"Listen, O'Leary..."
Yeah?
Mayor Cowell was going to close this place down.
Hygiene or some crap.
So they've all got motive.
"Oh, yeah."
"Listen, do you see what I see?"
Sugar ain't around.
He must be upstairs.
Yeah.
Maybe we should get his attention.
"Well, no, maybe we should just look around and try and find clues."
"Smash, smash this place up a bit."
Smash the table.
I don't want to...
Let him know we're here!
Like really smash it up.
Argh!
We're here!
PHONE RINGS I've got...
"O'Leary, I've got to take this."
- l will take you to Bombay.
"- No, no!"
Brother...
"Unless I don't work hard, I won't get the fruits."
Fruits?
I can see the fruits that you've got.
And about that back-breaking drill that you spoke of what is that?
- That was about parades!
- l see...
So you call it parade.
And what do you do?
- Love!
- Love?
"That's only part-time, brother."
"Otherwise, she studies too!"
I can read you too!
Your height is 6 feet 2 inches.
Your chest is 42 inches.
You like light-brown clothes.
You have an import-export business.
And you don't know swimming...
"Enough of it, Pooja."
"No, Pooja...don't!"
"Brother, whose car is this?"
It cannot belong to you.
- lt belongs to a lovely friend.
- A lovely friend?
Or a girlfriend?
A lovely friend!
- You?
- l didn't see you here before.
I have opened this shop recently.
"Please, do not do it"
"What are you waiting for, Mike?"
Shoot him!
Shoot him!
You coward.
"Good job, Mike."
"Now, I've been national i.ne."
Are you to be lachrymose?
!
"Okay, guys."
Collect them all.
Statues take him from here.
Come on!
Let's go!
I endorse this community.
Right there on the altar of a building.
"- I think the larger church take care of There are issues, Father."
- Right said.
One need not listen to confess.
- Hello Ms. Erin.
"- Good day, Father, Do you want to listen to a confession?"
- I listened to you last night itirafınızı.
- Listened to?
"- Yes, I listened."
- This is great.
Would you listen to it again?
- Of course.
- I was thinking about heaven that different layers.
- Yes?
Maybe my husband to a lower floor.
"I have another on the floor, if I can not be together."
- I think it is not a sin.
I love this scene.
You're terrific in it.
It's almost one take.
"- Oh, really?"
- Yeah.
"One-Take Cera, huh?"
One-Take Cera showed up.
"No, no, no."
We did multiple takes.
But what I mean is it's one angle.
- This was like...
- Almost one take.
There's one cut.
- I love that part.
- Me too.
One-Take Cera...
Did One-Take Cera show up?
Because One-Take Dennings never showed up.
- One-Take Cera did not show up.
- Okay.
But that's because One-Take Sollett was not on the premises.
I don't even think One-Take Graynor has ever been uttered before.
I used to say before we started to shoot a scene:
"""This is One-Take Dennings."
"One-Take Dennings."""
"And I thought maybe I would get it in one take, but it never happened."
"In ADR, One-Take Dennings maybe showed up once."
- There you go.
- She did show up.
- In post.
- She showed up for post.
She was in L.A. the whole time.
"Well... well, forgive me, but, you don't return my calls, you completely cut me off, and then"
I...
I returned to find this...
I'm...
- I...
I'm...
- What?
Speechless.
- I guess you don't like it.
- Don't like it?
I'm in shock.
I...
I come home to find a completely different woman in my apartment.
Why did you do it?
Wait a minute!
Why do I have to EXPLAIN this to you or ANYBODY.
"- I'm not anybody, I'm your husband."
- You could've fooled me.
And I married a woman who looked a certain way.
"- To tell you the truth, I feel sort of betrayed."
- Betrayed!
Oh!
Please!
"Gregory, c'mon!"
- You had no right.
- I had no RIGHT?
Why did you do this to me?
Do WHAT to you?
I don't do ANYTHING to you!
That's the problem.
What's the difference what I LOOK like?
You never looked at me ANYHOW.
"Oh, my God."
I don't even feel anything.
That's usually a bad sign.
You always know what to say to a girl.
Up.
"You have training in this kind of a thing, right?"
What?
-Field surgery?
Dressing wounds?
-Yeah.
"I mean, it's not my area of expertise but I know a little bit."
Okay.
is all this blood normal?
"Well, you have a piece of truck in your leg."
No way is a joke gonna make me feel more comfortable in your ability to not kill me right now.
Grit your teeth.
(GRUNTS)
Looks like we missed the artery.
"But it's gonna be okay, right?"
You could still bleed out.
"Emerson, lie to a girl, will you?"
-Bite down.
-l think it's starting to hurt.
Bite.
(breathing heavily)
(panting)
(MUFFLED SCREAMS)
(GASPS)
That was bizarre.
(sighs)
(EXHALES)
Emerson!
And then you tripled them.
"Well, yeah, I guess I was overdoing it a bit."
I wanna do something fun.
I'm gonna take Quinn out of school tomorrow.
Douglas Park.
We ain't been there in years.
Uh...
"Yeah, about tomorrow..."
Um...
My man died.
Leonard died.
- This past Monday we lost him.
- What are you talking about?
You were in transit.
I had no way of contacting you.
"- When I left, he was in the hospital."
- I know.
Leonard died?
His funeral is tomorrow.
I thought he was gonna make it.
Come on.
"Yeah, I don't feel right."
I can't.
"You're getting out of this car, and you're gonna pay your respects to his family."
- I can't.
I'm gonna stay here.
- He was your commanding officer.
He was our country's hero.
He was like a son to me.
You owe it to all of us.
You got five minutes to get your act together and get out of this car.
"You hear me, sergeant?"
Haven't we all?
"After he died, I"
- I found a change in myself.
My body changed.
Everything changed.
I know if any
- I don't know if anyone has ever told you that before.
And this is the first time I'm talking about it.
[Laughing]
He was one wonderful guy.
But I had a wonderful life.
And that's the thing.
I was one of the luckiest women.
And then he left me.
God took him away... and left me with three small kids.
[Laughing]
And now when I look back at it...
I can't understand how I did it.
I can't.
I went to work.
I had three kids.
I put them
- I took them to a nursing school in the morning.
I picked them up after 5:00.
We came home and we had dinner.
Sometimes I cheated.
I used to go and buy dinner and then pick them up.
[Laughing]
"Ah, dear."
But they liked me to go to the store with them.
Ah.
Where did the years go?
Yes.
Right.
"Well, you-- you should go do that."
I don't want to keep you.
- Abby.
- Yes?
What are you doing here?
And why aren't you in uniform?
"Look, I really didn't want to talk about this here."
"I was gonna tell you all last night, but then I thought I should probably tell you at Sunday dinner."
"- Abby, you're rambling."
"- No, I'm not."
Isn't that that bitch from I.A.?
"Her name is Lina Flores, and she's not a bitch."
She's my partner.
"Well, she might be a bitch."
I don't really know yet.
I just started.
- What are you talking about?
- Partner?
I made detective and took an opening in Internal Affairs.
- You what?
- Does dad know about this?
No!
And please don't say anything.
This is so typical of you.
What is that supposed to mean?
Figure it out.
He--
Abby.
Those your brothers?
Both cops.
I thought it was an apron.
"And this is supposed to be the new me, doing things properly."
Beggar!
No - this needs more than a beggar.
This needs a bugger.
Bugger!
"Oh, heck."
Oh... oh... oh...
"# Overweight, overwhelmed"
# I've overstepped the mark
# Help me out
# I'm whistling in the dark
# But something I saw in you
"# Gave me a sense, a clue"
# To what I had lived without
# The sun came out
# You think a heart can never melt
# You don't expect a thaw
# But feelings just accosted me
"# And sort of, well, defrosted me"
# And left me in a puddle on the floor
"# No choice, to see it through"
# I couldn't turn away
# From what I glimpsed in you
# That day. #
"Letting them stay all night now, are you?"
What?
"We saw your fancy man come, but we didn't see him go."
"Hey, Mam!"
I'm doing me hair like Mr Kirkby's.
You're not going.
Get upstairs.
Buckley and I could tackle the new ending in the office.
You'll enjoy the studio.
Change of scene.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Slowly forward.
Two steps.
- Look to the side.
- Like this?
"No, left side to the camera, your good side, and now raising your eyes and turning as the Stuka..."
"Please, if you don't mind..."
Stuka.
- Johnnie is hit!
Can you bring the light over here?
Thank you.
"Could you move, please?"
We're trying to get big boy up there.
- Sorry.
- Tea.
Excuse me.
- Coming through.
- Anyone for a cup of tea?
"I thought that was really rather convincing,"
- don't you think?
- Very real.
"Oh, I say, are those rock cakes?"
Ooh!
They want to know when it'll be ready.
It's very much on its way.
"Only you keep saying that you'll be sending over the new ending, but..."
- It's almost ready.
- Oh.
- Internet?
- We can help.
Find out what makes us hostage.
Must enter the cabin.
Addons Your job is not complete.
I tried ...
I tried!
Addons Do not let him reach the trunk.
Addons stopped him!
Addons you have 3 minutes or she would die.
Can see and hear everything you do.
You should not mix.
"But, you have to do something, Gwen."
- I have to get out.
"- No, no, no, please!"
Addons three minutes.
Gwen Addons and you fail in your mission.
"Addons View Hi, if you die, Just like your friend ..."
Addons not have to kill his brother.
"Addons Come, Jo, you lose the show."
Addons I think you like these things.
Addons may prefer younger men.
What is your problem?
Addons I put a mirror in front of you.
Addons To see how good you are.
Addons Although ...
Addons All of us have blood now in our hands.
"No, please, do not do this."
It's the only way to save my child.
Please.
No!
You should get the boot.
"Gigi, he is not interested."
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
"Alex, this is jacked."
The hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a black shirt.
- It's not black.
- Look at it.
Not a black shirt.
I see it.
It's not black.
This shit is black.
"If a guy gives you his phone number instead of taking yours, he's not interested."
He took mine first.
Then he gave...
"And also, if a guy wants to see you, believe me, he will see you."
I once called 55 Lauren Bells until I got the right one.
That's cute.
What happened?
"Oh, yeah, as it turns out, her ass looked really huge in the daylight."
[GIGI LAUGHS]
Is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women?
Don't call him.
He doesn't like you.
Don't tiptoe around my feelings.
"- Well, I'm just trying to help."
- I know.
Thank you.
Sure.
"I gotta get back to work, but good luck."
"Okay, bye."
"Hey, buddy, you home?"
CONOR:
Yeah.
You're responsible for the death of hundreds of people.
You know the punishment for that.
Listen...
I've found a way to live with the blood on my hands.
But can you?
(BODY TH U DS)
Why won't they come out?
"All I know is it put me in a sleeping sim, and then I woke up to all hell breaking loose."
Hec!
Don't play with it.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
You all know what this means.
Thank you.
For helping us.
I wish I could do more.
I had no idea Jeanine was capable of something like this.
It's time we fight back.
We don't have the numbers.
We will.
Once we get to Factionless.
WOMAN ON PA:
Strict curfew until further notice.
FOUR:
You heard Eric.
Jeanine's never gonna stop coming after you.
It's our only option.
JEANNE:
Tris Prior.
Of course. it had to be her.
Is she still off the grid?
Yeah.
But I think I found a solution.
- Ok.
- What?
Nothing.
"It's just, you're so bossy sometimes, it's kind of a turn-off."
Bossy?
Wow.
"Well, I only said that because..."
"No, that's cool, you know."
"I'll just, like, turn my brain off whenever we're together."
- That's not what I meant.
- So what?
"Did I, like, trick you into this or something?"
Did I pretend to be someone else that you... ?
No.
"I mean, I like how independent you are."
I just feel like sometimes it's kinda like you're dating yourself.
Like it doesn't even matter whether I'm here or not.
"Well, congrats."
It doesn't anymore.
Emma.
Emma!
Your secret admirer's outside.
"It's all about the Benjamins, baby."
Just what do you think $100 is gonna buy you?
'Cause you know what?
I don't want your guilt money.
"Yeah, I know who you are."
You're Robert Quinn.
"I Googled you, when you didn't show."
"Ok, look."
I'm sorry.
I took your DNA test.
"Right again, Mr. Monk."
An electromagnet.
Battery operated.
Strong enough to pull these six balls and only these balls up the chute.
"Well, we didn't put that there."
"Oh, Miss Teeger, please."
Don't insult us.
You started working here two weeks ago.
You had access to the equipment.
"Suddenly, your friend wins what?"
$106 million.
I suggest you both get good lawyers.
What?
This is nuts.
"Hey, Monk?"
Monk?
Have you got anything?
There were two winners.
What happened to the other man?
The truck driver?
Eugene Maddox.
We've already talked to his lawyers.
He's agreed not to sue us in exchange for a rather generous settlement.
I'm sure he did.
Waiter!
Yo!
There's something wrong with my glass.
It's empty.
You know what?
Hell.
Just bring the whole bottle and charge it to the room.
"I'm afraid you can't afford it, Billy."
Because he didn't want to go to a foster home.
He didn't want to leave and I didn't want him to leave either.
"It's like, you force me to live amongst these... these pod people and the first cool person I meet, it's like, you kick him out of the house."
I did the best I could.
So did I.
Come on.
Police want to ask us some more questions.
You and I need to talk.
And this time I want the truth.
I'm sorry.
Ryan Atwood?
We got some questions for you.
It was an accident.
"Yeah, you were there?"
Yeah.
"Then we got some questions for you, too."
"Officer, I'm Mr. Atwood's attorney."
Please don't ask him any questions unless I'm present.
"Ryan, keep your mouth shut."
"You, too."
Vic!
"Come on, dude!"
–Tell me you're leaving!
–That which doesn't kill me...
Come on!
Come on!
Let go!
Vic!
Hi.
David Aceveda.
Vote for me.
She's suffering from amnesia.
- Amnesia.
- Yes.
She didn't recognise me.
She doesn't remember anything.
I've got to go to California to see her.
She'll recognise me.
"- Oh, she won't know you."
"- I'm her mother, she will."
"No, listen to me."
"It was one of the worst moments of my life, one of the most painful."
"When I stood in front of her after all this time, she had no idea who I was."
Oh.
"Oh, God, she's-"
"She's ill, she's in trouble."
"She needs me, Blake."
"No, damn it, no."
We've got to follow doctor's orders on this.
She is in very fragile condition.
"Now, she's not to be pushed, not under any circumstances, is that clear?"
Not any.
All right.
I won't go.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
But we have another daughter who needs help.
"Now, Amanda's been going through a terrible time."
And I haven't been much good in helping her solve her problems.
"She needs your help, Alexis."
She needs you.
Mm.
-Mr.
Wheeler.
-Mm-hmm.
Is this toad flax?
"No, that's lmpatiens capensis."
That's also known as touch-me-not.
"You guys, I found a touch-me-not."
"Untouched, unspoiled, here in the middle of suburban uniformity, you can find..."
a tiny wilderness.
Dad.
"Brian, don't be an idiot."
"Hey, Dad... whoa."
I need to talk to you for a second.
I didn't know he had a daughter.
I need you to fix my car.
I was planning on fixing that after school.
I can't wait that long.
"I mean, I need to leave town."
I've got to get out of here right now.
"T ell me about it, lady."
We all want to get out of here.
Are you late for an appointment with a client?
Are you a religious fanatic or something?
No.
Why?
Oh... 'cause you're just the most understanding man
I've ever met.
Thank you.
"Wow, look at this place."
What is this?
This is the...
T anapaya Wet Lands.
"Souta-kun is a good person, and kind too, and we get along well, and it's fun to spend time together."
That's why...
"I was being two-timed, huh."
Two-timed?
- Eh?
Why does that sound like a question?
"Well, it's a regular two-timing, right?"
"You were continuing with your boyfriend, and also going out with me."
Going out...
Eh?
!
"Umm, Saeko-san."
"Saeko-san and I were going out, right?"
I asked you to go out with me and you said okay.
Eh?
Ah...
Yeah.
- These two months.
"It's just been two months, but."
"Well, look, we even kissed, right?"
"Ah, but, we didn't have sex."
"Oh, I see."
"If you don't have sex, it's not called going out."
So it's not two-timing either.
...What?
!
Is that how it is?
Is that how society works?
"Saeko-san is correct, and I'm wrong?"
I don't know what's what anymore.
Wait.
Let me collect my thoughts.
"18 year old girl, like a rose."
"Boy at 18, nothing to boast;"
"Woman at 40, beauty most,"
"Man at 40, what a ghost."
"Woman at 80, sparkles and glows!"
"Man at 80, coffin soon to close."
What's your rank?
"Supermac 99, and yours?"
Supermac 98!
You've been found out.
You're done!
What shall I do?
"Only the Commissioner's fiancee, who can save you."
But I don't want to see her again.
This is an order.
Go immediately!
Why are you here?
You remember what you said to me yesterday?
I don't remember.
But I do. I remember it too well.
You said you'll never see me again.
I was just joking.
I don't mean what I say.
"But you said you love me, do you mean it?"
Of course I do.
I need you help.
My help?
To go after some girl?
Can't you even get Dumplings on your own?
All I want is to get the 'Beast'.
But Hiroshima has escaped and identified me.
I was told that only you can help me out.
It's too dangerous to go on.
We should return to Puyo.
Sayong's right.
Guys with grudges will hunt you down like a mad dog.
Mad dogs are best when avoided.
"Let's turn back, Miss."
I heard they still call him commander.
Commander?
But they're bandits.
- That's nonsense.
- It's not that simple.
(Oi) They train harder than soldiers do.
They're willing to die for their commander.
(Mari) No wonder the soldiers are no match.
(Hyupbo) This is bad...
Captain.
There's no point in pushing forward.
We should go back to Puyo.
He's right.
Talk to Sosuhno.
"Actually, I want to go to Gosan no matter what happens."
But Sosuhno is our leader and we should wait for her decision.
Come with me.
Where to?
To the bandits' hideout.
What?
What for?
I want to check them out.
Cap...
(Puyo Palace)
What do you want?
"(Yangjung, Hyunto governor) We're going to attack the Southwest Yi."
"You're a loyal citizen of Germany, and I can respect that."
Sometimes I just don't know when to stop doing my job.
Thank you.
I wanted to ask...
How are they?
Ollie and Billy.
Oliver was killed last year in action.
- I'm sorry.
- And Billy...
William now...
He's missing in the Pacific.
I hope he will come back to you soon.
"I'm sure your father wants the same thing, Klaus, and I wish I could give it to him."
"But that's not the game, is it?"
"No, it isn't."
Thank you.
For your kindness.
It's the least I could do.
Maybe we can talk again.
Maybe.
- Soldiers are safe for now.
- That's great.
The Germans searched the Abbey last night.
They didn't find them.
We shouldn't leave them there too long.
We're gonna need a new camp.
Somewhere we can bring them longer term.
- Yeah.
- Varges is close to here.
Varges?
"Yeah, we talked about it."
Might be a good place to recruit more locals for the POWs to train.
One's clear.
Hey.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm a little nauseous.
It takes me a couple days to get back up to terminal.
- What's going on?
- There was a shooting across the street.
- Anybody you know?
"- No, but still."
- Kind of scary when it happens so close.
- Yeah.
So I heard you' re getting released today.
"My next round of chemotherapy's in about two days, so I thought I'd come by, say so long."
- How's your mom doing?
- You mean is she still pissed at you?
"No, I didn't mean exactly that, but..."
- She's still pissed at you.
- Good to know.
"She's upstairs with the ""doc."""
Does she know you' re here?
I kind of snuck off.
I actually might need one of those basins.
I think you need some IV Compazine.
- That sounds good.
- All right.
I'll go tell your mom you' re here.
Will you watch him for a minute?
I'm not a child.
"Yeah, Marky!"
"Yeah, Marky!"
- Yeah!
"God, this is so romantic."
Have you noticed that there's no other cars on the road anymore?
Cars?
Attention.!
Subject vehicle is 500 yards and approaching fast.
All personnel stand clear of the barricade.
"Oh, my God."
- Strap in!
"- Oh, shit!"
Strap in!
Hang on!
Maybe this whole thing wasn't such a hot idea after all.
This is it!
- This is more exciting than election night!
- Box 'em in!
Box 'em in!
- Do something!
- Like what?
I don't know!
Anything!
- What are you doing?
- Anything!
Holy shit!
This is unheard-of!
The surprise roadblock has backfired!
- Hammond's outsmarted the cops!
- Get in control out there!
Stop that damn car!
Don't panic!
- The tension is unbearable!
- Shit!
"- Yes, sir!"
"""now that you explained it,"
"It's comin' pretty easy."""
"Axl, ever since we got home,"
I can't stop thinking about aunt Edie.
That bone spur thingy on her foot?
"No, but ew."
You know what we need to do?
We should totally take her to dig up that old time capsule!
"Yeah, I'd love to drive my dor sister"
"And senile aunt around, then dig hole."
Let's go!
"Axl, you need to start thinking outside of yourself!"
Look at beyonce she has every reason
"In the world to be selfish, and she still gives back!"
Wouldn't it be amazing if we could find the capsule
For aunt Edie and make her dreams come true?
!
Sorry.
My time is way too valuable.
Hoo!
Ha!
Hoo-ha-ha!
Hoo!
Oh!
I know this one!
Ha!
I got one before you.
"Oh, so you finally got one, did you, dear?"
Why don't you come to the board and show us your work?
"No, no, no."
I'm good.
I wasn't asking.
It's none of your business anyway.
No.
It is not slowing anything down.
These conversations are slowing us down.
I can't believe I'm listening to this.
That was totally patronizing.
Claudia.
It's lan McKnight.
Lovely.
"I don't know why you're so fascinated with our sex life but for the record, Jane's an amazing shag."
"More to the point, we're just about done with the single."
I'm sure you'll be orgasmic when you hear it.
Let's give the telephone a rest.
Cheers.
Great.
You're a fucking diplomat.
This is it.
It's going to hell.
Fuck her.
Who cares?
We'll take it somewhere else.
-You hire a lawyer.
-That's how I want to finish.
"-What, with a lawsuit?"
-No.
With that song.
-Which song?
-The song I just played you.
-It's a ballad.
-So what?
-You want me to hand them a ballad?
-That's right.
"Why, I haven't washed or even powdered and here you are."
"You know, you gotta be careful."
"You sitting around in a damp thing, you catch a cold."
"especially when you been exercising hard, Iike bowling is."
"-well, you're the teacher, aren't you?"
-Yes.
-What do you teach?
-english.
"well, I never was a very good english student."
-How long you here for?
"-Why, I don't know yet."
You gonna shack up here?
"I thought I would, if it's not inconvenient for you all."
Good.
traveling wears me out.
"well, take it easy."
What was that?
"Oh, those cats."
"Hey, stella."
"What did you do, fall asleep in there?"
"well, I guess I'm gonna strike you as being the unrefined type, huh?"
"You know, stella spoke a good deal about you."
"She said you were married once, weren't you?"
Yes.
When I was quite young.
Yeah?
What happened?
-Yeah?
What happened?
-The boy....
The boy died.
I'm afraid I--
"Leave the dishes, I'll have Adrienne clean up."
"- They're here, Madam."
"- Ah, gentlemen!"
I've seen you before.
At Amsterdam Central.
That's possible.
Or someone else.
- l have an ordinary face.
- lt was you.
I don't forget a bod like you.
So we're going to tour around?
Whatever you like.
"You wanted to, didn't you?"
For your work.
I don't have to tour for my work.
No.
I wanted to have a chat with you.
A long chat.
- Privately.
- With me?
There's nothing I can tell you.
I'm just an ordinary boy.
I always write about ordinary people.
"As I said on TV, the ordinary man is my central theme."
All of him.
Above and below the belt.
"Yes... you've been on TV, haven't you?"
"And on the radio and in the papers, sure."
- ls it true what they write?
- What?
- All the goings on in the studios?
- What do you mean?
The red one.
Hey.
"I know you're depressed, so I brought someone to cheer you up."
"Right outside is a real, live, furry playmate."
I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
"Hey, a dog!"
"Who, you gotta admit, looks a lot like Jane."
He's the happiest dog ever.
- Where did you get that?
- What?
- Combination.
- Personnel.
Pratt matched at County.
"Yes, I know."
He keeps bitching about it.
He needs a locker.
Thought I'd spare Elizabeth the chore.
Heard you had some trouble with Romano yesterday.
He was right.
I took too long making a decision.
You don't have that luxury anymore.
I never really thought I did.
Mark's gone.
That means you've been here longer than any other doctor.
People will look to you to step in and fill the void.
Big void.
"Yes, it is."
I can't do this.
Will you do this?
Thank you.
Shotgun to the face.
"This is gonna be fun, huh?"
"The sooner I fill out my report, the sooner I can get back to them."
"Enormous beast, yeah... ."
Biggest thing here is the homecoming queen.
"Oh, my God!"
"Come on, I need a witness."
-It's around the corner.
-Don't pull so hard.
It's like a chomp out of the side of the car.
"It's like a bite out of a sandwich, Iike a--"
"What are we looking at here, Mr. MansIey?"
"Something big, Marv."
Something big.
hello!
Come out!
"Hey, big metal guy, I got food here for you!"
metal!
"Crunchy, delicious metal!"
Come and get it!
"So I guess you're not gonna hurt me, huh?"
The shutoff switch.
You saw me save you.
So where are you from?
"You came from the sky, right?"
From up there?
Don't you remember anything?
Maybe it's that bump on your head.
Do you talk?
"You know, words? ""blah, blah, blah,"" like that?"
Can you do that?
"well, you get the idea anyway."
Let's see.
See this?
I love the smell of progress in the morning.
"Come by and see me tonight, I'll have more good news for you."
This splotch of grime will soon be a gleaming suburb with strip malls on every corner.
We'll call it Frazierville or Bernietown.
"Sounds lovely, ma'am."
"Come on, boys, let's go."
Let's go.
"Come on, get up there."
"Get on your homework, okay."
"All right, group A, you guys are on dinner, group B, you're on..."
- My man.
- Out of here.
Bumpy ride on the short bus?
"What's up, buddy?"
You're on bathrooms.
Get out of here.
- Let's go!
"- Hey, what's up, man?"
You're on garbage.
Group B you're on dishes.
- Last one in the house does my laundry.
"- All right, let's go!"
- Halt!
"Tweaker, get back here!"
- Man.
"All right, empty your pockets and keep your hands where I can see them."
Empty your pockets.
"Sneak in more candy, you do dishes all month."
Clear?
Get out of here.
"Hup, two, three, four!"
"Hup, two, three, four!"
- Would you use it?
Of course.
If necessary.
Jo asked me to say good night to Daddy for him.
He loves you very much.
I love him.
"But, darling, you don't show it."
You never tell him.
You never hold him.
Don't be afraid now that he's growing up.
Afraid of what?
What the hell have I got to be afraid of?
"I'm going to go for walks with him, aren't I?"
And swim with him and play football with him.
- David...
"- I want him to be proud of me, don't I?"
"To grow up like his father, a legless fucking joke."
I suppose you and your mother had a lovely time discussing me.
She's very concerned about you.
I don't need anyone's concern.
I can manage alone.
I can't.
"David, I need you."
- I love you.
- Don't.
"Please, don't."
I want to sleep.
"For God's sake, let me sleep."
Thank you.
You haven't let this room to anybody since the death of Mrs Garden?
"No, sir."
Not since Billy Parkin lived here.
"- So, what happens to her?"
- I was just gonna ask that.
- She probably dies.
"- Now, that's cool."
"- No, that's depressing."
"- Oh, I give up."
Excuse me.
- (quietly):
What's going on?
"- Christy, I can't do this."
You should just take her home with you.
No.
I already have a daughter I screwed up.
This one's yours.
But it's so awkward.
I have nothing in common with her.
So what?
"She needs a home, she doesn't need a buddy."
"I know, but I really want her to like me."
Then you shouldn't have signed up to be a mom.
"Hey, how about, how about you and Bonnie come live here and help me with her?"
We might have to take you up on that.
Let's see how the banana bread goes.
"Oh, great."
Now I don't know what you're talking about.
"Christy, this was a mistake."
"When people don't like me at first, they never like me."
I don't have a chance with her.
That's not true.
I didn't like you at first.
You didn't?
Nope.
"I need to go back to Abnegation, maybe."
Sort out what our parents left behind.
At least I'd be useful there.
"Caleb, there's nothing left at Abnegation."
Yeah.
You Okay?
Just need to get to Candor.
Tris.
"I know you think Caleb is your responsibility, but he made his own choice."
You can't protect everyone.
(CHUCKLES)
I can't protect anyone.
Nobody can.
Him leaving isn't your fault.
None of this is your fault.
(SIGHS)
Johanna was right.
You have to forgive yourself.
Thank you.
WOMAN ON PA:
All factions have been instructed to
-maintain a strict curfew until further notice.
- We gotta move.
Repeat.
All factions have been instructed to maintain a strict curfew until further notice.
- We found them.
-Yeah.
- HECTOR:
Four!
-(ALL GREETING)
"Damn, is it good to see you guys."
"How are you, Uriah?"
"Good morning, doctor."
"Hello, Commissioner."
She died.
Just a few hours ago.
"Yes, yes, yes, yes..."
She was murdered?
Difficult to say.
The pulse is very weak.
"Janitor, a glass of water, please."
"Go, drink."
He probably absorbed a violent narcotic.
He'll be back.
Go away!
What do you want?
I am a physician.
Ease your mind.
Breathe quietly.
Deeply.
Tell us what happened to you.
My head hurts.
What happened to me?
"I do not know, I do not know."
"Ah, yes!"
"Yes, yes!"
"I was reading, last night and suddenly, some people came out of hiding and pounced on me."
"I wanted to free myself, but I was gagged, and they pierced my arm with something sharp."
I lost consciousness.
"I wanted to scream, move, but I was powerless."
I sank.
"But who are you, sir?"
The Commissioner eighteenth borough.
"When you were attacked, you were alone?"
I've been in a lot of scrapes.
What about that one?
That was teenage experiment.
Wanted to see if I could take the pain.
And could you?
Comfortably.
We're gonna do some balloons.
I've got a better idea.
Truth or Dare?
Dare.
Any suggestions?
I think we need to sex this party up a bit.
"- What do you think, boys?"
- Yes.
I can do sexy.
Eleanor...
"I dare you... to give Gemma... a long... hot, wet kiss on the mouth."
- Tongues?
- Absolutely.
"Excuse me, do I get a say in this?"
"- No, no, no, no, no..."
"- Rules of the game, babe."
"Oh, yeah, I've still got it."
And I hope you're not expecting me and Chris to do that.
We don't need any of that queer shit.
"Yeah, that-that-that's what I'm saying."
I get enough of that in the army.
"Okay, stop being weird and spin the bloody bottle."
"Truth or Dare, Gemma?"
Um...
"I don't know, truth."
Will you take me back?
"Yeah, I'm--I'm buying all the hot dogs."
"Oh, come on, lady."
And I'm giving them to the good people.
Who's that?
Kicking it down the street
Causin' a stir.
Who's that?
I know that you're wondrin'
That's her
"That's her, that's her, that's her, that's her."
Who's got the kind of charisma that
The boys prefer.
Who's hot and you know that she knows it.
That's her.
She's like a summer sky.
It's like some cherry pie.
And there is butterfly.
Me oh my.
Who flaunts her feminine magic.
That's her That's me!
That's Pam!
The overly-confident morbidly obese woman.
This fat suit smells like corn chips.
"Going again, please."
Thank you.
And this is the set of The Girlie Show.
It's a real fun ladies' comedy show for ladies.
"Hey, everybody."
"Look, here's someone you never get a chance to meet."
"It's the head writer of The Girlie Show, Liz Lemon!"
The Girlie Show.
"Hold on, I'll connect you."
Go.
Go.
- Come on!
Pick it up!
- Stop!
"I'm calling the cops, kid!"
"- Let's grab the bike, man."
"- Look, you can't tell anyone."
Okay?
No one.
It's okay.
I swear.
I won't let anything happen to you.
Hey.
"You did good, all right?"
"All right, stop crying and go to sleep."
- Jacob...
What if we really went to Galveston like Mom wanted?
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Would you like to try our new Quiet Burger?
"- No, thanks, Ted."
I'll just have an order of Crazy Fries.
"- Hey, you want ham or peanut butter?"
- Ham.
- Watch out.
There's enough rat poison in this dipped cone to kill a neo...
- Uh...
"I was thinking once she's dead, we could put her body in the... you know, just like on that one episode of..."
- I want some.
- You asked for ham.
- God!
Now we'll never know which episode it'll be like!
- He is no criminal!
"- So, he's starting to act like that again?"
"Not him, me!"
You darling?
Ah well.
Kiss me!
Kiss!
What a fine girl you are.
Just how I like it.
He's hanging around with scum like you!
Shame on you!
"Yeah, I'm ashamed of myself!"
- Let me go!
I can't breathe!
"- Feel free, there is plenty of air!"
You think you can just run away and ashame me in front of my friends later tonight?
"Reinhold said Kiss me, follow my order!"
Let me go!
I'll take anything I can find and throw it in your face!
You know how Franz lost his arm?
"He behaved just like you, unwilling to comply with my rules!"
So I grabbed him like this and threw him outta the car!
Killer!
Killer!
Killer!
Help!
- Go!
- What happened to you?
Where is Mieze?
Why was she screaming?
She isn't screaming anymore.
Now go!
Looks like we have to buy as much time as we can.
"All hands, prepare for battle."
"Dangaioh Cross, head to enemy attack point 11-02F."
"Man, this is so slow!"
It pisses me off!
There it is!
Red-herring operation successful.
Commence infiltration.
What?
You trying to scare me?
A smoke screen!
What a cheap trick!
What!
?
Where did you come from...?
What the...?
Command Center!
What the hell's going on?
Do you read me?
Answer me!
Don't be fooled by them!
"You're just a machine, for crying out loud!"
"Dangaioh Cross, do you read?"
Dangaioh Cross!
Doesn't look good.
It's been hit by some strong jamming.
"Unless we can grasp the situation, we can't send backup."
Flail and Burst aren't ready yet?
The final tune-up is taking longer than expected.
Where's the Commander?
He's with the Vice Commander.
He can't get away right now.
I know what's gonna happen.
You have to leave now.
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.
- Governor?
"- Good to see you, John."
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.
"- What's this about, John?"
- It's the tour.
You can't do it.
You can't go.
Listen to me.
Cancel it.
Cancel the tour.
Cancel it.
Make them shut down the plant now.
The plant's gonna blow up while you're there.
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?
- They don't know yet.
Have you received a bomb threat?
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.
- I know this sounds...
"- You're messing up here, John."
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.
Our top story takes us tonight to Point Pleasant...
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up!
Russ McCallum and the governor Harris toured the Edgewater Petrochemical plant.
In what he's called a successful review...
No.
The question remains the same.
Who would want to kill Mr. Malhotra?
Chelsea.
Chelsea?
What?
You guys don't follow football?
Chelsea has to win if they want to stay on top of the table.
Unbelievable.
I need some fresh air.
Hopeless.
Football?
I'm not going to let you die.
"22nd August, 2007."
You have two new messages.
First message.
"Neil, Ranbir here."
Call me back.
Second message.
Neil... it's been three months now.
You keep saying that you'll come here.
I guess it was naive of me to believe you.
Anyway...
I just want you to know that...
I'm pregnant.
"I'm sure, this is the last thing you needed to know."
"Neil, I've treasured every moment of my life since I met you."
"And, I'll always love you for that."
The number you've dialled is currently switched off.
The number you've dialled is currently switched off.
Neil.
Who won?
"Hiya, Sangita."
It's Nicki.
Hiya.
You all right?
No.
Not really.
I just did a pregnancy test and I... tested positive for baby.
You neverI
I'm pretty sure I followed the instructions OK.
"Well, you're gonna have to go see a gynaecologist."
What good's a bush doctor gonna be?
I'm pregnant.
I know I am.
"I haven't had a period since the ""Eurovision Song Contest""."
- And what does Moz think?
"- That's just it, see."
It might not be Moz's.
What d'you mean?
"Well, he's got a one-in-three chance."
There's only one thing for it.
I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna tell him the truth.
I'm just poppin' out to get some tampons.
"- Get us some fags, will ya?"
- Course.
Sure.
I'll get you some fags.
Why not?
China.
Good to see ya.
- Broke up with Psycho Paul.
- Smart move.
"As a rule, never date anyone whose nickname suggests anger-management issues."
Only that you keep saying you'll be sendin' over the ending'.
It's almost ready.
Well...
let me know when it is.
Goodbye Parfitt.
Mrs.Cole
Excuse me?
I bet...you know!
just this way...
Cigarette?
I've never seen much point in men.
Still I do hate to see you plaining.
Oh!
I'm not plaining.
Ellis moved out weeks ago.
I'm already used to it.
It wasn't Ellis I was thinking of.
Forgive me.
"It's just the...when we were shooting in Devon, you always seemed so... vivid."
Perhaps I'm in a sentimental mood.
"My landlady was killed yesterday,"
I could hear her husband crying through the wall...all night long.
"It seems to me when life is so very precarious, it's an awful shame to waste it."
"I was wondering on page 76, I say..."
Getting worried.
About the ending.
Turned Ministry spy now?
Is that it?
Did I...
Sorry!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...
Hello!
Help!
Help me!
So you've been looking for the daughter of Milonkovic?
Why?
We think it would be in the car.
We began the search yesterday.
Daughter reported missing in Sweden.
She lives with her mother in Gothenburg.
Did you know about the person in the trunk?
-Yup.
-What Was the fucking game then?
Why did not you tell us?
Hello?
-I Can not say.
All right.
Let's forget whims and pride and work.
You then have the theory that she was in the trunk?
-Is It possible.
-And She was saved by someone that killed the other?
-Deixamos All options open.
"-Legal, Sikkeland."
Mutual-confidence now?
"-surely, On my part."
Where is she from?
Stay there!
-Fatalidades Or injury?
-Still Are there.
-Milonkovic Was there?
I do not know.
The explosive was in the back.
I suppose you have a good view of it and the league-Z?
"I was just, you know..."
- How are you?
"- I'm fine, I guess."
"Actually, no, I'm not fine."
I just broke up with my boyfriend.
(EX CLAIMING)
- I'm so sorry to hear that.
"- No, it's..."
- Do you want to hang out tonight?
- Sure.
- It was so fun.
You guys liked it.
- It was the most...
- Please tell me you got in the window.
- I got in the window.
(ALL CHEERING)
What is going on?
What is the window?
"You know how everyone has that guy or girl who, no matter what happens, you always remember them being the perfect one for you?"
- Mike Scharz.
- Lily.
That girl right over there.
"Well, that girl for me was and still is Maggie Wilks."
We all went to college together.
She was awesome.
Everybody loved her.
I think I know what we're dealing with here.
Tell me when to stop.
It wasn't that Maggie was hot.
She was...
She was the ultimate girl next door.
She was the ultimate girl next door.
"He already fired Pete, who is a great producer."
Fire Pete?
He can't fire Pete.
You know what?
I quit.
He can suck it.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, suck it, Pete."
"No, you're not listening."
You're not a good listener.
MAN:
20 minutes to air.
But Liz said we were cutting the cat-lady sketch.
She said it stinks.
Ouch.
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humor is universal.
I just don't think that I'm good in it.
Do you think I'm good in it?
I think this is your opportunity to go out there and prove everybody wrong.
What?
What do you mean?
Who's everybody?
"The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said you had a weird eye..."
You mean this eye?
"Okay, this eye, it doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it."
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds.
What?
!
Where is Liz?
!
Liz!
"He had never deceived me, but for that night."
I always lost sleep and waited anxiously for his return.
"The time passed, one, two. three."
One gets preoccupied and concerned with... the thought that something might have happened.
"Telemessage, the person you called is unavailable."
FiIippo?
Is it you?
Also drunk again.
You are unable to even vomit.
Come back to say you lost all your money?
I lost everything.
Who won now?
The dull.
The blonde.
"I said to you, no more games."
"So I played once again, so what?"
Alright.
It is not the most important thing in the world.
And how much did you lose?
All of it.
I've lost totally.
Totally!
All of it.
All.
I have nothing left.
You have your wife.
"She is a beautiful woman, your wife."
-Only for one night.
"-Or pay the ten million, which you owe."
-Your wife is a precious woman.
-And very lucky.
Yes.
Worth's half a million!
is she inlaid with diamonds?
Ridiculous!
Thank you...
"Hello Sam, how are you?"
I'm Joe!
Why so many foreigners in white suit here tonight?
A Yank's grandma get married the 8th time to an officer.
They are holding a party to celebrate!
You still remember this song?
"Of course I remember, you cruise chick with this song."
"Play it again, Sam!"
You want a woman?
What?
"You dirty pimp, leave my husband alone!"
"The soup's tasteless, add some soya sauce!"
What?
Add some soya sauce!
Did you say 'Get some sort of toys'?
Did you...?
"- Must be you, I'm damn sure!"
- American.
"Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Sandra!"
You want woman?
He wants to kill me!
Get some sort of toys!
Help yourself!
I'm American!
American!
He run away!
"Hi, Hitler!"
- Hotel Hong Kong!
Bitter!
I thought you'd break my arm again.
"Kolya, you are so nice."
And amusing.
You are like a brother.
I used to meet a boy.
His name was Volodya.
He was a pilot.
I must have loved him.
He perished in his plane.
Just a day after he was kissing my hands.
"Then another boy Andrei, used to court me."
He was a scout and died too.
Then Vanya.
I began feeling fear.
It is dangerous to love me.
Do you understand that?
-You'd rather come back.
"- l'll be back, Olya."
"And we'll kill your sniper, that's for sure."
Take myword on that.
"I, Kolya Malakhov, give you this word."
We'll kill him.
"Astra, Astra, Carnation on air."
I'm at the door readyto enter.
"- Got it, wait for an invitation."
- Got it.
We are waiting.
"Go to our positions, afteryourfirst salvo Malyutin will advance to the hill."
"Yes, sir."
"Comrade mayor, Colonel Egorov is on the line."
"Yes, comrade colonel."
I see the light!
It's really attractive to me.
"Robin, are you alright?"
I'm perfectly alright...!
- ls that really you?
- Of course it's me!
Remember when you left me 3 years ago.
"No sleep at night, no waking up in the morning."
Couldn't eat at meals.
Why were you so cruel?
There are even crueler things!
"Your Excellency, may I present my fiancee!"
You son of a bitch...
Your Excellency!
You alright...!
"Stop it, I'm fine now!"
Do you know one another?
Know her?
Never!
There's little left of whom I knew!
The one I knew is dead.
My soul was betrayed 3 years ago.
"And 3 years later, her own soul is being betrayed!"
What's left is just a walking corpse.
For the world to laugh at!
What wonderful lines!
If Yeats could have heard you just now.
He would have saluted you indeed!
Fantastic...!
Thank you...!
Someone's fainted again!
Couldn't take your speech!
You've got three children.
Ah.
"Oh, if this phone could only talk."
"Well, it can if you want it to."
Everything you want to know about will is right in there.
"His friends, his music, everything."
"No, no, I-I can't invade his privacy that way."
I can.
"No, put that down."
Someone's texting him.
It's from Stephanie.
"""Did you tell your mom yet?"
"Did she freak?""..."
Freak?
About what?
What does he need to tell me?
"Well, find out yourself."
Pretend you're will and text her back.
I shouldn't do that.
"But as a mother,"
"I need to know what's going on with my son... by any means possible, right?"
- Indeed you do.
- Absolutely.
Okay.
"""How should I tell her?""..."
"Oh, I shouldn't have done that."
I just totally violated his privacy.
I am done with this.
"Ooh, she texted back."
"""Why are you texting like an old lady?""..."
"Ah, you shouldn't have spelled everything correctly."
Oh.
"- Hey, what happened?"
"- Good driving, Yo-Yo."
"Yeah, that was neat."
This bus can really move.
"Tony, look through the window."
The rear window.
That minibus is following us.
I command you to place obstacles in its path.
City property.
I've damaged city property.
They said these glasses were shatterproof.
Was that a bus or a bridge?
They're still with us.
"Tony, you must stop her."
"Man, that man was really buzzing."
Am I still alive?
They're gaining on us.
She counteracts everything that Tony does.
"Tony, you've got to stop her."
We flew!
They must've flown.
Don't you dare try it.
Sickle...
"Sickle, stop..."
Stop over that hill.
"Tony, cause the reflection of the sun on the rear window to magnify and shine so brightly that our pursuers'll be blinded by it."
"Come on, open the doors."
I can't see.
- Yeah.
"- Come on, let me out."
- Everybody OK?
"- Yeah, sure."
Are you in his apartment?
Are you on the bed?
No.
I'm not on the bed.
- Is he there?
- No...
Not exactly.
Is he taking a shower?
He's getting take-out for dinner.
And this call's becoming very 1-900.
"To talk to a hot English teacher, press 3."
Call ending now.
- Tomorrow?
"- Yeah, tomorrow."
- Hey.
- Hey.
"- Sorry, it took so long."
- It's okay.
Looks like Rose of Sharon has been discovered.
Big crowd at the take-out counter.
I meet your dad tomorrow.
I know.
I was thinking this is gonna be a bit more complex than the usual parent-teacher discussion.
"I mean, I can see your mom as a colleague, she's safe."
But your dad is your dad.
Which is complex.
"You will like him, he'll like you."
Just be your normal incredible self.
What is he after?
He's probably just what he says he is.
A nephew cleaning up after a distant relative.
Probably?
Does it have anything to do with Detective Hallstrom?
"Look, I don't want to talk about it, OK?"
You don't like him because you...
What?
Wanted you for myself.
I'm sorry.
This is stupid of me.
You're ready for contacts... if you want them.
Or glasses.
They'll correct you to 20/50.
Do you think I saw the killer?
"Seeing isn't something that happens to you, Emma."
It's something you do.
I gave you the equipment.
It's up to you to control it.
"If you invent these visions, you can stop them."
Do you think I invented him?
Doesn't matter what I think.
What do you think?
I'll call you later.
I got to go.
"Oh, sergeant, hi."
It's Detective Hallstrom from Chicago.
I'm trying to find out if Margaret Tattersall... spent any time in a hospital recently?
A lot of time?
She got a new kidney.
"Hey, you just can't..."
That's OK.
It's OK.
It's all right.
Where's John?
What's the problem?
Mush!
Mush!
"- What's up, Sergeant?"
- They just brought a fellow in.
- Picked him up on the Skagway Trail.
- What happened to him?
It seems like he left his sled to go hunting for food... then couldn't find his way back.
He was almost a corpse when they found him.
- What's his name?
"- Well, we found these on him."
Name seems to be Blake
"- John Blake, San Francisco."
Here it comes.
"Say, it even looks like a raft."
Thanks.
I always wanted to join the navy.
"- Will there be room for the dogs, sailor?"
"- I'm afraid not, matey."
- They'll have to run along the bank.
"- Very well, sir."
"Be careful of that varnish on the deck, you two gobs."
"Step right in, commodore."
All set?
"Shove off, cabin boy."
Ca-
"Toot, toot!"
Hard aport!
"Come on, Buck."
Come on.
"The way I figure it, we go 100 miles upstream... then we follow a creek that runs into it north."
Huh!
Never fails.
"God, you may have to give me the strength"
To slap the devil out of my daughter
If she ever talks to me like that again.
"Oh, let me read my word."
"Let me find that scripture about ""thou shalt not kill."""
That should work right about now.
Jesus.
Baby.
Daddy!
- You look wonderful!
- Thank you.
How's mom?
Not good.
"See, a lot has been going on since you've been away"
And none of it's making your mother a happier person.
"What, dad?"
"Really, is she okay?"
"Yeah, she's okay,"
But nothing around her is.
She's been out of work for six months now
- And even worse...
- Wait.
"What, daddy?"
I wasn't even gone for that long.
How much could happen in six months?
A lot.
You mother never really had savings.
She's been living at her means.
And she lost her car and all of the furniture.
The house is completely empty.
"- What, daddy?"
- Yeah.
Tell Daeso I'd like to see him in private.
"I will, Governor."
Trade with the Han will stop again if the King refuses Yangjung's demand.
"Daeso, you went to all that trouble in Hyunto."
I just hope it wasn't all in vain.
Father will make a wise decision.
Try not to worry too much.
No.
He'll never do anything to help the Han.
Things have changed since then.
Refusing Yangjung's demand will affect the salt situation... and Father knows we'll have to go to war over it.
This is stupid.
Why are we putting up with this?
That Yangjung keeps on bothering us.
Daeso.
Why don't I just kill him?
I know.
I'm just saying.
You wanna be president?
Just say it.
Say it.
I'll step aside right now.
Can I do my job?
Please.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
- Hello?
"- Hey, it's Noah."
- Remember me?
The guy you used to work with?
- Yeah.
I just heard about your father.
"My, my. [Clears throat]"
- [Laughter]
"- Reverend Robin, the floor is..."
All yours. [Chuckles]
Holy shit.
I don't think I can marry you.
"Well, I don't wanna marry you."
I-I wanna marry her.
- [Men laugh]
- Man:
"Hey, good one, Rob."
I-I can't do this 'cause she's 16.
That's right.
The numerical inversion of my 61.
"According to the ancient laws of Jewish mysticism, we complete each other."
Gross.
Nate?
Do you wanna say something?
[Lowered voice] I'm so sorry I sprayed you.
"Whoa, now... now..."
now I'm an intuitive man.
I'm starting to get the idea that you two don't approve of this union.
"Now whatever happened to, and I quote,"
"""What is wrong with these backwards, pigheaded philistines?"""
"Oh, no, that's when I thought she was Jewish."
Oksana:
She is Jewish.
What got to do with it?
You are anti-semite?
No!
"I... hold... well, hold on."
Is this even legal?
Barry Neufeld?
So what's wrong with him?
"Besides the fact he looks like Gumpy, and he irritates the shit out of you?"
"- Gumby, not Gumpy."
- Gumby.
Why should that matter?
"I'm no great prize, either."
Don't say that.
You are a terrific person and a great teacher.
"The truth is, I think I've reached the point."
- What point?
The point that you know you'll never get married.
Married?
What's marriage anyway?
Oh!
Come on.
"A ring, a contract, fighting and compromising."
"No, it can be more than that."
I'll tell you what I envy about people in love.
I'd love it if someone really knew me.
What I like.
What I'm afraid of.
What kind of toothpaste I use.
I think that would really be wonderful.
"Hey, sister-in-law, you having a good time?"
Yeah.
- Have you seen Claire?
- No.
- I can't find her anywhere.
- I'll go find her for you.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
Kind of a bad guy.
But you got better.
And I...
I always loved you anyway.
I'm glad you came back into Johnny's life.
Mom.
Can you believe this asshole?
He's still asleep.
I heard you talking to him.
"Yeah, well, we're an emotional lot, the Irish."
Giving up on him?
"No, just making my peace with him."
You should too.
"I mean, maybe he's just waiting around for you to tell him it's all right for him to go."
And I'm not saying that just 'cause I had him going today in the pool.
Although that would be a nice parting gift!
I don't know what to say.
You'll think of something.
Thanks.
"Okay, Dad, um, we love you."
You've been a good dad.
You've been an...
You've been an okay dad.
"On a scale of one to ten,"
I'd say you were a six...
You were a five.
Um...
"But look, last year, you really made a comeback."
"I mean, you were..."
You were almost an eight.
But I get it.
You saved people's lives for a living.
They love me.
Ryan:
Castle?
"He's a giant pain in the ass, but he's good people."
Okay.
"Uh, yeah, sure."
We'll help.
"We'll interview Harris' sister, Veronica."
"Yeah, why don't you send us a copy of the murder book, okay?"
Thanks.
"I need a favor, but you can't tell Javi."
[Laughs] I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.
It's not bad.
It's just...
I met a guy.
I like him.
And I want you to run a background check on him.
- Romantic.
- Seriously.
"In this day and age, you can't trust anyone."
I don't want to fall for the guy and then discover he's got a thing for putting the lotion in the basket.
Okay.
"I'll, uh, check it out."
Check what out?
"Uh, this, uh..."
This rash that I have.
"Yeah, I wanted to get Lanie's medical opinion on it."
"Too much information, bro."
"Yeah, that's what I said."
"Later, boys."
Castle:
First thing we need to do is figure out what case Phillip Harris was working on.
What did I tell you?
"I talked to you before, didn't I?"
Didn't I say not to go buy anything for a while?
The fucking car?
It's a wedding gift from my mother.
It's under her name. I just got married.
-l love that car.
-Excuse me for a second.
-l just got married.
-Are you nuts?
-What am I getting excited for?
-Are you stupid?
We got a million fucking bulls out there.
Everyone's watching us.
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.
I don't give a fuck.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.
Don't get anything.
What's the matter with you?
What am I getting excited about?
"Because you're going to get us all fuckin' pinched, that's why."
"What are you, stupid?"
-What's the matter with you?
-l apologize.
-l'm sorry.
-What the fuck is the matter with you?
"I'm sorry, Jimmy."
It's under my mother's name.
What'd you say?
You being a fuckin' wise guy with me?
Watch out!
Statue of David coming through.
Good God.
Look at that body.
- Kevin?
- What do you got here?
"A gay guy, a woman and a black guy?"
What do you call your group?
"""Republican's nightmare?"""
Kevin.
Drug dealing Nemesis.
"I had to go and, I don't know, turn my life around."
"Oh, you ruined the thong song for me, too!"
You guys can look but unfortunately I'm the only one who's allowed to touch.
I'm joking.
There's an alley out back where anything goes.
Nobody's interested?
You guys can take the dollar bills back out.
- Where's Leslie?
- Leslie is at a strip club looking at hot naked men who are not you.
Why?
"Women are complicated, man."
"Oh, my."
There he is.
"There's my B.F.F., my big dog."
OK.
"Look, all right."
"I get it, all right?"
You're sad and you know that I'm moving out.
"But I want to you know I'm not moving out of here, all right?"
For God's sakes.
We're J-ball and D-tell.
- Don't do this to me.
Don't walk out when I need you the most.
Please don't do it again.
Like what you see ?
She's just the greatest kid.
I know it's a terrible parent cliché but she just makes me laugh like no one else I know.
She sounds great.
- You should meet her.
- I'd love to.
"So, what about you ?"
Nothing like that on the horizon ?
"Fatherhood, responsibility ?"
Me ?
"No, not a chance."
Slade said you're seeing someone.
"Yeah, I am."
Laura.
"She's great but you know, early days."
- Are you serious about her ?
- I'm crazy about her.
Is she about you ?
"Of course she is, look at me."
I'm a hell of a catch.
She's just... honestly she's just a bit scared to take it to the next level.
Anyway.
Tell me about...
Stuart.
We met in the States.
He worked in the building next to the hospital where I was working.
"So, I was seeing him all the time."
I've never thought I'd end up with someone in finance.
But he's just one of those people.
It was tan.Sandstone.
- That's two different colors.
- Look...
"Listen,cross-reference Your locations with the word ""Windward."
- Excuse me?
"- ""Windward."
Why do you have to be so cryptic?
What are you working on?
Stop!
"Listen.""Windward."
"Pull up the list of parks,would you?"
"And check for ""Windward."
Sunset.
Sunset...
Sandstone.
***
There's only one Windward park or school.
"Oh,man,Windward elementary.That's close to my shop.I know those kids."
"Hey,Tanner."
You bored of me yet?
We've got a park to check out.
The park's clear!
Swept both playgrounds and the field.Park's clear.
Looks like your intel was off.
Any place that has this turf needs to be closed and searched.
"Yes,mom.We're all over it."
- Watch your step out there.
"- Yeah,you too,Tanner."
Hauser was so sure of himself.He was even more of a jerk than usual.
You gonna rub it in?
*****
Tell me that you're still at the park.
"Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we went from Trey to a lengthy Volchok period."
"Hey, thanks for this."
Yeah.
"Now, unless you hit that Chili guy... or Johnny..."
I know a lot of people were rooting for that.
"Well, I did punch Johnny's dad."
Or a bounty hunter who worked for him.
Johnny's dad was a bounty hunter ?
"Oh, yeah."
I never told you that ?
"Excuse me, Doctor."
My wife needs to see someone right away.
What happened ?
I fell down some stairs.
You break anything ?
"I don't think so, but..."
She needs help.
"Everyone here needs help, sir."
You can fill out this form and wait your turn.
She's pregnant.
Any bleeding ?
"No, but something isn't..."
isn't right.
I'm sorry.
Try to make yourself comfortable.
Hang on a second.
Sandy...
"Hang on one second, all right ?"
I'll be right back.
"Excuse me, Doctor."
My wife would never complain.
She would never put her needs in front of anybody else's.
He was pretending to be unconscious.
I gave him another injection.
Now he doesn't have to pretend.
He has a weak heart.
You can only give him 30ccs within...
"Listen, we know what we're doing."
Is there anything else?
I've located the woman.
She is at the Robin Masters estate with a man named Magnum.
"- Yes, Mr Masters?"
"- 'Higgins, it's me.'"
How did you get this number?
I had it changed.
"'I was lucky, I guess."
I have a little problem.'
- How perceptive of you.
"- Higgins, I can't get out of the car."
'The car?
You've wrecked the car?
'
"No, I haven't wrecked it."
I just can't get out of it.
- Where are you?
- In the Audi.
The Audi?
"- Very clever, Magnum."
"- 'Just get the dogs, Higgins."
'Get the dogs.'
"Tommy, this is silly of you to bring me to this fancy house."
You wouldn't want me to take you some place sleazy?
That would be more in character.
"- More tea, Mrs Greenberg?"
- When?
"When you do, that's why you never see me."
The forensic said it was a boat propeller.
Nobody in her family knew she was leaving town to work.
The girls had one just like it.
JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
These places aren't on the map.
We don't know where they are.
- What's in it for me?
- What do you want?
What size are those?
Size big.
These places are hard to find.
Almost 500 pesetas.
- Five hundred.
- And the smokes.
For the ride.
"I told you, nobody lives there."
It's abandoned.
Want me to open it?
Looks like they left in a hurry.
They left when they found out their daughter had drowned.
They couldn't set foot in the house after that.
You know them?
"Beatriz, Estrella and Carmen."
Charlie's Angels.
The one in the middle is Quini.
- Hi.
- Hi.
His mother disappeared three years ago.
My husband gave her this cross.
She never took it off.
"- I mean, it's not good for clothes."
- It's just cheese.
- It's wax.
"It's, like, balled up wax."
"- Oh, the wax."
- I love the happiness of that moment.
- Yeah.
- Look at Jonny's face.
- Yeah.
- John Cho.
- Holla back.
- I love that shirt.
"- I bought that from the wardrobe sale and gave it to Eddie, a.k.a. Jesus Christ."
"- Oh, really?"
You did?
- Yeah.
The hype man knows what you want but he's not sure if you want it enough.
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?
This was funny.
"So you just randomly picked this extra to be, like, the guy who loves the band, right?"
I didn't even pick him.
"Our AD, Christo, picked him."
"He said, ""You okay with this guy being the fan of the band?"" I said, ""Yeah."""
- Then the backflip.
"- All of a sudden, he can do a backflip and no one knows it."
Right.
"And it was just something he just did, right on a whim?"
"He said, ""Can I dance?"
"Can I do whatever I want?"" I said yes."
- Look at this.
- And then he threw in the backflip.
We just got back from the Balkans.
What was the artifact you found?
A metal box.
An Ark.
The Ark of Solon?
Atticus thinks so.
But that's incredible.
The Ark of Solon is like the Loch Ness Monster of archaeology.
People think it's a legend.
Isn't it supposed to hold the Torch of Truth from Atlantis?
Don't know.
We haven't opened it yet.
This came off a scratch on the side.
"Can you analyze it for me, please?"
Sure.
I'll run some tests in the lab.
Thanks.
Would you like to carry my books?
"Yeah, sure."
What a madhouse.
How do you stand the noise?
This is the rush hour.
You should be here when it's really quiet.
It's enough to drive you batty.
Kelly!
I'm so sorry I missed your lecture.
It's impossible London traffic.
"Hello, Simon."
"Oh, do you remember--?"
MacGyver.
Professor Carson.
"You were at Thera with that buffoon, Atticus."
You should have pubic hair.
"Oh,please."
The head of the English department has a Prince Albert.
So we says.
"You know,you should try this."
It's actually making me kind of randy.
"It's like all out there,you know?"
"I know,I saw."
Augie is going to lose his mind.
That's great.
Why can't you come with me?
I can't put pants on.
I'm all tender.
- So wear a skirt.
- I'm going to be cold.
Wrap a scarf around it.
I think tonight I'm going to consist of S'mores and marathon sex with a grateful boyfriend.
"Fine,whatever."
You suck.
Have fun.
"You,too."
So why didn't I ever meet this guy?
Because we spent most of the relationship sitting in his van talking about feelings.
"You know,sometimes I'm out and I look around at all the men and it makes me want to go home and,like,knit Marty blanket or something."
"Go,Johnny!"
"Whoa,crybaby's a little badass."
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
My father gave us that.
This is yours.
Remember this?
"Oh, no."
Can we just do this without any theatrics?
Please.
- We should have some kind of ceremony.
- What?
"You know, with the boys."
Some kind ofthing so they don't forget we were once-
What are you doing?
Richard?
Leave them alone.
- Do I look well to you guys?
- You should be in here packing.
"Objectively speaking, if you weren't my children... would you think, that guy looks okay?"
He looks like a guy who might have a wife and kids and stuff?
- Are you mad at us?
"- Yeah, totally."
I think you look good.
"Okay, good."
"Space, space, dash."
Is that a Bengal tiger?
I don't know.
"Space, space, space."
Dash.
"And in the dark of the night, and it does get dark... when I call a name-"
When I call a name.
It'll be your name.
What's your name?
Nevermind.
Let's go.
And you went to I.A.?
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you crazy?
Apparently.
I'll take the lead on this.
You jump in if you have a question.
Joe Penn?
Yeah.
We need to talk to you about the complaint you filed.
I already told you guys everything last night.
We're with Internal Affairs.
We conduct our own investigation.
I'm kinda busy.
You wanna retract your statement?
Then tell us what happened.
"I'm drinking a beer, talking to my buds."
"Out of nowhere, this dickmo flies--"
- Which dickmo would that be?
- The big ugly one.
Taggot?
He starts going off on Val.
- Who's Val?
- The bartender.
Taggot was drunk.
How do you know?
- You could tell.
- But how?
Were you sitting next to him?
"Did you buy his drinks, count how many he had?"
"Was he slurring his words, stumbling--"
Why would you assume officer Taggot was drunk?
'Cause Val was trying to cut him off.
She might even die.
How is she?
She went on a hunger strike outside the King's chambers.
She's been out in the cold for four days and nights.
The wretched woman.
She's trying to kill herself.
The King is ignoring her.
Now that Jumong is dead the King doesn't need a hostage.
Why won't he let her go?
He still wants to win her heart.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
Your Highness...
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
Your Highness...
Your Highness.
"Hurry up, take her to her chamber."
"Yes, sir."
"Your Highness, I'm here."
How do you feel?
You've gained consciousness but you'll die if you don't take this.
Please drink some.
I'm ready to die.
I have nothing to fear.
You're dismissed.
I have something to tell you.
I'm the assassin Prince Daeso sent to Jolbon.
I told Prince Daeso that I'd killed the Commander... but he's not dead.
Is Jumong really alive?
There's nothing edible in here.
"So, do you want..."
Where's Angela?
She left early.
"She must of had her reasons, or whatever."
"Well, do you want me to bring you to the hospital..."
- or do you just want to go to school?
"- Well, I... lt's whatever you want, sweetie."
Your mom says that it's up to you.
I guess...
I guess school.
"You rescheduled with Rosenfeld, right?"
And you've got the estimates?
Right?
I got them.
Yes.
Hey?
"Who's in there, what happened?"
Nothing happened.
I'm fine.
- Stop looking at me.
- Stop looking at me.
What are you doing here anyway?
- You are playing this all wrong.
- What are you talking about?
Please.
"Your dad's seriously sick, right?"
You shouldn't even be here.
"People are feeling sorry for you, right?"
- Use it.
Take advantage.
"- You're saying... I'm saying, you have a personal tragedy with a loved one."
And I was head cheerleader my junior year.
Barbara!
"Now, look, what other places did he write to you about?"
None.
Unless you count the place on the card he sent me to propose.
""""" Dear Babs, This is where all our dreams will come true."""
""""" The Old Hawaiian Aloha Wedding Chapel."""
That's a proposal?
"Well, wouldn't any reasonable girl take that as a proposal?"
- Did you go there?
- Without Roger?
"For heaven sakes, why?"
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Yoo-hoo.
Yoo-hoo.
You can't go in there right now.
I...
I'm very sorry.
You can't go in there right now.
There's a ceremony in progress.
That's all right.
We're just looking for a friend.
"You mean you're, uh, not the future Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd Brockman?"
Do we look like a bridal couple?
Uh...
Don't you wish to be married here?
Yes.
No.
"Oh, I see."
Uh...
I wonder if it'd be possible if we could see your gardens?

"Hear me,"

"Corambe, thou who art man, woman and god in one, hear me."

Your fish will die of fear first.
- Are you coming?
- MaIIefiIIe will come looking for us.
- We're supposed to have our lessons.
"- No, he won't."
He's sleeping with Mummy.
She doesn't get up till noon.
He's not sleeping with Mummy.
She doesn't like him any more.
My love?
My soul?
- My sweet?

My heart?
Let's get the doors and windows locked.
"We're staying here, where it's safe."
"He's out of control, and we're not having you going down with him."
I'm not going to let you abandon him!
Who are you?
I'm Bryn.
Your brother.
And I've come to take you home.
"Morning, Len."
It's funny it used to be the sound of the cycling that woke me and now... it's very much the smell.
"The sound you get used to it, not to the smell."
I like it.
"Len, when you work up a sweat it's like a slow-frying sausage."
Whitsun!
What?
Whitsun!
What are you talking about?
What are you doing for Whitsun?
Have you decided?
"Mum, I don't even know what or when Whitsun is."
Are you alright?
You look a bit peaky.
"Yeah, I feel a bit odd."
I might pop to the doctor.
"Oh, Jenny, love."
Have a thing about Whitsun!
Jenny?
What pants have you got on?
"Mum, go inside."
Would you want these *** ones?
You want a decent pair on for the doctor.
"It's like-  ""The Square Root Of Three""?"
"- No, no, I'm sorry-  ""A poem of love by Kumar Patel."""
- I need this.
"- Hey, let me read it."
"- No, no."
- Why?
- Because it's lame.
Then read it to me.
There's no way I'm letting you see me in that light.
Good luck with your calculus.
"Come on, don't be embarrassed."
"You know, a lot of girls find intelligence sexy."
"Look, I'm not even gonna be showing this to my professor, all right?"
That's why I'm so stressed out right now.
"Stressed out, huh?"
Come with me.
- ...going?
- Come on.
What?
You're smoking drugs in the library?
What if somebody catches us?
Don't worry.
It'll help you relax.
"Oh, boy."
It's illegal.

"I still don't know what I'm doing, you know."
I never meant to hurt you.
My son.
My boy.
My baby boy.
"My flesh and blood, pa."
But you ain't no baby no more.
You can make your own decisions.
"We want just want you back home, son."
Just come back home.

Glad you're enjoying yourself.
"Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination."
Now they have a delightful social aspect.
"Amy, you must've been in the bathroom with other women before."
Of course I have.
But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
Every cop in Pittsburgh thinks I'm a rat.
You're not a rat.
You told the truth.
Nick knows that.
"Yeah, we'll look where it's got me."
"It's tough, but you know what my dad used to say?"
"""Loyalty above all else, except honour."""
We're pursuing a murder suspect.
"'89 Ford, dark blue, RHX715."
We just crossed the 31st StreetBridge.
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
- Let's go.
- So much for the policeman's ball.
Take Bigelow.
- Don't you have a date tonight?
- You're my date.
- What happened to that nurse?
- It just didn't work out.
"You've got to give these things a chance, Tommy."
That girl that works for Dutch is awful nice.
- Is there some meaning in all this?
- Grandkids.
What?
I'm not that grown up myself yet.
- There they are.
- Go down the alley.
Send an ambulance to the southbound tube.
We'll trap him at 2nd Ave.
Captain Hardy.
Get out of the car now with your hands up.
- Uncle Nick.
- Is this the policeman's ball?
Great!
You do know Bernie's doesn't allow dogs?
I panicked.
"The only thing I could think of was, ""Sorry,"
"""we'll be locked in the cellar turning into wolves."""
You should probably work on your excuses.
I can't just make up lies on the spot.
Why is my experiment a different colour to everyone else's?
"Probably, because you're right and everyone else is wrong."
"Listen, Maddy was just saying how she can't make it tonight."
Why?
Because...
I just remembered...
I have to stay in and... help Mam with...curtains.
- Curtains?
- Yeah.
She's really into crafts all of a sudden.
I said I'd hold them while she...sews.
- Can't she do it another time?
- She's got a deadline.
Sorry.
Oh.
OK.
See?
You can do it.
Finally.
- We're early.
- Just.
We came straight from school.
It just seemed to take longer.
I know.
"Too much to see, too much to smell."
"It's not like this is my spot, this is Seo Yoon Jae's spot."
I'm sure that perfect Seo Yoon Jae will take care of it.
Eat slowly.
It's hot and spicy.
I can't eat this.
Are you going to die if you eat it?
Keep it down and be quiet!
Yoon Jae...
"The food must be spicy for you, so how about a nice refreshing beer?"
Huh?
Alcohol?
Why not?
"Sure, sure."
I'm not going to die if I drink it.
Father...
Yoon Jae has to drive.
Da Ran...
I don't have a car because it was in the accident.
Yoon Jae...
"You're not even well after the accident, so you shouldn't be drinking."
"I think if I have one drink, it'll help me fall asleep easily."
"-Please give it to me, father-in-law."
"-Dad, dad...!"
Me too.
Alcohol for an 18 year old minor?
No way!
A kid can't drink!
You can't...!
No one's going to deny that you're a teacher...
That's right.
"Since I'm a teacher, I can't watch a student drink alcohol."
You don't have to take me back...
Okay.
"He needs extra oxygen, he's gonna have to spend the night."
"Okay, that will be fine."
"Then, we'll hold off on the film for now, but if he gets any worse... ."
He gets x-rayed.
He says he didn't do it.
"D, I don't like this any better than you do, man."
He wouldn't lie.
"Come on, man."
Did he lie about the tagging?
Or the weed they found in his pocket?
"Look, K.J.'s a good kid, but right now, his judgment basically sucks."
I wanna talk to this Doctor... .
-Dubenko.
"-Yeah, the security guard too."
"D, they don't wanna press charges, man."
"But they're accusing my kid, I just wanna talk to them."
Banana bag is finished and she took a few ice chips.
Who are you?

She should be sobering up by now.
"Glenda, can you squeeze my hand?"
Let's see.
Try and squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.
Come on.
Okay.
Can you open your eyes?
"Glenda, come on."
Good.
You got that?
"Got that,"
Capt. Kechichian?
We were up late.
For a good cause.
"Sure, loitering in a bar at 2 AM, after defacing the wall of a Government building, how can I fault you for being so admirable!"
- Anything else?
- A lead on the van jobs.
A Serbian arms-dealer:
Victor Dragan.
We got a tip off from an informant.
A reliable source?
Not at all.
What do you say?
I know the fellow.
A sadistic loner.
"Barring a lucky break, he'll be tough to nail."
Luck can be engineered.
Briefing's over!
"Vrinks, you stay."
I've been appointed Police Commissioner.
As of when?
I take over on Sept 1.
Congratulations.
I hate to leave before I've cleaned house.
"I want that gang, Leo."
As my farewell gift.
You'll get them.
Another thing:
someone will get my desk.
You're the right man.
Klein wants to be Chief.
Siri is a little ...
-are You fine?
What the fuck you think you are?
Thought he could be quiet and I never find out?
I could not say that Christer was helping us.
There was nothing between Christer and I since high school.
He worked for you!
It was with you that he talked that night!
I can cry if I want to!
Okay.
"Sit down, Siri."
-With Whom you spoke?
'They did not believe me.
"They think I knew, and now they want a lot of money."
-With Whom you spoke?
-I Did not say anything.
A journalist found out.
It was with you that he slept when we were discussing?
"Yes, a few nights on the couch."
I've never been with him.
"You met secretly at night, was not it?"
Why do not you stop him?
It was dangerous!
It was you who did join ...
What the fuck.
You're not my sister.
"He wanted, right?"
He wanted revenge for what happened in Sweden.
He was killed because he worked for you.
You killed him!
"And now they're killing me, too."
The same.
Those two have been my bedrock.
"Yeah, I'm sorry about Darla."
"How's she doing, uh..."
How's she doing in prison?
I think she's okay.
"You know, I learned something."
Sometimes you just have to let your kids... sit in their own mistakes.
Sometimes you can't fix 'em.
Yeah.
"Well, I should get back to the hotel."
"You know, I'm guest of the day."
"[Chuckling] Say, listen, we have a half a pitcher of sangria, it's still early."
"Come on, hang around a while."
Okay.
Let me pour you some.
- Oh.
- Oh!
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
"No, no, no, don't worry about it."
Don't worry about it.
It's okay.
"No, I'm gonna show you something."
You're gonna love this.
- I'm such a klutz.
"- No, you're not a klutz."
"Stop it, you're not a klutz."
"That's what I've been sayin', I've been waiting to show this to somebody."
- [Spraying]
- Watch.

They gave me something.
If you plead innocent and make me try you for homicide I'm going to see that you pay.
What're you sayin'?
This have something to do with this accident?
-I wasn't even driving.
"-Oh, you weren't even driving."
You were too drunk to drive.
You were too drunk to walk.
"You have a witness at the filling station, yes."
Who do you think you're dealing with?
-I know you killed him.
-Come on.
Nice to see you again doctor Jones.
Thank you.

I never doubted that.
Something made it inevitable.
So what are you doing here in Nepal?
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.
I never meant to hurt you.
I was a child.
I was in love.
It was wrong and you knew it!
You knew what you were doing.
Now I do.
This is my place.
Get out!
I did what I did.
You don't have to be happy about it.
But maybe we can help each other now.
"I need one of the pieces your father collected, a round piece about this size, with a hole in off center with a crystal."
You know the one I mean?
Yeah.
I know it.
Where is Abner...

Is Flynn all right?
What can you tell me about Viktor Karp?
I don't know the name.
Karp was moving lithium out of the mine you and mom ran.
ETU raided the offices last week.
He started as a drug runner.
Now he transports weapons.
Is Musa planning an attack?
"- I mean, is that what the Purge is?"
- I...
I don't know.
I never met Karp.
Only your mother dealt with him.
"So Mom dealt with Karp, what did you do?"
I had other business.
I also maintained the family unit.
I took my job seriously.
That part was always real.
Guy's got nine lives.
Got away with just cuts and bruises.

"You know, Damon, we're on the same side."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Which side is that?
- Katherine's.
She wants John Gilbert to have the device.
I think that you know that she's not happy when she doesn't get what she wants.
- Why are you doing her dirty work?
- Don't kill the messenger.
We both know that you can't control Katherine.
- She does what she wants.
- Pfft.
And so do I.
"- Oh, really, Damon?"
"- Don't answer it, Stokes!"
- May I enquire why not?
"They're wearing dinner jackets, we've got to change."
"- Come on, James."
"- Very good, sir."
Answer the door and attend to them.
We'll be right down.
"Yes, Mr Twelvetrees."
"Oh, er, good evening."
"We're a bit early, I'm afraid."
"Oh, that's all right."
Come in.
(Door closes)
I'll take your hats and coats.
Nice weather we've been having.
I was saying to my wife this morning what nice weather we've been having.
- It rained last Thursday.
"-Yes, but apart from that."
- It didn't rain very much.
- No.
Came through my roof.
Nearly had the ceiling down.
I'm sure his lordship's maid doesn't want to hear our domestic problems.
"I don't mind, I'm very sympathetic."
"This way, please, and I'll announce you."
Just look at this place.
All got through the sweat of our labours.
"Don't start, Jock."
We've only just got through the door.
- Mr Foster.
"- (Cissy) Good evening, Mr Foster."
- Mr Barnes.
But he is a responsible police officer.
I can't interfere in this matter.
And what do you think?
Will he let you go scot-free if I tell him?
"That I am his friend, doesn't mean that I have bought him out."
"Ifyou haven't done it yet, do it now. I am with you."
Meaning?
"Here's 1 ,OOO,OOO in this bag."
Tell me ifyou think the price is less.
There is no price for Vijay.
My friend is priceless.
You can't buy his honesty.
Not even for 10 million.
My friend is a man of principles.
Amazing!
He is the first lawyer I have seen in my life whose hobby is to fly an airplane.
Flying isn'tjust an hobby for Ravi.
It is his life's first romance.
His first love.
Tell me something.
- Go ahead.
"Even you must have had a first love, hadn't you?"
Yes. I did have a girlfriend.
But why do you ask?
Just nothing.
Was she in your college?
-Oh yes.
In college...in my class.
What was her name?
The name was...
Meenakshi.
Meenakshi Chatterjee.
"Make that two epitaphs, because I'II kill you if I find..."
"Oh, my God, you're hurt!"
You're bleeding.
Yes.
Be a dear.
Ask UrsuIa if she's got something for a bandage.
Of course.
Don't move.
No.
(lock clicks)
Bastard!
(gentle piano music)

(gasps)
(yells)
"Oh, don't stop!"
"Monsieur Chopin, you were in the middle of a miracle."
I'm not quite yet cured.
How did you get in?
Who are you?
I am your slave.
And you have summoned me with your music.
"Oh, yes."
I think I know who you are.
I have heard you described.
"Madame Sand, rumour has it you are a woman, and so I must ask you to leave my private chambers."
Have I offended your modesty?
I apologise.
- play me one more piece and I'II go.
- This is ridiculously improper!
And frightening as well.
please leave now.
OLDER TED:
"There was no ""next time."""
Maggie's window never opened again.
Hey!
"Hey, I got it!"
"That country bar, Giddy-ups!"
The overalls have gotta work there.
Wingman me?
I don't want Giddy-ups.
I want that.
"I forgot what it feels like to chase the real thing, but I think I'm ready again."
Yeah.
Let me tell you where I'm at.
I wanna have sex with a girl so I can take off these overalls.
Come on.
Come on!
"Ted, you gotta help me!"
I gotta get these damn things off!
MRS. DOUGLAS:
Hey there.
I just love your overalls.
MARSHALL:
Dear 60-year-old Marshall.
By now you should be working somewhere that's making the world a better place.
Or at least trying to.
"No pressure, dude."
"I mean, sir."
"Also, if time travel is possible, maybe you could give me a little sign on Tuesday, December 8th, at 8:29 p.m."
"So, someone sent back these chicken wings, because they were too hot."
"And I'm like, ""Too hot?"
"Are you crazy?"""
"So, free wings."
And take this cucumber.
Nefedov gave it to me.
Eat!
"Ok, you'll have it later."
"OK, I'll go."
May I?
Katya!
Thanks.
It is so good to be a lieutenant.
The comm girls wash your shirts.
That's right.
"Well, Malakhov, some people have bread on their butter and some - pains in their asses."
"-Actually, this line does not rhyme."
- But it is true in principle.
I do not know ifwe negotiate this hill or not...
But there will be no way out.
That's for sure.
"Thanks fortelling this, corporal."
I know.
The next one.
"The next one, please!"
Artillery lance corporal Averchenko reporting for service.
to adjust the fire of our guns.
Why are you so young?
Are you the most experienced one?
"No, thejolliest one."
The company is packed up with jolly people.
Take Malakhov for example.
Come here!
They couldn't have picked an older soldier!
Idiots!
Gretchen!
(LAUGHS)
(CLEARS THROAT)
Blood of the Jabberwocky.
You have our everlasting gratitude.
And for your efforts on our behalf...
-Will this take me home?
-If that is what you choose.
You could stay.
What an idea.
"A crazy, mad, wonderful idea."
But I can't.
"There are questions I have to answer, things I have to do."
Be back again before you know it.
You won't remember me.
Of course I will.
How could I forget?
"Hatter, why is a raven like a writing desk?"
I haven't the slightest idea.
"Fairfarren, Alice."
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
She left me standing there without an answer.
"A case of nerves, no doubt."
-Alice.
-LORD ASCOT:
Good Lord.
-Are you all right?
-What happened to you?
I fell down a hole and hit my head.
"I'm sorry, Hamish."
I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.
And there's that trouble with your digestion.
- Someone's desperate for a diet coke!
"- No, Simon's been attacked by a kid..."
Here?
"What did he do, headbutt him in the knee?"
No.
"Kicked him in the cock, actually, but listen..."
Please say you aren't asking me to protect you from children?
"Hmm, a bit."
"All right, Cholmondley-Warner?"
Is this your bird?
Nice to meet you.
You're just like Will said you was.
- Right.
I hope that's a compliment.
"- Oh, yeah it is."
"You wouldn't mind having a quick word with our boss Jim on the old blower, OK?"
- Please don't.
- New friend?
- From work experience.
A colleague.
- Jim for ya.
"Ignore everything he says, it's bollocks, I promise."
Hello.
Right.
"No, I'm not his girlfriend, no."
"No, we didn't have sex."
"He did, did he?"
"No, that didn't happen."
"No, I'm not a porn star."
"Charlotte, listen..."
I was working in a garage.
You don't understand what it's like.
"Hi, Riley."
ASHLEY:
I think the tie is a bit much.
I'm invited to his home.
I don't wanna look like a schmo.
Then maybe lose the jacket.
"You know, it's 80 degrees out."
It looks like you don't own a more seasonally-appropriate jacket.
"I don't know, I think it looks nice."
Yeah.
"Nice, just kind of sweaty."
- Philip Lewis Friedman.
- Go get 'em.
"- OK, bye."
- Bye.
- Pleasure.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Fix your collar.
- Huh?
- Your collar.
Oh.
Thank you.
I'd seriously consider having a better answer to that question if I were you.
"I'm filling up notebooks, but it's nothing but worthless garbage."
Don't tell people that.
Makes you look lazy and stupid.
Got it.
That probably came out a lot crueller than I intended.
But don't make being lackadaisical and disorganised your thing.
- It sends out a message that you'll regret.
- I see.
He did not come.
Would he be it?
Major lord!
Major lord!
Please!
We are us here.
The Tót family.
The kind Tót family.
Oh finally.
"Tót lord,right?"
Mariska.
And she:
Ági.
"We welcome it with affection the kind major lord and we desire it, feel well in our modest home."
Very kind.
"Says Tót,it is not possible to silence this uproar?"
!
Stop it!
Yeah.
This is the good air.
This silence.
Believe it.
In constant noises and smelliness of 9 monthly a service working...
- What did I talk about?
- That in constant noise and smelliness...
That's right.
I cannot believe in the fact that I am at home
I know everything as your kind son wrote the things though.
"That Bábony... this the valley of Bartalapos kind Tót, we behind my back?"
Only Klein beer garden and the parsonage
Good.
"I ask it from you, live so, as if I would not be here."
She here?
She's not with me anymore.
You miss her?
Very much.
The mantle's quite pronounced now.
You're almost home.
"Hey, Mom."
Why did you come here?
I needed to see you... in person.
"You didn't ask to see me before,"
- when you were with Musa.
"- I wanted to, but I was afraid."
Of your own mother?
"I thought you would reject me, send me away."
"And yet you ran away from the Hunt, from Abby and the others."
It was too much too fast.
"When I saw Jules, I couldn't handle it, but Musa was right."
I don't belong at the ETU.
"I'm tired of hating myself, of fighting what I really am."
You can help me.
"You didn't raise me as a Hunter, but you can now."
I want you to be my mom again.
Why should I believe you?
"I'm here, aren't I?"
Love does swing the hammer.
"I'm not gonna hurt you, Mom."
Then show me.
Come closer.
It's been ten years since we've seen each other.
The least you can do is give me a hug.
You think I'm gonna hurt you?
You would if Musa told you to.
"Now, who'd be stupid enough to break into an ogre's house?"
- Aah!
- Aah!
Booo!
"Oh, wow..."
Terrifying.
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.
"Happy Halloween, everyone."
"Oh, man."
You said this was gonna scare 'em!
Hey!
I worked hard on this costume!
Oops.
Heh heh!
"Admit it, Shrek."
Weren't you even a little bit scared?
"Donkey, ogres don't get scared."
We do the scaring.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
I bet we can find something that will scare the pants off of you!
- Which would scare me.
"- Oh, really?"
And what do you have in mind?
All of us telling scary stories all night long.
There ain't no way you won't be scared!
Yes!
Stories to make your blood run cold!
- Yeah!
- Stories to terrify you.
- Yeah!
- And whoever shall last through the night shall be named the king of Halloween!
- I accept.
What's wrong?
You okay?
- Yeah.
Everything's fine.
- All right.
I don't want to hear about it 'cause it isn't true.
That isn't Artie.
"I don't want to believe it either, Pete,"
But it's true.
"Yeah, well, you shouldn't even be reading that."
Pete.
We should be out doing something.
"Pete, his real name isn't even Artie Nielsen."
It's Artie Weisfelt.
He used to work for the NSA.
He was a cryptographer--a code breaker--
When he was in his 20s.
They recruited him right out of school.
They had him decoding soviet communications.
"He intercepted letters, phone transcripts."
Then they think he turned.
He contacted one of the people they were spying on
And he started selling secrets to the Russians.
"And his file, it just ends."
He was never prosecuted.
It's like he just disappeared.
"But it's him, Pete."
What?
It's definitely him.
You're under arrest.
"No, no, no. listen to me."
I have to take this.
"Joey, can I ask you a question?"
Do you like my shoes?
Yeah.
Why?
Just wondering.

You were lucky.
Is that what I think it is?
I was going through a religious phase.
It's not America.

Q-101 time is 8:30 under partly cloudy skies.
We'll be back with the news on the hour after this 30-minute music mix.
You realize you've been in there for 20 minutes?
You miss me or am I wasting water?
Both.
How much longer are you gonna be?
Your shift doesn't start for two hours.
Yeah.
There's an 8:00 meeting near here.
You gonna go?
I was thinking about it.
Cash or charge?
- Cash.
- [Woman] Cash is $54.
- Right.
Okay.
Please print your name on both tickets before you board the plane.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Have a nice flight.
"- Yes, sir?"
"- Round trip to Washington, please."
[Car Door Closes]
So?
"So everything's going great, terrific, beautiful."
I'll need a few more days though.
The boys think we oughta cool it for a while... just to make sure there's no heat.
You must take me for an imbecile.
Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?
I haven't spent five minutes in New York City... without the company of a policeman.
"Look, I'm leveling with you."
I need a little more time.
It's just that my people think we oughta find a better time to make the switch.
- That's all.
- It has to be by the end of this week.
"Look, Charnier."
You got to be reasonable.
It's your problem.
"Well, it's your problem too."
It's so nice to have seen you again.
[Speaking French]
[French]
I'll see you around.
"Now, just come on in."
Let's count it first.
Make sure it's all here.
"If you got the money, we're good."
It's all there.
"Just bring it in, man."
Okay?
"I wanna make sure I got my money, so come on in and count it."
"One hundred, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight, nine, we're up to a thousand?"
Yeah.
There's one.
"Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, two thousand."
Getting closer.
"What's wrong, Tim?"
You look a little depressed.
"Okay, can we just get this over with, man?"
Just count the money and let us get out of here.
Hey!
"You wanna calm down, man?"
You would think I wasn't the one that got ripped off here.
"Yeah, why don't you call the cops then, Guy?"
"Ooh, good one, Billy."
Three...
Six...
Twenty-nine.
What do you know?
It's all there.
All right.
"It's taken care of and it's all paid up and he don't owe you a dime extra, all right?"
"Billy, let's go."
It's over with now.
"Hey, mi amor!"
"When you're finished playing with the kids, come play with me."
Where is the car?
I got a guy tuning her up in Yonkers.
Going out to the track next weekend.
I'm ready for Le Mans.
You ready to come with me?
Take a chance?
- I can't leave the kid by himself.
"- Excuses, excuses."
You're just fooling around with that register.
"- I have to pay you back, right?"
- That's right.
Good morning!
"The light, Mag."
I'm trying to finish this.
"- Good morning to you, too."
"- Hey, hey, muñeca."
Buen día.
What is it with these space chicks and the hugest tetas I've ever seen in my life?
What happened to the eggs?
The eggs I asked you to bring home last night?
Those eggs?
- I guess they're at the bodega.
- I guess so.
Why don't we go out for breakfast?
We haven't done that in a month.
- I've got to work.
- I thought you were hungry.
"I am, but-- hey, why don't you get the eggs?"
I've got to pick up beads for the dress.
You can't do me a favor?
"Go, go, go!"
Everything ok in there?
I thought I heard something.
It's fine...
Dolores.
- How you've been?
- I thought I heard somethin'.
"You know, I did too."
Sound it's like coming from the upstairs again.
I was sure it was coming from here.
- Did you try next door?
- Are you sure everything's okay in there?
Yes.
"I really should go now, Dolores."
You take care.
- Well ain't...
- Dolores!
Dolores...
Take care.
- Couldn't get it right... go!
- Go!
"115th precinct, Officer Minocha speaking."
There's something wrong in the apartment down the hall from me.
"We're going to take care of him too, you know."
I know.
- I think we should do it now.
- Why?
He's sleeping...
it will be merciful.
"Oh I thought, we're out of bullets again."
"We are, but I can run out and go get some more somewhere real quick."
We couldn't even do it now even if we had the bullets.
"I'll probably do the same with Priscilla now that she's back in town, God help me."
If it works out with Jarmusch
I'll be so distracted that I'll forget about Suzanne.
"Movies equal money, women, glamour..."
- more women.
- I like that.
That's positive thinking.
- But is any of it meaningful?
"- No, but it's fun."
There's Jarmusch.
"All right, let's go."
All right?
Look at that hair.
This is...
"I'm sorry, I forgot your name."
We just met.
Miriam.
Nice to meet you.
George Christopher.
And this is Jonathan ames.
- The man I want to meet.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Could you excuse us?
We have some business to talk over.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Are those hummingbirds?
They're dipping their beaks into flowers.
I love them.
- What was your name again?
- Miriam.
"So I really loved your novel... dark, funny, perverted, beautiful."
Go back to sleep.
"It's all right, Bobby."
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
We're here together.
I think we could all use one of those.
Mr. Gordon?
Shall we go into the other room?
Let's go.
Get started on the clock.
"Stan and I had a brother, Bobby."
He was younger than either of us.
Not quite 7 when he died.
Stan and I were 12 and 14.
We lived in a big house with grounds that bordered a river.
"That particular day, our mother asked us to stay at home and look after Bobby."
We wanted to go swimming.
"What we wanted to do, Bobby wanted to do, naturally."
He idolised his big brothers.
"So we told him to stay in the house, and off we went."
He followed us.
We were pretty far out when we spotted him.
He was trying to...
To get to us.
He still is.
- You mean it's his...?
- Spirit?
Ghost?
"I don't know, Mr. Gordon."
"I do know that often, when Stan and I are together, this happens."
And you believe?
"It happens, Mr. Gordon."
I could give it up for the right guy.
"Oh, that came out wrong."
What I mean is...
"I would, you know, stop hooking if you wanted me to."
"I mean, there is lots of pans with pancakes out there, right?"
I think I'd like that.
Mr. Reznik.
"I am sorry, I thought it was somebody else."
You gave me such a scare.
What are you doing in my apartment?
There is a leak in my ceiling.
It's coming from your apartment.
That's impossible.
I was going to leave a note.
A note?
What kind of note?
About the leak.
What's that terrible smell?
There's no leak in this apartment.
Now if you will excuse me...
"- You're sure you're alright, Mr. Reznik?"
"- Yeah, I'm sure."
"If you need anything, please call first."
Miller.
Miller!
"Hey, Reznik."
It's a pleasant surprise.
We need to talk.
"Take a look at this, huh?"
"Picked it up at Grossens, top of the line."
"Hey, let's not trim anything for a while."
I need to be doing something.
Hello?
Something wrong?
Carter?
What are you doing?
"We really can't help you anymore, sir."
I'm not a junkie.
"The stuff just finds me, you know?"
How convenient.
I need another room for Mr. Hudlin.
He says Exam 3 is full of ectoplasm.
- Did you cut yourself shaving?
- What?
Never mind.
Lipstick.
- Dr. Carter...
"- Mrs. Breeland, you need to stay in bed."
"Otherwise, we might be tempted to put somebody else in it."
"Okay, I think we're getting there."
Hardly.
Board number two is for the patients in the halls.
"We have heat exhaustion, barbecue-smoke inhalation, and boils."
All up for grabs.
- I love my job.
"- No, you don't."
Why are you dressed like that if you can't prescribe nothing?
The smell of fresh med students in the morning.
What is it about them?
They all seem so...
- Gullible?
Immature?
Vapid?
- I was going to say sweet.
"That's not the point, Cookie."
"The point is, what do you do with him?"
"You tip your mitt and the jerries pull him out of here and plant him in some place else, like Stalag 16 or 15."
Or you kill him off and the Krauts kill off the whole barracks.
Every one of us.
"So, what do you do?"
Who is it?
"If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy or Security?"
Yeah.
Security.
What's keeping Hoffy?
- Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
-He'll be back.
They got no proof.
"Come on, boys."
Soft and sweet.
Beguile me.
Betty.
Betty.
Betty.
Betty.
"May I have this dance, miss?"
"Why, sure."
"Pinch me, darling."
"Pinch me, so I'll know I'm not dreaming."
"Thank you, darling."
I love you
I love you
Three words that are divine
"And now, my dear I'm waiting to hear"
The words that make you mine
Did anyone ever tell you you had the most beautiful legs in the world?
- What is it?
- Tabasco.
I've never known Captain MacDaniel to run scared.
I'd kind of like to eyeball this situation.
Don't get killed.
I don't want anything upsetting my plans for going home.
L'll give you full cooperation.
Good night.
You didn't get a chance to give him the whole story.
L'll arrange another meeting.
MacDANIEL:
Kowalski!
Kill that light!
You better check the gun placements again.
I'm going to have a look-see.
Over there.
A heavy concentration to the south.
Let's see what Starlight-Starbright has to say.
That's a ruse.
"Kowalski, MacDaniel, pass the word."
Quietly.
Strengthen the north wall.
I repeat:
Strengthen the north wall.
Out.
KOWALSKI:
"Every third man, north wall, quietly."
"Every third man, north wall."
We had better inform the mortar crew.
- Pit one.
- Pit one.
- Pit two.
"Viljanen, goddammit."
Get up!
Show me...
A disgrace to the entire brigade.
Does he live here?
I'm too scared to sleep.
I can come and keep my finger in your navel.
Easy...
You're moving further down.
"Down, until I can feel your tongue... ah."
Don't turn it off or the neighbors will hear.
"No, I wasn't talking to you."
"He hung UP""-"
What happened to the smell?
-I threw Hakkarainen out.
Don't take any new idiots in.
-Of course not.
The red Batman has moved into building D.
"He's an old friend of mine, Jesse Viljanen."
He was just named firefighter of the year.
He was torching the garbage can!
"-He's a nice guy, really."
I think he's repulsive and nuts.
"What's eating you, Jemina?"
"Grow up, Mom."
Don't let your boy play with matches anymore!
Will you come and work at the office when you get better?
Are you sure?
Yes?
I see...
Goodbye.
You must not torch garbage cans.
"You got a ""D"" on your math test?"
You don't get D's.
"Eh, what are you gonna do?"
"I'll tell you what you're gonna do, Brick."
You're gonna study.
Math is very important in life.
You use math in everything...
"Oh, even I can't say it like I believe it."
Hey.
Hey.
"Look at this... a ""D."""
"- Axl, get in here!"
- This is Brick.
Really?
"What happened, buddy?"
You don't get D's.
We're kinda counting' on you to pull up the family average.
I'm reading at an eighth grade level.
Why can't I please you people?
!
Just reading isn't gonna get you into college.
"Oh, I'm not going to college."
I've decided to live with you guys forever.
Forever.
"Well, mike, you know what this means, don't ya?"
"Oh, jeez."
We're gonna have to help Brick with his homework.
"In our house, helping with homework"
Is something that's never gone well.
Write it down.
Write it down.
Why aren't you writing it down?
"I know all about the new lag,the one who likes to blow things up."
Is that his voice on the tape?
"If you want to know what the song is, then you find out why I am in here all the time."
Deal.
The song?
It's a Korean lullaby.
The thing about land mines is...
You got to remember where you put 'em.
"Otherwise,you blow up your own men."
The lullaby was the enemy's way of communicating that information.
One word in each line indicated a different location.
We did the same thing.
Crosby and Sinatra.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
Grace.
"Snow... ""Beard..."
Grace.
Where are you putting them now?
"""Little brook..."
In the woods.
*****
There's more.
A second verse.
"""Among the pines you flow."
Pine street.It matches.
Broke the lock and put a new one on.

"He broke out,not in?"
This is where he came back.

We decided against Eggshell.
W-why don't we just sell the house?
Why don't we just paint the floor Eggshell
- since that's what I'm walking on.
- Okay.
- I forgot to give this to you.
"- Oh, thank you."
"- Have a good day at school, sweetie."
"- Bye, sweetie."
It's fourth grade.
We're all just treading water.
What is it?
"Ah, well, it's... it's from the principal's office."
- Is she in trouble?
- (door closes)
No!
She's... smart.
- She is?
- That's what it says.
Are you sure it's not for Lily Rosen?
You were at that science fair.
She brought that frog back to life!
This is for our Lily.
T-they're suggesting that she skip fifth grade and go right into middle school next year.
"""Lily is testing far above her grade level..."

"Odds are, that's what got him killed."
"Look, I love a gruesome murder as much as the next girl, but we don't have a client."
And impressing that ridiculous detective society isn't exactly on the top of my list.

Yeah.
This is definitely the place.

You were here 18 months ago.
"Uh, yeah."
It's my place.
So?
Do you recognize him?
"No, should I?"
"Uh, I was here about, um..."
[Speaks Korean]
I was here about a year and a half ago.
Something happened.
You yelled at me.
"Oh, you're the guy with the watch."
What watch?
You...
You couldn't pay.
And then I was gonna call the cops on you.
"And then, uh, you..."
you gave me your watch to hold onto.
"Said you were gonna come back for it, but you never came."
"They let him off the hook, but it wasn't easy, let me tell you."
That's great news!
I guess.
You guess?
"Leo, come on."
Ben didn't burn down the school and he didn't get kicked out of school or get anyone else kicked out.
That's the best possible outcome.
It's over!
Congratulations!
"Oh, it's far from over."
He has to get through the rest of the school year without getting in trouble.
He won't get in anymore trouble.
He's not a bad kid.
Dylan's still circling around.
"Oh, another girl will come along and he'll forget all about her."
"(KNOCKING) No, I won't."
Ben!
I heard the good news.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Congratulations!
We should all go out and celebrate.
He can't go out.
He's on restriction.
"Oh, Leo."
Wait.
"I'm on restriction from seeing Dylan, but I can still go out."
"I'm going out with Alice, uh, we're going to go catch a movie or something."
"Oh, are you?"
"Yeah, she's coming over."
I will just be in the kitchen.
"That's okay, isn't it?"
I'm getting on that train.
What are you going to do to him?
Shut him up for good after I get the diamond.
"Now go on home, wait for my call."
"All right, but be careful."

I cast that cat myself.
"Why, they are my..."

She just went down to get me some more coffee.
Millie's Barbecue.
Maybe that's around on the other road.
I was beginning to think you wouldn't come.
"Edie, always I come when you need me."
"Axel, I've so much to explain to you."
"No, no."
Not now.
I-
"- I only wanted to help you, but I did everything wrong."
I should have told you in the beginning.
I don't want to hear.
"Come, get into the car."
I have money.
Come.
- What?
- And no one will catch us.
"And whatever has happened, I don't want to know."
Come.

Never mind that.

I didn't mean to do this.
She suddenly attacked me.
I'm the victim here.

So you didn't mean to?
Who took off your pants?
I didn't go near her at all!

"Hey Meatwad, how's the job going?"
"Um, just okay."
"Carl washed his car there, didn't he?"
"Yeah, but..."
But what?
I'm having some reservations about this work.
And some nightmares.
Nightmares?
"There was a time in my life when I thought dancing in front of the car wash would be the only thing I'd ever want to do, but the way these people wash cars..."

"Well, Carl seems happy with it."
Is he licking it?
"Yeah, he's been doing that all morning, I'm afraid."
"You know, snakes -- in the wild, of course -- have to unhinge their jaw to eat a car."

"No, there was nothing familiar about him at all."
Let's call it a night.
Send Matt and Caroline home?
"No, the whole point of tonight was to not have to deal with this stuff."

"You're looking great, really."
So are you.
And I know I am.
"- Not a day older older, apart from... from the grays."
- What?
That's big news.
Are you OK?
"Oh, uh, fine, yeah."
"You know, it's a shock."
Hell of a shock.
We're working to find out more.
"Well Danny felt... and we all felt that since you were there that day, you know, you had a.... you had a right to know."
Well I thought about it a lot.

The fault is in the dimensioning routine.
"We can trace it, if there's time."
"Well, can I help?"
Perhaps you can.
This is the machine code of the section that contains the error.

I make those kind of videos all the time.
"You know, in fact, I was about to do one right now."
"Hey... hey, girls."
"It's me, Daddy."
"If you're seeing this, I'm dead."
But I want you to know that I love you now and forever.
"Okay, time for a lullaby, sung in your native Latvian."
Ligo!
Ligo!
Ligo!
"Yeah, yeah, lullaby time."
Look.
"Go to sleep, Daddy's dead"
But his ghost's always watching
What the hell are you guys doing?
Good call.
Blocking the door.
"Keep it up, smorty-pants."
- Oh...
- Uh...
Mwah.
"One of our classic forehead smooches, just like I planned."
- This is weird.
- Should we have sex?
- What?
- Huh?
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
"Oh, it's you."
Yes.
What is it?
"I'm supposed to command a ""human"" team."
"Even if you aren't human anymore, do you still crave a man at night?"
Has the new commander arrived at his post?
We transferred him from SAS.
He seems capable.
"May God and Her Majesty, the Queen, bless you."
- Amen.
- Amen.
"Walter, what is this about?"
"You've made Hamchunk's ""A"" Club."
You funny!
You not.
This is Hamchunk.
He's become a permanent fixture here.
He's an orphan.
Lived with some missionaries about 10 clicks south of here till they were assassinated.
Maybe you could use an interpreter.
- Missionaries taught him English.
- I don't want an interpreter.
You number one.
I choose you.
I don't want to be chosen.
- I don't think you have much choice.
"- Choice, Mr. Hobson?"
I haven't had a choice since I was selected for this outfit.
We'll make you a winner right here.
"You're not a New Yorker, are you?"
"Ferriday, Louisiana."
Huey Long country.
"""Every man a king,"" but no one wears a crown."
I love this guy.
Thank you so much.
Lovely evening.
"Kevin, give me a call in the morning."
I need some stuff for the New York Times.
An editorial lauding our choice of convention city.
The President loves a good Times editorial.
- Let me assure you...
- The vote's in.
We got it.
Let them catch their shuttle.
I'm sure they're running late.
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
"MacNeil-Lehrer, Friday night."
Zapatti's bullet killed the child.
It wasn't the cop.
That's it!
That's what passes for good news these days.
I'll take it.
I saw Tino Zapatti's probation report.
"Exemplary, but an odd thing:"
It's front-loaded.
- With who?
- With supervisory personnel.
But it's signed off on by an honest judge.
- Judge Walter Stern?
Come on.
We do all right.
Love In The Afternoon.
Eh?
"Well, it'll be a big photograph of the choir and the Halle."
"And will we be allowed to, like, buy one?"
We will.
"Did they say how much that photo's going to be, Mr Kirkby?"
"It's got to be four or five bob, hasn't it?"
A big cardboard job.
"Well, I wanted to get one for Mam."
She'll have your school photo.
"No, she didn't get it."
"See you Saturday, Mr Kirkby."
Oi!
Eccles cake.
The labourer is worthy of his hire.
"Thanks, sir."
Bye!
And...
How come?
Mr Kirkby give it me.
"For carrying all his hymn books, because you know he's religious, so he has to carry hymn books, but he can't because of his leg."
Carry them.
"If I only had one leg, I'd put a wheel where my leg was."
"Would you, Mam?"
Put a wheel where your leg was?
I'd put a motorbike.
Get me to work quicker.
# My Christian name is Enid
# My mother is to blame
# She wanted something nondescript
"Listen, kalaya's mother, she was a prostitute."
Your sister?
Yeah.
She has a bunch of kids.
She try to get them out of Thailand.
She doesn't care how it happen.
So she sells them to drug dealers.
This isn't the first time something like this happen.
Can I see her?
Kalaya?
Kalaya?
Hey!
Kalaya?
Kalaya?
I need an ambulance.
Someone stole my palm pilot.
"Oh, well, welcome to the club."
Jake left his wallet in his suit coat.
300 bucks.
"Yeah, and one of the secretaries is missing her disc player."
"Can you excuse us for a second, Jake?"
You bet.
You gonna talk to Liz about this?
About what?
Jeremy.
Are you serious?
He was out there the whole time.
"Well, even if it's true, I'm not gonna call his mother and accuse her only child of stealing from us."
Agnes:
They found 4 small balloons of heroin in her stomach.
One of them leaked.
She gonna be ok?
What's going on?
Jenna?
Sweetheart.
"Oh, honey."
"Sweetheart, what's the matter?"
"All right, come on."
"Come on, just come in."
"Oh, sweetie."
"You'll be fine, sweetheart."
- Jenna?
"- Hey, it's me."
- Hello.
- Is she there?
Anna?
I'm coming over.
Please don't tell her.
"I know I'm being such a pain in the ass right now, but I had to come and see you."
- Hi.
- Hi.
"I know you're like, ""This girl's a freak, get her away from me,"""
but I have something for you.
Don't you want to know what it is?
"I made you, like, the best mix CD ever."
"I mean, there's a ton of stuff on it."
Like some really cool Madison bands that I'm sure you've never heard of before.
"And, like, the first song that we danced to."
"And there's also, like, this song of me playing the flute which you're gonna think is totally God-awful."
But I thought it'd...
- Kim.
- What?
There's something I have to tell you.
There's something I have to tell you.
"No, I can't forget him."
That's what I thought.
I knew that very well.
But he doesn't live in our world.
Right?
That's not true!
Are you saying that when you're dancing with me it's like dancing with Kayama-san?
That's crazy.
"Hey, should I wait for you?"
Wait?
That's...
Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it here and now.
I'm not thinking about getting married now.
You didn't like the way I said it?
"No, that's not it."
"It's just that when I see my mother and father,"
I feel nervous about marriage.
Can't you help your mother?
My mother's problems go beyond the problems in our family.
I'm my mother's unfulfilled dream.
I'll taking care of your dancing.
But marriage is frightening to me.
I have the feeling that I'll end up like my mother.
Oh!
"Shinako, when did you get here?"
"Hello there, NMzu-san."
Did you see Kayama-sensei?
No.
He got sick and went somewhere.
I met Tomoko.
Tomoko?
How is she?
?
Don't forget this!
I'll give you a ghost charm isn't it pretty?
I'll give you another leg I'll give you two fists
"Watch my ""old man pushing a cart""!"
I'll beat you!
I'll do the beating!
I'll kill you!
Where'd you come from?
I...
He...
Where'd your crystal grapes come from?
Speak up!
Picked!
I picked them!
Nonsense!
Sure they didn't fall from the sky?
Speak up!
Where'd you pick them?
At...
At South...
At the South-hill plot?
"Nanking's 18 mounts, fleet horse on the road"
A boat sailing before the wind carried it over with great difficulty!
How about you?
So far!
"Monkey somersaulted 18,000 miles I took the grapes and lifted my heels and walked 109,200 miles!"
I still think you got them from South-hill!
I'm warning you two
Those grapes belong to Clearwater Winery!
What!
?
"Say, Gloria..."
- Alvaro!
- Lella!
"So, this is your boyfriend?"
You mind your own business!
And what are you doing here?
I brought you some ice cream for your birthday.
Why are you dressed like that?
You look like a whore.
"Alvaro, I..."
What should I do with this?
I don't even like the stuff.
To hell with it...
Lella...
"- By the way, how much do you charge?"
- Fifty thousand.
So... fifty plus fifty makes a hundred...
Good...
let's do a threesome!
Guys!
"You look like the ""Night of the Living Dead""."
"Come on, cheer up!"
- Always with your jokes!
- Will you ever change?
"Come on, Ciotti is starting his rounds."
We need to hurry!
"- No, not here!"
- Over there!
"Guys, women being as they are, we don't mean to cause problems,   we're just having fun."
"Excuse me, Professor, have you seen Miss Italia?"
- Why?
- Because I'm supposed to have an injection.
But why would somebody lie about this?
I hate those little orphans.
"Off the record, of course."
"With the key vote only weeks away,"
Bernie Frazier today responded to rumours that Mayor David Kenneth may oppose her Newman measure.
"Well, Dickie, the mayor and I are good friends."
He personally assured me of his support before he left town.
"Clearly, someone is lying."
- Harold!
I didn't understand what you said.
- What the fuck are you doing?
"- What the fuck are you doing, man?"
- You're ruining my shot.
- You what?
Get off my set!
I'm so confused.
What's...
- What's going on?
"- Harold, I'm doing a photo shoot."
For H/gh T/mes magazine.
"Of course, you're a model."
You're very hot.
You're a model.
Right.
I always wondered what you did for a living.
I'm sorry.
"So, wait a second."
So you're not with this dude?
Are you kidding?
Me?
- Yeah.
- No.
Serving drinks to the meanie moms or watching Marly's husband massage your gums with his tongue?
"I know, I'm sorry."
I should have locked the door.
Yeah.
That's pretty much the only thing that was wrong with it.
"You know, I'm not Marly's biggest fan, but she really doesn't deserve this."
"Yeah, I know."
"It's wrong, it's wrong."
But I hope that you and I can still be friends.
"Yeah, I don't think so."
Why?
Because I'm Portuguese?
Because I'm a maid?
"Uh, no."
"It's because, well you're kind of a whore."
"- So, what's up for tomorrow?"
"- Well, we should definitely get together."
"I could swing by, maybe we'll catch a movie."
Great.
- I don't want to.
"- Oh, thank God."
"When you were married, we spent about three and a half hours alone together."
- And that was over 15 years.
- That seemed about the right amount.
So I'll see you around.
Maybe we can do something next spring.
"- That would be great, Dad."
- What?
- Bye.
- Bye.
[ENGLISH SDH]
Using the artifacts-- but that someone--that someone is Macpherson.
And I can prove it.
Remember?
"Artie, we've both seen you like this before."
"No, no, no, no."
He planted this on purpose.
He wanted me to find it.
Otherwise he would've been much too careful.
He's taunting me.
Would you listen to yourself?
You are leaping to wild conclusions
Based on nothing.
"And meanwhile, your team is falling apart around you."
"Oh, they're not falling apart."
Myka and Pete are fine.
Are they?
Did you know the tsuba's now under Dickinson's control?
Did you know Bering and Lattimer had been detained?
They're at the hotel.
I'm taking you all off this case.
- Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wh--what if I'm right?
What if it is Macpherson?
"Go home, Artie."
"- Artie, where are you?"
- It doesn't matter.
New orders.
You two stay in the hotel and you wait for me.
I will take it from here.
What's the matter?
- Shut up!
Be normal!
"Hi, Will and Mark."
- Marcus.
"- Right, Marcus."
Come on in.
## I felt all flushed with fever # # embarrassed by the crowd #
# I felt she found my letters # # and read each one out loud ##
"- What you singin', fuzzy?"
Mind if I borrow this?
Yes.
Jesus!
This is crap.
"Can I have that back, please?"
It was a Christmas present and...
You pathetic shitface.
Give him that back or you're gonna get a slap.
Tricked ya.
Now... off before I get really cross.
Slag!
Slag!
"Why does me hitting someone make me a slag, I wonder?"
Boys are peculiar creatures.
"Not you though, Marcus."
"Well, you are peculiar but in a different kind of way."
"Are you a little slow in the head, Marcus?"
No.
I'm just funny.
- That's what everyone tells me.
"- You are a funny one though, ain't ya?"
Is it because your mum tried to top herself?
- How do you know?
"Flat-coated retriever, possibly, but poodle, no!"
Professor Barkway merely...
Barkway doesn't have a leg to stand on and he knows it.
Mary left the work to me.
All of it.
"- What, she put that in her will?"
- Of course.
The funeral was four days ago.
We buried an empty coffin.
- Were you there?
- No.
"No, because you didn't know her."
Let alone spend 15 years of shared life with her.
"And yet here you are, demanding her work, demanding her papers, anything she left behind."
"""Come on, hand it over!"""
As if it's your right!
It isn't!
Is that clear?
Very clear.
"Miss Cramer, we've clearly got off on the wrong foot here."
"Poodle or no, all we wanted was a chat."
Maybe we could have one over a cup of tea.
With buns?
Cake?
Cream?
I know a place.
"Mr Matthews, thank you for bringing it round."
I'll be right with you.
- How come it looks like it's melted?
- It's a G-Wizz.
"Well, gee whizz."
It's an electric car.
- Two in the center?
- No.
Rules are different for cops.
- I'm losin' my shirt here with you guys.
- So what do I got to do?
- Five out of six in the star.
- Five out of six.
"- Hey, Freddy."
- You a cop too?
"Yeah, yeah, I heard ya."
Enjoy your trip to the big city?
You gotta hit the next five to win.
Shit!
"I just hope you're not trying to prove anything, Freddy."
I know some of them are real assholes.
They think they're high priests or somethin'.
I don't know.
But why would they do all this?
Maybe they're doin' the right thing.
"Liz, I saw these pictures of Ray meeting with these guys."
"You know, like mobsters."
Everyone's houses are financed by these mob banks.
Says who?
IA?
Even you said Joey's death was no accident.
"Joey fell off a building, Freddy!"
Okay?
I don't need this opened up.
Maybe you do.
I don't.
All Joey wanted was a place for us to live.
Who are you to judge that until you've walked in his shoes?
- What a pro.
What a pro.
- I didn't ask him to do that.
- He's aces.
"- Yeah, I know."
I didn't ask him to do that.
He just did it.
Really thoughtful.
- He was hilarious.
- I didn't dislike smooching Jay.
It's hot.
I'm just gonna say it.
"- Just, you know, say it."
- Just gonna say it out loud.
- that gay band We're Gay.
It was great because...
- We're Gay.
- We're Gay.
We had been shooting for a while when he came in.
And we had all gotten pretty tight pretty fast and it was just cool.
He came in and was just so awesome.
"- Yeah, he jumped in."
- Just jumped right in.
"Oh, man, do you remember Rafi put a bunch of Babybel..."
"- You know, the Babybel cheese things?"
"- Oh, yeah."
They come wrapped in wax and Rafi got a bunch of those and balled them up and put them in the back of Jay's jacket as a joke.
"And Jay was okay, but the wardrobe lady was not pleased with it."
"Oh, man."
"I won't name names, but she was angry."
What happened?
Did they melt all over the place?
Edgar.
Heard you got deported.
"Yeah, did Mexico stick its finger down its throat and send you back?"
That's very funny.
It's a shame
Mitch isn't around to hear how witty you two are.
"Man, I know you're still pissed."
I should've told you that--
"Told me what, Edgar?"
That you're a selfish asshole with no regard for anyone or anything but your sorry-ass self?
No.
You shouldn't have told me.
I should've already fucking known.
"Hey, man."
"We don't all feel that way, Edgar."
"As a matter of fact, I got you new headshots-- a little welcome home present."
[crowd laughing in the theater]
What do you think?
"- [laughing] Oh, man."
- Fuck you!
"Come on, man, we're just fucking with you."
Man!
Prison has changed you.
Yeah.
Baby.
Eat.
They seemed so nice.
"Yeah, get used to it."
We're gonna be fine without him.
Even you said they were pretty big.
"Yeah, I say all kinds of things."
Why do some people get so much?
We're supposed to have dinner with Judge Maynard and Timmy.
"Yeah, okay, as soon as I finish this level."
"No, get your coat on."
It's a three-hour drive to that cabin.
Can't you just cook something here?
Excuse me?
I am not going to cook you dinner while you sit here in your own mess playing your TV games.
"Oh-ho, and the martyr returns."
"Chris, I..."
I think it's time for you to go.
"Okay, I'll go."
"But I want you to know,"
I faked all my light-headedness.
"Mm, good Kool-Aid."
"Whoa, whoa."
Sound familiar?
"Oh, my God, Chris."
"Oh, there you are."
I've been looking all over for you.
Why?
You want to humiliate me with more slave work?
"No, I..."
I wanted to apologize.
I should've never blackmailed you.
I'm really sorry.
And I want you to come home.
I thought you said no one would miss me?
"I said a lot of stupid things I didn't mean, Chris."
But I miss you.
"Thanks, Meg."
"I miss you, too."
"You know, living in that family, we both have pretty crappy lives."
This is a smile.
"Yes, it is, 'cause you love your auntie Nai, don't you?"
Oh.
"Oh, isn't he beautiful?"
"When Maya was little, I used to just watch her breathe."
Isn't this the best?
Sure.
I am hogging the baby.
I'm sorry.
Who wants him?
It's Addison's turn.
"Oh, go, go, go."
Yes.
But you're coming back to me.
"Hello, Lucas."
He did just smile.
He smiled.
"Wow, this place looks different."
Pete...
I'm surprised to see you here.
"Unless you're my 2:15 appointment, in which case,"
I'm glad you're finally dealing with your kleptomania.
"Well, that's funny."
You're a funny guy.
"Look, I need to talk to you about Violet."
Are you sure this is a good time?
"Okay, I've been a little overprotective."
You mean territorial.
Whatever psychological term you want to use is fine.
I'm not here to argue with you.
"I told you when you brought her home from the hospital to her home, that was a mistake."
She wasn't ready to face the trauma.
Good afternoon.
I'm Pedro Suarez.
- The manager is expecting me.
"- One moment, please."
ACCESS PROHIBITED TO NON-EMPLOYEES
It's this suitcase.
- Shall I open it?
"- Yes, open it."
The guy was really weird.
He had a problem with a guest.
What problem?
Something weird with a very young girl.
I think that's why he vanished all of a sudden.
Poof and he was gone.
"Rovira Galvez, Sebastian."
Sexual assault on a minor?
Whereabouts unknown...
A two-year-old warrant for his arrest...
Anything else?
Any friends who know him?
"No, he has no family."
Nobody in his town ever saw him again.
He didn't even go to his mother's funeral.
"Yeah, yeah."
Thank you very much.
The wages are nothing!
It's not enough to survive on!
You should know we're going through rough times.
Mr. Alfonso is offering 20% more than last year.
- 150 pesetas more per day.
- That's nothing!
"Silence, please!"
I guess you could say I've had a romance with the West... since I was old enough to read.
- You miss that ocean?
- Sometimes.
"You know, I never learned how to ride."
Is that right?
Glendolene.
"It's a nice afternoon, John."
I enjoyed my lobster.
"And I know Mr. Horn did, too."
I'm glad you liked it.
"- Excellent afternoon, John."
- Joe.
Tom.
Giddap.
"The way I see this, you'll be a stock detective."
See that the rustling gets stopped.
You can stay here at the ranch... and I'll pay your wages as a cowhand.
$200 for every rustler that goes somewhere else... to ply his trade.
- Who do I report to?
- To me.
"And as far as you are concerned, you and Joe Belle never discussed this."
"And for that matter, neither have I."
Twenty-five.
Do I hear 25?
Would you bid 30?
Thank you.
Now a half.
Would you bid a half?
Would you bid 35?
40.
"Thank you, sir."
Now a half.
Couldn't win this war without them.
Captain.
I'm sort of new out here.
What's this all about?
"Muldoon and MacDaniel, in those choppers fly low over the treetops and hope to draw V.C. Gunfire."
You mean there are V.C. That close?
Yes.
"Mr. Beckworth, I have V.C. In my own strike force."
Pardon me.
I have to check the perimeter.
"There they are, building a boat bridge."
MacDANIEL:
"They're not Cong, they're hard-core regulars."
Petersen you worry me.
Three tours of duty and you're still acting like a civilian.
"Sergeant Muldoon, I'm not a Marine."
I believe in my comfort.
We got the tin.
What about the .50 caliber?
Don't worry.
Next drop.
How'd you do it?
A guy in Khe Sahn wanted 2 cases of bourbon.
Bourbon!
How'd you get 2 cases of bourbon?
From a straight leg in supply in Bien Hoa.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Why would he give you that much booze?
He didn't give it to me.
I traded him for it.
Traded him what?
-How you doing?
You all right?
"-Yeah, okay."
I....
I wanted to apologize.
"Oh, no, we finished with that sorry business already."
Sorry for getting you into this situation.
"No, you didn't get me into anything."
I got myself into whatever we got into.
-I was just curious about you.
"-And I, you."
You're the least likely person in the world for me.
-Are you insulting me now?
-No.
"No, not at all."
A compliment.
I think you helped me.
"Okay, a little positivity."
"Yeah, you helped open me up."
"Yeah, and I would've opened you up further if I had my way."
-That's disgusting.
"-No, not really."
It's honest.
-You should work on your manners.
-I know.
"I'm trying, believe me."
I wanna tell you something.
All right.
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
"I made mistakes, a lot of them, I know that."
I live with them every day.
The hardest thing I live with is knowing how much I've disappointed you.
"Hello, doc."
"Hi, Connie."
"- Just coffee, please."
- Right.
"Who's that, doc?"
That's Mrs. MacKenzie.
She runs a dress shop.
"She has a daughter in the senior class, Allison."
Beautiful woman.
She's a widow.
"Born here, but she had ambitions, and left."
Married in New York to some ad genius.
"When he died, she came back here."
- I'd like to meet her.
- Wouldn't do you no good.
Bring your coffee.
"Connie, you haven't met Mr. Rossi, the new school principal."
- How do you do?
- Hello.
I hear about you every day from my daughter.
You've been working kind of late?
"No, I've been to the movies."
Allison's giving a party.
What does she plan to do after graduation?
She'd like to be a writer.
I'd like her in college.
It's too bad she has no brothers and sisters.
- Why do you say that?
- Just that I'm against only-child families.
Only children receive all the attention of the parents.
- Good and bad.
- I don't think Allison turned out badly.
Love you but I got to go.
I know pizza-boyfriend beats omelet-daddy every time.
Thank you.
Yes!
[Singing to the tune of William Tell Overture]
-She's got her guy
"-Her best friend, too."
-Her life seems great
-That can't be true.
We've still got lots more show to do.
Wash your hands to prevent the flu.
[Horse neighing]
What?
It rhymes.
And it's a good message for the kids.
[Continues singing] You'll never guess what happens next.
It twists and turns and gets complex.
"It's fun, it's sad, it's something new."
-My legs are sore
"-My butt is, too."
[Groans in pain]
Stop bouncing so much.
[Humming]
[Singing] My Barefoot Cinderella.
"Got my Jesse and a pizza yeah, life's a breeze."
Gonna get a deep dish with extra cheese.
Oh. [Chuckles]
Twelve-hundred miles and you still look like you just drove off the lot.
How do you do it?
"Pretty much getting everything you want, aren't you?"
Yes I...
"-Pretty freaky, isn't it?"
"I'm telling you, this son of a bitch killed her, this Mike."
"I begged her to tell me, but she refused."
His last name's not in the book.
This is gonna be very helpful.
So it's not a suicide.
This girl was murdered.
-You read how she was gonna quit drugs?
-Thank you for giving us the diary.
-You have leads?
"-Yeah, we're working on things."
You find this Mike.
He murdered my little girl.
"-You wanted to see me, sir?"
-Yeah.
"I want you to go over to Health Services and take a drug test, officer."
-A drug test?
What for?
WALLENBECK:
For cause.
Lieutenant brought facts to my attention that warrant it.
-l don't get this.
-You have a problem?
"No, sir, absolutely not."
I got nothing to hide.
I would like to know who's spreading rumors about me.
-No one's spreading rumors.
-Health Services expects you.
"-lf you got nothing to hide, not to worry."
"-Yes, sir."
You know where you're going?
Lefrak City?
"Yeah, I know where l'm going."
See who dares call me Fat Pig in future!
Fat Pig!
- Get him!
- Yes sir!
"Oh, it's you who made this sound?"
"Don't look at me, look at the glass."
"Yes, a spy needs to be very secretive!"
So you're Fat Pig?
"No, but I know a Fat Pig is eyeing my 'Beast'."
"So I got you to uncover him, and I found out."
So you've set me up!
"I told you not to look at me, look at the glass!"
What if there's no glass?
Then look at the ash-tray.
- What if I look at the vase?
- lf you like!
Where's the 'Beast'?
- ln my head.
- What?
"The 'Beast' is the formula for an atomic bomb,"
"Meant to have a deal with the American, but got chased about."
So I got you to help me close this big job.
"Oh yes, big job!"
Can you see it?
Very clearly.
- Does it look good?
- Looks great!
You're still looking at the good view?
"Not any more, only at the menu!"
Lucky you!
Why?
"That's what happened to me, stared at the good view too long."
I'm weird.
I'm going crazy.
Something really does seem weird...
"What's more important, my birthday or training?"
.
"Come on, Bulma-san..."
I've known your dad for how many years now?
"That reminds me, Bulma-san, how old will you be today?"
Ouch.
How rude.
Why would I ever tell you that?
.
"Oh, dear."
Wow.
I've never been on a cruise ship before.
You can tell they're the richest family in the world.
Goku-sa's sure got some great friends.
Is it true that you've prepared a castle and an... aeroplane as prizes for today's bingo contest?
"Yep, that's right."
But the Grand Prize is even better.
"""Grand Prize:"
"Secret"""
"All right, Kuririn."
"With Maron here, that makes three of us."
Let's make sure we go home with that second place castle.
Huh?
You're fine with just the second place prize?
Is second not high enough?
"Oh, I didn't mean it like that..."
"Oh, Goku-sa..."
Why'd you have to go training' at a time like this?
.
"Yes, sir."
He's been here for like 20 minutes.
"Oh, god, do they suck ass?"
And you're already dressed.
And what they're gonna do is they're
"Gonna bring you out through this side,"
And we're gonna put on your shoes.
Great.
"I'm gonna shoot with this guy, who's"
Half an inch taller than Mike in the 10-year-old fucking mask?
That's brilliant.
Who's fucking idea was that?
"Oh, that looks really great."
Motherfuckers.
INTERVIEWER:
What's that?
"They got the fucking 10-year-old mask on a 6'2"" guy."
MAN:
It doesn't look anything like-- we have a stunt man.
Somebody could have asked.
Anybody could have asked.
Somebody could have asked.
I had no idea they were shooting with it.
I'm sure--
I put together pieces of this makeup for a stunt man.
They don't care.
"No, they just don't fucking care."
They could do the rest of the movie with a 10-year-old
"Mask and 6'2"" guy."
Right?
Why not?
They just don't care.
- [sighs] wayne.
you take care.
[engine turns over]
"- see, you could wear that to the sizzler or the prom."
that is gorgeous.
- it's growing on me.
- [sighs] okay.
- i wanted to thank you for what you did for tim.
"it pains to say this, but i've never seen him look happier."
- so is this some sort of an apology?
"- well, look, i'm sorry, too."
so...
"- uh, uh. baby steps."
- [chuckling] i agree.
[spits]
- [spits]
"- is everything okay, ladies?"
- yes.
- ah!
i knew it!
[all chuckling]
"- so, bob, i was thinking about a christmas gift for you."
"- oh, no."
this is all the gift i need.
"- since mama handed me this store, and she's your mama, too, why don't we become partners?"
- oh.
i-i don't think that would be such a good idea.
"- um... you know, it might not be a bad idea."
"look, there is -- there's a line outside the door."
"- but we can talk about that, but not today."
today is christmas.
"- well, merry christmas, you two."
"AII right, but you gotta get over it."
So I unwrap the paper... and there she is... with her head held high and her ears perked up.
And there I am smiling.
What happened then?
"still, I gotta be the sad clown."
"A front for my friends, my family."
"You know, a brave front."
I've heard you describe yourself this way.
-About what?
"-Well, I do need a place of my own."
So I decided to take you up on your offer.
And which offer would that be?
To check out your apartment.
"Alex, it's nearly 2 in the morning."
But you said you were a night owl like I am and you walked me home an hour ago. I just figured--
What?
"Oh, my God. I'm sorry."
-lt's okay.
-No.
You know what?
It's not okay. I misjudged this whole thing again.
I'm-- l'm just-- l'm leaving. I feel terrible.
There's nothing for you to feel terrible about.
"Yes, there is."
Okay?
"Here you have this life, this great. wonderful life."
And I keep imposing myself on it.
You are not imposing.
I know that I am.
"You're not, okay?"
It's fine.
Please.
How strange.
It's 20 past.
It's just that in Spain we aren't as punctual as you.
But are you sure about what you're saying?
Yes.
"He was speaking with Himmler, I'm sure of it."
"He said: ""Dank, Heinrich"" and hung up."
And he's accepted everything.
We'll call the Ministry.
They will know what's going on in Montserrat.
"No, we're outside Spanish territory."
Our cell phones don't work here.
We'd have to return to Irun and there's no time.
But Amelia and her team are in this time.
We could get off and call from the station.
You're right.
I'm going to get off.
No.
They could call for you at any moment.
It would be suspicious if you weren't here.
I'll take care of it.
"But where do you think you are, Ramblas street market?"
Montserrat is a spiritual retreat.
(Cell Phone)
(Cell Phone)
(Cell Phone)
Excuse me.
(Cell Phone)
Yes.
Irene.
"Well, not too well, truthfully."
"Actually, if I'm honest, things have gone to shit."
"A pneumoencephalogram, I would think, to pin down that lesion."
It will involve another spinal.
"Oh, Christ!"
"Well, what we missed in the EEG and the arteriograms could conceivably turn up there."
At least it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
Dr. Taney says the x-rays are negative.
"In other words, normal."
You keep any drugs in your house?
"No, of course not."
Nothing like that.
Are you sure?
"Well, of course, I'm sure."
I'd tell you.
"Christ, I don't even smoke grass."
Are you planning to be home soon?
"I mean, uh, to L.A., I mean."
Um....
"No, I, uh--"
I'm building a new house.
My old one has been sold.
I don't know.
I was gonna take....
I was gonna take Regan to Europe for a while after she finished school.
Why do you ask?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
Hello?
Sharon?
Shit.
God.
Sharon!
"What do you mean, leaving Regan by herself?"
Her window's wide open.
Landlord says she lives alone.
"And it appears that Pamela or JMJ or whoever, has a predilection for white cotton gloves."
He saw white cotton gloves?
Through her bathroom window.
12 pairs hanging on clothes pegs from her shower curtain.
It's her!
She's the killer!
She's the killer!
Yeah.
The electronic scratch on those anonymous calls?
She used a device to make her voice sound like a man's.
"Sorry about the interruption, JMJ, it was rude."
My name is Pamela.
Pamela?
Do you have a light?
Hmm.
I'm confused.
Why does the lease to your apartment read JMJ Wilgis?
My lease?
"What do your initials stand for, JMJ?"
Pamela.
It's Pamela.
Then who's JMJ?
"Is she, what, your sister?"
Why does she have 12 pairs of white cotton gloves hanging on her shower curtain?
- Answer me!
- You can't treat me like crap!
- Sit down.
- Go to hell!
- Sit down!
- No!
Sit... down!
"Look, I keep telling you, I haven't got a girl."
- What's she like?
"- Oh, about 40."
I thought you said she was a girl.
- I wasn't referring to her age.
- Eh?
Oh.
Poor Henry.
"It never rains but it pours, hmm?"
I've never seen her before.
It's a lie.
- What?
- Whatever she says I've done.
- Oughtn't you go and find out?
"- Yes, I jolly well will."
And be careful.
You might fall.
- Good evening.
Did you want me?
- I'm sorry to come like this.
"I know you've done something dreadful, too, but you needn't pay a penny."
- What are you talking about?
- That beastly Dennis.
"Come here, will you?"
...and there were magazines on Sonny MacGregor and a lady called Ransom.
"Now I've nothing to lose, I'm going to expose everything."
- To whom?
- To the police.
You may have nothing to lose but other people have.
"- You don't want to pay him, do you?"
- I have my reputation to think of.
I can't discuss this with you here.
"-Either I will go, or go... hopefully."
"It sees, María."
"-Yes, lady."
"And now it studies, that you have the examinations."
"yes, study, study..."
What I am going to study?
"We do something, comes."
"God, what beautiful you are..."
No.
-Why no?
-Because not and point.
If everybody does.
"Stay put, watch the film."
"-Sight, watches what it is doing to him."
-If you knew what you haríía I...
"Only would to see if still worked,"
If I worked or I endorse?
"They call Perennial Dust to me,"
"In addition, after a time between grates,"
"Then all good goes,"
"You remember lnés Badoer, its artistic name, if therefore it is possible to be said, Inés?"
To the attack!
"Alvaro, quiet."
It is possible that you only think about that?
"Yes, Yes."
Only in that.
You already know that I do not want.
"But, if we are engaged."
Indeed.
Ten patience?
no?
"Have I it, she is who does not have it."
Dr. Cairn had it personally adjusted for you.
- Thank you.
- Very good.
Please!
Please don't do this!
Where is Dr. Cairn?
!
"- Dr. Cairn has given you to me, my exquisite... pitiful little creature."
"- I'll do better, I promise."
Please give me a second chance.
"Please, please."
- Don't worry.
This will all be over soon.
This is a special day.
"- No, no, no."
- A celebration.
"- No, no, no."
- In your honour.
- No.
"Life is changed, not taken away."
Bodies grow slowly and die quickly.
- How have your dreams been of late?
"- After my parents' passing,"
I had the most frightful nightmares.
- Mm-hmm.
- Now... my dreams are different.
- Different how?
"Isabel, we spoke about this last week."
"Without complete honesty, the healing cannot take place."
"- Yes, sir."
"Lately, my dreams have been... strange."
"They feel so real, I hardly know where the dream ends and reality begins."
I don't understand.
How does that make you money?
Do carol singers have to pay you 10 percent?
"They should, but you can't always catch the little bastards."
It's on every Christmas album ever made.
Elvis did it.
The Muppets.
An American punk band called...
Remember where we live?
"Flat 2, 31 Craysfield Road, Islington, London, N12SF."
"England, the world, the universe."
Yeah.
We'd like to go to Planet Hollywood.
Jesus.
Really?
Yeah.
It's supposed to be brilliant.
Planet Hollywood is horrible.
Marcus?
This is hopeless.
Look at the length of the queue.
"It's probably because Bruce Willis is inside, or Sylvester Stallone."
They won't be in there.
"Yes, they will."
They're here all the time.
Unless they're working.
"Even then, they try to make films in London so they can come here for lunch."
I'm really hungry.
Does this place you're talking about have good fries?
Fantastic fries.
Come on.
Let's go.
- lf you're concerned with the truth...
why did you lie about me?
- Your name didn't even come up.
- Not the gun thing.
With Sharon !
What you said to her about me and Jordan Catalano.
- What are you talking about?
"- l heard her, Brian."
You told her terrible things.
False things.
You lied to her.
"I didn't lie to her, I just..."
What difference does it makes.
I can imagine what she did with it.
But it's just that you lied too.
When you said you didn't know about Jordan coming over that night.
I thought about it for like fifty hours.
"You knew it, didn't you?"
You used me.
- lt's not the same.
- Maybe it is because...
you just did what you wanted.
And didn't care about what damage it did to anybody else.
What damage did it do you?
Angela?
Angela.
Can I talk to you for a second?
- How are you doing?
- You know.
Life goes on.
I was thinking about what I said to you yesterday?
"You know, the thing."
FRIENDSHIP
We don't have profound conversations.
I ask how they are doing but it's mostly just being polite.
If I really had a problem -
- I think they'd   quietly disappear.
I try to be just like them.
I try to be like them so they'll accept me.
It isn't really acceptable to be different from the others.
I've got loads of friends.
All over the world.
I go to L.A. I get in anywhere I want   because I know people and I'm friends with them.
With celebs and so on.
They've got money.
You can't be friends with people who've no money.
How did it go?
- Let's stop now.
- You can't stop now.
- It was your idea.
- A stupid idea.
I'm sorry.
When I hook a guy I won't share the money with you.
"Hey, baby!"
"Hey, Marc!"
- I thought you left with some guy?
- It's been a really lousy night.
Cheer up.
We're going to an after-party at Peter Skjoldmark's.
Have some Cristal.
Why are you always on booze and coke?
You're 26.
You need a wife and kids.
Send me one of your girls.
Let's bring him in.
"Deep-dive every team that competed in those races, Patton."
Especially Dana's.
I'm hoping that a hacker can find a fellow hacker.
"(chuckles) Come on, man."
That's what I'm all about.
That's why I do what I do.
"Well, go do it."
"Come on, Christopher."
Where the hell are you?
(line ringing)
(phone ringing)
(door closes in distance)
(phone continues ringing)
(sighs) (beeps)
(train passing)
Hey.
What the hell are you doing here?
I come here to give you a friendly warning.
Stay away from Tucker and his mom.
You understand?
(laughing):
What?
"Get out of here, right..."
But I don't think you heard me.
"Look, I may not be Tucker's dad, but I'm not gonna let anything happen to him or his mom."
"So, if I were you,"
I would just... stay away.
- Or what?
"- Well, trust me."
You don't want to find out.
"You see, that's my boy and my woman."
I'm going to kill youraunt.
She nevertells me anything.
"Look at his gorgeous eyes, his pearly teeth."
"Mom, don't embarrass him."
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
!
"What's that hair, pussy boy?"
It looks beautiful.
Don't you ever risk your life like this again.
Mom...
I'lljoin the army.
Silly boy.
F... ing liar...
My son would never upset me...
"I'm so broke, nobody will give me a job..."
You can find so many jobs...
I can send you money...
How the hell can you?
My aunt is having a hard time...
What now?
"Because of the army, I haven't seen daylight for years."
You can go-go dance in the army...
"Cihan, go get some air."
Yourdaughterwill come back as a man from the army.
Save it for your hairy ass.
Excuse me?
"Cihan, come on, son."
"Sorry, dear."
How did this army thing came up?
Look what the military did to yourbrother...
Yourfather...
I don't want to loose you either.
You sent that to Tyler.
(screams)
I can't go home.
I can never go home again.
It can't be that bad.
Whoa.
I have never even seen this on the Internet.
You watch that kind of stuff on the Internet?
Sometimes.
Don't you?
"No, it's blocked at my house."
"I thought it was because of my dad, but now I'm wondering if it's because of my mom."
Hmm.
You'll be fine.
"My dentist accidentally sexts me, like, once a week."
Ooh.
You know what I'm gonna do?
"I'll look him in the eye and I'll just say,"
"""Hey, autocorrect completely changed the grocery list I gave your dad."""
"Well, not completely."
"I mean, ""cream"" and ""meat"""
could have stayed the same.
"God, Tim, why?"
Why aren't you helping me with this?
!
"I'm sorry, honey."
"I'm just enjoying this too much because, for once, it's not me who screwed up."
"Okay, you know what I need?"
I-I need the advice...
of a professional.
Did I do this to you?
Did I make you like this?
She was first in the room.
"I followed immediately after, sir."
Who's Miss Kelly?
"She works for Mr. Sabourin, sir."
Yeah?
And where should she be found?
"She's in his mother's room, sir."
You mean his mother lives here with him?
"Just since she came from Europe, yes, sir."
Let's look over the rest of the room.
Show me his personal things.
"Yes, sir."
"This way, sir."
It couldn't have been robbery.
"Yeah, if it was they overlooked a lot of cash and jewelry in these boxes."
"Diamond cufflinks, diamond rings, women's jewelry."
"Look at this, gold handcuffs."
Must be a dozen of them in here.
"Yeah, they're all over town."
He liked to think his women were his slaves.
Show me his mother's room.
"Yes, sir."
"This way, sir."
I'm sorry to break in.
We're police.
I'm her doctor.
You can't disturb her now.
He can ask me anything he wants.
"I'm sorry I have to do this, mam."
But do you know anything about this?
No.
I know nothing about who killed my son.
I humbly ask you to tend to your children with love.
Deign to see the pain and suffering of my friend and those like him.
"Chun-su, what are you doing?"
!
They'll take everything away anyway.
I'd rather bum it myself.
I'm going to destroy everything and follow my friend.
Chun-su!
Please tend to my father's grave.
He's burned everything!
Who's next?
First old man Yim then his son Chun-su: who's next?
Say something!
Are you mute?
"Don't get involved, Father."
"Hush up, boy?"
Old man Yim was like family to us.
But we just let them take him.
"Heck, we didn't even go to his funeral because we were afraid!"
What do we have except our friends?
"If we lowly peasants don't stick together, who are we to trust and depend on?"
Who goes there!
"Soon-shin, I'm here for you!"
It's me.
Yim Chun-su!
Soon-shin!
Soon-shin!
"It's me, Yim Chun-su!"
Soon-shin!
Soon-shin!
What are you waiting for?
Stop this man!

Keep Savage and our Nazi friends occupied.
Gideon has detected a temporal signature consistent with a timeship.
"If Kendra and Carter are alive, that is where they're going to be."
"Yeah, I see it."
- Jax.
- You miss me?
Is he still nuts?
"No, he's okay."
Take this to the ship.
What the hell was that?
You transmuted the molecular properties of the rifle.
What does that even mean?
"Okay, let's get out of here."
Kendra's down.
"Rip, we're kind of outnumbered here."
Fall back.
Staying here to fight Nazis is exacerbating the damage that we have already done to the timeline.
- But Kendra...
"- Is alive, thankfully, and we will rescue her in due course."
I hope.
- So this is a spaceship?
"- It's a timeship, but yes, it does also travel through space."
"You... you've seen it before, Mr. Hall."
That used to be my name.
"Now you form up here, put fire down on them."
They're coming and I'm going to meet them.
Captain Goree.
Come on!
"General, what are your orders, sir?"
What do you want me to do?
Where do you want me to go?
"You've got to pull back, General."
"Pull back, sir."
Place the guns.
Bring up the guns!
God!
"How are you, T.J.?"
"I'm tolerable, sir."
They aren't coming.
Too bad.
"Yes, sir."
General.
I'll tell you plain.
There are times when you worry me.
No good trying to get yourself killed.
The Lord will come for you in his own good time.
"What are the orders, sir?"
"Prepare for defense, but the Yankees aren't coming."
"Come on, boys."
I have the figures from Pickett's command.
General Armistead is missing.
"General Garnett, missing and figured to be dead, sir."
"General Kemper is down, seriously wounded."
"Sir, of the 13 colonels in Pickett's division, seven are dead and six are wounded."
No more.
You tell me the rest later.
"Do you want to know what I'm feeling, George?"
Mm-hm.
Hungry.
Adam?
"Do you want to go in and spend some time with your dad, and say goodbye to him?"
I don't have a good feeling about this.
Someone's just died.
You're not supposed to.
Adam hasn't just lost his dad.
He's lost his food supply.
He's going to have to feed again soon.
"Oh, my God."
- Where is he?
- Out.
"Oh, no."

You were a teenage boy once.
You know what they do.
"- Yeah, wank at any opportunity."
"- Well, that's helpful."
"Well, no, there's other stuff, but none of it really registers."

I'm Seaman Robert Epplund.
We were on the Hagen together.
You knew Petty Officer Adams?
"We were friends, yeah."
I just found out what happened.
I can't believe it.
He was doing fine when I saw him last night.
What time was that?
"Uh, like, 11:00 or so."
"His crew was the first section off for liberty, we were the second."
He was in a great mood.
He was going to see his girlfriend.
"Like, totally in love with her."
He kept saying she was the one.
"""The One's"" name wouldn't happen to be Meredith Bilson, would it?"
"Yeah, that's her."
Does she know?
We'll stay in touch.
Thank you.
Thanks.
The director has always been very protective of his family.
That should come as no surprise.
"No, it's not just that."
It's something else.
Can't put my finger on it.
"And you're worrying that whatever ""it"" is may prevent the director from seeking the truth?"
"It's not him, Duck."
It's me.
Family or not.
I gotta do my job.
"Do you have news, Dr. Mallard?"
I was just about to brief Agent Gibbs.
Then I guess there's just one problem left.
"And what's that, Your Majesty?"
How much I'm going to miss her.
Aha!
Yes!
Thankyou.
Thankyou.
"I love you, Daddy."
Now we can walk Now we can run
Now we can stay all day in the sun

"Boy at 18, nothing to boast;"
"Woman at 40, beauty most,"
"Man at 40, what a ghost."
"Woman at 80, sparkles and glows,"
"Man at 80, coffin soon to close."
What's your rank?
"Supermac 99, and yours?"
-No!
-You'd better take your boy and go.
"I've never, never been so humiliated and disgusted!"
Allison!
Come back here immediately!
"If you keep this up, someday I'll do what you keep accusing me of."
I don't doubt it.
You're just like your father about sex!
"In that way, you're just like him!"
Don't you say things about my father.
He was a wonderful man!
-Wonderful.
-Fine and good to you.
That's what you told me.
So don't blame him for anything!
"Wonderful, and fine, and good."
That's what I told you?
I lied.
I lied about him because I was ashamed of him and of myself.
-Then why did you marry him?
-I didn't!
And he didn't marry me because he already had a wife!
"-You don't mean that, mother."
-I do mean it.
-Don't you understand?
-No...
He had a wife!
No!
Nellie!
Allison!
"Connie, everybody reacts differently to suicide."
"With Allison, severe shock."
What could it be?
We're waiting.
Gamze came here too.
The three of us are waiting.
What's Gamze doing there?
May God watch over you guys.
Did we buy those devices so the three of could stand together?
I congratulate you guys.
Is this all you can do?
"Ok, dude."
Calm down a little.
"Now, put your phones on silent and wait until you hear from me."
We won't give up.
We still have time.
We will keep waiting.
Uluc says we'll wait.
Come on.
Hello?
They arrived at a shopping mall.
I am following them...
Is everything alright with you guys?
"Things are a little bit complicated here, but you keep following her."
"My dear Candan, it is such an untimely devotion to music."
Here's your mobile number.
"Now, I need an address for a recording company."
"Pick it up, pick it up."
Hello?
- Am I speaking with Professor Candan?
"- Yes, speaking."
"Professor, I am calling from Bemol Records"
:
-This is Cevat Ceyhan.
"It would go great with cocktails or, uh, for a snack or on crackers or to make small sandwiches."
"- Even those, uh, ""ooh-doovas."""
-What?
- Hors d'oeuvres.
-Huh?
Hors d'oeuvres!
"They'd be good for that, too!"
"Here, just taste this."
- Just taste it.
"-No, no, no, I'd better not, Kramden."
I'm on a very strict diet.
No.
How can this harm you?
"It's homemade, pal."
- Here.
Take a little bit.
- Well. ..
"just one, if it's homemade."
Hey.
This is very good.
What did I tell you?
L-I've never tasted anything like it before.
"Everybody that tastes it says the same thing, Mr. Marshall."
- This'll be a riot.
-Yeah.
"Well, I want to try it on someone else."
"Oh, Ms. Evans, please tell Mr. Peck I'd like to see him in here for a moment."
"Mr. Tebbits, too."
"Kramden, this appetizer has possibilities."
"If it's handled right, it can be a big thing."
"Now, tell me, is this your wife's exclusive recipe or could there some..."
"be someone else involved, like, uh..."
"So, one-way ticket to Peru?"
I'm hitting it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Yeah?
About what you said the other day.
I thought it didn't bother you.
"You know, Sam, I saved your hide back there."
And I saved your hide at that church...
And the hospital.
I may not think things all the way through.
Okay?
"But what I do,"
I do because it's the right thing.
I'd do it again.
And that... is the problem.
"Y-you think you're my savior, m-my brother, the hero."
"You swoop in, and even when you mess up, you think what you're doing is worth it because you've convinced yourself you're doing more good than bad..."
But you're not.
"I mean, Kevin's dead, Crowley's in the wind, uh..."
We're no closer to beating this angel thing.
"Please tell me, what is the upside of me being alive?"
You kidding me?
You and me -- fighting the good fight together.
[ Sighs ]
[ Sighs ] Okay.
"Just once, be honest with me."
You didn't save me for me.
You did it for you.
What are you talkin' about?
I was ready to die.
I was ready.
So I was very happy to only photograph...
"His trousers, his boots, the sidewalk, and this car."
"I really liked that, and..."
Also what I liked was...
"To blur the whole picture, except the upper outline."
What's that?
It's beautiful.
It's a sunrise on Fès.
I went to Fès in April...
"And people told me ""Did you take pictures?"
"!"""
"I say ""Sure, here's a great sunrise on Fès""!"
And I show them...
And they're a little bit surprised...
"It is Fès, that's obvious..."
Fès is here...
"There's the brightness of a lamp, but..."
"No, it's not a lamp..."
There's Fès...
And there's some brightness...
Those two things together can make a picture...
Can make a picture...!
Two heterogenous things can make a picture together...
Like a sunrise in Fès.
I seduced someone with this picture.
I send it to him...
He fell in love instantly with the picture...
He's also a photographer.
"He felt close to it, especially for this."
The end.
That's all.
I want to thank (...) For their help.
Then you whacked your aunt and uncle.
"Shut up, Calum."
I'm just saying.
At least with Lenny you know it's someone who probably deserves it.
Not just some scared kid in a trench.
"I didn't fight in the trenches, Calum."
You wouldn't be going to see your sister if Lenny hadn't got you out of prison.
"Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do it."
OK.
He can find himself another hitman.
I'm sure.
"OK, kids, lunch is ready."
You should get yourself a new map.
Nah.
This is my only school prize.
The names are out of date.
I know.
But the old maps are the best.
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that's a brilliant name for a country.
Are you gonna talk to me?
What do you wanna know?
How did you get out so early?
Where you're living now.
What you're planning on doing with your life.
I'm out on licence.
Living in a kind of halfway house.
My life?
"I don't know, Jess, you're gonna have to give me a little bit more time on that one."
Is that it?
Of course it's not it.
I did it for you.
No.
- Don't ask!
That's 20 Navel...
"Er, Navy!"
"Navy Cut for you, Mrs Turner, and for you, Mrs Ellis."
-
- Thank you.
-
"- You get worse, Granville."
-
"- Keep taking the pills, Granville!"
-
"- And who is she browning herself for, is a question that springs to the lips."
It can't be her husband.
Have you seen him?
It's the way he walks.
Nobody's going brown all over just for him.
Can you imagine him with nothing on?
I bet we'd have to if we saw him with nothing on!
He's fixed her up with some wonderful kitchen units.
Has he?
-
- What are you glaring at me for?
-
- What am I g--glaring at you for?
Look at all them opportunities you missed!
They only came in for cigarettes.
That's all they ever come in for.
What they come in for is up to them.
What they go out with is up to us!
Can't get a word in edgewise with them two.
They never listen.
-
Please.
You're frightening me.
"Can't you stop that, man?"
This is a hospital.
Abel to Security.
"Abel, are you down there?"
Abel to Security.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not frightened of you!
I'm interested in getting some hours in the sleep lab...
"I only sign off on the paperwork, Elmer, as I think you know."
Good luck.
Dr. Massingale.
I heard you need volunteers in the sleep lab.
"Elmer, that depends."
On what?
Whether you're interested in working or flirting.
"You've got a bit of a reputation, I'm afraid."
- As a flirter?
- And for being a practical joker.
I'll be the best sleeper in the house.
"Okay, but you..."
"What's going on, may I ask?"
"We waited, and then we held the meeting without you."
"Really, Dr. Hook?"
Very funny.
But regardless of what Dr. Hook says... the meeting begins when I arrive.
It ends when I leave.
Any questions?
Have a seat.
Any time.
Any admissions since yesterday?
- he's left the country?
"- On the contrary, sir."
"He's here in this room, sir."
Your banker's draft Sir Arthur
How did you know?
You smelt of Turkish tobacco - a kind you can't get in Spain.
You didn't touch your pork at the monastery
And remember speaking Yiddish in the coach?
"Sir, you are an edel mensh."
A gentleman
"Did you know about that banner, sir?"
"Well, I knew you'd risk your life for the army's wages, but I couldn't count on superstition."
Time to go.
"Hasta otra, Richard."
No.
Sir Arthur's pleased as punch.
"So you say, sir."
"Say, is it?"
And don't I have your promotion for first lieutenant in my pocket.
Wellesley's going to take the army into Spain.
"It'll be bugles, battles and bags of glory."
"Stick with me, Richard."
I'll see you right.
"You'll see me dead, sir."
That's my boy!
"Oh, well done, Pat."
Well done.

Give me a week.
You know I need the money up front.
You know I need the money up front.
"So, you hated her."
No.
"No, no, no."
"Uh, no, she was a nice person, just sometimes she wasn't nice."
Now we're getting somewhere.
I saw that!
We have several eye witnesses that place you at the scene of the crime and a few hundred of 'em overheard you say you wanted to kill miss Weather.
"No, no, I di- I..."
"Okay, maybe, but I..."
"Look, I just..."
That's not the kind of thing I would ever...
"Okay, look..."
"I know, I know, I know, I gotta stop babbling."
"I gotta- and I gotta stop laughing nervously, right?"
She's going down.
I heard that!
Look you don't know what I'm going through.
You try being pregnant 27/4.
It's confession time.
You did it again!
Hey.
I'm Shaye.
"What are you doing here, Shaye?"
There's no way Corrinda coulda killed Heather.
And I have the footage to prove it.
Shaye.
"Look, I'm not gonna let my baby momma do jail time."
Even if I don't plan to help with the kid at all.
Mm-hm...
"Okay, I'm so mad!"
"I am so mad at her,"
I could just kill Heather Weather right now.
We work in this store.
"Yeah, I've been working in this mall since '97."
- Yeah.
- Back when the big and the tall stores
- were still segregated.
- Pre-merger.
- Yeah.
- I'm Jen... and I'm the store manager.
"Anyway, do you have a girlfriend, Irving?"
How do you know my name?
"Well, there's a... a reason I'm the manager."
You know what I'm saying?
"Anyway, girlfriend?"
Yes?
No?
"If you do have a girlfriend, everything in the store is half off."
I thought I had a girlfriend.
- Ah.
"- She didn't ""like"""
his Instagram of him surfing.
My boy got dropped!
- Ball tap!
- Oh... (whispers):
Ball tap...
"Hey, well, did you ever think of maybe just, like, talking to her?"
"Like, asking her why she didn't ""like"" the photo?"
"All right, who are you guys?"
Do you even work here?
"Three-time manager of the year, right here."
"Yeah, I've won a lot of awards."
"Okay, then how come every guy who works here has his shirt off but you?"
What's up?
Both of you.
We don't want anyone injured.
Put down your weapons.
"Until the captain says otherwise, I give the orders on this bridge."
Go back to the ship.
You have to come with us.
Captain!
"Shh, it's all right."
Contact the captain.
Belay that.
"I gave you a direct order, Ensign."
"I'm sorry, Major."
"It's over, Major!"
Take him to his quarters.
"Aye, sir."
It's Commander Tucker.
Put him through.
Go ahead.
We've got the captain.
What's going on up there?
The bridge is secure.
Tell Phlox to get the Imaging Chamber ready.
We've got a patient for him.
"Acting Captain's Starlog, We've resumed our course for Azati Prime."
Major Hayes and his men have been temporarily relieved of duty.
Dr. Phlox believes he's found an explanation for the captain's behavior.
Where is he?
"In his quarters, resting."
Do you recall when the captain was attacked by one of the eggs?
It sprayed something in his face.
Mmm.
I thought it was a defense reflex.
- You are the...?
- That's right.
I am the babysitter.
"Yes, yes."
Thank goodness that you've come.
My boy.
I don't know what's gotten into him.
I've never seen anything like it.
"Trust me, buddy, I've got three little ogres at home."
This will be a piece of cake.
Father.
Father!
"- OK, then."
"- Look, I'm telling you."
I've tried every trick in the book.
You see?
"""Once Upon A Time-Out""?"
"Oh, come on, now."
- You're gonna listen to a goose?
- Please.
You don't understand.
It's like he's two different people.
"What your kid needs is discipline, not a bunch of psychological mumbo jumbo."
"You just gotta walk in there, look him in the eye, and show him who's..."
Please tell me he's an only child.
Bubblegum fish pants...
Hello.
"Well, here's your problem."
His head's not screwed on right.
"When you wish upon a star, you get lots of stuff."
"Well, I wish for a nice, quiet evening where you go to sleep and I raid the icebox."
OK.
- I just— I gotta—
- What are you doing?
- Call you back.
- Excuse me.
"Moe, I apologize."
He just walked in here.
"I'm sorry for rushing in like this, but you were right."
"They tried to kill him like you said, but he got away."
Now he's runnin' through the woods.
He's like a scared animal.
He's scared to death.
That motherfucker should be scared.
His uncle got this case closed with one phone call.
"I'm sorry it took so long for me to come around, but you were right."
I couldn't see the truth.
"Like you said, the evidence, my loyalty, they were confusing."
They never give you any napkins in this place.
What am I supposed to use?
You want this?
What is this?
"You came to me, to my town... with all these speeches, talking about doing the right thing."
I'm doing the right thing.
What's goin' on?
What are you doing?
That was like two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago?
- What about Babitch?
- What about him?
Fuck him.
- What about Donlan?
- Fuck him too.
What about Joey Randone?
Why should my wife make dog food?
We haven't even got a dog!
"Now, look, I could be wrong."
Anybody can make a mistake.
"Well, you certainly are wrong."
I don't think I am.
"But if you want to make sure,"
I'll get Charlie.
He raises dogs.
-(chuckling):
Dog food.
-Charlie.
"Boy, jealousy, sometimes."
I'm telling you.
"Well, it'd better not be!"
"Yes, Mr. Peck?"
"Charlie, do you know what that is?"
I should know.
I've been using this for years.
It's dog food.

"You know, Alice, a French name would be cute for him."
"Well, I'll worry about a name for him after I get Ralph to agree to let me keep him."
"I told you, you're worrying over nothing."
"Once Ralph gets a look at that little face, he's got to fall in love with it."
"Well, I hope so."
"You know something, Trix,"
I never realized what wonderful company a little pup is around the house all day.
"You know, this day just flew by."
Sure.
"That reminds me, I gotta be getting back upstairs."
"For the traditional, parents flanking their graduate child."
- Don't they look proud?
- They do.
Very proud.
What is that?
It's pictures of Sookie's high school graduation.
What was your high school graduation like?
"It was dignified, as most French ceremonies are."
"Poetry was read, a string quartet played, a ballerina performed."
Drank Boone's Farm out of a bota bag and knocked a beach ball around?
I don't understand half of what you say.
That's why we work.
- Hello.
"- Hey, Lor, how you doing?"
Christopher.
I'm good.
I'm excited.
You should be.
It's a big day.
Did you get my present?
- What present?
- A basket.
You should've gotten it by now.
- Did a basket come for me?
- It came.
It was heavy.
"I felt a twinge, so I dropped it for health reasons."
It's probably still intact.
My cracked staff has just informed me of its arrival.
I'm going to find it.
I put it together myself.
- And it's all for me?
So... are we good?
So-
(SIGHS) He basically knows.
He doesn't know jack shit.
FINN:
"Well, he knows that you have some kind of information."
How long is he going to be content just piggybacking your bets?
I don't know.
Forever?
I got it under control.
"You look like hell, Jasper."
Are you even sleeping?
"You know what, man?"
Get off my dick!
You and Callie both get all this money for doing nothing.
- You should be happy.
- We're all in this.
Callie and I are sharing the risk.
I hope you have a back-up plan in case this thing with your bookie falls through.
I seem to remember you wearing something a little different in tonight's photo.
"Screw you, Jasper."
I'm not going to start as long as he's here.
"Yeah, no, Jasper was just about to take a walk."
Aren't you?
I am?
Yeah.
"Yes, don't forget to come spy on me at 8:00."
(DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS)
So I don't really know what I'm doing here.
You're going to have to walk me through it.
Sure.
"Um, we just need to get you in the same pose in the photo."
I think someone took my wallet.
You heard Ed.
I gotta get some sleep.
So-
"Come on, Jerry."
Give him a six.
Yes!
Look at that.
He listens.
"You are the man, Jerry!"
Oh!
I'm winning more money.
I'm winning more money!
All right.
"Keep it comin', Jerry, 'cause I'm in the zone and you are en fuego."
I've never seen anything like it.
We've switched tables on him.
We've switched decks.
We even switched chips.
The man keeps dealing winners.
How much has he cost us?
"This guy is up 300,000."
Are you sure the dealer isn't cheating?
Maybe he's signaling the player.
We did a complete analysis.
It's just one of those streaks.
"Well, if he continues on one of those streaks, doesn't it make sense to put him where he's gonna cause the least amount of damage?"
"Yes, Miss Mancuso, it does."
"The people here, do they think about making sense?"
"We try to, Miss Mancuso."
And what's with the Miss Mancuso routine?
I thought you told me that's what you wanted me to call you.
"Ken, the kiosk man. """
Amazing.
Too bad this guy didn't run a hot-dog stand.
I'm here for allergies.
These things are pushing me over the edge.
Can you get rid of them?
Or give them to someone a little more deserving.
Who saved flower boy's foot and moved more patients than anybody today?
"Me, that's who."
"You' re gonna miss me too, because I'm out of here."
"- Banker's hours, Pratt?"
- Only if they work doubles.
"Hey, Carter."
What's up with your boss?
Is it true she was crying earlier?
- Weaver?
- Yeah.
Bad breakup or something?
- Been pretty moody lately.
- Lately?
I'm sorry!
I think this man needs immediate attention!
- You gotta help my pops!
- What happened?
They came in the ambulance entrance.
- I saw he was diaphoretic.
- Not asking you.
We were playing ball.
He grabbed his chest.
- When did the pain start?
- An hour ago.
- Thought it would go away!
"Gigi, he's not coming."
But you can tell me the story about the molars.
I'd love to hear it.
Hey.
How could he already not like me?
I screwed up.
"I told Bill it was Thursday, not Tuesday."
It's my fault.
Hi.
Are you good?
- Can I get a Jameson on the rocks?
- Sure.
GIGI:
Awesome.
I'm stuck with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.
"Meanwhile, this girl, she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak."
- This one right here?
- Mm-hm.
"Oh, God, no."
How do you know?
The guy working the Tom Cruise thing?
"She's interested, he's clearly not."
You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not into her.
"Actually, I can."
I see this stuff going on every night.
Watch this.
She's going on about her macrobiotic diet.
"He's thinking, ""Dear Christ, get me out of here."""
"And look, how fortuitous."
"Drinks spill, which is perfect for him, because now..."
He can move on to the girl with the shoulder tattoo.
"Man, you have a gift."
If the best they could come up with is...
Me.
False humility-check.
I'll be there.
I hope you don't mind.
I invited Nate and Blair.
I really want them to get to know you.
Terrific.
I'd be honored.
"Well, Rufus and I would love to come."
"Uh, why don't you grab a plate?"
Help yourself.
What?
He left when I was 2.
The man's a total stranger to me.
You have to at least give him a chance.
"No, I don't."
"Okay, everyone."
Let's sit down and enjoy this wonderful food.
"Dad, here."
Sit here.
"Rufus, scoot over, please."
Please.
Thank you.
"Hey, Blair, what's up?"
I thought I'd come and watch your lacrosse game.
"So if you could make sure that there's a seat for me in v.I.P.,"
"Preferably next to an injured cute player,"
But not one on scholarship.
Since when do you care about lacrosse?
Since I desperately needed to get away from N.Y.U.
Everyone's planning their living arrangements for next year.
Have you split up?
You could say that.
"Believe me, I could see it coming."
"Don't ask me how, but I did."
"There was something in your relationship, forgive me, that didn't work."
When are you leaving?
"- Very soon, but I'll see you before."
- I hope so.
I'm sorry you're going.
- I'm off.
"Benigno, see you soon."
- Yes.
Has her period come yet?
Going by last month's nursing report it should have come.
"Yes, it is a bit late."
It's over two weeks.
That's too much.
Are you sure she had one last month?
I put the towel on her myself.
It was the week you had flu.
She even seems swollen.
"Yes, but at times they can be irregular."
Lydia's periods have stopped.
You're right.
But I think we should tell Dr.Vega.
I brought some of my travel guides for Alicia and you.
Thank you.
I've said good-bye to Lydia.
I tried to see Alicia but Dr.Vega and the head nurse were there and I wasn't allowed in.
Is anything wrong?
"No, I think Alicia has got an infection."
Can you take me home?
How nice.
Look at this.
It's worthless.
Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.
"But I take it, I burry it in the sand for a thousand years it becomes priceless."
Like the Ark.
"Men will kill for it, men like you and me."
What about your boss?
Der Führer?
I thought he was waiting to take possession.
All in good time.
When I am finished with it.
"Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?"
It's a transmitter.
It's a radio for speaking to God.
And it's within my reach.
You want to talk to God?
Let's go see him together.
I've got nothing better to do!
Doctor Indy!
Come back home now!
"Next time, Indiana Jones, it will take more than children to save you."
I thought I would find you there.
"Better than the United States Marines, eh?"
Marion is dead.
"Yes, I know."
I am sorry.
"Life goes on, Indy."
There is the proof.
I have much to tell you.
"First we will take them home, and then I will take you to the old man."
I can't figure out how Belloq did it.
"Sorry to call late, cock."
I was up.
I just needed to hear a friendly voice.
It's been one prick of a day.
Yeah?
"First, Lorton."
And then-
"One of the many things Scarlet hates about me is my inability to lose my temper, so I won't even try now."
"But let's have nothing more to do with each other, OK?"
"Barn, what the hell are you- Ask Scarlet about John Bartrop."
"You were joking about him, remember?"
In the alley where Ben Rigby was killed.
What'd you call him?
A puff of wind in a mohair cardigan?
"You know, even when you're destroying lives, somehow it still comes out as a bloody joke."

That's two.
They're getting harder now.
"All right, then i'll tell you."
Mr. Fisk is backing a show.
Miss mansfield is an actress.
That's all there is to it.
"I've known miss mansfield as long as he has, and i've never known a finer woman."
"No, malicious gossip isn't news."
"I don't think your papers want to print it, boys."
"Thanks, mr."
Boyd.
That's good enough for us.
Yeah.
Thanks.
No offense.
"Good night, miss mansfield."
Good night.
"Thank you, nick."
"That's all right, josie."
What else could i do?
Did you really mean what you told them about me?
No.
I was thinking of jim.
"Ever since i've known you, nick, you've been fighting me because of jim."
"You knew how he felt, and you didn't want to hurt him... so you tried to hurt me."
And you succeeded for a while... till i discovered the reason.
What is the reason?
You're in love with me.
I'm in love with you?
"Why... what do your guests think about all this, mr."
Taylor?
I haven't got any guests except mr.
Drew and colonel fisk and his soldiers.
I don't care what they call the place.
It will.
So I suggest you keep the Vorpal sword on hand when the Frabjous Day arrives.
You seem so real.
Sometimes I forget that this is all a dream.

Will you stop doing that?

I've always admired that hat.
"Hello, Chess."
"Since you won't be needing it anymore, would you consider bequeathing it to me?"
How dare you?
It is a formal execution.
"I would like to look my best, you know."
It is a pity about all this.
I was looking forward to seeing you Futterwacken.
"I was rather good at it, was I not?"
I really do love that hat.
I would wear it to all the finest occasions.
"I love a morning execution, don't you?"
"-Yes, Your Majesty."
"-Yes, Your Majesty."
-I'd like to keep it on.
-Suit yourself.
As long as I can get at your neck.
I'm right behind you.
Off with his head!
I can't watch.
(EXECUTIONER SHOUTING)
"Good morning, everyone."
"Chess, you dog."
-(GASPS)
"You know, it's how people are supposed to feel when they fall in love."
"Of course, I never have."
I wish I could be so sure of what I wanted to do.
You must have some idea.
No.
"No, I've thought of everything, but nothing seems to fit me."
Maybe I'll be unique and retire at the age of 18.
"Norman, it's about time you got home."
"Hello, Ms. Page."
"- Goodbye, Norman."
"- Wait just a minute, will you?"
- But you...
- I don't want to go in just yet.
"Norman, what an awful thing, hating to go home."
Come on in here.
"Well, thanks for walking with me."
"I enjoyed it, really."
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
"- May I walk on it, Nellie?"
"- Sure, it's dry by now."
- Your mother wants you to call her.
- I really don't feel like it.
You two have a fight again?
"Same fight, different round."
- Nellie?
- Yeah.
You've been both a daughter and a mother.
Which one is worse?
- Being a mother.
- Why?
You find yourself doing the same things you hated your own mother and father doing.
"It's because our half brother is here, isn't it?"
He's helping you.
"Oh, it took you a while, but I'm..."
I'm just...
"I'm so proud of you, Duvie."
Just let it in.
"You know, you... you can say it now."

Is that so hard?
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to yourself?
I wasn't talking to you.
That's the problem.
You're not talking to the right person.
"You know, it's been a long time..."
Since I could do this.
I've never been able to do that.
"Look, I got it, all right?"
I got it.
You want me to talk to my son.
He'll accept who you are.
You saw it.
- He's almost there.
- That's the problem.
"If he accepts who I am, he'll want nothing to do with me."
"If there's any problems with that, let us know."
I'd like to interview each of you individually.
Who wants to go first?
Corky.
Corky.
"Santana, how was the bus ride home?"
Sunshine felt good.
"This is my brother, ese."

He had a lightweight jones going and got popped.
He's coming up to Folsom.
I want him in with us.
Can he take care of himself?

I knew they weren't gonna come.
Maybe they got lost.
Maybe they got lost and they lost my phone number.
It was just a big joke on me.
I'm such an idiot.
No one wants to be friends with me.
I am sure there's some explanation.
"Get real, Grandma."
I'm pregnant and I'm new at the school and no one wants anything to do with me.
And I knew it was going to be that way going into this.
"Honey, don't say that."
"And, of course, I blew it with Ethan because I was the ""b"" word to him."
Bitch.
"Yes, I'm just surprised you said ""'b' word."""
"You have a tendency to use foul language, which I'm not completely opposed to when it's called for."
Why don't you call him?
"Oh, I can't."
I'll call him.
"No, it's stupid for me to have a boyfriend."
It's bad timing.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
I already called him.
Stay off the bed.
"Or the one she's on, anyway."
"So, mind if I come in?"
I guess not.
I told you those two weren't nice.
Madam you go to bathroom.
No...
"Madam you go to bathroom, go... go..."

Are you Laxmi Narayan?
Yeah.
Are you father of Sonu?
Yeah... you came so early son?
You were in Singapore?
Yeah my work has finished early so i thought...
"Papa doesn't know about bra, pantee and design so you came to tell me."
I am selling undergarment since you were not even wearing it.
"And now you will explain me, now get out."
Out?
Why?
One second...
where are you going?
"Bathroom dad, why you are going?"
To get light... no... now i wont let you get light anymore.
See how thin you have become.
"Do eat or not, now i wont let you go thin never..."
"Dad, please get a side or it will come out."
If went inside mine will be out.
I said no...
Dad what is she doing here?
"Son, she is... you know my nature right?"
Now i know
now why hide from Son.
Your dad with me in this room... was finagling the deal.
What kind of deal?
Should i tell Laxmi Narayan Jee?
"I will tell me he is my son, we talk regularly."
My wife says I'm supposed to trust someone.
What's it say about me that you're the one I trust?
♪ [both breathing heavily]
You seem different.
"Yeah, how so?"
You're just present. [chuckles]
I didn't realize I was being so absent.
What did you wanna tell me this morning?
Something was on your mind?
I wanna quit my job.
- What?
- [exhales]
I started a clinic outside the wall.
- Laura...
- I just can't take it anymore.
"The tongue extensions, the belly button removals."
I have a medical degree and I've never practiced real medicine

- You're worried.
- Yeah.
I get it.
It's reckless and it's dangerous.
"I know, but, Ben, I saved somebody's life today."
I got to be a real doctor.
We're trying to start a family.
I know.
You want me to stop?
No.
If this is what you need to do.
You're facing down your biggest fear and telling it to go to hell.
I think it's brave.
I don't get to make these decisions.
"But, sir..."
I'm just a government employee.
Which government?
United States.
"Are you all right, ma'am?"
We heard there were six different people claiming the presidency.
There were.
"In fact, there are still a couple of holdouts--"
"Texas, a bloc in the East."
"The new federal government's been restored in Cheyenne, Wyoming."
"Colonel, this is an emergency."
You have to go to Jericho.
The fighting could be happening right now.
"I am very sorry, ma'am."
"Casper, you see she gets back to the medical unit."
"Come on, ma'am."
Get 'em out.
Why?
Get 'em out.
Clear everyone out.

This place is where you survive.
"You make a stand here, you hear?"
We will.
I'm sorry you have to see this.
You been through enough.
"Dad, Dad, stop."
"You're stronger than you think you are, though."
Always have been.
"I love you, son."
"I guess I zigged when I should've zagged out there, huh?"
"Stupid, bloody engine, eh?"

I gotta get home or I'll be late.
How about a kiss?
Not thank you.
I could be back in action tomorrow... ?

Catrin?
I got caught in the raid.
Ended up in the big street shelter.
I didn't know where you were.
I didn't know if you were safe.
I never know if you're safe.
Oh God!
Look at you.
I'll be alright after a cuppa tea.
They've already ruptured the mains.
"Look, Catrin..."
I want you to go back to Ebbw Vale.

It's the biggest steelworks in Europe.
"They are more likely to get bombed there, than here..."
It's just not the bombing.
I can't afford for us to live here anymore.
"I can't afford for us to live, anywhere."

I could keep painting.
You don't have to keep me.

-Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
-l'm stirring it.
"-Listen, you know what to do?"
"-Yeah, yeah."
"Don't ""yeah, yeah"" me, Lois!"
This is important.
Make sure you leave the house when you make the call.
Understand me?
Call from an outside line.
I mean it!
"Jesus, you must think I'm dumb."
I know what to do.
"Hey, you little hick, just make sure you do it!"
You're such a pain.
-Hey!
Just do it!
-Okay.
Un-fucking-believable.
All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.
-What'd he say?
-Nothing.
So what does she do after she hangs up with me?
After everything I told her?
"After all her ""yeah, yeah"" bullshit?"
She calls from the house.
If anyone was listening they'd know everything.
They'd know a package was leaving my house and they'd have the flight number.
"As soon as I got home, I started cooking."
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.
I told my brother to watch on the stove.
All day long the poor guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce.
Damien looks after me too.
"Right, I'm going to need copies of all the photos."
No way.
But I will promise not to use any that compromise your team.
I think you misunderstood me.
All photos now.
You do not publish until this is over.
You make no mention of my unit or personnel.
Or what?
You're going to kill me?
CRAWFORD:
I can't see her.
"Christ, there's a lot of them."

You got that cuddly little ferret from a cooking pot.
"- Yeah, he peed in my shoes."
- That was...
That was me.
- That's funny.
"- So what, are you still mad at Artie?"
"No, I'm not."
- I'm not mad at Artie.
I'm mad at you.
"- No, you're not mad at me."
"- Yes, I am."
- You're not mad at me.
"Because when you're mad at me, your neck gets all long until it looks like that."
It's like a giraffe over here.
"And when you're mad at Artie, your neck gets down over here to the right."
Just like that.
"Look, I know the MacPherson-DC thing is still bugging you, okay?"
But everybody has a past.
"But he lied, Pete."
"Artie's past is treasonous, hazardous, there's a crazy man who wants us dead and he wants the Warehouse for himself."
Would have been nice knowing that going in.
Artie should have told us about MacPherson.
"Yes, yes, I get it."

Please don't disappoint me!
"Amida Buddha, please turn back."
"No, I'll never go back."

In which hole did you fall?
It was a woman who was being courted by a gangster!
I spent the night with her.
I don't know where she is.
I came here.
Have you seen the Eiffel Tower?
I lost my luggage!
"My mom's picture, my father's last letter, his tie, handkerchiefs too!"
I don't know where!
"""I loved her""."
That's not the truth.
She touched me... moved me...
You remind me of your father.
"He was handsome, your father."
"You always fall for beauty, especially when it doesn't buckle."
What use are your truths?
Does they wash whiter?
My shirt.
It was the journey.
The night.
The rain... the rain...
"Do you get a kick out of it, or is it just stupidity?"
I kick stupidity?

"And when your mother came to Paris for the last time,"
I knew I'd never see her again.
I tried to talk myself into believing she was happy.
"Fine, okay."
"Sia, you won't believe it."
There was a call from the local police station.
Vikram Kapoor called the police to confess that he killed Maya.
What?
!
Just 70 rupees.
The latest from Bollywood.
August 22nd.
- He is dead.
Vikram didn't confess voluntarily.
He was forced to.
How does Neil figure in this?
"Sunil, who is the only one to have skipped surveillance?"
"Yes, sir."
"Where are you, Sia?"
"Mumbai, sir."
Vikram Kapoor is dead.
He was found in his house with slashed wrists... but his body has severe signs of violence.
"Sir, Neil Menon is on a killing spree."
Eliminating all the witnesses from that weekend.
Did I not give you a direct order to drop that case?
And to drop Neil Menon.
"Sir, if you could just listen to me."
"No, you listen to me."
I want you off that case.
Right now.
I will see you in my office tomorrow.
Sir...
"Sir, if someone in our department... is protecting Neil Menon..."
"That will be enough, Ms. Agnihotri."
What?
I won't say a word.
"It won't be easy, but I promise."
Oh.
"Oh, I'd love to."
"Yes, I'll do some shopping, and then I'll meet you for lunch."
Okay.
Bye.
"- Who was it, honey?"
- Louise.
- What are you so happy about?
- She wants me to meet her for lunch.
"- Oh, boy."
Some life I've given you.
- What do you mean?
"A little thing like going out to lunch, and you're ecstatic."
I'm easy to please.
"I'll just go change, and then I'll drive you to the office."
"Honey, I'm a little late."
Only take a minute.
Darrin.
"Larry, I want to speak to you about the Waterhouse account."
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
"Well, I'm talking to you about it first."
Remember the Hoffsteddler-Douglas account?
"- Yes, but..."
- Before I took over Hoffsteddler hadn't spoken to Douglas in 30 years.
"- You did a fine job there, Darrin."
"- Yes, I did."
And let's not overlook the Michael Sales Company account.
"Before I took charge, they couldn't give away ice water in the middle of the Mojave Desert."
- A memorable job.
"Yes, it was."
Yeah?
What'd you learn in class today?
I don't know...
the usual.
Yeah?
You weren't learning how to cut class
With your little faggoty little friends?
Enrique!
"It ain't like I never cut class before,"
But don't lie to me.
Enrique!
"You can't follow me around, Papi."
Sit down.
I don't go following you around.
"What's up with your hands, man?"
Put your hands down and talk to me like a man.
I didn't raise you to be like that.
You didn't raise me!

Emily.
"No, it's me."
Spencer.
"It's really very nice of you, but I'm here now."
I'm going with Spencer.
I see.
"Hanna, the man's ID checked out."
It checked out because there was a James Leland related to Mrs. Potter but this isn't him.
This is somebody else.
"If I tell the state people some story about the man being an imposter it'll just draw attention, which we do not want."
"Well, we have to do something."
I'm not doing anything based on what Caleb says.
Leland's coming to the bank.
I will show him the safe deposit box.
And we will go from there.
"- All right, well, call me when he leaves."
- I will.
Hey.
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
"Uh, change of plans."
Good.
I'll take you and Mike out for dinner later.
Okay?
"Hey, Dad?"
How were the parent-teacher meetings?
"Oh, they were fine."
"You know, I really like that one teacher, your French teacher."
"- Well, how do you like Mr. Fitz?"
- He was okay.
Okay?
"All right, listen, I'm gonna tell you the truth."
I dunno.
A bag bag.
Was it a suitcase or an overnight bag?
"Yeah, that's it."
An overnight bag.
"He goes out for a jog, like you said, and then... ..he comes back out with a bag."
What was I supposed to do?
Did anything happen to spook him?
Did he see you?
Of course not.
What?
"If we mess this up, they will find you dead of an overdose and I'll be back in prison waiting for someone to stab me in the showers"
"Better hope he hasn't gone far, Calum."
Iain?
What do you mean a runner?
Just took off all of a sudden.
Find him for me.
And then what?

"""I want him dealt with, John."
"And this time no guns."""

"So again last night, the wife got a call around 10:30."
It's the husband calling to say good night.

"Hey, kid, what happened?"
I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore.
"Yeah, well, my Dad blew a gasket when I told him, and then he beat my Mom."
"Dude, what did I tell you?"
You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!
"Mr. Garret, Mr. Garret!"
This kid wants to join the basketball team.
He's really good.
Really?
"Look, I should be getting to class."
"Hey, we sure could use you, kid."
I can never find enough kids that wanna play ball.
All the kids and the school funding goes to the theater department.
You see?
They need you.
"This is fate, kid-- fate."
I don't know.
"Look, just come in at recess and shoot some balls with the team."
"Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some balls with the team, Goddamn it."
Okay.
"Hey, that's great, Bridon!"
"Yeah, it's like a clever little twist."
"The motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars try to avoid."
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.
"Figure that all out on your own, did you?"
"Cone number one, if you want."
Oh...
"Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there?"
Oh...

Yeah.

"Looked just like a Jaguar, only she was a truck!"
"You know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her."
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
"Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watching' you!"
"No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here."
"Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt."
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
"Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater."
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.
I can handle anything.
- I'm not doin' this.
- Come on.
Everything you know about Latif.
Or I'll put a fucking bullet in your head right now.
Latif has a spy at the top of British intelligence.
Neutralise him and you'll stop the atrocity Latif has planned.
He can't finalise the arrangements without him.
- Who is he?
I need a name.
- When my daughter is safe.
Last chance.
"Oh, you need Clare safe as much as I do."
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
People die.
I'm fine with that.
- You fucking prick.
- Shoot then.
Fuck.

I'm Eleanor Grant.
Can I get you a drink?
"No, but can you can turn off the recording device in your pocket."
This conversation is off the record.
We never met.
Do you understand?
Damien said you were a ball breaker.
"Well, Damien Scott talks too much and to people he shouldn't."
He knows he can trust me.
I protect my sources.
That's why I'm here talking to you.
- I want to protect him.
- Why were you not arrested also?
"Nobody knew I was there, just taking photos."
He lectures alcoholics on television.

"And garage keys, too."
Can we stop over and get those keys?
--My new bumper is there...

--Brains.
--A bumper!
"--One ball-point pen, please --Can you read, sir?"
It says we're on break from 14:00 to 15:00
It's 15:00 now

And what?
How can one live this way?
What for?
"But then again, I do look good in purple."
Are you sure?
No cites for a loose load on the Golden State?
Of course.
Baker and Poncherello.
They came in this morning.
They didn't respond to the dispatches because they're not on their bikes.
They're at Poncherello's.
Does anybody have Poncherello's phone number?
Yeah.
I shouldn't have let them go home.
I shouldn't have...
I'm too nice a guy.
That's it.
I'm just too nice a guy.
You go to the drive-in very often?
I don't have to.
I can watch it from right here.
Saves me a fortune.
How do you know what's going on?
You can't hear it.
"Well, during the winter, you kind of have to figure it out, read lips."
"But during the summer, all the car windows are open."
It's like stereo.
"Hey, how do I get my nickel back out of here?"
Mr. Nice Guy.
I'm gonna have my name legally changed to Mr. Nice Guy.
"Boy, never again."
Never again.
"- Hey, sarge..."
"- Later, Park, later, later."
"This is your noon news update, Larry McCormick reporting."
- You gotta go ?
See yourself home.
- Fuck you !
"- Bitch, I'm gonna--"
- What the hell is your problem ?
You gonna take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine ?
"- 'Cause you wrong, Malakai."
"- No, you're wrong."
You been wrong.
You ain't even worth shit no more.
"Get outta my face, college boy, and take that trailer trash ho with you."
"Honey, his blue pajamas are at the bottom of the bag."
"If it's as cold as it was today, put those on him."
"Hey, whatcha all doing with my nephew here ?"
Come on now.
There we go.
It's okay. lt's okay.
- What's wrong with him ?
"- He don't know you, Kenny."
"I'm his father, he knows me."
What should I do ?
- Come around more often.
"- See, I can't talk to you."
And I can't depend on you.
- Shh.
- [ Baby Crying ]
"What do you think I use to raise this baby, oxygen ?"
"He has needs, Kenny, and his needs require money."
- Here we go.
- And we're gonna keep going... until I get what I need from you to raise your son.
I'm doing the best that Ican.
But do you think your mouth helps the situation ?
I hoped to find him recovered and so I'd explain to him everything.
But when he came back...
I won't say he was worse.
It's not that.
But he was a total helpless person.
I don't know what would he told you.
He told me the same.
I couldn't leave him in that spot.
It was a terribly unfair situation for me.
I thought that with me by his side I could help him.
How is Luisa?
Who told you about Luisa?
I heard from mom.
"Well, from Berta."
She was talking to her.
"What a lousy, filthy bad omen bird she is!"
What's omen?
"It's a sign, a premonition..."
I sense your eyes like dark violets...
Who wrote that?
Mine.
-It's beautiful.
And why wouldn't it be?
Are you gonna write more poetry?
I don't know.
What did Berta say about Luisa?
"That she's a whore, more or less."
But why do you care?
And what did your mother say?
Nothing.
"She said she knew you were dating some girl already, but she didn't know her."
And Berta said she was very tall and young.
You're a guy.
"Well, you used to be."
"So, what do you think?"
I've still got it.
-Why did you get me this?
-What is it?
"It's yelling, bleeding, dilating."
"Oh, the dilating!"
Is this the video of the birth?
It's Phoebe's.
Why were you watching it?
I thought maybe you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
If you thought I was gonna get you porn for Valentine's Day..
you were right.
It's about a girl who moves to the city in search of stardom..
but ends up having sex with a lot of guys.
It got four stars.
Wait a minute.
Those aren't stars.
"-Anyway, you wanna take a look?"
-Well..
-I'm not really in a sexy mood.
"-Hey, what's going on?"
Remember the first time you saw Jaws..
how long it took to go back in the water?
We can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day.
You gotta get past it.
Just get back on the horse.
"Otherwise, the horse is gonna go into the bedroom and change into her sweatpants."
"-Okay, you don't know."
You didn't see it.
-Childbirth is beautiful.
They're so much better than regular bars because worse is better.
"I know, right?"
"They're my favorite, too."
I'm quirky like that.
I've got quirky taste.
I'm a quirky girl.
It seems like we would be perfect for each other.
But really we're terrible for everyone.
ANNE MURRAY:
♪ And though I...
What the hell?
Are you listening to Anne Murray?
"Uh, I am experiencing Anne Murray."
Why?
That music is complete crap.
"Um, excuse me?"
"It's all just vapid, overproduced tripe."
It has no edge whatsoever.
"Yeah, neither does a soft summer breeze, or a letter from an old friend."
I'm pretty sure envelopes have edges.
"Fine, an e-mail."
Dick.
Whatever.
You know what?
I don't care.
"I think Anne Murray sucks, and that's my opinion."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, I'm going to make a believer out of you, Brian."
I am going to show you the true meaning of Anne Murray.
"Don't waste your time, I'm not going to change my mind."
"I don't know, Bri, I can make things happen when I want to."
Just ask my twin brother.
"Maybe I should've listened to you, Seth, and done it the way you said."
"Come on, don't talk like that."
- We're gonna get you help.
- Seth.
"Seth, I can save him."
- No.
- He was right.
This world  ain't the same no more.
[laughs weakly]
I don't even know what that was.
Hey... hey.
I thought I could handle anything you two punks throw at me.
But I ca...
I can't dance on this dance floor no more.
"You were right, Seth."
Time for me to hang up my wingtips.
[sobbing] No.
"You two knuckleheads, you gotta promise me..."
You gotta take care of each other.
[exhales softly]
To Eddie Cruickshank.
Uncle Eddie.
Rest in peace.

"- Richard, say something."
- What do you want me to say?
I don't know.
"Something, anything."
He never got his Shangri-La.
"Son of a bitch would never admit it, but we had more in common than he knew."
"You know, from the moment he took us in, all I ever cared about was making sure he didn't regret it."
"Man, did I screw that up."
"There are other influential people, why don't you go to them?"
For example...
-For example...
-No need.
"Look, doctor, you are a completely ordinary, insignificant man."
-Congratulations.
-You don't lie.
And this is exactly what we need.
"We need a background, a guide, who will help us understand matters on Earth."
I must go to work.
Pardon.
"What is ""work""?"
Work...
Work is the meaning of life.
And what is the meaning of life?
Meaning...
I will explain it to you when I get back from work.
-You mustn't snap.
"-And what is ""snap""?"
Such big gaps in knowledge...
"Snap, is like..."
It is like...
I have it!
It was those from the eighth floor.

"Good morning, Jerry."
Some things in people's homes ring continuously.
And some don't.
- How we gonna get there?
- Walk.
"Feet, did y'all hear what that man said?"
"- When my man appears, send him up with my luggage, will you?"
"- Very good, sir."
Show Mr. Wooster to his room.
"This way, sir."
Mr. Wooster just arrived.
I've given him room nine.
Good.
Keep me informed of everything he does.
I'm Mr. Wooster's man.
What room shall I take his things to?
- Mr. Wooster is in room nine.
- Thank you.
"- What's the matter, old man?"
Don't you feel well?
"- I'm very well, thank you."
- Have you got wasps in this hotel?
- Wasps?
Of course not.
- I feel certain I've been stung.
- Possibly your imagination.
"Possibly, but not probably."
- I'll carry that for you for two bits.
- Two bits of what?
That's a quarter— 25 cents American money.
"No, thank you."
I don't need your aid.
What an extraordinary language.
Two bits!
"Well, Jeeves, you were right again."
Whoever calls maysound like her... but it's not gonna be her.
I don't know what happens to us after we die... but I'll bet you wherever Mary is now... she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.
What if it is her?
"She's dead, John."
The only important question now is how do you want to remember her?
I miss her so much.
I know you do.
Of course you do.
"But, John, listen... you can miss her here just as easily as there."
"Even more easily because there, you're all alone."
And that's just no way to be.
You do whatever you need to do... and I'll understand.
"But here, we have dinner at 6:00... and we open presents at 8:00."
And we hope we see you.
Okay?
"Bye,John."
WJMP time is 5:51 on this chilly Christmas Eve.

- Some problem with the traffic lights.

I want to go home.
Mummy said we can't go till the roads dry up.
But it's been raining for three days now.
It's no use.
We're prisoners.
Prisoners of the Bastille.
Guards are everywhere.
- We'll blast our way out.

"Monsieur Chopin, it sounds so like the raindrops, it's quite magical, but I must ask you to produce a little sunshine for us instead."
"I'm about to go mad with the sound of horrid rain, day in, day out."
"Ordinarily I would just take a bromide and go to bed, but one has guests to entertain."
"Stupid, stupid rain!"
"No need to entertain us, Your Excellency."
"Rather, it is our turn to entertain you."
- I've just written a play for your theatre.
"- Oh, how gay!"
Eugene will paint the scenery.
The maids can do the costumes.
Oh.
"He's very handsome, isn't he?"
I don't know.
He looks kind of hairy and slobbery to me.
Not that one.

"It is now my honor and privilege to present our esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday present."
"Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole, you shouldn't have."

"[Grimsby] Happy birthday, Eric."

"Uh, gee, Grim..."
Ha!
[clears throat]
"It's, uh..."
It's really somethin'.
"Yes, I commissioned it myself."
"Of course, I had hoped it would be a wedding present."
"Come on, Grim."
Don't start.
You're not still sore because I didn't fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?
"Oh, my!"
"Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone."
The entire kingdom wants to see you happily settled with the right girl.
"Oh, she's out there somewhere."
I just...
I just haven't found her yet.
[Grimsby] Perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough.
"Believe me, Grim, when I find her, I'll know."
- No.
I'm sorry.
I...
I won't disappoint you.
I'm sorry.
"Please, Doctor!"
"- Your medication, Miss Porter."
"- Thank you, Gunther."
"- What book are you reading, miss?"
"- Oh, it's Edgar Allan Poe."
- Why would a lady like yourself fancy such grim materials?
"- The tales may be dark, I know what you're saying, but... through them, he asks questions of humanity in situations most extreme."
"In plumbing these depths, he... holds up a mirror to our own lives."
- You're a very thoughtful woman.
"- Thank you, Gunther."
- If you ever need anything ever you just let me know.
- Ah!
- Isabel.
"- Oh, Dr. Jacobs."
- Calm yourself.
"- Oh, thank God."
There's a man in there!
There's blood everywhere!
I...
I just...
- Dr. Lemelle.
Our surgeon.
What are you doing out of your room this time of night?
"- I heard a noise, so I came to see what..."
- Came to see what evil lurks in these halls at night?
- No.
I'm sorry.
I protect my sources.
That's why I'm here talking to you.
I want to protect him.
Why were you not arrested also?
"Nobody knew I was there, just taking photos."
Damien looks after me too.
"Right, I'm gonna need copies of all the photos."
No way.
But I will promise not to use any that compromise your team.
I think you misunderstood me.
"All photos, now."
You do not publish until this is over.
You make no mention of my unit or personnel.
(LAUGHING) Or what?
You gonna kill me?
Mmm-hmm.
(YELLING IN DISTANCE)

I can't see her.
"Christ, there's a lot of them."
We're heading out soon.
Once they've juiced themselves up for the night.

Why isn't he leaving with them?
She's in that hut.
She's in that hut with him.
"I trust you have been treated appropriately, Major Sinclair."
I thought you were gonna steer clear and let me do my job.
"Well, maybe I'm not satisfied with the job you're doing, Gibbs."
"It's not about me, and you know that."
I'm not just gonna stand by and let you grill him about something that happened 16 years ago.
"He lied to me, Leon."
"What's more important is, you let him."
That's not true.
His records were sealed.
It still matters.
"I told you, it was complicated."
More than complicated.
Why the kid gloves?
Stand down.
Michael was eight when Jackie and I met.
Both parents passed away.
Kid was struggling.
I filled a void.
I tried to steer him right.
"Leon, it's tough taking things like that on."
"Yeah, and it wasn't always easy."
"But I got him into private school,"
I got him into counseling.
"He was lost for a long time, Gibbs, and now he's finally finding his way."
The last thing he needs is people giving up on him.
- People like you.
- Yeah.
I've come a long way with him.
I'm not about to give up on him now.
Gibbs.
"Yeah, Abby, I'm on my way."
"Talk to me, Abbs."
Hi-- wow.
"-What's she got, anyway?"
"She's afflicted with a complaint, you know, a female-dog type of thing."
What's the full-court press on Santini about?
They got mail service now.
-What did you get off toxicology?
-This girl was a suicide.
"Trace amounts of narcotics in her system, not enough to stupefy anyone..."
... letaloneajunkie.
She pulled the bag over her head.
"Otherwise, we'd have found signs of struggle, resistance."
-The mutt from her apartment?
-Yeah.
-She's as much of a mess as that girl.
"-Hey, you ain't exactly Clark Gable."
"-John, what did the M.E. say?"
"-Suicide, Mike."
"-l told you I was clean, right?"
"-Yeah, you did."
"That's right, I did."
"Yeah, squeaky clean, Roberts."
LAURA:
"Yeah, thanks, I'll see you upstairs."
"Hey, congratulations on that Garcia homicide."
-Thanks.
-Yeah.
I was flat wrong about that.
-l didn't have my crystal ball.
-You were dead right.
"Yeah, well, I'm glad it worked out."
Nice job.
Thank you.
-Think that got you out of the woods?
"Yeah, wrap it up."
"-Get the fuck out the car, bitch!"
"-Motherfucker, you know who I am?"
Who the fuck is this?
You know who the fuck I'm with?
"You ain't no fucking cop, that's for sure."
-The fuck you going to do with that?
-Stick it up your mother's twat!
Goddamn it!
What?
Little piece of shit.
"The cork, it got stuck in the bottle."
Homemade crap.
That somebody cared enough about to carry all the way from the old country for you.
What a fucking week.
"I talked to Ronnie, asked her if she's even heard from Ralph."
Little fucking kid's got a respiratory infection now.
"She just heard about Pie-O-My, she's sick about it."
Hello?
We're talking about Justin here.
"Sorry, I was thinking about my mother, her skin condition."
"Oh, my God."
Did I forget to take that out?
What's wrong with you?
"Really, Ma."
Dad's right.
It's not a bad drive.
It's interstate up to Boston.
"If you don't want to accompany me,fine."
Your sister can come up from Florida.
"Come on, she's not going to do that."
Of course I'll go.
- Luise?
Want a drink?
"- Yes, of course."
"Mark, stop it."
Stop.
- What are you doing?
- I feel like playing.
I am not in the mood.
If you fuck me the others will respect you again.
- What do you mean?
- You stopped talking to Vanessa.
When she had to move to Virum.
Just like you.
And where is she now?
Leave me alone.
Fuck off back to Virum.
POWER
"Power means being able to do what I want,   when I want, the way I want."
If something goes wrong like assault or other crime   our parents have the power and money to hush it up.
Nobody would dare say anything to me or tell me off.
Or tell me what to do.
Girls and boys look up to you and want to know you.
You can choose who you want to talk to.
Being in the group I'm in...
People know you are not...
I can provide all the stuff people dream of.
All the people who do ordinary 9 to 5 jobs   dream of living my kind of life.
I need something from my jacket.

"Hi, Hanne."
- We're leaving.
No.
"You were right, let's kill him."
"Oh, no."
"""Kanima."""
I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
"Me too, but it looks like they are."
And more.
A lot more.
How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl with severely low standards?
Because I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
Hey.
What if it's Matt?
"I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?"
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
"So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad, one of Argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?"
-Yes!
-Why?
Because...
He's evil.
-You just don't like him.
-The guy bugs me.
I don't know what it is.
Just look at his face.
Any other theories?
You okay?
-I have to go to the bathroom.
-adrian:
Give him a little kick in the slats.
Yeah.

That's it.
Kind of roll your hips a little.

- No?
- No.
That's a girl who goes on adventures.
How do you figure this day we're having out here?
- An adventure.
- Yeah?
"How do I work into it, this adventure?"
I see a man of the Old West trying to live in the New.
Do you know how raggedy-ass and terrible the Old West really was?
- No.
- lf you spend any time with me... you'll find out just how raggedy-ass it was.
"You love it out here, don't you?"
"Yes, I do."
- Morning.
- Good morning.

"I know you're depressed, so I brought someone to cheer you up."
"Right outside is a real, live, furry playmate."
I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
"Hey, a dog!"
"Who, you gotta admit, looks a lot like Jane."
He's the happiest dog ever.
I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.
So you can keep him till he cheers you up.
I borrow him myself from time to time..
when I get depressed thinking about..
"world hunger, poverty.."
Not to trivialize your pain.
"Thanks so much, Pheebs."
We are gonna have so much fun!

Shut up!

Come in.
"Oh, come in, everyone."
"I've brought Constable Wilson, m'lady."
He's going to perform the ceremony.
"Oh, good."
"Well, now, you stand over here."
That's right.
"Stokes, you're going to be best man."
You stand next to the groom.
"James, you're to give the bride away."
And Ethel and her mother will be the bridesmaids.
"We're the bridesmaids, Mother."
That'll be nice.
What am I?
The congregation.
Right.
"Go and fetch the bride, she's waiting on the landing."
"As soon as you hear the wedding march, come in."
"We don't want it to be too loud, so I've put in a soft needle and stuffed a pair of bloomers down the horn."
"That's the best thing to do, that is."
"This is ridiculous, Mr Twelvetrees."
Do we 'ave to do it?
"Yes, Ivy, we do."
His lordship gave strict instructions to humour Lady Lavender at all times.
Otherwise she might not leave him her money.
"Be quiet, Mabel, and hand me the parrot."
Haven't you got anything religious to put on?
Do you really love him?
"He""s my family."
I just want my family back.
Then go home.
Go home and close your eyes.
This will all play itself out.
"But, Bobbi..."
"There""s nothing I can find out that""s gonna make you feel better."
Knowing the truth will only hurt.
And hurt and hurt some more.
"You""ll end up back where you are... which is still in love with the man you married."
Go home.
"I can""t."
"Get some rest now, Clara, okay?"
"L""ll call you first thing in the morning with my report."
"- Can""t you call me tonight?"
"- Okay, tonight after the dinner."
"Amy, you take her home."
Stay there until you hear from me.
"- No, I""ll call you."
"- No, Clara, you won""t."
"No communication with me when I""m on the job."
"No interference of any kind, or we back off the investigation entirely."
"It""s for our own protection."

"- Well, things can get complicated."
- We understand.
- Thank you.
- Go home.
- Thank you so much.

"It""s not that simple, Jesse."
I guess I'll just...
I'll see you at work.
Yeah.
Is this the right decision?
Yeah.
Beth happy about it?
Yeah...
"I dunno, we'll see."
You don't exactly look happy.
Happy?
Happy comes later.
"Right now we're on a 30-day trial basis, kinda like a vacuum cleaner."
- How about the lieutenant?
- What about her?
- Is she OK?
"- What do you want me to say, Kay?"
You want me to say that Beth and I have come to a big understanding?
We haven't.
"Maybe we will, I dunno."
All I know is I gotta try.
"Allie's front tooth is falling out, I'm the tooth fairy, no one else, OK?"
"Zack slides into second base and breaks his collarbone,"
"I take him to the ER, no one else!"
"I remember what it was like when I broke my collarbone, and my dad wasn't there to take me to the hospital."
"The kids are kids, the rest of the people involved are adults, OK?"
All right.
"Just asking you how you are, that's all."
My car should be ready tomorrow.
Thanks... for the ride.
- Annabella?
- Yes.
- Tell me about the gloves.
- Don't you say a word against Norman.
If you'd brought him up with intelligence...
He has no interest in girls.
He never had.
He never learned a thing about sex in my house.
It was never mentioned.
"- Hello, Mrs. Page."
- Come in here.
- Where's Norman?
"- Outside, just going home."
- Stay right here.
- What's the matter?
Norman!
Come in here.
"What is it, Ma?"
- Where were you today?
"- What is it, Mother?"
You were seen swimming in the nude with Norman.
- That's a lie!
- How could you even think that?
You were seen clearly by two people.
"We went swimming, but we had our suits on."
"And by now, everybody in Peyton Place knows about it."
If anything is wrong with her...
"We didn't do anything, did we, Allison?"
- No.
- You better take your boy and go.
We didn't do anything.
"I've never, never been so humiliated and disgusted!"
Allison!
Come back here immediately!
Keep this up and I'll do what you accuse me of!
Already did.
I told you to stay away from them and I meant it.
"Now, go on, get him out of here."
I don't know what to say.
There's nothing to say.
"You came to me for help, right?"
"It may not have turned out the way either of us wanted it to, but... it's how it turned out and it's all right."
I do... and besides...

Thank you.
Thank you.

"Yeah, but the wife didn't know that."
She likes BBs.
It was a really nice BB.
What kind of people would stay at a place run by a pedophile?
Plot twist... they didn't know that.

Events of major importance happened in Europe today.
"First, this morning, the representatives of Britain, France and..."
[Ursula]:
Do you think Andrea would be a soldier if he were at home?
[Janet]:
Probably.
[Radio]:
Informed by the German government that Germany regarded the Franco-Russian...
We're going to have to go into Truro to get him some clothes.
- I know.
- Who did father go to?
Can't remember.
[Radio]:
By the obligations assumed at the Carno.
"He's so young, isn't he?"
"Yes, he is."
I think we can eat.
I'll take Andrea's tray up.
Perhaps he might want to try coming downstairs.
"Oh, no."
It's far too early for that.
I hope he's gonna like it.
"They look so sad, don't they?"
Not at all.
Don't eat too quickly.
Hmm?
Doesn't matter.
"It's very filling, isn't it?"
"You don't have to eat it, Ursula."
I'm sure Andrea will eat what you can't manage.
Perhaps I'll eat later.
He might like some of my bottled pears.
"Hey, this is with a typewriter."
It's from a finance company.
So it is from the finance company.
So it's better than no letter at all.
So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.
"So they want the fourth, the fifth the sixth, the seventh."
So they want the Plymouth.
"""Sugar Lips"" Shapiro."
"Amazing, ain't it?"
I believe it.
I believe it.
- You believe what?
-My wife.
"She says, ""Darling, you won't believe it but I found the most adorable baby on our doorstep and I've decided to keep it for our very own."
"Now, you won't believe it, but it's got exactly my eyes and nose."""
"Why does she keep saying ""I don't believe it""?"
I believe it.
I believe it.
I believe it.
"This is it, gentlemen."
Don't bother to scrape your shoes.
"Okay, gang."
Meet our new guests.
This is Lieutenant Dunbar and this is Sergeant Bagradian.
A lieutenant?
Knock it off.
Knock it off.
The pleasure's all mine.
- How are things?
-What's doing on the outside?
"Yeah, what's new in the States?"
"Well, the skirts are shorter, if that's what you mean."
And Becca...
I think you've met Becca before.
"Yes, I've met Becca before."
It's good to see you.
Hi nice to meet you.
You too.
Wow...
How are you?
I'm sorry I was actually just about to take off.
"Aw well that's too bad, well listen my tour got pushed back a month or so... so I'm going to be around."
"Oh, and hey listen tomorrow night my band and I are doing a little set at the Hotel Cafe if you guys... want to come by that would be great."
"Yeah, sure."
I love your music.
Thank you.
"Ok maybe, maybe we will."
"Well, just email me the address and..."
Yeah.
Oh...
"Ah, I think the Pap's have found you and um... your girlfriend's kind of looking a little lonely."
No pictures.
"Oh, that's actually not my girlfriend it's just a girl who's my friend."
"Oh right, um hum."
"Hey, Cece this is my friend Dale."
Hi.
"- Hey, nice to meet you."
I'm just going to get my stuff.
"Ok, we will..."
Don't forget to email me.
Don't forget to come.
So you guys all went to Catholic boarding school together?
OK I can't imagine that.
We've known each other since we were fifteen.
"I heard a noise, just checking..."
"It's getting colder, wear an undershirt."
There are no cleaning materials left...
Dad?
Tie up yourhair.
Take care of yoursister.
"No, I still have things to take care of here."
"Kezban, enough!"
"Watch out, this could be the end of us."
"Don't worry, Dad."
This is yourfinal year anyway.
"Just finish school, do your military service, and come back home."
"Business is bad, I need help."
There is a teaching position in college here.
See?
He is lusting aftersinful gains.
"Don't keep us waiting, son."
Business is really bad.
"You don't say, dad."
Do you want me to go bankrupt?
"I can't breath without you, son."
I could've driven you.
No need.
You take care of yourhomework.
May God protect you from the evil eye.
"Finally, the nightmare is over."
They wouldn't even leave your corpse behind in Istanbul...
Damn.
My hands stink of bleach.
C'mon I'll drop you off at school.
And where you off to?
"- Misty, moisty, morning, full of birds..."
It's not what you think.
"Amira, you are planning an attack at school."
Please!
"Please, Drew."
Let me at least try to explain.
After we broke up...
I was lonely.
"I went online, started talking to this guy from back home."
"A friend, but he didn't like this country."
I started saying that stuff because I thought that was what he wanted to hear - just to keep talking to someone.
But it wasn't real.
"Not for me, Drew."
Never for me.
None of it?
No.
"Please, Drew, you know me."
And you told all of this to Mr. Harris?
Yes.
"And I showed him all the texts from Kasym,"
Where I am telling never to contact me again.
What he was talking about was crazy.
So what is Mr. Harris going to do?
"He say he'll tell the principal that he believes me, then we see what happens from there."
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I know you only did this because you care for me.
And it's made me realize that I feel the same way.
Can we talk later?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey.
"I told him I was texting with someone from Chechnya,"
Taking advantage of me.
Safer to go down on the stairs!
Where're you off to?
To catch the burglar.
You look in the safe.
Don't run!
You think only you know Chinese Kung Fu?
Bet you're out of breath after the chase.
Do you know who I am?
Don't bother asking. I'll tell you.
"When I was a kid, they called me Super Kid Robin!"
Now they call me Super Sleuth Robin!
Also known as Super Shot Robin!
"You quite finished, Super Silly Sop?"
Are you ready to shoot?
You want to see me shoot?
Don't blink!
You've set 2 records in my books:
the slowest draw.
And the shortest time I've disarmed anybody.
You've got a surprise coming!
Freeze!
You got anything else to say?
- Sure!
- Go right ahead!
You haven't buttoned your pants.
You made a fool of me!
Confidential?
You want to screw my head off?
Ain't got much use anyway!
Couldn't even fix a woman.
Just wonder how you become an inspector.
Only financially.
"Well, finance is the basis of most relationships, don't you think?"
"Don't play this with me, Mr. Sabourin."
I'm a tigress.
I'll bite you.
I accept your offer.
"26th floor, miss."
Yes?
I'd like to see Mr. Sabourin.
Do you have an appointment?
"No, but he'll see me."
Just give him this.
"What is your name, please?"
Just say Kelly.
"Will you wait right here, please, Miss Kelly."
Our plan is to buy companies that are in financial trouble and then build them up.
Now here's a company in Canada that I'm particularly interested in.
Wilson Oil?
I know that stock.
Sells at a dollar.
It hasn't been very active lately.
"Well, I want you to get me the background on it and then go into the legal aspect of the situation here with Herb."
Alright.
Where is she?
In the reception room.
"Alright, show her in."
"You must forgive me, I have a private meeting."
"You may go in now, Miss Kelly."
Hello.
"Mrs. Ryan, I'd like you to meet Miss Kelly."
"Miss Kelly, Mrs. Ryan."
How'd you do?
170 pesetas.
That's his final offer.
Anyone who doesn't want to work can stay home.
We've too many people already.
"If you want to sign up, get in line."
Sir!
Hey!
Excuse me.
Juan Robles.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
Alfonso Corrales.
I'm with the police.
I'm here about the murders.
If I can be of any help...
Let me know if you need anything.
- See you around.
- Thank you.
Yes.
"Yes, don't worry."
Of course.
"Good night, Manuel, and thanks."
"The field boss says there's no Dyane 6 on the Corrales property, neither registered or unregistered."
And Marina's mother says her daughter is at a movie.
I'll call Mr. Corrales tomorrow and have him come in for a blood test.
- It's late for today.
- It's 11 o'clock.
I don't think it's late.
I'll call him tomorrow morning.
I don't think there will be any problem.
Right now I'm going to have them check on the girl.
I'm not asking you to call him on the telephone.
I'm asking you to authorize a blood test.
And photo session is going on...
Model or their skeleton!
Look like they got sick by wearing out undergarments.
Who will buy our undergarments?
We'll have to wear them all.
"Underwear is okay, but who's going to wear the bra?"
Your father.
Dad please don't use your words.
What is happening?
"Uncle Shakespeare said, What is in the name?"
But he forgot...
What if three people share the same name?
Laxminarayan One.
Laxminarayan Two.
Laxminarayan Three.
Diamond is worth 20 crores and route is by road.
Go easily and come back with the diamond.
"Here, 2 bucks."
You'll get the diamond when you'll give him this half bill.
This diamond will bring that diamond from Pondi.
"Stop, I know you have the diamond."
We are dangerous people.
He's running.
Scoundrel.
Don't touch me.
Say Chandu loves Chandni.
"Sound so sweet, Keep saying it."
You think I'm mad!
I mean let me show it also.
I didn't even touch.
I did nothing.
"Chandu, There's someone at the window."
"Hendricks is in hospital, Andre and the others are dead, so let's not fuck up anymore."
- And who are you?
- I'm Mr Crawford's CEO.
The code word for this is Scylla and Charybdis.
"Now move it, soldier, we have a package to collect."
"Go, guys."
"Crawford, wake up."
Look.
Government troops.
Army checkpoint.
"Well, that's good, isn't it?"
"I'll name drop Matak, we'll get an escort back to Khartoum."
- What?
- I don't know.
- What are they doing out here?
- Patrolling?
Who cares?
Maybe Matak has them looking for us.
Christ knows I've paid him enough.
"Matak set you up before, remember?"
And your men tried to kill him at the exchange.
Maybe he just wants to return the favour?
"I say we find a different route, just to be safe."
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
- What's he saying?
- Janjaweed.
Two jeeps.
Coming fast.
We press on.
We hit that checkpoint.
"If the soldiers are friendly, we'll have more firepower against the Janjaweed."
"Crawford, you drive, take it slow, but get ready to gun it on my command."
I don't know.
Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.
"When a defendant has no lawyer, the court will assign one to him."
Hey!
Anyone want to be his lawyer?
"Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!"
All rise!
The Honorable Doc Hudson presiding.
Show-off.
May Doc have mercy on your soul.
"All right,"
"I wanna know who's responsible for wrecking' my town, Sheriff."
I want his hood on a platter!
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
"No, check that."
"I'm gonna put him in jail till the jail rots on top of him, and then I'm gonna move him to a new jail and let that jail rot."
I'm...
"Throw him out of here, Sheriff."
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!
"Boy, I'm purty good at this lawyering' stuff."
"Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!"
Holy Porsche!
She's gotta be from my attorney's office.
"Hey, thanks for comin', but we're all set."
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?
"Yeah, your job's pretty easy today."
All you have to do now is stand there and let me look at you.
- Mmm-hmm.
Randy?
"Psychologically, we need to connect with somebody."
- Could be.
Jill.
Because we're culturally preconditioned?
"Good answers, but too intellectual for me."
"I think it's because, as some of you already may know, while it does last, it feels fucking great."
That's why.
Thank you.
Thank you.
"I'm halfway through my meal, and you haven't even started yet."
The perfect bite.
Mmm.
You need a therapist.
"Rose, do we have to have the television on?"
Can't we have a civilized conversation?
I know I'm not as intellectually stimulating as some of you university people...
"Okay, I'm sorry."
"How was your day, Mother?"
- Who gives a shit?
- I said I was sorry.
Let's talk.
I've lived too long.
"I should be dead, not having conversations."
"You stop it, please."
Give me that!
Talk to me already!
All right.
You haven't even noticed I had my hair done differently.
"Yeah, I thought you looked different."
It looks great.
I'm suffocating here.
"- Bart, you listen!"
"- Oh, go eat some flowers!"
[ Screams ] My secret shame.
"Smithers, my plan worked perfectly."
Bart Simpson will live here as my son... and I will mold him in my own graven image.
Who knows?
I may even grow to...
love him.
Bartholomew!
Ugh!
"Smithers, get it off me!"
"- Bart, you're coming home."
- I want to stay here with Mr. Burns.
I suggest you leave immediately.
Or what?
"You'll release the dogs or the bees... or dogs with bees in their mouth, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you?"
"Well, go ahead."
Do your worst.
[ Lock Slides Shut ]
He locked the door!
I'll show him!
[ Rings ]
I'm very concerned.
"Mr. Burns has stolen our son, and he won't give him back."
"Oh, for gosh-"
- Can't you people solve these problems yourselves?
"I mean, we can't be ""policing"" the whole city."
"""[ Speakers.:"
Muzak ]
Damn clogs.
You good folks can rest easy because you've come to the very best in legal representation.
"Well, then..."
This ought to be fun.
Pff.
Fun.
"Yeah, right."
I find myself agreeing with boss.
This looks to be a very entertaining evening.
"You know what, I just figured out what your costume is."
You came as a kiss-up!
"All right, all right."
"Buckle up, everybody."
"The quicker I scare the wits out of you lot, the sooner I can be home, cozy in my bed."
Unless anyone else thinks they've got what it takes.
Oh!
Oh!
"Pick me, pick me!"
I have a scary story!
"This isn't the one about you getting trapped in the petting zoo again, is it?"
- 'Cause that's not scary.
- Actually...
If you look at it from my perspective...
"Hey, guess what, Pinocchio, no one cares!"
"Get ready to send these jokers home, Shrek, 'cause I've got a doozy... and it's all true!"
It was a dark and stormy night...
Gingy?
My girlfriend kicked me out.
"I don't know, something about me being too into myself."
"Blah, blah, blah, yack, yack, yack."
You?
But you are so adorable.
I know!
That's what I keep telling her!
"Maybe she was a good teacher when she was younger,"
"But now that she's older, she just doesn't care anymore."
Yeah.
"I'm a lot younger than her,"
And I don't really care anymore.
"She's jaded and burned-out, and the last thing"
"She should be doing is teaching kids that young,"
But does the school system care
That she is creating a hostile learning environment?
"No, because the school system is broken, mike!"
It's broken.
You're right.
Somebody should do something.
They should.
Where you going?
Bed.
But we're in the middle of a conversation.
Really?
I was at the end.
Night.
"Well, maybe mike could turn it off,"
"But I was too worked up to sleep,"
So I called my sister...
"I mean, when a kid as smart as Brick gets a d-minus,"
Something's wrong.
I called my mom...
"When a kid as smart as Brick gets a d-minus,"
Something's wrong.
"And at 3:00 in the morning, I'd had enough talk."
Hey.
What are you doing up so early?
I never came to bed.
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
Now I'm feeling good.
"It's nerve-racking being here now though, and actually seeing, Iike where you're actually playing."
"Like, I sat here the other week watching Kanye West play."
And now we're here.
I just feel a bit nervous.
"AII right, fellas, Iet's start."
So first day of rehearsals.
They've done the same choreography the Iast two years.
Now I'm changing it.
"Heads, will!"
should we start?
"Louis, you're on that X."
was never really a fan of boy bands before One Direction.
I'm a massive boy band fan myself.
"Backstreet Boys, NSYNC."
"When people say, ""You're in a boy band""  I'm like, ""Yeah, I am, but I'm in a cool boy band."""
"So I'm like, ""Okay, whatevs."""
Right from the start we were always very v ocal  that we couldn't follow the boy band stereotypes.
"Choreographed dance routines, and everything's the same."
Here we go!
"Go, NiaII!"
Taking the crowd with you!
Love the stag.
Keep the stag.
"really good, Iike that."
Keep that in.
"paul, our choreographer gets bored, I think."
"NiaII, up that ramp."
"Harry, come on!"
It's a free-for-aII.
- I'm Justin.
- Ding dong.
- Felix's brother.
- Hi.
Sorry about the mud.
"- Hi, I'm Gemma."
- Nice to meet you.
I'm Chris.
"All right, mate."
"Right, um..."
"To explain, there's been a bit of a cock-up."
"Uh, Felix was due back yesterday, but he ended up getting stuck abroad."
"- In Chile, of all places."
- Chile?
"Y-Yes, I know, it's bizarre."
"Uh, he's been volunteering on a hospital project, having a fantastic time, by all accounts"
"The birthday bash was meant to be a surprise, and... well, then, his flight got cancelled."
"I've been ringing around putting people off, but I haven't done a very good job of it evidently."
"So, there's no party?"
I'm really sorry.
"But look, there-there's plenty to drink, plenty to eat, um, places to crash."
"Youre more than welcome to hang out here tonight, in fact I hope that you will."
I know that Felix would approve.
"Come on, uh, let's do this."
"Uh, Luke, it is, uh, Luke, right?"
"Yeah, that's right."
Grand.
"Grab six glasses, my friend."
I'm cracking open the bubbly.
"Let's have a party, then."
- He is horny.
- He's okay.
There are certain moments that define your entire life.
Moments when a shock goes through your body.
"And although you don't understand it yet, you know... from this point forward, nothing will ever be the same again."
News flash:
It ain't real.
"On the outside you might be Soccer Mom of the Year, but on the inside... it's all you can do to hold it together."
Keep up the image.
"All across America, families are hiding behind the same mask... of baseball practice, Girl Scout cookies, Harry Potter sequels... and $15 Yu-Gi-Oh!"
Cards.
"Truth is, we're all living in fear and hiding behind our SUVs."
"One of these days, the other shoe's gonna drop, honey."
It's going to drop.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Here we go.
"We""re all set."
"- Do you have a pen, please?"
"- Yes, I do."
Here you go.
How are we feeling?
- It hurts.
- Yeah.
"- What time is the soccer game, honey?"
- About 2:00 on Saturday.
- Who are you playing?
- The Cougars.
"If we beat them, we""re in the playoffs."
"Mom, can I go to the park?"
What?
Yeah.
"Oh, my!"
Look at you.
They'll learn it when they marry.
"Good night, Mr. Rossi."
Doc Swain offers a special price for frostbites.
"- Come on, Allison."
- Rodney.
Allison!
This was supposed to be a birthday party.
"Just playing ""photography"":"
"Turn off the lights, see what develops."
Don't be fresh.
Just leave immediately.
- All of you!
- I just caught her under the mistletoe.
Will you please leave?
"Happy birthday, Allison."
"Come on, Betty."
I'm sorry.
Thanks anyway.
"Thanks, Allison."
Come out here.
"Allison, I said come out here."
I knew this would happen if you invited Betty.
- Wasn't her fault.
- And you making love...
"We were kissing, one kiss, not making love."
"The house in darkness, and couples necking all over."
"I know, but everyone wanted to dance in the dark."
And I couldn't very well... .
"Mother, at every party in this town, they turn out the lights."
I don't want you to be like everybody.
I want you to rise above Peyton Place.
"It's my home, my town."
I have some friends here too.
Look.
"See that man over there, standing next to Matt by the float?"
His name's Frank.
He's very handsome.
And he's also quite handy.
"And he noticed that the axle is kind of rusted, which is very dangerous."
So all you have to do is apply a little bit of pressure and...
No!
[MATT YELLING]
"- Hey, pick this trailer up!"
"Guys, lift it!"
- Give me a hand.

"Dude, come on."
"- Come on, lift."
[MATT GRUNTING]
MAN:
Come on!
"- Caroline, call an ambulance."
- Okay.
Why are you doing this?
I'm showing you how easy it is to hurt people.
You're doing this just because of Johnathan Gilbert's invention?
- Hand it over and the fun will stop.
- Damon's not gonna give it to me.
And I think that you underestimate how much Damon cares about you.
He'll kill you before he gives it up.
"Is that before or after I kill your brother, Jeremy?"
ELENA:
Jeremy?
Jeremy!
Really likes improv.
- Anyway.
- One summer mommy had to work for ones.
OK.
"Well, look, I basically, since I got Trent back to"
"Tampa, he agreed to give me this."
Oh.
"Hey, what's that junky old piece of crap?"
- My grandma's wedding ring.
- It's so pretty!
- Thank you so much for doing that for me.
- I didn't just do it for you.
I did it for my best friend.
Did you just call me your best friend?
"- Yes, I did."
- I don't think I want that anymore.
You need to try that.
"Look, I already know you're my best friend even though that pissed me off quite a bit."
But I need to know if you'd be willing to be my best man.
Hey.
Of course.
Baby bird.
"Let's get married, huh?"
"Well, summer, fall but definitely not this season."
"Hey, buddy."

"Oh my god, you're so annoying!"
"OK, Shelly, would you ever have sex with me and then lie to my face right after?"
"Oh, no, sweetie..."
I get all my lying done beforehand.
There's still some ladies in Detroit who think they slept with a chunky-eyed Isaiah Thomas.
- Where may I find him?
I heard there was a pipe burst in the new underground parking garage.
The one they're building for the docs?
I heard the place is filling up with water.
"It'll set construction back six weeks, probably more, with winter coming on."
"Doc, I hope you've got yourself a really big ice scraper... 'cause winter could start any time now, and up here, the winters are long."
- It's not like Boston.
"- Up here, very little is like Boston, I find."
That's the way we like it.
There's a crack in the parking lot.
You know what?
"I got one of those, too."
In the back of my pants.
"Hold on, Doc."
"You got to fill out a maintenance form, 44-B."
"Johnny should have one here somewhere, but..."
You know what?
You better take a seat.
This will just take a minute.
My name is Stegman.
"Dr. Stegman, Chief of Neurosciences."
"Pleased to meet you, Doc."
Earl Swinton.
I don't know where he keeps these things.
It's got to be here somewhere.
Hell.
Hello?
Is somebody there?
Is somebody there?
Who are you?
What are you?
Who's there?

Then you'II get paid.
Thanks to you I can't go to the baroness's party.
"- In fact, I'II have to leave Paris."
- No more advances.
"I don't need your money, old sow."
I've had an invitation to the country.
"From a duchess, no less."
Good day.
(strains of piano music)
(coughs)
This summer dust is ruinous to my lungs.
I hope the air will be better in Angers.
The Duchess d'Antan has invited you too?
"- well, yes."
- How delightful.
"please continue, dear fellow."
"- Good day, Countess."
- (gasps) George!
- I'm sorry I frightened you.

I had the most fearful dream.
BIandine was a terrible creature with fly's wings that was draining my Iife from me.
They are deadly little charmers.
Chromatic gIissando.
The wings of a butterfly.
Or the wrath of God.
(baby cries)
"He wakes the baby, then complains about the crying."
- How is Franz?
You know that.
I won't get a fair trial.
I'm not going to no prison.
"Lila, Chief Dixon said the cops that are after you..."
Dale Dixon?
Yeah.
He was the one that was by the house.
"You used to know him, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I used to know him."
"Ronnie, I didn't come all this way not to see my baby."
"Now, they'll be watching our house."
So you got to take me someplace outside of town.
"Oh, Lila."
And then tonight you're gonna have to bring my baby out to see me.
And then tomorrow I'll be gone.
"Ronnie, please."
I'm your sister.
I need your help.
"Okay, Lila."
Okay.
RONNIE:
A friend of mine's grand-mamma died a couple of months ago.
She had a house off the highway past the bait shop.
There's no one living there now.
"I'm going to be out there all night, honey, so don't wait up for me."
Are Dud and John going to be with you?
"No, they're not gonna be with me."
We don't need 19 goddamn people in a car to watch a house.
I don't mean you're incapable of watching the house.
"Hey, just 'cause I'm not from L.A."
don't mean I can't watch a goddamn house.
Okay?
"Mr. Thomason, you're under arrest."
Please stand up.
"Couldn't leave it alone, could you, Caine ?"
"Hang on a second, gentlemen."
Now I am conducting an investigation in this room.
Say good-bye to Mr. Thomason.
He's our suspect now.
Fed trumps county.
Get him out of here.
Thomason was leading us to his contacts.
- We were closing in.
- Closing in on what ?
I can't discuss it.
This would be a good time for you to start.
This isn't just smoke and mirrors.
"There are people in our country, this very state in fact, who want to do us harm."
Answer my question.
Haven't you heard of the greater good ?
Was my brother Raymond involved in this ?
And I want the truth.
Raymond's dead.
Now we both know that's not true.
You keep digging... and it will be.
I did some checking of my own.
Bob Keaton's release was approved by federal authorities.
"He was a Fed, wasn't he ?"
"Yelina, Bob Keaton was a DEA agent."
And Raymond ?
I need to know.
I have the right to know.
"Horatio, is he still... is he still alive ?"
It's possible.
I volunteered you guys.
–You can't be serious.
–Your shirt's gay enough for the job.
–What do you mean you gave us to Aceveda?
What...
Great.
I've got your assignments.
"Briefing room, five minutes."
Is everything okay with Kayla?
When was the last time you saw your roommate?
–Last night around 6:00.
–She didn't come home all night?
I don't know.
I slept at my boyfriend's.
Any idea where she might have gone?
There's two million single men in L.A. Take your pick.
"We found her car in the garage, but not her purse or keys."
Is there someone close?
Somewhere she might have walked to?
Wait a minute.
Is Kayla dead?
We have every reason to believe that she's still alive.
'Cause I don't wanna be a bitch... but our rent's due next week.
–Vic.
I got great news.
–What?
Just be glad you hired me and not the brain-dead idiot your wife did.
Jerk off privately.
What do you got?
"Corrine's P.I., they're making nonsecure calls from his cell phone."
I caught one.
Found where she's at.
"Doctor, I assure you, if anybody's playing jokes, it's Judy here."
"Come on, Judy."
Don't touch that chimp.
"Look, fellas, this animal's the property of the United States government."
(JACK):
"Captain, you are wrong."
"Doctor, will you let us prove it to you?"
"Ok, convince us."
"Hey, Judy."
"Judy, it's Mike and Jack."
She has a stubborn streak.
"Judy, don't you have something to say to us?"
(SQUEAKS)
"Judy, this is getting silly."
"Now, say something."
"Look, I will ask her to give me a kiss."
"Now, if she does so, will that prove to you that space helmet or not, she is our chimp?"
Not necessarily.
"And let me warn you,"
Sally is reputed to be a very aggressive chimp.
- Don't get too close to her.
- I'll take my chances.
"Ok, Judy, now look, you've had a lot of fun, but the game is over."
Now you lean over here and you give your old friend Jack a great big kiss.
"Now, come on."
Pucker up.
(SCREECHING)
"Jack, you all right?"
"No, no, Sally, don't do that."
I told you not to get too close.
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
Do you just carry that thing around for dramatic effect?
Yeah.
around for dramatic effect?
Yeah.
And I use it to boil eggs.
Yeah.
And I use it to boil eggs.
"A little heavy-handed, I know."
And I use it to boil eggs.
"A little heavy-handed, I know."
"Oh,she'shere."
"A little heavy-handed, I know."
"Oh,she'shere."
So I think that Haylie might
"Oh,she'shere."
So I think that Haylie might actually maybe for some reason
"So I think that Haylie might actually maybe for some reason like you, so ix-nay actually maybe for some reason like you, so ix-nay on the death stuff."
"like you, so ix-nay on the death stuff."
"Just ask her if she's, like, on the death stuff."
"Just ask her if she's, like, a cat person or a dog person."
"Just ask her if she's, like, a cat person or a dog person."
I'ma turtleperson.
a cat person or a dog person.
I'ma turtleperson.
Justkeepit light.
I'ma turtleperson.
Justkeepit light.
"You know, tell the truth."
Justkeepit light.
"You know, tell the truth."
Theawfultruth!
"You know, tell the truth."
- Course not.
What?
"If we mess this up, they will find you dead of an overdose and I'll be back in prison waiting for someone to stab me in the showers."
"Better hope he hasn't gone far, Calum."
Iain?
"What do you mean, a runner?"
"Just took off, all of a sudden."
- Find him for me.
- And then what?
Operation Merlin's all but dead and buried.
"I want him dealt with, John."
"And this time, no guns."
"- John, I've finally cracked it."
It's churros.
- What are you talking about?
The Spanish doughnuts you dip in hot chocolate after you've been out.
- Churros.
- Good.
"Once again last night, the wife got a call at 10:30."
- The husband saying good night.
- Exactly.
He's always calling.
They must like each other.
"We need to get in, get the phone number, without her knowing."
How?
We need a woman.
"Like Mr Ray Charles says, we've got a woman."
- You must be joking if you think...
- How many other birds do you know?
We meet again.
Thanks again for everything you did to help me.
"Oh, don't just thank me."
"Well, whatever you say."
And we should analyze it more deeply.
"Yes, we'll analyze it."
So I'll come back next week?
Excellent.
My pleasure.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
What are you doing here?
I was just leaving.
Don't freak out.
I just wanted to see you.
But I'm harmless.
Dr. Roncero's office.
"Hi, Lola."
I've just taken an elephantsized dump.
One and two and three.
Forward and hold.
Can you take over?
Alicia never came back.
"I didn't want to scare her again, so I didn't go to her house until a week later, when I had to see her father."
It rained all week.
The next time I saw her was here.
What happened to her?
A car accident on one of those rainy days.
"Her father didn't want her to be alone for a minute, day or night."
"He asked for the best nurses,"
"I've got a very good reputation here, and they recommended me."
"When he saw me, he remembered that we'd met and he'd a moment of doubt, but he ended up hiring Matilde and me exclusively."
That was four years ago.
And here we are.
"Right, Alicia?"
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.
They don't pay Fanucci.
"If they don't pay Fanucci, then somebody else collects for Maranzalla!"
We'll all be better off if we pay him.
Don't worry.
Now what I say stays in this room.
"If you both like, why not give me $50 each to pay Fanucci?"
I guarantee he'll accept what I give him.
"If Fanucci says $200 he means it, Vito!"
I'll reason with him.
Leave everything to me.
I'll take care of everything.
I never lie to my friends.
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.
He'll ask for the money.
Tell him you'll pay whatever he wants.
Don't argue with him.
Then I'll go and get him to agree.
"Don't argue with him, since he's so tough."
How can you get him to take less?
That's my business.
Just remember that I did you a favor.
Is it a deal?
Yes.
His family's out of the house.
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.
"Vito, here's my 50 dollars."
Buona fortuna.
Are you sure he's going to go for it?
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.
It looks like there's - $ 100 under my hat.
Emily pledged her loyalty to Katherine.
But she couldn't stand by and watch innocent people get killed.
This was the only way she could think of to help to let Johnathan Gilbert believe he'd actually invented these devices.
Does it say what it does?
- Are you sure this is what Isobel wants?
"- Yeah, I'm sure."
Why?
This is a weapon.
Against vampires.
Elena.
Hey.
Um...
Have you seen Stefan?
I need to find him.
"No, not lately."
"Listen, do you have a second?"
"- Yeah, what's up?"
What's going on?
"- Well, it's Anna."
I've left her all these messages and she hasn't gotten back to me.
- Not even a text.
- Anna?
I didn't know that you guys were still friends.
"Yeah, we're more than friends."
"Look, something could be seriously wrong."
"And if you know anything, you gotta tell me."
"I haven't talked to her, Jer."
Are you lying to me right now?
- Why would you say that?
- That's what you do.
You lie.
You lie about everything.
Right?
Even that is a fanatic of arrangements.
"Well, O-wakama introduce yourself."
My name is Wakama.
"She's being taught to act normal in a general way, bur..."
"It's because she don't know the meaning of "" hard work """
O-Waka -chan!
Matsuki-chan!
Son of a bitch!
""" This body of mine have I received for my parents... ..And to keep it safe from harm is my first filial duty..."""
Don't you know?
Matsukichi!
You are not just some clerk sitting on a reception to have irezumi.
You are disinherited!
O-Waka-chan.
Matsuki-chan!
What happened?
I've just been said by my father that I'm disinherited.
But...
Matsuki-san...
You are his only son.
Aren't you?
It doesn't matter.
I was being forced to...
"From now on, finally I'll become a firefighter."
You were like this since you were a child.
Matsuki-san.
But... if that happens...
I...
I want to see you Matsuki-san.
I want to see you as soon as possible.
Don't worry.
How?
"Secondly, the Church, before it approves an exorcism conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted."
That takes time.
-You could do it yourself.
"-No, I couldn't."
"I'd need Church approval, and that's rarely given."
Could you see her?
"Yes, I could."
I could see her as a psychiatrist--
Not a psychiatrist!
She needs a priest!
She's seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you !
Are you gonna send me back to them?
"Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?"
You don't understand--
Can't you help her?
Just help her!
It wants no straps.
"Hello, Regan."
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.
"You might loosen these straps, then."
"I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan."
I'm not Regan.
I see.
"Well, then, let's introduce ourselves."
I'm Damien Karras.
And I am the devil.
Now kindly undo these straps.
"If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?"
"That's much too vulgar a display of power, Karras."
Where's Regan?
Ghosts are tied to the places that they haunt.
They can't just bail.
Unless this one can.
"There's lore about spirits possessing people, riding them."
"Whenever they leave the body, they're bungeed back to their usual haunt."
"But until then, the ghosts can go wherever they want."
So a spook just grabs a kid on the bus and walks right into Truman?
It's possible.
"Ghosts getting creative, well, that's super."
[EMF METER WHINING]
SAM:
Definitely ain't clean.
"Here ghosty, ghosty, ghosty."
"-Come out, come out, wherever you are."
-I don't get it.
No one ever died on this bus.
It's not like there's a body here.
"But a flap of skin, a hair-- Hell, a hangnail--"
Something's gotta be tying the ghost to this place.
We gotta find it.
SAM:
Yeah.
"Got a new driving permit, issued two weeks ago."
[CLICKS OFF EMF METER]
-Just before the first attack.
-Yeah.
Name of the bus driver is Dirk MacGregor Sr.
39 North Central Avenue.
-MacGregor?
-Yeah.
What?
I knew his son.
He...
"He saved Roger, didn't he?"
Hey.
"Hey, the race is on."
"Oh, hey, man."
Spare me.
I don't want to look at no race.
I don't want to know nothing about no race.
Shh.
Today's running of the famed Iron Man Classic drew a record number of competitors.
"The big surprise of the event came in the last leg, the 100-mile bicycle portion, when a rider sponsored by Island Hoppers... suddenly reversed field as he exited the famed Austin Memorial Gardens."
"We've got some footage of that Island Hoppers biker, who certainly lived up to his sponsor's name."
"Whoever you are, Island Hopper, we admire your style."
Yeeha!
Look at...
And that's the news from all of us to all of you.
Good night.
ANGEL GUTS:
RED PORNO
There are perverts everywhere nowadays.
Hello?
Come on Nami.
You're my best friend.
"Do my shift tomorrow, please?"
I've got a date.
What job is it?
Can just anyone do it instead of you?
Yeah.
As long it's a woman.
It's very easy.
You just have to stand there doing nothing.
Humanity would live... once again.
The end
Mmm...
Mmm...
"You gotta wrap it up, Teddy."
"We're closing for the afternoon, but we'll be back in a few hours for the dinner rush."
I'm ready!
Let's go!
- Why do you have two bottles of wine?
- What?
It's a wine train.
Ooh.
You guys going on the wine train?
"Uh, you get the wine on the train, Lin."
You don't have to bring it.
Oh...
"Otherwise, it would be just called a train."
Right.
"Lin, you're sure kids are allowed on this thing?"
"It says right here in the brochure, ""Kids are allowed."""
"It says, ""Kids are allowed, ""but not welcome."""
Like in the health and sexuality section at the bookstore.
- Where's Gene?
- He's picking out his outfit.
I'm gonna be Boxcar Gene!
"Gene, why do you look like Dexy from Dexy's Midnight Runners?"
- 'Cause we're going on a train!
"- Well, go put a shirt on."
"Next thing, you're gonna be telling me to go put on underwear."
Put on underwear.
Okay.
"That Joe, collecting stuff like that."
It used to be just guns.
- What sort of trick you got in mind?
- A small wall type.
My f amily bible.
"When you spot your job, holler."
- There.
Am I right?
- That looks right.
That one?
It's a pipe.
What's the layout?
Martinelli's private office at the Sanctuary Club.
I was willing to turn a trick because you're Al's f riend.
I'd cut it off to here f or Al.
But I ain't souping Martinelli's safe.
"I've built up a legitimate business here, with a positive f uture."
"Forget it, Murdock."
Wash it out of your mind.
No grease. it wouldn't do me any good with sand in my mouth.
"If it's a pipe, couldn't you show him how to do it?"
How you like that?
"Murdock, you got something there."
"I have a letter l want to get, and she wants me to get it."
"Lady, there was a time I could have used you."
I'll show you how in five minutes flat.
Come on.
- Where next?
- Where does Martinelli live?
Crescent Beach.
Why?
"Suppose you drive around, show me the sights and wind up there after dark."
I want... that one.
"Jack Donaghy to the control room, please."
Jack Donaghy.
Peanut's not an actor.
I just rescued her from a lab.
"Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off."
Where do you live?
The studio.
I want you to drop me at the studio.
I want to tell Donaghy to his face that I quit in front of the whole crew so that they know he didn't fire me.
I want to see that.
"Oh, oh, pull over!"
Pull over here!
"Tracy, I don't have time for this."
Right here.
This is where I grew up.
This is the Jordan family estate?
Wasn't no Jordan family nothing.
This is where I was in foster care.
"Oh, sorry."
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
I'm so lucky I got out of here.
It's not luck.
"I mean, you got out of here because you're very talented and people love you and..."
Are you peeing?
Where's Donaghy?
I want to talk to him right now.
"Last time I saw him, he was riding the crane camera."
"Oh, I have Pete for you."
"Pete, oh, my God, I didn't know."
"No, listen, it will give me a chance to spend more time with my kids."
I'm quitting.
"Kelton, do you read me?"
Do you read me?
"Kelton, answer me."
"Kelton, talk to me now."
Come on!
This is Alpha.
I'm okay.
Search and Rescue's traveling.
Monroe!
This is Alpha to Staging Command.
I've got my location.
Look for a manhole cover...
It's number... nine...
It's number 929.
That Nathan card wasn't a coincidence.
That perp knew I was going to be on this case.
You think he has an ax to grind?
I don't know.
I cross-referenced the word Nathan with the number 929.
II Chronicles 9:29 talks about the prophet Nathan.
"Nathan passage, Nathan card..."
"Why it's relevant, I have no idea."
Perp could be a religious fanatic.
What's his profil say?
His taste is consistent.
"Both Sara and Amanda are attractive, civic-minded politicians' wives."
"High profile, soft target."
How hard did they look at Amanda's husband Curtis McNeal?
"With a fine-tooth comb, even though he was mayor at the time."
There were rumors of an affair.
He took a lot of heat from the local press.
Nothing stuck.
He said that I was unfit.
"Now, all my life, people have told me that I'm very fit."
"My Uncle Lionel was in the fucking Olympics, okay?"
I didn't know that.
Archery?
Pentathlon.
"So, to tell me that I am unfit now when my fitness really matters, when the fitness stakes couldn't be higher..."
Here I am!
With nothing left!
Nothing!
You have taken everything that has meant anything to me!
You have--
Get a blanket.
Dennis.
What are you-- what are you doing?
"You're a doctor, right?"
"I mean, you help people?"
I-I do.
"I, um, heard you wrote a book about... people's private parts."
About sex-- yes.
"Yes, I did."
Is everything all right?
I don't think so.
I think... something's wrong with me.
"And originally, it gets produced in here."
"It's called a nocturnal emission or, colloquially, a wet dream."
It's incredibly common and perfectly normal.
Are you sure?
I couldn't be more sure.
Hasn't your father or... someone explained any of this to you?
- Ow!
- John!
It's-
You know what?
This isn't a basement.
This is a nursing home.
I know something new we could do.
"Jackie, Donna, get naked."
The rest of you guys back off and give us some room.
"- Hello, friends of Fez."
- Hi.
Where's Nina?
She don't wanna hang out with me tonight.
She said she needed space.
- [All] Ooh!
- Uh-oh.
That's the same sound you guys made when I told you I was gonna grow my bangs out.
"Fez, when a girl says she needs space, that means that she's dumping you."
You don't understand.
She said it was her and not me.
- [All] Oh!
- That ain't good.
"- Oh, what's the big deal?"
"- Oh, man, I can't tell him."
"This is a job for someone who's cold, heartless and just inhuman."
"Jackie, go for it."
"Fez, when a girl says, ""It's not you, it's me""... what she really means is it's you."
- So I have really been dumped.
- [Hyde] Yep.
And here's another tip.
"When a girl says she just wants to be friends... it means she wants you to do stuff for her, but she's not gonna put out."
"So, you know, heads-up on that one."
Yep.
Women'll screw you over every chance they get.
Thanks for the wallet.
Dr. Roncero.
Psychiatrist.
7th Left.
Twenty three.
The day I spent waiting at the window was the day she wouldn't come.
But I knew her address and that her father was a psychiatrist.
Dr. Roncero's office.
I'd like to make an appointment.
Does tomorrow at 5:00 suit you?
Can't it be sooner?
"No, tomorrow at 5:00."
All right.
Your name?
What's up?
I've got an appointment at 5:00.
Come in.
Don't stand there!
Excuse me.
Benigno Martin?
Yes.
I have to get some details.
"I just wanted to see Alicia again, but as I was there and her father was a psychiatrist"
I decided to tell him I missed my mother.
"The last fifteen years, you said?"
Yes.
I started when I was very young.
And during those fifteen years you did nothing but look after your mother?
I never left her side.
"Well, I studied to be a nurse so I had to go out to attend classes."
"I also studied beauty therapy, makeup and hairdressing, but by mail."
You mean you did your mother's makeup and her hair?
"Right, so, I failed to mention that the giant enchanted the beanstalk to repel intruders."
"All right, so how do we get up there?"
"I've got a counter spell from Cora, if you'd be so kind."
"Thank you, my lady."
(TINKLING)
I've got one more of these.
Cora was to accompany me.
"So, which one of you four lovelies shall take her place?"
"Go on, fight it out."
"And don't be afraid to, you know, really get into it."

"But really, you could've just asked me for the keys."
Just drive.
It's fine.
I just stole your car.
Your life could be in danger.
Neal Cassidy.
"Yeah, I'm not telling you my name."
I don't need it to have you arrested when the robbery is in progress.
Emma Swan.
Good name.
"So, do you just live in here, or are you just waiting for the car to be stolen?"
Why don't I tell you over drinks?
Excuse me?
"- Hey, eyes on the road!"
Watch how you poke those fingers.
This is still my office!
--FOR NOW!
--And no need to yell at me
I can also shout so the windows will shatter
"--You're with them, dammit!"
--Why are you intimidating me?
Why do you all try to intimidate me?
"Look at you, commandeering around here"
"His wife busted him, so we all have to tip-toe around your hysterical persona"
--That's personal!
--Do excuse me...
My mother-in-law tore out a lump of hair from my head on Wednesday?
You know about that?
Does anyone?
NO!
Did it show in my work?
No!
Because I keep myself in check
"--I don't mix personal with professional --Valentin Maximovich, 7th SMU is on the line"
"Raya, I am not here."
"Here, have some."
From Finland.
You can bring me some in the evening.
Why are you staring?
Take.
I know where to get more.
And one more thing.
Use words.
"They mostly care about words ""Little chicken, little birdie..."""
"Raya dear, 2 teas please"
--Buying me off?
This is a dream come true.
That's very kind of you to say.
"Our society has a long and rich history, and our membership expands every continent, save Antarctica."
Not too many murders there.
No.
No. [Chuckles]
"Although, I did find a lost Chinese treasure ship hidden in an iceberg... 2007."
"Now, I hate to do this, but I need to speak to Mr. Castle alone."
"I'm sure you understand, Ms. Shipton."
No.
"I can stay here, if that's what you mean."
Excellent.
This way.
Ooh.
"As you can see, we have assembled a few of our members."
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
I know you.
You were at the crime scene.
You're a cop.
"No, but I wear the hell out of a uniform."
This is Kendall Frost.
She's a private detective based out of San Francisco.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused.
What exactly are we doing here?
Phillip Harris was a member of our society.
His death is a tragedy.
But it is also an opportunity for you or Ms. Frost.
Phillip's death has left an opening in our ranks.
Elimelech.
Who was that?
Boaz... a kinsman of mine...
just wanted to say goodbye.
and their two sons left their home in Bethlehem.
they arrived in the land of Moab where they found relief from the famine.
Elimelech died.
Naomi's two sons grew older and eventually married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth.
they knew very little of the God of Israel:
The God of Naomi and her sons.
and Naomi loved them very much.
tragedy struck again.
Naomi's two sons also took ill and died.
Now three widows faced the future alone... together. and I want you to go back to your families.
What?
Mother?
do it for me.
but we can't let you live alone.
Bethlehem is no place for two Moabite women.
My people will not accept you.
You'll be strangers there.
As you were a stranger here.
Don't you understand?
It's my fault that you've been hurt.
The Lord has punished me.
That's not true.
Your God is good.
You are good.
you'll do as I have asked.
Go.
Return to your own people.
I will go;
They're making your mind into mush!
- You hear me?
- I'll take them back.
I knew my Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.
Since I would see them in the afternoon to pick up a delivery
I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.
"Oh, my God."
"When I finally got to the hospital, Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed."
"Jesus Christ, what happened to you?"
I almost got into an accident on the way here.
And I told him I was partying all night.
- I'm fine.
- Come on.
Get over here.
"- Doc, I'm fine."
- Let me check you out.
Come on.
"He took mercy on me, gave me 10 milligrams of Valium and sent me home."
My plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up Karen.
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?
"Right in front of us, there."
I think it's been following me all morning.
- Get the fuck out.
"What are you, nuts?"
- I'm telling you.
I don't know what's going on.
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.
I've been all over town and I've seen it all day.
The stars shall be your guide.
"As long as we're headed east, that's the direction we're supposed to be going."
I'm looking for the Little Dipper.
"If I could find the Little Dipper, I could find the North Star."
"Shane, help me find the Little Dipper."
"What do I look like, Harriet Tubman?"
Fine!
"I'll do it by myself, okay?"
You guys are no help!
Just...
Just...
Welcome to Hump Island!
It's time to feast here in the belly of the beast here at Eden East!
Now can you feel it?
Come on!
"Man, we are about to get this party started right!"
You guys ready?
Bingo!
"Hey, yo, check it out, y'all!"
A luau fire and drum show is coming up real soon!
Some of the best drummers in the whole world.
Don't forget to check it out!
This place is out of control.
"What could she be possibly getting into over here, man?"
"Come on, let's not get ahead of ourselves."
"For all we know, she could be sitting in a corner sulking somewhere."
"Hey, we can do this."
"We get in, we get out, we're back before sunrise."
I know...
I know that girl.
San Diego!
I know that girl.
"Here's a dollar, kid."
- Treat your folks to dinner.
- Wow!
♪ Memories are made of this ♪
♪ The memories you gave me ♪
♪ Serve it generously with love ♪
♪ The memories you gave me ♪
"♪ One man, one wife... ♪"
"Oh, come on, ladies."
Buy something already.
"Oh, Sue, why are you trying to sell containers to that fat tub of shit?"
She's never had a leftover in her life.
That's the great Jim Reeves.
Hard to believe it's been ten years since we lost him in a horrific plane crash.
Lucky bastard.
"- Hey, mister."
You a pervert?
- No!
Then why are you staring at ladies through that window like one?
- That's my wife in there.
- How come you're not at work?
How come you're not leaving me the fuck alone?
I'm gonna tell my dad you swore at me.
He's a cop.
"Then he can solve your murder, you nosey little shit!"
"Frank, no!"
You've got to stop swearing at other people's children.
You're right.
"Hey, go play with your father's gun!"
- Frank!
- I didn't swear.
Would you please go in and carry out the rest of the stuff I didn't sell?
What?
"Pauline, I'm in a meeting, you lardy trout!"
Wh...?
Insurance?
Hop it.
I just wanted a quick word with you about Enid and myself.
What are you talking about?
"Pauline, get Roberts."
Enid and I are in love.
"'Yes, we're in love.'"
'And why are you telling me?
'
Because I have to assume that you have feelings for her as well 'and that you want the best for her.'
'Are we talking about Enid Sutcliffe?
' 'Yes.'
Why do you think I care one way or the other about her?
Because I know what the situation is.
"Get out of here, you fat fool."
Coming shouting the odds in your cheap suit.
No-one's shouting.
"Can we not shake hands, like gentlemen, for Enid's sake?"
Enid's nothing to me.
"She's a spinster with a crush, that's all, whatever she's told you."
How dare you.
You've had what you've wanted for years and years and you say she's nothing to you?
You're despicable.
Tubby!
Ha-ha-ha!
Come with me!
You'll stay where you are if you want to keep your job.
"I love you, Enid!"
And don't let him back in!
Thank you.
You can finish early.
"No, I'll stay to the end."
You're a trooper.
It's my last day.
What will you do in Korea?
I want to open a store with my mother.
- With your mother?
- Yes.
Mom endured a lot of hardships for me.
Dad died in a car accident when I was only two.
"After that, Mom raised me all by herself."
She sold clothes at a market until the morning.
It was tough on her.
I'm going home to return the favor.
How old is she?
57 years old.
"If my mom was alive, she'd be the same age."
She passed away?
"Two years ago, breast cancer."
"I was a troublemaker, a constant headache for her."
Kept getting mixed up with the police.
Mom apologized for me every time.
Now I feel horrible about it.
"Maybe I'm not one to talk, but take care of your mother."
I will.
"Say, Kubota San, did you come up with the name Juicy Fruits?"
"There was a band named Juicy Fruits, and I liked the vocalist, Ilia."
So that's where my name comes from.
"Hello, thank you for calling Juicy Fruits."
We'll miss you.
Thanks for everything.
"At last, comes the day"
"Simran, what are you doing?"
"I had forgotten, Ma."
I haven't even the right to dream
"No my child, of course you may dream"
But don't expect them to come true
"And who know, Kuljit might be the man of your dreams"
I don't care.
I've bought your tickets.
You're coming to Europe with me
- I can't
Babujiwon't let me go to college alone.
Will he let me go away... touring Europe for a month?
I have lots of work here.
- You've known me for years
Can't you make up an excuse?
"An excuse, I can find."
But I don't feel like lying to Babuji
Let me talk to Matonight
Europe?
- Yes
With friends?
- Yes
For a month?
- Yes
"Chutki, call the doctor."
Tell him that our Simran has gone stark mad
Will you at least take a look?
- Check out your brains first
You talk of traveling by Eurail?
"If he hears, he'll bring the roof down"
A lone girl mustn't travel like this.
Was she pregnant?
Why else?
For fun?
"The very day they caught them, Papa sent her to Paris."
And two months later we all left Algeria-.
Things were bad enough for the Jews as it was.
But Maurice didn't give up.
He followed her to Paris.
Finally they decided to send her to Israel because he couldn't go there.
She went to the kibbutz where she met your father.
And they never saw each other again?
- I don't know.
- When she came to visit.
"She came to rest and see me, that's all I know."
"And this Maurice, where is he?"
Did you know all this?
Not until two hours ago.
So why did you come here?
To ask you to come home.
Now that I've heard things that your mother never told me
"I'm begging you, come home."
Live your lives.
"Honor your mother, she didn't want us to know."
- Are you going home?
- What do you care?
"Rosa, will you see me out?"
Regards to Ricky.
I say we go home.
You can go.
I'm not leaving until we find this Maurice guy.
You believe that old drunk's bullshit?
"One thing doesn't make sense, Aunt Rosa."
officer david.
This is jody carvell.
I am standing outside of the larson lane house.
Are you aware that the police tape is still up?
"Yes,it's an ongoing investigation."
It's the real-eate agent.
"Okay,for how much longer?"
It costs me money every day I can't show this house.
- This is outrageous.
"- Yes,but I..."
"- no,I..."
"- I would like to speak to your pervisor,if I could."
She wants to have a word with my survisor.
"miss kemp,it's is."
We need to speak with you agN.
Rebecca?
"Rebecca,what happened?"
Did you call 911?
Hold on.
"Yes,I've got a woman here who's shot and needs immediate medical attention."
why would someone unbury a body?
I can answer that.
"To send a message.Like,""hi,I'm dead."""
"""Never get engaged to two women at the same time""?"
It would be easier to jusrent a billboard.
Second question.
where's the money?
"ah,maybe in siri's engagement ring."
I got to bring this down to abby.
I can save you an elevator trip.
"oh,that's nice."
It's creating condensation.
It wasn't fulfilling.
It wasn't fulfilling?
Ha-ha-ha.
It wasn't fulfilling.
It wasn't anything!
"We don't want any violence in here, do we?"
"Go ahead, kill me."
I don't care.
It must be from a factory... or someplace where the fire is burning quantities of oil.
That direction... that would be the factory owned by Mac Bain!
Mac Bain?
Do you mean the famous aeronautical engineer?
"If I remember right, he's the favorite to win the world aircraft championship."
A race that will be held in Holland sometime soon.
My late husband really admired him.
"Oh, I do hope everything's all right."
Well then.
Why don't we have a look?
How terrible!
Where is Mac?
Is Helen safe?
"Ma'am, it's too dangerous!"
Stay back!
Stay back!
We are acquaintances of Mac.
I am Sherlock Holmes.
"Pardon me, sir."
"Please stay here, Mrs. Hudson."
Mac!
Helen!
Let me see...
How could this have happened in an empty factory?
I can't believe I chickened out.
It's okay B.
This is the beginning of something new.
Now we can all move on.
The possibilities are endless after all.
Yes.
To great things.
And so what if i'm not going to yale?
you were recently incarcerated
And I'm afraid to talk to Chuck because he might hurt me again.
This is our moment.
Nobody can take that from us.
I urge you to go out into the world
And show them who you have become.
Not so fast.
You're not graduating until I give you my diplomas.
Mine are labels and labels stick.
Nate Archibald-- class whore.
Dan Humphrey-- the ultimate insider.
Chuck Bass--coward.
Blair Waldorf--weakling.
And as for Serena Van der Woodsen
After today you are officially irrelevant.
- O.M.G.
- I know.
Congratulations everyone.
You deserve it.
Now please join me in welcoming the class of 2009.
Class please stand.
You were right B.
Nobody can take this day away from us.
Gossip girl is going down.
"Hi, Mrs. Donovan."
Yeah.
"Okay, well, we're gonna be late."
- So let's just get going.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
Damon hasn't said a word to me.
"Every time I try to talk, he shuts me down."
- Think he's trying to find Katherine?
- I don't know.
He waited 145 years only to find out that Katherine could not care less.
"And it's gotta hurt, right?"
And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
- You have every reason to be upset.
- Mm-hm.
- What are you gonna do?
- About what?
"Isobel, my vampire birth mother, who's related to my ancestor, Katherine who screwed over your brother?"
Nah.
I haven't thought about it at all.
I'm sorry I brought it up.
It'd be nice if we could get through a day without having to deal with it.
No vampire mother or brother...
No vampires at all?
No vampires but you.
I just wanna get us back to normal stuff like school and homework.
Fun.
"Ooh, that sounds good to me, when do we start?"
We can watch a movie at my place.
The Baroness is served.
Take the princess' arm.
I will follow you.
What a beautiful couple you would make.
Come in.
"Madam, Mr Barbey and another gentleman are here."
They ask if you can receive them in spite of the late hour.
Of course.
I'm coming.
- You will excuse me.
- You're welcome.
"Let me introduce you to Mr Nanteuil, my new partner."
"Good evening, Mr."
Madam.
"Excuse my tardiness, Baroness, please."
Mr Nanteuil is a French Canadian.
"With the capitals he brought, my bank, our bank, is now the first private bank in Paris."
"I am very happy for you, Mr Barbey."
You will therefore find it easier to give me the money I asked.
"Unfortunately, no."
It is no longer the same operation.
"I do not know how to say this, but you are completely ruined."
This is the sad language of numbers.
But it is not possible.
"Your hotel, your cars,"
your home...
- But...
- You must leave everything.
Which Baroness?
"De Vibray, Mr Commissioner."
"His patron of the arts, somehow."
Ah!
Thank you.
I'll drive up to Joe's Cabins.
I'll take a look at the junction.
"Yeah, I-I'm Reed."
Latham Reed.
"But you might as well know now, Mr. Mason, I-"
- I just can't remember.
What can't you remember?
"Here, sit up."
Nothing.
"From that moment yesterday afternoon when Somers offered me a highball and I said no, make mine lemonade."
Thought it tasted funny - for lemonade.
Used to be an alcoholic.
For three years I didn't touch a drop.
Didn't even smell a cork.
I'll kill that Somers.
Someone already has killed him.
Yeah.
Edie told me.
First good news I've had since she brought me to.
Where did she find you?
Mmm.
You'll have to ask her that when she comes back with more coffee.
"You took a certified check yesterday, isn't that right?"
"A check for $50,000?"
A check that Somers asked you to deliver and endorse over to a hospital fund?
How should I know?
"When she found me, she said that I had $7,000 in $500 bills."
- Now-- - [door opens]
Now what?
"I couldn't spot her, Perry."
"No sign of Axel, either."
Yoon Jae...
You came...?
Surprise!
Why did you come here?
!
What were you thinking coming here?
!
I came here to see you and some lady just suddenly appeared!
'Guess what was inside the dumplings?
'
"'Wriggly, wriggle..."
Ah!
You guessed it!
'
She said that and just dragged me inside.
I'm about to go crazy!
You're lucky that I was able to figure out the situation so quickly.
"What would you have done if I said, 'Lady, who are you?"
'
"Since I was good enough to greet them all, you take care of the rest on your own."
Bye.
Where do you think you're going?
!
"If you started out as Yoon Jae, you have to finish it out as Yoon Jae before you leave."
Okay?
What?
Seeing how he came all the way here...
I guess the wedding isn't off.
He said he was like that because he's been unwell since being in a car accident.
We misunderstood over nothing when he was sick from the accident.
"Talk it over with Yoon Jae over a spicy dumpling stew and a drink, then let it go."
Choong Sik...
"Kiersten, where's Tony?"
[Kiersten] He's at the Mexican restaurant.
[Rossi] Is someone around him?
"Yes, uh, but I can't really make out his face."
What about his body?
Is it young?
Is it old?
"Uh, 25 maybe."
Wait.
He's wearing a mask.
- Like the kid?
"- No, no, no, no, no."
It only covers one side of his face.
"His ear is gone, and, um..."
[Rossi] What do you see?
It's a black guy.
He's black.
You make him sound like he's Freddy Krueger or something.
"No, but I do think he's severely burned."
Explains why he chooses this time of the year.
- He doesn't have to hide his scars.
- What about his victims?
He's punishing them for wronging him.
[Garner] Wronging him?
What about his second victim?
Have you looked at Josephine Davis' life?
She was the nicest woman in the world.
How did she wrong this guy?
"He's had interactions with all of his victims, some more personal than others."
So he's acting out of revenge.
Kiersten and Tony didn't even speak to him.
"Maybe not that night, but at some point in the past."
Rely on it!
That's what my lawyer said.
- You too?
"- No, thanks."
The fine gentleman will pay.
There's still something called fatherhood.
Only the pleasure and no responsibility?
Ha!
"He's here, Mrs John!"
"Where I, in my condition, was made to sit at the bar's cash register..."
No percentages anymore!
"And then, not even the alimony!"
Mr Hassenreuter?
Did you go to the state library?
"Oh certainly, the books!"
"Yes, just a moment, Mrs John!"
- An extra lock?
- And a bolt on the inside!
"As if there was anything to steal from him, Mr Theater Director!"
Without a theater...
He still owes me the rent.
How does he make a living?
"Life, but my lips are sealed..."
"Morning, Mrs John!"
I have something for you.
"Gynecology, midwifery and infant care."
Whether this is the right one for you...
I've been a bachelor all my life.
It's all Greek to me...
"I'll find my way through, Mr Hassenreuter!"
Thank you very much...
What do you want with it?
I see that she's stayed out all night.
"I'm sure she was with Yoon Jae, right?"
!
Is your daughter staying out all night something to be smiling about?
"They're going to get married in a month, so who cares?"
"With Yoon Jae always sending Da Ran home on time,"
I was worried something was wrong with Yoon Jae.
But I guess not...
Shall we invite Yoon Jae over today and make him some grilled eel?
Don't make things so obvious like that and embarrass those kids.
You're right...
Things like that...
You do for them without making it obvious.
How can you feed him eel without making it obvious?
"If you put the eel in the stuffing and give it to him in a dumpling form, don't you think that'll work?"
Eel dumplings?
!
(Eels are good for a man's virility)
Should I grow out a beard?
It's not even my body.
Why am I itchy?
Does this guy have dry skin?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Da Ran!
That person...
Looks like Yoon Jae!
Wait!
Wait!
Gil Da Ran!
Yoon Jae!
Gil Da Ran!
Uh-oh.
Walking me to the couch.
This can't be good.
No.
I just...
I have something really important I need to tell you and...
You could be mad.
Really mad.
But I just care about you too much to not tell you that...
That you're Hannah Montana?
Please don't interrupt me.
This is really...
Huh?
I know you're Hannah Montana.
How?
"It was that blabbermouth Siena, wasn't it?"
Didn't need any help on this one.
You both have the same beautiful eyes.
And amazing smile.
And then there's the fact that I told Miley that my dad.
Was stationed overseas and then two days later.
Hannah had a concert for kids whose parents were stationed overseas.
Hmm.
I was hoping you'd think that was just a coinkydink.
Come on six years and the rest of the world hasn't put it together.
Well the rest of the world isn't in love with Miley Stewart.
You're in love with me?
Yeah.
Um...
Unless you're not in love with me then I take that back.
"Because, you know, I'm cool."
Aw.
Great.
Ayushman.
Sometimes I can't decide... who the bigger rascal is.
Doesn't make a difference.
We're both serving the country.
If you're eager on taking a decision... then decide when I'm going to be CP.
I'll sign on your promotion letter... only when your sister and my son... sign on the marriage certificate.
Even I can't decide Mr. Pradhan... who the bigger rascal is.
What to do Ayushman?
My son's heart is set on your sister.
And my son's wish is my command.
On that note let's celebrate at your house today.
Okay.
- Sir.
- What is it?
The police thrashed Vishal.
They threw him down from the multiplex.
What?
What happened Mr. Pradhan.
That police officer whom you appointed... for Ankita's security thrashed Vishal.
Threw him down from the first floor of Galaxy Multiplex.
Zoravar.
Whoever he is.
That midget beat-up Vishal.
I'll look into it.
- Get the car.
- Yes sir.
- Jadhav.
- Yadav sir.
Whatever.
Get me Galaxy Multiplex CCTV footages now.
Yes sir.
Back to business.
"Is it just me, or is Zach perfect?"
"He's good-looking, but not into himself, smart, but not a showoff."
"Athletic, but sensitive."
A politician's son.
"Hey, he's like Newport's Prince William."
"- Yeah, the kind of guy parents love."
"- Hey, did I tell you how stoked my dad is that I'm dating a congressman's son?"
"- He is, like, dying to go have lunch with Zach."
"- So, you going to do it?"
No way.
Remember what a Grade A disaster that was with Cohen?
"- Yeah, but Zach's not Seth."
"- Believe me, I know."
"- So, then what's the problem?"
You afraid he might actually like Zach?
Then you two will live happily ever after with no problems and nothing standing in your way?
- No.
I... no.
"- Oh, so, then you're not over Seth."
"Oh, I am."
I've divested myself of all of Seth's material possessions.
I'm vibrating at an extremely Cohenless frequency.
"- Okay, so, then you don't really like Zach."
- No.
I mean yes.
I don't...
"Ew, shut up."
"Hey, Summer."
Marissa.
Hey.
Come sit down.
Like the disappearance of the Lady Hampshire.
Like love.
Abbs...
"I don't have anything yet, Gibbs."
The computers just got here.
"Well, maybe this stuff will help.; it's all the files we've compiled on the case so far."
What are you doing?
(shutter clicks)
I'm taking a picture of you with my map.
"Trust me, you will thank me later."
"Oh, I know that look."
I like that look.
"The photo of Jarvis and Wickes, where is it?"
"Right here, why?"
What just happened?
Another unexplained phenomena.
"Sometimes, you just have to believe."
Who took the picture?
Haven't we already done this?
VANCE:
"Gibbs, be careful."
RYAN:
The tell.
"Wickes looked at the picture because of who was behind the camera, not in front of it."
"Who took the picture, sir?"
(sighs) Carl Dalton.
He used to go hunting with us.
Does he have a connection to the company?
He's Wickes' half-brother and in-house counsel for Wickes Steel.
DALTON:
"Phillip, what's going on?"
You said you were in trouble?
"Only maybe I was buying a lot more than that, and didn't know it."
"McGee, 25 Palmetto Street."
It was a nice little house.
"He'd probably paid 4 or 5000 for it, before houses went up."
"From all I hear, it would probably bring 15 G's by now."
"And here was this guy, McGee, all nicely reformed."
"Chances are, it's the first house he ever lived in."
"When this is over, go see him, Father."
You two would get along.
But I had something else on my mind right then.
- What'll it be?
"- Phone company, checking calls."
Did you get one f rom St. Louis a little while ago?
"- Hiya, Murdock?"
"- Okay, McGee."
Step right in.
"Oh, McGee, this is Mike."
"Hiya, Mike?"
I'm fine now.
- What a nice place you've got.
- lt's messed up right now.
"Joe, that's my kid, he brought this junk back f rom Japan."
Joe took this off a Nip colonel.
Ain't it a pip?
"Almost cut your head off, didn't I?"
Joe says these are new.
- Those are German.
- That's what Joe said.
How'd you know?
I'd turn them into Army ordnance.
Start coughing too hard there'll be nothing left but the gold in your teeth.
Holy smoke!
All right.
- How did it go?
- Nothing to it.
I left his car at the airport and took a bus back.
"Good, then all we've got to worry about is his wife."
This will control the lights in the house.
"Ready, Cinnamon."
"The more I think of that Harper dame, the more I wonder if she shouldn't have disappeared with her husband."
Yeah.
"Well, that can be arranged."
Burt!
Burt!
It's her.
"Burt, please."
My husband is back.
He's in the house.
"I was in the kitchen, fixing something to eat, and I heard a noise in the living room."
I went in there but there was nothing there.
Nothing but cold.
It was colder than anything I've ever felt in my whole life.
Then I felt as if someone were watching me.
"I turned around and there he was at the top of the stairs, looking at me."
"Well, whatever it was, lady, it wasn't your husband."
"Oh, it was."
It was.
"He was just like he was this afternoon, with blood, here, on his sweater."
There he is.
I'm terribly sorry.
"I was coming over to my brother's, I saw Lynn come up the road."
Is everything all right?
"Lynn, are you all right?"
You look strange.
Bring up their photos.
The left clavicle on this one is higher than the right.
That's an indication of handedness.
SAROYAN:
"Also, his left deltoid is slightly more developed."
And he parts his hair to the right.
"I mean, most lefties do that."
MONTENEGRO:
Jake Tompkins.
I'll call Booth and let him know.
AUBREY:
"So, this hood isn't exactly screaming ""drug dealer."""
You sure we got the right address?
"Well, Tompkins is not your, you know, usual drug dealer."
He runs a very efficient business.
"Well, I mean, he has to have slipped up somewhere."
Otherwise he wouldn't be in the database.
"Well, he was charged, but he was never convicted, you know?"
"Like I said, he's very careful."
(doorbell ringing)
Yo.
(doorbell rings) (whistles)
Jake Tompkins?
FBI.
Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Special Agent James Aubrey.
How can I help you?
Ask you a few questions.
When was the last time you saw Aldo Clemens?
"Sorry, don't know him."
"Look at the photo, Jake, okay?"
Clemens was found dead this morning.
You think?
That's it.
Pull over.
"You know, Phil, I wanted to support you on this."
"I'm a firm believer in livestock in the home, but you are out of control."
"No, I'm in control..."
More than ever.
"And if me getting what I want inconveniences people a little, then so be it."
Oh.
"Uh, she's nervous."
The guy said you should let her suck on your hair.
"Okay, that is it."
I am done.
♪ Enough of this ridiculousness ♪
"And thank you, Phil, for making me appreciate Mitchell."
"He may have his faults, but at least he's not a crazy person."
"Phil, honey."
"Yes, Claire."
I got an alpaca...
Again.
And there's nothing you can say about it.
I'm not saying anything.
What's the problem?
"Mom, dad!"
There is a camel in the living room!
It's not a c...
- I-I just can't.
- Okay.
I see you've all met Jolene two.
"Sadly, the original Jolene that your mother made me return was cruelly adopted by a children's hospital."
"You see, something hit me this morning when that truck didn't hit me this morning..."
I have not been in control of my own life.
"Uh, excuse me."
Is there an OrangeJulius stand on this floor?
I'll sell you this one.
It's almost full.
Why don't I drink out of a toilet bowl?
He'll be back.
"As for your case, don't you worry."
"I've argued in front of every judge in the state, often as a lawyer."
[ Slurping ]
This court rules in favor of Montgomery Burns.
I find that he is clearly the boy's biological father.
[ Happy Chattering ]
"Uh,Judge, these won't be ready until Thursday."
"You know, we should really stop hiring him."
[ Whistle Tooting ]
- Cool train.
Where does it go?
- Beats me.
But it won't be back for three hours and 40 minutes.
- Once it had snow on it.
"- Wow, Bart!"
Mr. Burns gives you everything you could ever want.
My parents use that old love excuse to screw me out of toys.
"Well, I'm sure you'd like to be alone with your possessions."
"Um, Milhouse, if you stay a little while longer... you can have this blazer."
- It's a Bob Mackie original.
- Wow!
A Bob Mackie!
"Uh... sorry, Bart."
[ Groaning ] Oh.
"Bartholomew, you don't need him."
I can be your school yard chum.
"""A broken smile beneath her whispered wings""."
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What do you look like?
It depends on who's looking.
I want to meet you.
"You already have, John."
I have seen you afraid.
"You're afraid right now, aren't you?"
Can... can I ask you something?
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
When?
Why?
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
Gordon!
"What's up, Connie?"
Everything okay?
Did you just call John?
No.
I've been asleep since 9:00.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
See?
"It's sticking up here around 1,950 cycles per second."
"But it never gets any lower than maybe 1,930 or so."
"But yours is way down here in the normal vocal range... anywhere between 1,000 and 1,200 cycles per second."
"Okay, so this guy's vocal range."
is much higher than mine.
What makes you think it's a man?
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
He was not the looked for element.
How does she look?
"Terrible, Mom."
She's really upset.
- She's called it off.
"- I don""t understand."
What did she expect?
"Well, you done now?"
Are you about finished?
"""Cause, you know, I never bought this whole cynic thing right from the start."
"None of this whole ""Marriage is a sham, you""re better off alone"" thing."
"I don""t buy it."
Never did.
Not for one minute.
"But I""ll tell you who does."
Your daughter.
"The whole world knows you""ve been cheated on... by just about everybody you ever believed in."
I get it.
We all get it.
You can stop sleeping with one eye open right now... because I am not going anywhere.
"L""m right here."
I know.
"Sweetheart, I""m right here."
That dress has been hanging in my closet for 20 years.
"Every couple of years when I clean my closet out, I think:"
"""What the hell am I saving this thing for?"""
What should I do?
"I don""t know what you want me to do."
"- I don""t know what to do!"
- Cassie.
"Honey, listen to me."
"You can pack up your heart, and go home, and be your mama""s daughter... or you can close your eyes and just jump right in."
Just jump in.
I hope I won't.
You never know.
"Hey, girl!"
"You're not from around here, are you?"
Let me see...
You're...
"twenty, maybe twenty five."
Your hair is black.
But your soul is deeply bothered.
Here it comes.
"Yes, my child."
I'm blind.
Blind as a bat.
Then how you know I'm a woman and how old I am?
I've been sitting here for the past 40 years.
The only thing I do here is listen to the sounds.
"Ma'am, if you don't mind."
I...
"I'm sorry, but it is necessary."
[Greta barking]
"We do a routine investigation on any accidental death,"
"Particularly one like your brother's, where"
There weren't any witnesses.
I don't know what to say.
The police told me it was an accident.
"Yeah, I read the report she gave to our detective"
The next day about how you brother parked on the hill
On account of the dead battery.
"Well, I've been thinking about the past four days"
As how I should have gone out and helped him.
I should've insisted.
But I don't understand how the car got down the hill.
"Okay madam, atleast you bless me!"
I understood.
I understood that all my ties with this house are severed
"Its very simple, sir."
But Krishna understood it today..
..that the poor persons destiny can get generous..
..for sometime but cannot improve forever.
"Excuse me, sir.."
-Get aside.
"Mister, listen to me.."
"- Hey go away, go away."
Its a strange city.
No one listens here.
"Mister, where can I get a place to stay here?"
What?
-A home?
Whats so funny?
"Hey fool, who gave you a ticket to Mumbai?"
I have come without a ticket.
I didnt have the money to buy the ticket.
"Then listen, when I came to Mumbai.."
..even I had asked the same question.
Can I get a place to stay somewhere?
Its been 20 years I still didnt get a reply.
I amjust standing like this on one leg.
"You didnt understand, right?"
Does this city belong to yourfather?
Why dont you think before taking..
..your bags and baggage and coming here?
Enough.
Enough.
Hey.. hey my..
"At every step lies deceit, friends will stab you in the back"

Anil Khanna.
I'm the principal in the college Jagadish goes to
I know.
We would like To see his room
The principal.
He wants to see Jagadish
What is the matter...?
- I don't know
Sir... you...?
We must check your computer
What is your password?
Why sir...?
He wants to know your password
Saraswati.
What...?
Saraswati.
Our mother's name
Our suspicion is true.
The papers were stolen by Jagadish's computer
Atul...
Did Jagadish use this computer to give you the question papers?
Why did you have to do this?
Someone tell me what he has done.
- I'll tell you Mrs Batra
Jagadish used his computer... just like a burglar who enters homes and steals
I missed the exit.
I went all the way to Yong Moon.
-How could you go that far?
-I know right?
How can I go that far?
Who are we talking about?
Me.
-Why didn't you answer the phone?
"-I didn't bring it, you know."
I thought you got into an accident.
I was going out to look for a car accident.
You called all of the sudden and told me to leave in 10 minutes.
I was in a hurry.
3 minute shower. 3 minutes to change. 3 minutes to do hair.
-I left at the right time.
-I have to be back by office by 4:30.
You're an hour and 30 minutes late.
We only have an hour and 30 minutes left!
I said I'm sorry.
You can kill me ok?
"Just be positive, hmm?"
"Oh geez, we have an hour and half left."
It's only 10 minutes short from 100 minutes.
It's 10 times 9 minutes.
We even had 14 minute dates before.
When there was an accident in your office.
What do you have in your head?
"I made an absurd excuse to get out of meeting, so that I can see you here."
"10, 20, 30, 40 minutes."
You made me think that you were in an accident.
A big one.
I thought you were unconscious.
You can remain seated.
"It is nothing, only a little exhaustion."
-Then?
-You are well.
"And that there is of the fatigue, lack of appetite and all that?"
"One does not worry, take this and you will feel better."
Good morning.
-What do you want?
-Sandro is in the house?
"-No, in fact, there is nobody."
"-In agreement, tell him that we will return."
"You hear, dear colleague, it would be better to wait for him here."
I do not know if they would have...
"Young lady, I am Prof. Moroni, educational of ""Endocrinoginecologentropia"","
-my assistant Dr. Ognissanti.
"-Yes, we are very important."
"-Come in, come in, please."
-Thanks.
Thanks.
Please.
"Sit down, professor."
Can I get you anything?
Whisky.

-What you want to do?
-You have seen that good she is?
"-Who, the chambermaid?"
"-Handsome, young, ingenuous, ebullient..."
-The lady is not.
-She is not...
-She does not know you...
-She does not know me...
What's going on here anyway?
An old man was buried here yesterday.
"Last night, somebody dug him out and chopped him up."
We've been looking everywhere for his head.
Sometimes I don't understand the world anymore.
How did you last this long?
My family.
"No matter what,"
"I went back home, and everything was okay."
Can I ask you something?
They say you found that hit-and-run driver.
"Yes, I found him."
"An insignificant state employee, living in a row house."
I went into his bedroom at night.
He was alone.
I woke him up.
I wanted him to knowwhy.
It was pathetic.
He cried like a baby.
I just couldn't do it.
Sometimes I drive past his house at night when I can't sleep.
He got married last year.
Has a daughter of his own.
"If somebody always pays, who paid for your wife's death?"
I did.
I paid for it.
Now let's go afteryour Mr. Schoubya.
Mr. Schoubya.
Chief Inspector Minks.
"My colleague, Officer Schrader."
Thank you for seeing us at such shortnotice.
We have a few questions.
"So, Aaron, what kind of career do you think I should go into?"
"I got into math and computers because there was this deep, dark..."
I don't know...
hole inside me and math filled it.
"You need to figure out where your hole is, and try different things until you discover what fills it."
"Wow, I was not expecting to say this, but this really might be your fault."
I got to find her.
I got to find Mary Webber.
I got to talk some sense into her.
- I started this.
I got to end this.
- Whoa.
Wait.
No.
"What about my ""pornado""?"
Yeah.
"Whatever, Neil."
"Yeah, everyone knows you're eating Marci's pudding snacks."
"Yeah, that's right."
"Yeah, I've seen you."
Son.
"Friends with Benefits The Benefit of Mentors August 26, 2011"
Where should we go for lunch?
Let's do vegan.
"I just bought a leather jacket, and I wanna balance it out."
Who are you talking to?
Some loser I can't get rid of.
He won't stop texting me.
So you're texting him back?
"Well, I can't just ignore him."
That would be totally rude.
"Plus, you never know."
Help!
- Gunther.
Where's Margaret?
"- Don't worry, ma'am."
I'll take care of you.
- You're home now.
- Roderick.
- So I looked into...
- The Aconite Society.
- Yeah.
- And?
- There are whispers of a secret order made up of society's wealthiest and most influential men.
- And?
- And whispers are about all anybody would say about it.
"- Thomas... if it's money you want, I'm in no short supply."
- I don't want your money.
- I'll make it worth your while.
"- Listen, I have some advice for you."
Leave this alone.
"Even if half of these stories are true, they run everything:"
"the courts, the papers, the banks."
- All Rosewood?
- I don't know.
- Is Dr. Cairn one of them?
- I don't know a Dr. Cairn.
- What about the girl Lucy that I saw?
Is Mr. Baxter involved with these people?
- Listen to me.
I don't want anything to do with this.
- There's gotta be something more you can give me.
Please.
- That's all I can tell you.
"Oh, um, okay."
"Uh, well, you'll do."
- Flattered.
- Sorry.
"Listen, Leena, you know that 800-year-old sword"
That we were swapping out?
"Uh, well, it turns out, a piece of it has come up missing."
"So if--if--if you were standing next to Artie, right,"
"And he was looking for this thing,"
Wh--what--what would he be doing?
Artie did say that the sword was from the Edo period.
So instead of trying to track it forward
"From the past, just find it in the present."
Identify any collectors that deal in that period
And then try and find as much information as you can
On any sales or transactions of those pieces.
- Right.
Right.
Right.
"Uh, since-- since you're right there,"
"Do--do you think that, uh, maybe you could, uh..."
"Give me a minute, Pete."
"One point, Lattimer."
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello!
Hello!
"Oh, you should've kept your promises, Erik."
"The tsuba, did you find it?"
- Well--
"- Well, it wasn't easy."
"You know, it--it took some digging."
"Hey, where is he?"
He took my car.
- Kono.
- I'm on it.
"Shoulder wound, through and through."
- Dana?
- The surgeons are working on her.
"Listen to me, did Dawkins say where he was going after the bank?"
"I saw a passport and now that he has his money, he's gonna disappear."
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoo!
Damn it.
"Dawkins was on his way to the airport, saw our check point and made a U-turn."
"He's in the H-3 tunnel, headed into Halawa Valley."
Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh, what?"
We're about to lose traffic cam coverage in about two seconds.
He's gone.
"I'm sorry, there's no other cameras on that road."
All right.
Wait a second.
"Why, hello there, sailor."
"Cath, I need your help."
"I'm pursuing a suspect in a black Mercedes, he's headed west to the Halawa Valley."
- Can you give me a visual?
- You want me to access an IKON reconnaissance satellite for your car chase?
This guy has killed three people already today.
"Yeah, look."
This could raise some flags.
"Classify it as an NSA request from a black ops drop box, okay?"
"Come on, Cath."
I need this.
"Hold on, Mr. About-face."
"Is this the same woman you described as a chippy, a leech and a vampire?"
"All lies to save face, sir."
You don't get over a goddess.
- What else does the little Aphrodite have to say?
- Let me see.
"""Thank goodness for Gus."
"He helped me realize the error of my ways."""
Oh!
Good old Gus.
I knew I could count on him.
- Who is this Gus cuss?
- Gus Nagy... my best friend.
"A while back, he wrote me Laverne and Morty were having fights."
"So, I told him to do his best to keep the fur flying'."
- Ah.
- [Laughing]
"""And so, dear Max..."
"""I wanted to let you know before you hear it from anybody else."
"I am marrying Gus Nagy."""
I can't believe it.
I just lost my best girl and my best friend in one lousy sentence.
"Now, pull yourself together, son."
You'll bounce back.
When you get home to Toledo... you'll find a new girl and a new friend.
Toledo.
I'll be the laughingstock there.
It's like Nero Wolfe said...
"""You can't go home again."""
- [Helicopter Approaching]
- I had one shot at true happiness... and now it's killed me.
"I tell you what, Max."
"-But she looks so, so..."
-Shock is just a kind of a sleep.
It's an escape when the mind can't accept what it sees.
A few days care and she'll be out of it.
I guess I'd better tell Selena.
"And, Connie, just because it happened in your house... don't think that any of it was your fault."
-Somehow I do.
-You've got one thing to think of:
Allison.
"If you were going to get married, why didn't you tell me?"
-Because you wouldn't have approved.
-You never gave me a chance.
"At least, it would've been a proper marriage... not a cheap sneak-off weekend affair."
-Don't say that!
"-Well, what was it?"
-I'd like to talk to you alone.
-You can talk to both of us.
"This has to do with the business, not your wife."
-I'll wait outside.
"-Okay, honey."
I can get it annulled.
"Look, dad, I don't want any trouble between us."
"I was in love with Betty and I wanted to marry her, that's all."
You weren't in love.
You had an itching for her.
"She took you, son."
"Good-bye, dad."
-Don't bring her to the house.
-Then I won't be there either.
"Rodney, what about college?"
I'm not going.
I have a wife to support.
I take it you're not a religious man?
You don't believe in a guiding light?
No.
"You're like me, then."
Floundering in wet shit.
Yeah.
How long do you think we can go on like this?

- and to the left?
- Uh-huh.
- Go see if Dad's found his bathing suit yet.
- Gimme a hug.
Yeah.
"Thanks, champ."
"- They are paid to teach, not..."
- To preach.
"I know, but he's six years old, and he also believes in the tooth fairy..."
- and that George Washington never told a lie.
"- Well, it drives me crazy."
"- Mary, wanna turn the ball machine off?"
"- Yes, Mr. Governor."
"Thanks for seeing me, Dad."
- Why wouldn't I see you?
- Partisanship.
I gotta love at least one Democrat.
"You know, Dad, I'm getting some reports that you might not be ready to back me."
That you're opposed to my confirmation...
- You've heard quotes?
"- No, I haven't heard."
Just that we should expect to be reading of your opposition.
"Pardon my Swahili, but you're being led a line of pure bullshit."
- I haven't said a word.
- Maybe it's just that.
Maybe you've been quiet.
- I hate the press.
"- I know, Dad."
"- When I left the mansion, I swore I would never talk to them."
- I remember.
"- I suppose you're gonna force my hand on this, huh?"
- You wouldn't have to say much.
"Daddy, we've found it."
"God, hope you would bless Yu-fa and Nim-sai, make them live happily in heaven, thank God!"
"Sir, beware of catching cold, let us handle it."
"Chung, open the coffin and check the body."
How is the body?
We still can see his face.
Turn the body upside down and remove his trousers.
What did you see?
His ass.
Anything on his ass?
A triangular stain.
It's birthmark.
"Right, he is your brother Nim-sai."
"Actually, Nim-sai was sold to Canton by you for over 20 years."
"If he is still alive, can you recognise him?"
"You know, when one is happy, his has one look."
"And when he is sad, he has another look."
I can't guarantee the change of his look.
Do you remember anything special about Nim-sai?
He has had a very beautiful jade round his neck.
"There is a little door on it, behind the door, the name ""Sai"" of Sir Ho Sai is carved on it."
"Master, what are you doing?"
Wait.
"Master, what are you doing here?"
Wait.
Master.
You are lucky!
What's the matter?
Are you willing to kiss Lotus?
"Master, are you kidding me?"
Will I be that lucky?
It's true!
He's at Rocky Point.
I oughta know that.
Hanley and Grayce got him picked up for an old rat and sent there to get him outta the way because the papers was getting hot.
It's like having him put in a safe.
Yeah.
That's all I know.
You can't blame me.
In Rocky Point.
No wonder you couldn't find him.
The old homestead.
So now what?
"So, what do you suppose?"
"I promised the girl we'd find that fink and clear Ross, didn't I?"
"Well, we did."
Now we gotta get to Carlisle.
Is that right?
Duck soup.
"You take off the kelly at the front door and say,"
"""Please, sir, can I see Mr. Polecat Carlisle?"""
It's too hot.
And supposin' we do find the guy?
Where's the payoff?
"Yeah, the payoff."
"Why don't you forget it, Stacey?"
What difference does it make if you promised the girl?
What do you care about Ross?
We can't help it if Polecat's in stir.
We'll just fool around at Rocky Point and get paid off with a slug in the belly.
And I ain't taking it for Ross or nobody.
Okay.
"If there was only a half a chance, Stacey."
"Listen, don't do nothing foolish."
That's when I felt a burning in my back and I knew he bit me.
I never saw him do anything like that.
Maybe he knew his mother was gone.
Maybe he did it to show his grief.
"Maybe he would've bitten himself, had he been alone."
We don't know.
We don't know how he thinks.
"Maybe he understands, but it's all stuck inside, and can't come out with words."
Poor polo...
What's gonna happen to him?
Where will he end up?

Bus or car?

How long did she study?
Who?
That woman whose poem you recited.
Forough?
I think she was in school until the fourth or fifth year.
"You know, writing poetry has nothing to do with diplomas."
"If you have talent, you can do it too."
How much do I owe you?
"Honey, that""s not nerves."
"That""s intuition."
"And that""s a blessing."

- No.
- No?
- How do I know if my husband is cheating?
"- The wife""s the last to know."
"The co-workers know, the mailman knows, the dog knows."
"But not the wife, because it could be right there... underneath your pretty little nose, but you don""t wanna see it."
Signs of cheating.
Number one:
Changes in personal appearance.
Is hubby working out?
Shopping at The Gap?
Suddenly strutting around like Mr. Sexy?
Changes in phone habits.
Sneaking off to make calls.
Hiding the bills.
Computer obsession.
"Ask yourself, honestly, is hubby spending every waking moment..."
"logged on, so to speak?"
"Hi, honey."
Sexual changes.
From complete lack of interest to the bastard wanting sex now.
New positions.
Role-playing.
Foreplay with condiments.
"It""s really not funny."
"You being my new boss, I'm hesitant to point out that it... it might not be that easy."
Heartbeat looks normal for 10 weeks.
No evidence of bleeding from the trauma.
So the baby's okay?
Looks fine.
"Michelle, does this kind of thing happen often,"
"Darren hitting Tammy, hitting you?"
It was an accident.
I want to see my daughter.
"Michelle, look, I know this is hard to talk about, but you stabbed your husband."
"Now if you were protecting Tammy, if this was self-defen..."
"God, you're making us sound like..."
It was not like that.
Darren didn't do anything.
You don't have to make excuses.
I was cooking... and Darren and I started arguing.
"Tammy tried to stop us, and she got in the way, and Darren pushed her."
"It was an accident, but I got mad and I overreacted and I had a knife in my hand."
Please.
I need to be with Tammy.
I need to make sure she's okay.
"Okay, okay."

We have a warrant for your arrest.
What?
"No, no."
"No, officer."
Her husband hit her.
It was an accident.
"Okay, Michelle."
"No, look, she has a daughter who needs her."
She's pregnant.
Pishsalver.
Let me think.
"A pinch of worm fat, urine of the horsefly,"
buttered fingers.
My sister preferred to study Dominion Over Living Things.
(SIZZLING)
"Tell me, how does she seem to you?"
Perfectly horrid.
-And her head?
-Bulbous.
"I think she may have some kind of growth in there, something pressing on her brain."
"Three coins from a dead man's pocket, two teaspoons of wishful thinking."
You can't imagine the things that go on in that place.
"Oh, yes, I can."
"But when a champion steps forth to slay the Jabberwocky, the people will rise against her."
(SPITTING)
That should do it.
Blow.
-Feel better?
"-Much, thank you."
There's someone here who would like to speak with you.
-Absolem?
-Who are you?
(COUGHING)
I thought we'd settled this.
"I'm Alice, but not that one."
-How do you know?
-You said so yourself.
"I said you were not hardly Alice, but you're much more her now."
"In fact, you're almost Alice."
"Even so,"
I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky if my life depended on it.
To help you and Victor
He isn't safe here I know what happened to him.
"He's not the only one I don't know what you mean lf you stay, you're putting Victor at risk"
Soon people like him will be hunted lt's safer at the Helping Hand
Not a chance
Pack your things
The power could be down for a while
Do you want to go out?
No
Shall we play a game?
OK
Truth or dare?
OK
Truth
How old was I when Dad killed himself?
You weren't born
So he never saw me?
No
Did he want to die because of me?
No
Was it because of you?
It's complicated
You're too young to understand I'll ask Thomas.
At least he will tell me the truth
It's natural that you want to know
"But the truth is, I have no idea"
You don't know why he did it?
No
Was he unhappy?
"Sometimes, he was"
"Other times, he wasn't"
Why was he unhappy?
How do you know what Christine looks like in the nude?
Because we went swimming and I was in my bikini.
"This is Gerard, the writer I told you about."
He's here to work.
Well...
"Working with the whiskey bottle, by the smell of it."
"Let's go to bed, I'm dead-tired."
Tomorrow morning...!
Look at it this way... ln Germany they're in need of plumbers too.
So I set me up a business with Dutoh labor.
Pour me some more.
"And I got 5 chaps there now, all working black and drawing welfare in Holland besides."
"A lot of sugar, baby."
"And they give me no trouble, 'cause if they did I would report them to Labor Inspection."
Those ham and eggs are just the thing especially after last night.
"Really, Herman."
I mean the long drive.
"Don't be shy, Gerard's a writer."
- He's used to a thing or two.
- Stop it.
"Damn, it's empty."
I'll get a frosh pack.
The world of Peter Stuyvesant so much more to enjoy.
What do you think of him?
He's really got something.
How was it last night?
- Zilch.
- Zilch?
We hadn't met in weeks... and oopla!
He came and zonk!
Fell asleep.
Tough...
Sure!
"- So, why..."
- Huh?
Ouch!
Wh-Wh-What?
I only got closer because you were speaking softly!
Ahh...
Is this okay?
Y-Yeah.
That will do.
How did you figure it out?
"You mean, ""How did you realize that I was the person behind Eromanga-sensei""?"
Yup.
"If not, I won't ever let you in."
"When you were streaming, the meal I made for you was in the background."
"You forgot to turn the camera off, and you started taking your clothes off..."
Th-That's enough.
I get it now.
"So after all, Big Brother, you were ""Masamune Izumi-sensei""."
"""After all""?"
You had noticed?
I was just thinking you had the same name.
For it to actually be the same person...
What kind of probability is that?
To think that I've been living under the same roof as Eromanga-sensei.
I can't believe it.
And I don't know anyone by that name.
"Um, this is so sudden, and I don't know what to do."
"For starters, I'm sorry I made you draw all those lewd pictures!"
I-Idiot!
"Don't suddenly shout so loudly, idiot!"
Y-You're the idiot!
Stop trying your Yiddish out on me.
You sound like a Shakespearean actor from a Savannah pogrom.
- But do you know him?
- Sure.
But the trial was 2 years ago.
I was long gone from the department.
"Hello, Larry."
Good to see you.
This is Deputy Mayor Calhoun.
The first deputy mayor to set foot on this floor.
"We had a commissioner once, but it was the wrong floor."
- May I have a seat?
"- Please, sit."
"Abe, you're already at home here."
I think I know why you're here.
I've logged 12 calls already.
Tino Zapatti.
- You want to know why I handled it.
- Exactly.
Because sometimes we get overloaded.
And you take on the extras?
The extra-specials.
Such as Zapatti family members?
Something like that.
- Mr. Deputy Mayor...
"- ""Kevin""'s good enough."
Any case that comes here that looks like it's connected I take a special interest in.
- Why's that?
- To avoid making mistakes.
You sure made one on this.
"I blew one, okay?"
I don't mind admitting it.
"♬  Oh, we were destined  ♬"
"♬  Oh, underdone  ♬"
"That girl, Eul, doesn't know her place."
How could she linger around you?
"Noona, from your perspective,"
I think I'm better than Eul.
Of course!
"Even though you're still unemployed, you can't give yourself to Eul."
Eul is in a lot of debt and doesn't even have a great personality.
She only mooches off of you.
So that's why I'm telling you this.
"Oppa, there is a woman I know who cooks well, has enough money, and doesn't fall too far behind in terms of looks."
"I... am not good enough, Noona."
"Because I am not good enough,"
I cannot accept Eul.
"Ah, Eul left her cellphone."
So clumsy...
That oppa is not normal either.
Eul!
No Eul!
What is this?
Yes.
This is No Eul's phone.
Hello?
Why are you picking up No Eul's phone?
"We were together, and Eul left her phone behind."
- Who is the person picking up the phone?
- What about you?
Who are you?
- I asked first.
"- When you ask for someone else's identity,"
I believe you should reveal your identity first.
"And of all the cars to borrow, why mine?"
You just don't like him.
Never gave me a chance.
"This shouldn't be about Danny, it should be about us."
I care about you.
"I'm sorry, A.J."
Hi.
Did you come to take my mother to lunch?
"You screwed with me, son."
"I don't really care about that, but you're keeping your mother from being happy and you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
She is happy.
And I'm happy.
It's not our job to make you happy.
Still driving a rental car?
"I'll be sending you the bill, boy."
I never consented to marriage with Mustafa.
I accepted him only as a friend of my father's.
A friend of the family.
I spent many hours in their home.
Fatimah was always happy to see me.
I was a child.
You brought me presents.
"I thought of you as a favourite uncle, not a suitor."
Fatimah's father came to me with her promise.
- He signed the kitab.
- He signed the kitab.
I did not.
- Her father was her wali.
- Objection.
Fatimah was 18.
Her father was no longer entitled to serve as her wali without her consent.
"Thank you, Miss MacKenzie."
"You know, when I was younger, I almost got engaged but her brother talked me out of it"
Really?
What did he say?
"He said, ""Brett, you have a beautiful penis"" and..."
Dip.
Woo!
"OK, guys."
Help me out.
What should I do for my wedding?
I don't know where to begin.
"Charlotte, what did you do for your wedding?"
Was it like a fairy tale?
My wedding was exactly like a fairy tale.
"Um, once upon a time there was a princess with low self esteem..."
And terrible taste in men.
She went to Las Vegas and ate some magic beans.
Then she married an evil ogre named Mark.
"Mark put a baby in her, and ruined her credit."
"12 weeks later a wizard named Jeff, the divorce attorney, annulled her mistake."
The end.
OK.
"Um, I'm surprised."
But just so you guys know you're all going to be in my wedding party.
"Except for you, Charlotte."
- I'm sorry.
I just met you.
"- Oh, you know, that's fine."
"I'll just uh, I'll come to the next one."
"Oh, hey Bursk, Les, I'm assuming you guys want to be each other's plus ones because"
"- you know, smooch buddies."
"- No, no, stop."
No cute winks.
How deep?
Can you tell how deep it is?
"Okay, roger."
Two feet.
"Okay, roger."
Visibility's not that great.
It that the same down there?
He lost visibility because he's stirring it up.
Clouded up just like 10X.
We lost all visibility.
"Whenthewellgot murky, itwasmoreasense of ""not again."""
Another dive where we can't see anything.
BecauseI wasabsolutely convinced that ithadbeen a fitted stone bottom.
Up five feet!
All stop!
"DiverTonySampson has just found anotherpossibleclue in an old stone well, whichsomeresearchersbelieve to have been built bymembers of the Knights Templar."
That's a Broad Arrow!
I see something.
Do you guys not see that in there?
Show... show me...
show me what you're seeing.
Right there.
But when he comes at a different angle...
"Okay, okay, there I see it."
-Yep.
You see it now?
"-Yeah, yeah."
I see it there.
"Right here, here and there."
You got her.
"Whenitcametome, then I could see it."
"The left side of the point, ifyouwill, saw that well-defined."
Send him in.
"- Would you come in, Mr. Rossi?"
- Yes.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
- I'm Leslie Harrington.
This is the school board.
Mr. And Mrs. Partridge.
He's a lawyer.
Dr. Swain.
Seth Bushwell.
He's editor of the Peyton Place Times.
"Mr. Rossi, here's our situation."
We're prepared to offer the job as principal to a qualified man with a minimum guaranteed five-year contract.
"Mr. Rossi is a graduate of Penn State, summa cum laude."
He holds a master's degree in English and literature.
He was an outstanding athlete.
He's single.
"Personally, now that I've seen him, I like what I see."
- Did I miss anything?
- I've been working in construction.
"If you're a teacher, why were you working there?"
I couldn't live on the salary of a teacher.
This job starts at 3000 a year.
Then we're all wasting our time.
That's only $5 a week more than I was making as a teacher.
But this offers you security.
A long-term contract.
Guaranteed poverty is not security.
I want 5000 a year and a raise of 500 in the second year.
- We can't do it.
- You own this mill.
Surely a few hours' sleep wouldn't--
Contact me if you find anything else.
[Solemn instrumental music]
"-Is there a problem, Corporal?"
"-No, ma'am."
-Why are you guarding this chamber?
-Captain's orders.
[Solemn instrumental music continues]
-Lieutenant Reed's report.
-What?
You requested a tactical analysis of the Insectoid ship.
Later.
ARCHER:
Are we ready?
TRIP:
"Just a few seconds, Captain."
T'POL:
There are two macos posted outside.
I asked Major Hayes to assign them.
These eggs are vulnerable.
There are breaches in the outer hull.
ARCHER:
There could be predators around.
"Aside from microbes, we found no evidence of life on this planet."
ARCHER:
Trip.
TRIP:
We're ready.
"Start at 40 megajoules, but keep an eye on that matrix converter."
Take it up to 50.
Trip?
ARCHER:
"Sometimes, when I have these stress dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I come out of it."
"""This is not a dream."""
"Tracy Jordan is in New York today, Liz."
I'd like you to have lunch with him.
"We have a show tonight, Mr. Donaghy."
"I don't know if your research covered this, but we do a dress rehearsal and then a live show."
That's tonight.
This is lunch.
"If it's not a good fit, I'll drop the whole thing."
"If I meet with Tracy Jordan and we mutually agree that this is the worst idea ever, you'll back off?"
I'm known for being reasonable.
[Sighs]
Okay.
"Alfredo, 2:00 P. M."
I'm not dressed for that.
You're dressed for Burger King.
Should we make it Burger King?
"Pete, hang back for me."
"Yeah, you bet."
"Y'all, please set yourselves for ""Dr. Ridiculous."""
Hey.
What happened to your head?
The sky is falling.
Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow?
"Thank you, Lee."
Whatever.
"Hey, you know in that cat-lady sketch, do I have to hold a real cat?"
Cat-lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.
"Oh, good."
Who's that?
That is the new network dude.
"Yes, we'll analyze it."
- So I'll come back next week?
- Excellent.
- My pleasure.
- Good-bye.
- What are you doing here?
- I was just leaving.
Don't freak out.
I just wanted to see you.
But I'm harmless.
Dr.Roncero's office.
"Hi, Lola."
I've just taken an elephant-sized dump.
One and two and three.
Forward and hold.
Can you take over?
Alicia never came back.
"I didn't want to scare her again, so I didn't go to her house until a week later, when I had to see her father."
It rained all week.
The next time I saw her was here.
What happened to her?
A car accident on one of those rainy days.
"Her father didn't want her to be alone for a minute, day or night."
"He asked for the best nurses,"
"I've got a very good reputation here, and they recommended me."
"When he saw me, he remembered that we'd met and he'd a moment of doubt, but he ended up hiring Matilde and me exclusively."
That was four years ago.
And here we are.
"Right, Alicia?"
I started going to the ballet on my days off.
And to the Cinematheque.
I try to see all the silent movies.
[Sirens wailing]
Where's O'Malley?
- Pukin'.
- Pukin'?
"Yeah, it was pretty bad."
"One of them was still alive when we got here, even though the rats had eaten off half his face."
"Another psycho killer, just what we needed around here."
Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch.
What do you mean?
Somebody offed some of the ghetto ghouls?
Is that what this bullshit's about?
You check it out.
I'll see ya down at the station house.
See ya later.
"Hey, Dalton, you want a TV?"
[Police radio chatter]
[Sirens wailing]
"Hey, Stevie, I don't wanna keep you awake or anything, you know."
Thank you very much!
"Hey, Stevie, it ain't so bad!"
"Yeah, let's go."
"Swing it in there, Steve!"
These comics are terrible.
"Whatever happened to ""moon mullins,""."
"""Maggie and Jake,"" and ""buck Rodgers?"""
"Do you remember ""buck Rodgers?"""
"Nah, you don't remember ""buck Rodgers."""
"I just spoke to Washington, and they're..."
shh!
"Excuse us, hon'."
We got a little business to talk over.
Why don't you finish your breakfast out by the pool?
- Just a little something.
"- Okay, okay."
"I, uh..."
I'll call back Joe Glynn at the Times.
He's okay.
He'll write it up well.
I once leaked him some shit about Buchanan.
Damn near won him the Pulitzer.
"- Thanks, Dad."
- Sure.
Thanks.
"What would you do, or have done, in my case?"
"Well, when your president asks you to jump... it's hard not to jump, that's for sure."
But you remember what Ben Franklin said about the vice presidency.
What did he say?
I didn't talk to him this week.
"He said he ought to be addressed as ""Your Superfluous Excellency."""
"In the past ten years, I've enjoyed the kind of power the vice presidency can't offer."
Why would anybody want to give that up?
Am I crazy?
"Baby, power is where power goes."
- Think you can beat me?
"- Uh, yeah."
Okay.
"Hey, Tony!"
Foul!
Can't trust those fuckin' people.
"Speaking of which, Mr. Webster, it turns out you're a Democrat."
"I, uh, wasn't keeping it a secret."
"Sad to say, I don't think I can bring you aboard the committee, son."
Ray Spies makes all the decisions regarding the other party.
- It's a courtesy.
You the one that's hurting him.
[Parnell] I ain't got time for this shit.
"You okay, baby?"
They said it would be more fun than a Ferris wheel.
They said?
"I ain't always gon' be here, so you listen up good, you hear?"
"They two kind of people out there, discerners and fools."
Discerner know the difference between what people say and what people mean.
Fools...only hear what they want to hear.
You got to know the difference out there.
"You hear me, Adam?"
"How I know, Mama?"
You watch they eyes.
"A mouth smile easy, but not eyes."
"[Al] So my wife's new husband is younger, better looking, better job, bigger dick... [laughter] ...nicer car."
Why would she leave me?
Just because I made noise when I chew?
"Well, she made noise when she chewed-- his cock in my bed."
[laughter]
Hey.
[Al] The kids were home.
[laughter]
"Hey, keep it tight."
Haul ass offstage when you see that light.
[Al] I'm back in the dating world.
- [Al] Nobody knows.
"- Man, look."
"About the other night, I'm sorry."
"Okay, you were cool and I wasn't."
It won't happen again.
It's disrespectful to the next comic when you running the light.
Disrespect for who?
Don't you remember about going to the beach?
"Arrizaga, Alonso, Adbinu, Arza..."
I still know it!
"No, please, don't name the whole list."
-Arostegui...
Arostegui comes before Arza!
You're right.
I'm sure I couldn't recognize any of them.
"Arostegui, Arza, De Blas..."
I remember a lot of soccer team lineups.
The Italian one was beautiful.
"Lupo, Taviani, Becattini,.."
"Estébanez, Estremianas..."
Who were the next to Estremianas?
Alcón!
Maybe I know the class list better!
What time is it?
It's 12:15.
-I haven't called Laura yet.
Be right back.
Julian and I were close friends.
"When you're young, you meet friends everyday and then they vanish."
Don't you get bored with our silliness?
-No.
How long didn't you guys see each other?
We met by coincidence the other day.
Apart from that...
Maybe 10 years or more...
You also named that list back then?
I hope not.
The last thing I remember is we were really drunk.
At dawn we decided to look for an old mutual girlfriend.
Hi.
I'm Michael Gallant from Psychiatry.
Stella Willits from Ohio.
Nice shiner.
I understand you have quite a few medical complaints.
- I'll need to ask you a few questions.
"- Knock yourself out, hon."
Had any recent weight gain?
I've been thinking about going on the Zone.
- How about dry skin?
- Like the Sahara.
Here.
Give me this.
"""Intolerance to cold."" Yes. ""Arthritis, sore muscles, constipation."" Yes, yes, and yes."
""" Fatigue. "" Well, I have been kind of low-energy lately."
You have some delayed relaxation from the deep-tendon reflexes.
What about depression?
- Me?
- Yeah.
"No, I'm glass-half-full, I'm silver-lining girl."
I'm an optimist.
"Listen, I'll be back to finish."
I guess I do get a little blue sometimes.
Get this gurney out of the way.
"If you haven't talked to anyone, you need to go back to the nurse in Triage."
Your food poisoning in Exam 4's been here for 11 hours-
- Waiting on a consult.
- From the Naked Chef?
He ate bad shrimp.
- Can I get something for my skin?
"- Yeah, sun block."
Can I talk about Stella Willits?
Was it all genuine?
- When may we expect your brother?
- Edward is due tomorrow.
He will not stay long.
Will Margaret give up her room for him?
"The view is incomparable, and I want him to see Norland at its best."
Mrs. Dashwood.
Miss Dashwood.
Miss Marianne.
"My brother, Edward Ferrars."
Do sit down.
Where is Miss Margaret?
I'm beginning to doubt of her existence.
"Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars."
My youngest is shy of strangers at present.
"I am shy of strangers myself, and I have nothing like her excuse."
"How do you like your view, Mr. Ferrars?"
Very much.
Your stables are handsome and beautifully kept.
Stables?
Your windows overlook the lake.
"An error led me to a family room, but I've rectified the situation."
I am happily installed in the guest quarters.
Tea!
They're all spoilt.
Miss Margaret is always up trees and under furniture.
I've barely had a civil word from Marianne.
They've just lost their father.
Their lives will never be the same.
That is no excuse.
Library.
- These are mostly foreign.
Right?
"Now, if you want to see the most unpleasant side of me,"
Have another person come up the steps.
"But I'm a nasty, horrible guy."
"I'm not worried about-- right, you guys"
Are the sensitive young people.
"You're worried about-- you know, seriously, come on."
Wake up.
"I'm not gonna screw around, man, when it comes"
"To the people whose little babies are coming through here,"
I don't care.
MAN:
"Yeah, I'm making a sign."
You can dislike me all you want.
But I'm sorry.
I've been here for an hour.
I've been asking for some kind of polite system
Of the Poughkeepsie-vilians to go around.
They're perfectly willing.
They don't want to go through here.
"You don't want people falling on cables, right,"
Especially little tiny babies.
MAN:
I got it.
"Yeah, well I didn't think you got it, because it's"
Like the eighth time.
"So until it gets done, I'm gonna keep being unpleasant,"
Which I'm pretty good at.
And have somebody here.
"Whatever it takes, right."
MAN:
I think we're--
Not really.
"Yeah,real."
"You've been dropping a lot ofash lately,mcgee."
"New phone,new watch,new teeth."
What'up?
Ducky matched the dental records.
The body downstairs is lance corporal finn.
"Ziva,when did you..."
"Mcgee,how long does it take to put on a clean shirt?"
Ten conds.
"With buttons,a little longer."
Rhetorical question.
Contractor's off the hook.
He's been out of town for a week.
Going to check on the real estate agents this morning.
- That's all you did?
- No.
"While you and mcgee were watching the sunrise, I was pulling lance corporal finn's srb."
And I would have to say it was spotty.
He was unc' on the range and failed his swiqual.
- So they de him a supply clerk.
- Right.
"Six months ago,he signed out on a three-day pass before deploying to iraq and he never returned home."
- Get me his C.O.
- He's in iraq.
I'll contact mtac.
"I put in a request for finn's bank records, earning statements and medical records."
Night wasn't a total loss.
Ground radar picked up a shol about ten feet from the gravesite.
Already sent it to abby.
Yep.
The old gibbs is back
"Mousy, stop."
He's dead.
I killed Painted Face!
I killed Painted Face!
Mousy!
I am not in training to enter the Iron Man contest.
A guy'd have to be crazy to do that.
"I have enough cash to pay your salary for one day, so I gotta have results in 24 hours."
- Wah!
- Come on.!
Come on.!
"- T.M., I gotta get you dry, man."
"- T.C., you're killing me."
"Come on, Magnum.!"
Who's he?
"Oh, this is a private investigator..."
- A cop?
- I'm making a citizen's arrest.
Magnum!
Magnum.!
Hawaii is like every sensual woman I've ever known.
"She can have raging, violent bursts of temper, followed by incredible calm and peacefulness."
Today was one of those days of true serenity... when even the great tourist wave seems to recede.
"I mean, I couldn't believe the stillness."
"Man, business stinks."
"Hi, guys."
Hi.
"Rick, what's the exact time right now?"
"You know, everybody's on the mainland."
"Nobody even cares if my chopper's sittin' there gettin' rusty, just eatin' money."
"Rick, the time!"
And he was right.
Those years are gone and my chance with them.
"I'll leave tonight, Sarah Beth."
But I'm not sorry I came now because I'll take something back with me which means a great deal to me.
The knowledge that he has you.
"You to fight for him, be there when he needs you."
To be what I wasn't strong enough to be.
He didn't come to St. Louis for nothing.
"And now when he's lost it all, everything when he needs something human at last you'll come into the field."
"No, he didn't come to St. Louis for nothing."
"And all at once, that gives me peace a kind of happiness even."
I haven't felt that for a very long time.
Just one thing.
"Some night when he's sitting on the porch, Sarah Beth, give him a kiss from me."
"Don't, Mother."
Don't.
"I'm glad you're home, colonel."
Buckboard with Sarah Beth get in;
I missed seeing her start.
"Maybe you'd better go on in the house, colonel."
jim:
Sarah Beth;
"-Papa, come here."
"Mother wanted to be waiting for you here, Papa."
The way she used to be.
Lutie.
You're well;
"Yes, Jim."
And you;
You look as you always did.
"Do I, Jim;"
Papa.
* When you are mine
(CLEARING THROAT)
"Hello, Aunt Nancy."
"Hello, Willy."
Why aren't you inside dancing?
"Oh, I am dancing inside."
"I mean, inside I'm dancing."
I know what you mean.
That's very grown-up.
"Uh, can I ask you a question?"
"That's ungrammatical, but tonight's a holiday."
What is it?
"Well, do you believe in love at first sight?"
"Willy, you've fallen in love with one of the girls here, haven't you?"
Uh-huh.
"Does she love you, too?"
"Well, she's very fond of me, and she thinks I have a very fine and sensitive spirit."
So do I.
You tell her I said you'd make a fine husband when the time comes.
I think the time's coming.
"Nancy, I think you're the most wonderful girl"
"I ever met in my whole life, and I haven't slept a wink since I kissed you."
"Willy, little boys don't talk like that."
"Yes, I know, and I never could talk to girls."
"I mean, I usually get very tongue-tied when I'm around girls."
But not when I'm around you.
That's very sweet.
"I'm very grateful, but..."
"Willy, I'm too old for you."
My mom and dad got married when she was 17.
"Yes, that's different."
That's old enough for a girl to get married.
"Charlotte's fifth birthday would be like, right?"
- What are you talking about?
"- When Cookie rolls up, like, piñatas aplenty, everyone will be like,"
"""Hey, Cookie's here!"""
You wanna slow your roll?
'Cause that's not gonna happen.
They're not gonna last.
"She's like the perfect physical specimen, and he's just, you know, Bruce."
"It makes now sense at all, and, at the same time, it kind of makes all the sense in the world."
"I mean, look at them."
Like two hippos wrestling in the wild.
"Oh, that's a classic viper hold into a Chinese handcuff."
[phone buzzing]
Man.
We learned that two weeks ago.
"God, she's good."
"Oh, we didn't learn that one."
We should not be watching this.
And I am all alone. [sighs]
"Officer Rodriguez, at your service."
"Mark, what are you doing here?"
I'm being spontaneous.
"I slipped in through the window, ""Dawson's Creek"" style."
"- No, you didn't."
"- Oh, yes, I did."
"You better come over here, girl, 'cause I don't wanna wait."
There is a former MMA fighter named Cookie downstairs.
"Well, then we're gonna have to be quiet, huh?"
[both moaning]
Hmm.
You know what?
You know what?
My God!
How could they think threatical vehicles as words can express... what Lacroix is all about?
Don't they get it?
Don't they understand?
He's not about a dictionary... he's about spirit!
"Oh, God!"
"Spirit, spirit, spirit!"
Any messages?
A fax is coming in.
From Europe!
Paris studios.
Carl Lagerfeld to... the Editor in Chief.
I have a fax for the Editor in Chief.
The Editor in Chief is waiting for it.
You can go in.
"I'm sorry to interrupt, I have a fax for you."
Okay.
Thanks.
"The work is piling up, and I really should be getting to it."
"I have to retype a roll of decks, get tea, pick up a huge garment... bag, anyway, the xerox machine awaits me."
"So, now you know the people on staff aren't really snobs."
They're just better than everybody else is.
Is it enough?
"- That was great, thank you ."
- Let me know when it's on.
I can watch in my time off on Channel 13.
"Thanks a lot, kiddo."
Hang in there.
It seems like a pretty tough place to work.
"Hey, Paul."
These are the photos for the acessory page.
She's gonna come here and show you exactly how she wants them.
"Oh, my god."
"Sean.Sean, you all right?"
"Holy shit, mike, he's pissing blood."
"All right, call an ambulance."
Sean?
"- Hey, franc."
- Hey.
Lot of iron on that bar.
"What is that, 200, 240?"
"Oh, I don't know, maybe 280 on a good day."
"Animale, this kid, huh?"
Yeah.
"Got a proposition for you, franco."
Yeah?
"Well, I'm very flattered, lou, but I don't believe in gay marriage."
- Hilarious.
- This kid cracks me up.
"No.Now look, we saw you beating the heavy bag into submission the other day."
"We were wondering, maybe you ever thought about stepping into the ring."
- Boxing?
"- No, bullfighting."
What are you doing?
"Look, I cornered a couple of fighters back in the day, and i think you got potential."
- You got a thunderous left.
"- Thanks, lou."
"You, uh, you used to be a boxing trainer?"
"Yeah, indeed I was."
I took joltin' joel johansson to the department title back in '86.
He had a brief but minorly successful golden gloves run.
No shit.
You guys talking about slow joel johansson?
"Want to mind your business, tommy?"
- What about supper?
- Don't worry about me.
I'II have a fiddle in the shed.
We'II get a takeaway later.
"He's weII-buiIt, your Jeremy."
Bet things can get quite rough when you two play hunt the hairy hot dog.
"Joyce, at last."
camilla Diamond.
LiIIian Gordon-Moore.
"I Iike your sweater, Joyce."
- Oh.
- I'm fond of cats myself.
"The Wicker Barn, lillian."
Pronto.
The old town was built in 1647 and I think some of the residents can remember back that far.
"- Oh, the cricket green looks lovely."
"- Ah, yes."
My husband Stuart plays.
He's a very aggressive bowler but very frisky afterwards.
You can get everything you need from this one parade of shops.
shirley Thompson flowers.
Bit low rent.
Uses her own excrement to fertilise the pot plants but I can get you a discount on everything except shrubs.
And what have we here?
"Ah, yes."
The Wicker Barn.
Mm.
"Used to sell gorgeous, hessian pIacemats."
- till it tragically burnt down.
- It looks fine to me.
"hold this and press that little red button, would you, Joyce?"
Looks like they're closing early tonight.
Blake?
(melissa) I've caught blake and holly
One-on-one several times.
"(blake) when melissa walks in,"
That's not really the threesome I had in mind.
(jake) everybody will eventually stab you in the back
"For $250,000."
"(gia) this is (bleep), this game."
Graham backstabbed me.
(crying) I'm not losing my friend
Because of something I did.
You guys all had a preconceived notion of who I was.
"Honest to god, I really think it's (bleep)."
(crying) just tell me what happened.
You're okay.
(woman) this is crazy.
Everything is about to change here tonight.
"(erica) oh, my god."
"Oh, my god."
"It's all coming up right now on ""bachelor pad."""
(woman) that was the most shocking exit
"In ""bachelor pad"" history."
(kasey) I have control of this game.
Justin and alli were both going back and forth to both sides.
They had to go home.
(erica) I felt bad for alli a little bit.
"She looked sad like she was, like, fighting tears."
"(kasey) if you don't choose a side,"
You're gonna get canceled.
(woman) she went out gracefully.
She did.
"(kasey) 2 down, 16 to go."
-lt is a war after all.
-Yes.
- Everything is all right.
-You know I was going to face a real war.
I prepared myselffor hardships or even death.
And we live in the headquarters like in paradise.
We sleep on beds.
As ifthere were no war around.
"We drink milk, listen to birds, walk around with boys like you."
"Everything is as usual, do you understand?"
-The offensive is to start soon.
- Really?
"-Olya, can I have a look in the gunsight?"
-You'll survive without that.
"You know, Kolya, a real marksman never makes two shots from the same place."
And this guy does everything the otherway.
-He way not be a real ace after all.
"- No, he is."
He seems to play hide-and-seek with me.
He seems to say:
""" lfyou are smart - look for me."
He must have about five secure firing positions here.
This one is the fourth one.
And your canister shot was made from the last one.
-What?
- Forthe first time you...
-What?
-You smiled...
-At last. I see his position.
-Where is he?
-At last orthe life was becoming boring..
-Where is he?
Who do you think you are?
"Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go."
That was the deal.
"The deal was you fix the road, not make it worse."
"Now, scrape it off!"
Start over again.
"Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer."
I'm a racecar.
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Is that right?
Then why don't we just have a little race?
Me and you.
- What?
- Me and you.
That a joke?
"If you win, you go and I fix the road."
"If I win, you do the road my way."
"Doc, what're you doin'?"
"I don't mean to be rude here, but you probably go zero to sixty in, like, what?"
Three-point-five years?
Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
"You know what, old-timer?"
That's a wonderful idea.
Let's race.
"Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race."
"You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back."
"There will be no bumping', no cheatin', no spitting', no biting', no road rage, no maiming', no oil slickin', no pushing', no shoving', no backstabbing', no road-hoggin',"
and no lollygaggin'.
Speed.
I'm speed.
"Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer."
"My friend Guido, he dream to give a real racecar a pit stop."
How could you do such a thing?
"No, I don't want that one!"
I want Mario!
He's too ugly.
- Shut up!
"- No, Mario!"
"Don't worry, Sir, I'll handle it."
- I want Mario!
"Mario, it was me!"
I found him!
It was your Quirino!
"If it were up to the lawyers, you'd never get out!"
I did it!
"- Mama, are you OK?"
The Tribunal.
Mama.
"- Oh, God, here we go."
"Oh God, what now!"
"In the name of the Italian people, by article 479 of the Criminal Code, this tribunal acquits.."
"- Valeria, did you hear?"
Acquitted!
".. of the Code for not having committed the deed, and orders the immediate release if not detained for another reason."
- Mario!
"In this moment, I must inform Mario De Santis, who is present of having incriminated himself.."
"- What, Sir!"
- Nothing.
.. the crime of autocalumny!
"Autocalumny, what's that?"
"- Don't worry, it's a misdemeanor of 1-3 years."
"Because having confessed before this Court, he blamed himself for the crime of bigamy, which he knew had never happened."
This is the warrant.
- The warrant?
I had already decided I was gonna leave my husband.
-I just had to wait for... -your father to die.
"-When you say it,it sounds horrible."
"-Well,yeah.It is."
"If dad knew I was getting a divorce, he'd have disowned me."
She inherited $2 million last month when dad died.
Ah... how about if you were a murderer?
I didn't kill james.
You buried him.
No.
I did not even know that he was dead.
I will admit that we had a fight.
"James wanted to borrow money... and I refused,and he got angry,and... and he said that we were throug he got up to leave."
I just wanted m to stay.
"I,uh... took his cigarettes."
-Give 'em back!
-No!
-Now!
No!
-Not unless you promisemes!
"I just got in my car,and I drove for hours."
"I came back to-to check on him, to see if he was okay,but..."
"-he was dead,so you buried him."
-No.
James was gone.
"I thought that he was fine, until I went to that house for the showing the other day."
And there he was.
And I could only think of one explanation.
It was the hand of god.
Can gibbs arrest god?
I don't know it's like the thing tryg to bring in the hulk.
She's telling the truth.
"So, um, can I get anybody a drink or--"
"Okay, you need to tell her."
"Um, tell her--"
"About you, about me, about everything."
"You know, I'm really sorry."
I have no idea what he expects you to do.
"Monroe, you need to show her what a Blutbad is."
"Okay, I-- you want to explain to me how we suddenly arrived at this crucial crux kind of a zenith pinnacle moment?"
Juliette got scratched by a cat.
"Um, well, that's too bad, but I'm not sure how that qualifies--"
- The cat belongs to Adalind.
- Oh.
That's actually not so good.
And I took her to the trailer.
- Adalind?
"- No, Juliette."
"I-I showed her everything, I told her everything."
She thinks I'm crazy.
"Ho, okay."
"So we're just kind of jumping out of the old airplane without a parachute here, huh?"
"Monroe, you're my last chance."
You have to do this.
Nick.
Enough.
"Juliette, I don't care if you believe me anymore."
- I'm just worried about you.
- You're worried about me?
You don't understand what Adalind is capable of.
I'm going home.
This is ridiculous.
"[Sighs] Okay, okay."
Just give me a second to get into it.
"Sorry, I already set the alarm for the night."
"But, Sadie!"
"I've been gone so long, and all the food in our house went bad."
And I'm just starving.
"Um, I think fish Pizza is still open."
I don't know if I'm hungry enough for a meal.
But you're starving?
"No, I'm dying!"
Blegh!
"Well, if you're dead now,"
I guess you can't come by tomorrow.
I won't be dead then!
What happens tomorrow?
"If you didn't know, we started baking our own donuts after that workplace-safety lawsuit got thrown out."
"So if you get here tomorrow right when the shop opens, you can have the very first, fresh donut of the day."
What an honor!
"First thing tomorrow, I'll be here right when the store opens to taste your first delicious donut of the day!"
"Yeah, sure."
"Later, Steven!"
[ Alarm clock beeping ]
"Mm, 6:55 A.M."
That should give me enough time to get to the big donut right when it opens at 7:00.
"And I can start another beautiful, Beach City day."
[ Sighs ]
It feels so good to be home.
"Hello, Beach City!"
It's great to be back!
Whoa!
I jumped super high!
I didn't know I could do that!

"Oh, my gosh!"
But you don't seem to care.
Who cares about a bunch of nurses powdering their noses?
"When are we gonna get those new movies you promised, huh?"
- [ All Clamoring ]
"- Patience, everybody."
Patience.
"At this very moment, an emissary is tracking down one of Hollywood's finest."
"- Oh, yeah."
Sure.
- Here comes Mr. Show Business now.
"Any luck, ""Shobe""?"
"So far, the only nibble is a movie called Terror in the Tiny Town."
It's a Western with an all-midget cast.
"- Oh, great."
"What do we do, show it on a pillowcase?"
- With selected tall subjects.
I'm serious.
It's a real movie.
You guys stink.
Who wants to see a shrimp cowboy?
[ All Clamoring ]
You want a morale problem?
What about mine?
"- The food in this place is disgusting, right?"
- [ All ] Right!
"- Well, I don't cook it, right?"
- Right!
But who has to stand over this slop every day... and listen to everybody's gripes and dumb jokes about it?
- Who?
- Me!
"Well, I've had it!"
"If you don't like the swill here, talk to the cook!"
"And ""net"" means they'll be weighed in the nude and after... having gone through their morning routine."
I understand...
- Mr. Eduardo.
- General.
I assume that you understand that this little transaction... will cost the American taxpayers... 50 thousand dollars in exchange for 20 tons of enemy flesh.
You don't want to pay?
He doesn't think this price is democratic.
Isn't democratic?
I hope the newspapers don't learn about this.
How is it not democratic?
Officers and soldiers cost the same thing.
- The same price...
"- Yes, yes, I understand, I understand."
"Ask him, how much would Hitler be?"
- What did he say?
- He's asking how much Hitler would cost.
"Ah, thank you."
Hitler...
Tell him that with the Fifth Battalion marching on Rome... the price is falling ever day.
It's the Fifth Battalion's fault the price is falling.
- That's amusing.
- Very well.
"Sir, the photographers."
They're waiting outside.
Let them in.
Is he signing?
Come in gentlemen.
"Mr. Eduardo, a group photo."
- This way.
- Yes.
- Is someone looking for Febo?
- Yes.
And did I mention that Kain Frazier and I scrimmaged together at the rink?
He's good.
It's date night.
Riley and Shayne sitting on the couch...
Just drop it guys.
"Look, I'm staying home, all right?"
"You totally have to go, man."
"Baker's goofy, but she's hot."
"I don't know, man."
"Like, if Tweaker gets in that candy, man, he's like a werewolf at full moon."
"Okay, give some credit to A-train and Big Daddy Precious."
We could take care of this house.
No worries.
- Just one thing in return.
- Details.
K-l-S-S-l-N-G
"- Hey, entrez vous."
- Here.
I hand-picked them from Precious' flower garden.
Thanks.

"Go, go!"
I'll die if I have to!
You still have a lot to learn.
Keep practicing
"Y es, Master!"
"Gao Jian, are you here to learn martial arts?"
"Master, I don't think he'd learn anything"
But even if he did so it's useless
Useless?
"Because, Master, he looks down on our school!"
Don't make things up!
Come here!
"Gao Jian, how long have you studied here?"
About three years
So you should know the stances they've just shown
Could you demonstrate
Master
I doubt if you can manage even one
One stance and he's finished
"Master, please!"
See?
He's useless!
"Master, you see!"
"Gao Jian, where did you learn this from?"
I...
I made it up
"Okay, show me some more!"
Please!
"Master, the ""flying light as a butterfly"""

Buckley?
I don't care that you lied.
I cared that you lied to us.
There wasn't enough money.
Ellis wanted me to back to Wales.
Do you want me to compare to Mr.Blitz?
I'm sorry.
Well his partner would be relieved.
"His wife, Mary, she's an invalid."
"He pays for a nurse in the day, but he has to sit with her himself at night."
"When I told him, you wanted more than Ministry wages, he was worried you would find yourself in a similar position,"
With your husband Spanish War and all.
Should I...do you want me to come in tomorrow?
How would that help losing you?
Who the bloody hell do you think is going to be running the slob?
"The work's good, Mrs.Cole. You do a good job."
Oh!
Oh.
Hello Catrin.
Hello.
Hello.
"I mean, someone gave it to me."
Who?
"Um, I think his name was Alan or Adam, something like that."
Where or when did he give you the chip?
I'll tell you if you give me Elton John tickets.
Done.
"Okay, well, like, let's see 'em."
"Elton John, front row, tomorrow night."
Ah!
"Like, talk."
I remember his name-Alex.
Alex.
Great.
"Um, when did he give you the chip?"
"Well, see, I was over by the fountains, you know, at the Bellagio, and when I left, this guy Alex sees me, like, a couple of blocks away and he's like,"
"""I saw you over by the fountains."
"Where are you staying?"""
"And he's kinda hot, so I'm like, ""the Montecito."""
"Um, where did he give you the chip?"
- Here.
- Here?
- In your room?
"- Well, like, we had drinks at Pure."
"And then he's like, ""Do you want to go back to your room?"""
"And I'm kinda drunk, so I'm like, ""Okay."""
"And then after we hook up, he goes, ""Here,"" ya know, with the chip."
"And I'm like, ""I'm so not that type of a girl."""
"And he's like, ""I know."
"I just, like, like you, so I'm giving you this."""
Completely believable.
Did Alex say he had to leave because he had an early morning meeting he had to get up for?
Yeah.
Which is exactly what the Nazis are looking for.
What does this Ark look like?
Uh...
There's a picture of it right here.
That's it.
Good God.
"Yes, that's just what the Hebrews thought."
"Uh... now, what's that supposed to be coming out of there?"
Lightning... fire... power of God or something.
I'm beginning to understand
Hitler's interest in this.
"Oh, yes."
"The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains, and laying waste to entire regions."
An army which carries the Ark before it... is invincible.
"You did it, didn't you?"
They want you to go for it.
"Oh, Marcus!"
They want you to get ahold of the Ark before the Nazis do and they're prepared to pay handsomely for it.
And the museum?
The museum gets the Ark when we're finished?
"Oh, yes."
Oh...
The Ark of the Covenant.
Nothing else has come close.
That thing represents everything we got into archaeology for in the first place.
Mmm!
"You know, five years ago, I would've gone after it myself."
I'm really rather envious.
I've got to locate Abner.
I think I know where to start.
Suppose she'll still be with him?
"Possibly, but..."
"You think you hate it now, but wait `tiII you drive it."
I don`t want to drive it.
"I just want my old car back, okay?"
I`m not falling for this bit.
No way.
"Let`s go, Russ."
"clark, is that the right car?"
"No, it isn`t, honey."
I changed my mind.
They flattened our old car like a pancake.
Are you serious?
"Is this really our car, Dad?"
What happened?
I thought we were going to get the little Sportswagon.
"Oh, no!"
The Sportswagon`s much too small.
"Besides, I got a great deal on this one."
"If we`re taking the whole tribe cross-country believe me, this is your automobile."
Why is it still running?
"Oh, all new cars do that."
I`II take care of that in a second.
"You may think you hate it now, but wait until you drive it."
An air bag!
"You know, clark, it`s not too late to fly out to california."
We only have two weeks.
"Let`s not get into that again, sweetie pie."
please?
"Lots of families fly, clark."
especially cross-country.
The whole idea of a family vacation is to be together as a family.
"On a plane, you put on earphones and you`re lost in your own world."
"It`s a very long ride, clark."
I don't know anyone who fits that description.Doctor's ethics.
"If you knew, you wouldn't tell?"
"No, I probably wouldn't."
"Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California, no less was put in jail for not telling the police what he knew about a patient."
Is that a threat?
"No, I mention it only in passing."
"Incidentally, I mention it only in passing I could always tell the judge it was a matter of confession."
"Father, wait a minute!"
-Do you like movies?
-Very much.
"Well, I get passes to the best shows in town."
"Mrs. K, you know, she gets tired, never likes to go."
That's too bad.
I hate to go alone.
"I love to talk film discuss, to critique."
You want to see a film with me?
I've got passes to the Crest.
It's Othello.
Who's in it?
Debbie Reynolds:
Desdemona and Othello:
Groucho Marx.
Are you happy?
I've seen it.
One last time.
Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Come on!
"No, answer the question, Father Paranoia."
All right.
You know who I think really did it?
Who?
The Dominicans.
No.
Fredo's in the house with Mama.
He asked for you and Tom said you wouldn't see him.
That's right.
"Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?"
"Please, I want to talk to you."
"Michael, I hated you for so many years."
"I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you'd know"
that I could hurt you.
"You were just being strong for all of us, the way Papa was."
And I forgive you.
Can't you forgive Fredo?
"He's so sweet, and helpless without you."
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.
Connie.
"Tom, sit down."
"Our friend and business partner, Hyman Roth, is in the news."
-Did you hear about it?
-I hear that he's in Israel.
The High Court in Israel turned down his request to live there.
"His passport's been invalidated, except to return here."
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.
He offered them a million dollars if they'd let him live there.
-They turned him down.
-He's going to try Panama.
Panama won't take him.
"Not for a million, not for ten million."
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.
He's had the same heart attack for 20 years.
-That plane goes to Miami.
That's reassuring.
Thanks.
(CONTINUES GRUNTING)
"You know, I hope what he's paying you feels worth it."
I don't work for him.
I work for the British government.
He's my prisoner.
I've been arrested for trafficking arms...
Weapons I was sending to save you.
"So, I...struck a new deal."
We help get you out...
And he gives us valuable information about a terrorist.
Which he knows about how?
(CRYING) And you expect me to be grateful?
"Well, at least you got your money back."
"That's something, eh?"
(PHONE RINGING)
(PHONE BEEPS ON) RICHMOND: (ON PHONE) Colonel.
We're picking up smoke trails at the water hole at Bir an Natrun.
The heat map indicates some sort of explosion.
"If Stonebridge has managed to engage the Janjaweed, then this would fit that scenario."
"All right, send through the image."

SCOTT:
Oh.
Uh...
Let me see.
That's not nothing.
I'm glad I know that too.
"I mean, that you love him."
"If I hated him, I'd be all right, then we could walk down the street together and I wouldn't mind feeling him cringe, never let on."
I should've gone away from here a long time ago.
But he's hard to leave.
-Now I gotta get out of here fast.
"-Don't run away, Brock."
"Mr. McCurtin could get you off, couldn't he;"
"Oh, sure, easy."
Jury wouldn't even leave its box.
-Then face it like Papa wants you to.
"-Ever been to a trial, Sarah Beth;"
Lots of things come out of trials.
Whole mess comes out.
Salt Fork would eat this up with a spoon.
And he's had enough.
"Go on, Sarah Beth, sit down and play a tune by yourself."
You'll have to get used to it.
And tell the colonel nothing.
Jeff said McCurtin was here.
What'd he want;
-Nothing.
-Where you going;
-First lap on my trip to Denver.
"-Get down off that horse, Brock."
Get out of my way.
"Well, Sarah Beth, I'll try to understand why he had to go."
I didn't try with someone else a long time ago.
I've always been sorry.
"Well, colonel, then if Brock ain't here, we just gotta find him and take him in."
-Why;
-l thought McCurtin told you.
I have to tell him something.
I'm expecting John any minute.
There's been another murder.
In Indiana.
Indiana?
Is there something you want to tell me?
"No, nothing."
The smell on the killer's hands... it's surgical soap.
He must take it with him.
He washes his hands with surgical soap... to get rid of the blood.
I don't like this.
Nina Getz was my patient for many years.
The man has killed 3 people.
A donor's identity is strictly confidential.
Here it is.
Leslie Davison.
"OK, follow me here."
Frank's victim...
Margaret Tattersall... had a kidney transplant 2 months ago.
So?
Our victim...
Nina Getz... had skin grafts from an organ donor... about 2 months ago.
Valerie Wheaton never had a transplant.
"No, but the woman who lived below her did."
"Emma Brody... she had a corneal transplant... and, it turns out... her apartment number is listed incorrectly... on her medical records."
This guy meant to kill Emma Brody.
Holy fuck!
OK.
"So you got the letters... and the organs, right?"
What's the connection?
I'm not done yet.
Nina Getz's donor's name... was Leslie Davison.
Which of these two do you prefer?
I don't know.
Try them both.
One for each window.
"Don't be silly, darling."
It's as much your problem as it is mine.
- I know.
- These curtains are for your den.
My den?
"What's this, Sergeant?"
Buying a trousseau?
We're buying curtains.
"I thought it was for underpants, the kind civilians wear in the tea business."
Will you two leave and stop annoying Tommy?
"I'd like to oblige, but we're marching off to Tantrapur in 20 minutes... and Tommy's marching with us."
But Higginbotham's replacing him.
The Colonel said...
"Higginbotham's in hospital, Miss."
"I grieve to say, Miss, that the man is a tower of pain."
- Something he must have ate.
- Or drank?
"Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!"
- Tommy.
"- It's the Colonel's orders, Miss."
"Tommy, these friends of yours have engineered this behind your back."
"Don't cry, darling."
Goodbye.
This is May 9.
"I'm going with you for five days, and good company I'll be... but at sunset on May 14, when my time is up... wherever we are, I'm going to knock you two apes' heads together."
Now come on.
"- Pardon me, madam."
- Fall in!
- You won't get bored with a life of fresh air and bird-watching and jam-making?
"Not with you by my side, Joyce HazIedine."
Ah.
Three-nine-nine-eight-five?
"You got yourself a bargain, Joyce."
Pam Draper.
welcome to little Stempington.
"Oh, sorry."
How d'you know about us?
health club database.
"You're down as potential new members, Joyce."
It's like a tardis in here.
"- Ah, one of the natives at last."
- Pam Draper.
pleased to meet you.
"There's some olive tapenade, walnut bread, few organic eggs."
- I'm really touched.
- You'd never get this in the metropolis.
"And I imagine you'II find policing a place like little Stempington a Iot easier, too, once you get started."
"Ah, very observant."
Excuse me.
hello.
That's a strong grip.
You must be Joyce's personal trainer.
"You ladies of little Stempington are a friendly lot, aren't you?"
"hello, Joyce."
hilary Davenport.
welcome to little Stempington.
"- We've done that bit, hilary."
"- Oh, Pam."
What a nice surprise.
"As I was saying, you were lucky to get one on the south-facing side of the close."
"Michael, anything."
What can I do?
Settle these troubles with the Rosato brothers.
I don't understand.
I don't...
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.
-I know he is.
-So why ask me to lay down to them?
It was Hyman Roth that tried to have me killed.
I know it was him.
"Jesus Christ, Mike."
"Jesus Christ, let's get them all."
Now while we've got the muscle.
This used to be my father's old study.
It's changed.
I remember there used to be a big desk here.
I remember when I was a kid.
We had to be quiet when we played near here.
I was very happy that this house never went to strangers.
First Clemenza took it over.
Now you.
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.
"He taught me, ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. """
"If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded in this, in the Rosato brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still good."
That's what I want him to think.
I want him relaxed and confident in our friendship.
Then I'll be able to find out who the traitor in my family was.
-Yeah?
You look like one of those jerks who's in some lame band and rides a motorcycle without a helmet and has a wallet chain and neck tattoos and a drug problem.
"Not a... a big one, just, uh... enough that he deals a little bit on the side, and... he can never..."
ever be true to one woman.
Finish that damn pickle and do me!
"Okay, you guys know how my mornings usually go."
Why would we care how...
Usually it's like this.
After you.
"Aw, thank you."
"On the house, Robin!"
♪ Take this bagel on the house
♪ Have a paper on the house
♪ I'd give you a house on the house ♪
♪ If I could
♪ You're so beautiful
♪ Everything in life should be free ♪
♪ It's so wonderful to be me!
Mmm.
Wow.
"Do little bluebirds help you get dressed in the morning, too?"
♪ She's exaggerating
♪ To make a point!
But today was different.
That'll be $3.75.
But I didn't have to pay yesterday.
Okay. $7.50.
"Oh, honey-sweetie-baby."
"It's the ring, Robin."
The ring has power.
"When a woman puts on an engagement ring, it's like when Bilbo Baggins wears the One Ring in The Hobbit."
"Okay, can you say that again but not in nerd?"
Sure.
"- Ha, ha."
[Phone Beeps]
[Woman's Voice] Danny.
[Woman Chuckling]
Must be the wind.
"Hey, honey."
Hey.
Wow.
"Pretty crowded, huh?"
Naturally.
- How did that inspection thing go?
- Aced it.
We should get the official report in a couple days.
Ah.
"You know the entire food press is coming for Wolfgang's opening tomorrow, so that's..."
"Excuse me, please."
Very good.
"Excuse me, gentlemen."
There is a line.
You'll have to wait in it like everyone else.
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?
Why don't you think about this?
Why don't you listen to what the young lady said and get in back of the line?
Excuse me.
"Ladies and gentleman, by order of the Las Vegas Department of Public Health, this establishment is hereby closed for gross negligence... and flagrant violation of the Nevada food preparation safety guidelines."
[Crowd Groans] If everyone would please leave through the nearest exit.
Wait a second.
"Everyone, please leave now."
Everyone out now.
This place is closed.
[Woman] The next Haunted Hotel Tour starts in 20 minutes.
Let me tell you what's wrong with this TV.
"Them kids been here, that's what's wrong with this TV."
"No, Larry, the kids have not been in here."
"No, them kids been in here."
"Trust, OK?"
"They been in here playing that hindindu, OK?"
And I told them don't be playing the hindindu with my TV.
That's why I got a four-bedroom house for everybody.
Everybody have a room.
"In other words, you can't fix it."
I can fix this.
That ain't no problem.
I fix things for a living.
That's my job... to fix things.
"- What's up, Mr. Reed?"
"- Hey, Mr. Reed, how you doing?"
"From goons to mafia, from hooligans to terrorists,"
I gave every one bad dreams.
But one thief disturbed me very much.
"Not one or two, he committed 14 thefts."
He decamped with Rs.150 crores.
Government handed his case to me.
"Don't know why he's doing it, don't know where is he,"
"how is he, nobody knows it."
I stood for him...
I called him to take me...
I changed my face...
Cheated everyone...
I appeared strange...
I raced up the heart's pulse...
Teased mischievously...
Stole sleep from the eyes...
"Actually, I'm 100% objective."
- Mmm.
"Do you have a dictionary, Mr. Webster?"
- Yeah.
"Take a Magic Marker, cross out the word ""objectivity."""
"Your constituents want you for your opinions, your philosophy... for your subjectivity."
Laver has to duck out of the way of that one.
One that Laver can't get.
He's still trying to recover.
And he zings another powerful forehand past Laver.
"See that, Tim-Tim?"
Know what we call that?
- We call that topspin.
You know how we get topspin?
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?
Tell me.
- 'Cause Baby Jesus made topspin.
What?
- Baby Jesus gave it topspin.
- Jesus?
Ah!
Why do you say that?
- Because Baby Jesus made everything.
- Yeah?
Who told you that?
"Miss Moyer in kindergarten, and Mommy says..."
- I have to listen Miss Moyer.
"- Wow, this is news to me."
I gave up my career trying to strike that nonsense out of the public school system.
"Maybe I ought to put him in public school, then."
Remember what I told you about moving your grip down...
"Loud and clear on this end, Tony."
"Roger that, buddy."
Let us know what you need.
AssistingTony at the surface is safety diver andcommunicationssupervisor Mike Huntley.
"IfTonyencounters any kind of danger, or needs assistance underwater,"
Mikewilldescendthe well to help him.
You got to plant your ass on that board.
Okay.
Roger that.
Down slow.
"Roger, down to water."
Down to the water!
"Yeah, roger, we have visual on the camera here."
Lower Tony down.
Down two more feet!
Diver's in the water.
- All stop.
- All stop.
"Actually, visibility's great."
Lower Tony down!
Lowering down.

Where is he in relation to the bottom?
Are his feet on the bottom?
Are you touching bottom yet?
"Roger, on bottom."
"Is the bottom rough, smooth?"
"Hey, Tony, can you feel with your feet at all whether or not the bottom is smooth or rough?"
Roger that.
I'm not sure who I should be asking for.
"Dr Penzler, just make the call."
"All right, all right."
"FBI, please."
What are you gonna do once you get to somebody in charge?
I'm gonna make my demands.
"You're gonna call the federal government and say,"
"""Let me speak to the man in charge of your super-secret operation because, if I don't, I'll shoot a few people"
That's pathetic is what that is.
"Well, no one ever said that Ray wasn't pathetic."
CYNTHIA:
I knew I never should've joined this damn group.
This is like White people land.
Do you know how many Asian people have been abducted since 1947 ?
Will you please shut up?
"Maybe seven, and you're looking at one of them."
"So I decide to be open and honest about it, and this is what I get--"
I'm abducted by Homer Simpson.
White people land.
Hello.
Hello.
Is this the--the FBI?
- You got 'em on the phone?
"- Um, yes."
Uh-huh.
See?
"This is, um, Dr Harriet Penzler."
I'm hoping you can help me.
I have a bit of a problem here.
DR PENZLER:
Yes.
"Um, I have a group of people here, and one of them's been shot."
We'll trap him.
- I'm going down there.
- I'll go with you.
"Garcia, have Detroit PD set up roadblocks."
[Garcia] Got it.
Chris Edwards is a husband.
He's a father.
He's a general contractor.
[Morgan] Check any subcontractors who've worked with him.
"Okay, that is a humungous list."
What do you want me to do with it?
Anything that requires flames...
"plumbers, electricians, welders."
Did he fire a welder recently?
Okay.
"Uh, he's been using Vinnie's Welding and Fence, but he hasn't hired them back in months."
List of employees coming up.
- It's still a lofty handful.
- [Prentiss] Okay.
We think he's been following the investigation.
Look at volunteers with Detroit's Finest.
"Okay, I'm crossing employees with volunteers."
- Nothing.
"- Come on, baby girl, keep checking."
- There's gotta be a connection here.
"- Okay, I'm gonna long-shot it, and I'm gonna cross the Michigan business directory with the payroll company and see if I still got what it takes to find stuff."
And I do.
His name's Kaman Scott.
- [Morgan] You got an address?
- I'm working on that.
Kaman...
"Kaman, come on, man."
"But for right now, I'm free."
Once I get this ball and chain off my leg.
I'm waiting for my dad to take me to the courthouse for that.
I could drive you.
If you want me to.
So your mom didn't believe you when you said Leland was shady.
You don't sound very surprised.
"I'm used to that, that's why I called Syracuse University."
Talked to a lady at the school of architecture about how I was thinking of applying and did she know a James Leland.
You just called up and asked?
People love to talk.
And guess what?
James Leland went to S.U. And opened an office in town.
- See?
He's legit.
- Yeah.
He was a pretty good architect.
Right up until he dropped dead two years ago.
Introducing James Leland.
"Wait, my mom said his ID checked out."
Right.
"You ask a computer ""Is James Leland related to this Potter lady?"""
The computer says yes.
But you didn't ask if James Leland was still alive.
Knowing the right questions is better than having all the right answers.
Toby?
Mr. Dugan called with the good news.
Did you hear?
He told me.
We can get that awful thing off your leg right now.
The cab's waiting.
That's all right.
Are they farts or are they queefs?
Do you know what I mean?
This is the problem.
A front bottom one.
"I often think it's easier to say it's queef than a fart, because..."
I've never heard queef.
I'm enjoying queef.
I know.
A fanny fart.
"Yeah, but queef, what's that mean?"
I don't know where that came from.
It's an American word.
"Yeah, it is."
It's a pussy fart.
"Well, thanks for clearing that up."
When your cat farts.
Exactly!
"I don't think a man's as put off by a pussy fart, because they just think it's funny and it's often the result of something good happening."
"Whereas if you just let rip, a man's not going to go,"
"""I'm going to marry you for that revolting smell you just made."""
"Queef I think could be onomatopoeic, as in it's the sound it makes."
Queef!
"If you did willy farts, men would never stop doing willy farts."
"Oh, my God, it would be..."
Can you imagine it?
Especially if it made a whistling sound.
The joy that spread over your faces just thinking about that!
"If we could do willy farts, I would do one right here on this show."
"It should be like old Victorian policemen, you know."
Feep!
Feep!
"It's like a call - ""I need help'!"" Feep!"
- Sing what?
- Dunno.
I'm not sure the lyrics make much difference.
"You're Beautiful by James Blunt, maybe."
"That's an underrated song, John."
"Much darker than you, think."
"Like, he freely admits he was high and once the beautiful angel he was after spotted that..."
Curtains closed for them.
"Got to sort the ladies out first, Blunty."
Everybody knows that.
That or La Bamba.
"Remember what you need to dance La Bamba, Calum?"
Feet.
- Do you want a bacon sandwich?
"- Yeah, all right."
"I'll stick the grill on, you nip to the shop for the bacon."
What?
That's fair.
"And if them hoodies on the corner start getting fierce, just dance La Bamba in front of them."
There is on thing that is totally and utterly certain in this life
- and that is you will never see me dance.
- I'll put money on it.
One day you'll dance.
- Who's that out there?
- Jude Cassidy.
Don't think that I care for you.
I just need you alive.
"What do you mean, he's gone?"
- Argument about the M25.
- You had an argument about the M25?
"John, you can't leave me here on my own, please."
"- Who else can I go to, Rose?"
Not a dime.
"Honest, Sarge, they all owe me."
"Listen, right next to Zimmerman's name, put ""KEOZ."""
"I'll know what it means-- ""Keep Eye On Zimmerman."""
"All right, dismissed."
"Hey, Sarge, I got a couple letters for you."
"Oh, those finance companies must have radar."
What's this?
"Oh, this is a joker."
"This is addressed to the house I used to live in way before the war, when I was still a civilian."
"Hey, Sarge, maybe you've been drafted, huh?"
"It's a little late for that, don't you think?"
"Oh, no."
Ten years.
"What is it, Ernie?"
It's just not possible.
Ten years.
"Hey, Ernie, come on back to us Earth people."
The squad I led in WWII-- way before I even met you guys-- they're having a reunion.
A reunion?
"Yeah, I forgot all about it."
"You see, we were pinned down on a beach in the Marianas, and we swore if we ever got out of it alive, we were going to meet ten years from that day for the biggest, fanciest banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria."
The Waldorf-Astoria?
"Man, what a crazy barrack."
(laughter)
"Oh, what a bunch of deadbeats they were."
"Wait a second, wait, hold this."
I got a picture of 'em in here someplace.
Get a load of that.
That's me holding the flag.
BARBELLA:
Let's see.
It's all over now anyway.
"In a while, bim-bam-boom, I've got this town in the rearview mirror."
"- Hey, take me with you, boss."
- What?
"- Yeah, a little Colorado road trip."
"- No, no, Larry."
Come on.
Let me go.
I'm practically a fugitive.
I can't take you with me.
"Well, Russ, today, yeah,"
"I'm an authorized Yamaha sales associate, but tomorrow I'm just another guy... boxing peanut butter cups at Hershey."
"Come on, Russ."
"I have faith in you, man."
You would just drop everything to come with me?
"Yeah, let the word go forth -"
The Russ Richards freight train is about to leave the station.
"New horizons, new conquests."
- Ready to kick some new ass.
"- Bob Barker, watch out."
Russ Richards is heading west.
Now let's see what's behind door number three.
Whoo-hoo!
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
- Come on.
- This will be no bed of roses
"All right, I'll take the first eight hours."
- Ever driven one of these things?
- Nope.
I consider it a challenge before the human race and i never lose
All right.
There's Tommy with that bitch Josephine.
She had the same clothes on last weekend.
And she lives in Virum.
I just saw Jonas Engberg and Nik Kragh.
MONEY
"We set the trend for what's ""in""."
If me and my sister are seen in things we bought in New York   everyone wants the same.
You can buy your way out of most illnesses.
You can always go away somewhere for a cure.
I spend my money on on sex and gadgets and drugs and booze.
My friends rate some of my friends rate money higher than happiness.
But I hope -
- I'II be happy.
Then money won't matter.
I use my credit card as a comfort blanket.
If I'm feeling low I feel I deserve that top or that bag.
I haven't found a door I can't open with my money.
Crying in a limo with shaded windows is always more fun   than smiling at the wheel of a Skoda.
- I don't get it.
- Get what?
Anja and Patricia.
"The biggest cock-teasers   with Tommy and Jonas, the biggest shaggers in town."
"- Yes, it's weird."
- I'm getting new rims.
20 inch.
Straight from L.A.
- Cool.
"- I want 22"" Chrome."
- As my graduation present.
"- You can't have 22""if I've got 20""."
- Another line?
- You know I can't take it.
"I said, ""Really?"
"You've seen Cliff 60 times?"""
"He went, ""Yeah, but I saw him when I was 11, and I'm autistic,"
"""so whoever I saw then, I just loved forever."""
"So, even Cliff's biggest fan is explaining away why he's a fan."
LAUGHTER
It's absolutely insane.
Can you tell me about the time you met the Queen?
The Queen?
Yeah.
"Oh, I know what you're after."
Do you remember telling this story?
"When you came on QI, you told this story and it really made me laugh."
"Yes, I did a Royal Variety show and I was..."
"Yeah, that's it."
LAUGHTER
"And, you know, you have to wait for ages in a line, and Her Majesty was proceeding graciously along, and she spent quite a long time talking to Frankie Dettori next to me."
And you know when you are aware that you've got a little bit of wind working its way through?
"And I thought, ""It's nothing to worry about..."
LAUGHTER
""".."
"I'll just deal with this silently."""
LAUGHTER
"And just as the queen got to me, the..."
"It was the moment, you know, where the wind was making a break for it."
"So, I let nature take its course."
"Unfortunately, I shat myself."
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
But it wasn't...
"It wasn't a great big, you know..."
Sure.
An he's coming out swinging!
Ooh!
"Au revoir, Beautiful Steven."
"Parlez-vous ""Ouch""?"
"Now, a commercial."
- [Clink]
"- Oh, Arthur, there you are."
So nice to have company to watch TV with.
[Sniffs]
Brace yourself while corporate America tries to sell us its wretched things.
[Man on TV] I like jackhammering.
"I' better, I o it all ay long."
It's a man's job an I work up a man-size sweat on my brow.
[Woman] You sure o.
[Man] But I'm not afrai to pamper myself with a plush tissue when my brow nees a goo wiping.
[Woman] Plush?
"Here, big fella, sample my tissue."
I'll show you a tissue sample.
[Thrakkorzog] Fetch me a tissue sample from the Tick.
- [Suit squeaks] - [Toilet flushes]
Hm. [chuckles]
Knew I'd regret that burrito.
"Hey, what's happening here?"
"Uh, the little bunny guy was chafing himself on the ropes,"
- so I loosened him up a bit.
- You what?
He's a moth guy and how many times do I have to say it?
Don't touch my stuff!
This is my side of the living room and that is your side of the living room.
And must you drink straight out of the milk carton?
It's disgusting!
"Rally, Beautiful Steven, rally!"
Then it became the TV show for HBO and that took you to Hollywood.
Yeah.
How did that come about?
"We did the Conchords on HBO, so even that was very popular."
"It was on a cable channel, so there were so many millions of people that never saw it, but of course, when it came out on DVD, a lot of people saw it after that."
On the one DVD?
There's two DVDs now.
You pass the DVDs around?
We pass them round.
Yeah.
So all the cast and crew saw it.
"And then word got out, you see."
It was big in the comedy circles.
You're familiar with those circles.
"Yes, I am."
"We're going to talk more in a little minute, but just sit back and relax now and please welcome the very, very funny Charlie Baker!"
APPLAUSE
Hello!
That's very nice of you.
That's enough.
I might be rubbish!
"Hello, I'm Charlie Baker."
I'm waiting for Jack Black to die.
LAUGHTER
I've only ever met a couple of very famous people.
"Jay-Z, Jay-Z, the world's biggest rapper, Jay-Z."
"I don't know about you, but if I see someone famous, I have a little voic in the back of my head that goes, ""There's Jay-Z there."
"""There's Jay-Z, the world's biggest rapper."
There he is.
"""Go and speak to Jay-Z."
Go on.
"""Say something to him."
"Would you be disturbed, or would you welcome it?"
Is that a special move I'm not aware of?
"Tell me, does it feel... does it feel tight, is there reverb?"
"Whoa, wow, we, uh, we can come back."
"Oh, no, no, no, I was just trying to see if my butt had changed since college."
"- Well, this is 40."
"- Oh, God."
"- Hi, baby girl, are you hungry?"
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Okay.
- Dive in.
- Ahh-ooh.
We got some carrots.
"Uh, hey, Mags, might I have a word?"
"Uh, yes, you might."
"Well, it's been approximately six weeks since we took Joanie and Cha-Chi to the carwash."
- Are you talking about sex?
"- Geez, Maggie, the baby..."
What?
"That's how she got here, right?"
"Anyway, since that wonderful night, I've been feeling..."
"Oh, no, no, hey, Bruce, we talked about this, right?"
- It was just the one night.
"- Oh, no, no, it's not that."
"- It's, uh, I met somebody."
"- Oh, okay, good."
"- I mean, that's great, yes."
"- Her name is Nancy, and it's been fast and furious, like the first movie, not the other seven, which I feel don't hold up."
"- Okay, Bruce, focus."
"- Anyhow, um, I really want Charlotte to meet her, but I was that maybe before she meets her that you might meet her."
- I'd love to meet her.
I know you got that movie deal.
I know you're starring in it.
Congratulations.
"I'm a nice guy, but I'm also a businessman, and I'm willing to get rid of those tapes, each and every one of them."
"And that's why we're here-- giving you three a chance to repent, forgive yourselves."
"And how do we do that, you snake?"
I think a million dollars will help you heal and cleanse that darkness you've gotta be carrying with you.
Bastard.
You can cover that.
"No, I know how this works."
"- Oh, do you?"
- Mm-hmm.
"Once we pay you, then in three more months, we hear from you again looking for more money to keep quiet."
We were acting in self-defense.
Self-defense?
"Mutilating, chopping up a lifeless body, that's self-defense?"
You three are crazier than I thought.
I made you all an offer.
I keep my word.
What are you gonna do?
911.
What's your emergency?
CHEERING
Tonight on 8 Out of 10 Cats.
"Our Pointless friend, it's Richard Osman!"
"She's having a laugh, it's Ellie Taylor!"
"And their team captain, Rob Beckett!"
And facing them tonight.
"Acting funny, it's Jessica Knappett!"
"Here for the craic, it's David O'Doherty!"
"And their team captain, Aisling Bea!"
I'm sure that President Mateo and I... would both welcome the votes of only those people... with sexual indiscretions in their past.
We'd be landslide victors every time.
"Hey, Sheila."
- They've been waiting for you for about ten minutes.
- Okay.
Hey.
"- Henry, I gotta talk to you in five minutes, okay?"
- Okay.
"How about ""Her involvement in prostitution""?"
"No, no."
You gotta couch it like it's something... for the FB...
the AG to investigate.
"- Hi, Reggie."
- Hi.
"Well, how about, ""How embarrassing it is..."
"- that the..."" No, no, no."
- Who...
- What?
- Where's Gilmore?
- Gilmore.
"- Um, Idaho?"
Iowa?
Can I interrupt for one second?
We're all set with America Live.
What are you guys talking about?
We're just going over our statement... in response to The Washington Post story.
- What story?
- The one that says the secret investigation is ongoing... to determine whether she accepted money... for her activities in college.
I didn't hear about this.
"Well, it's, uh..."
"It's, um..."
It'll be in...
"Well, if he's telling the (phone ringing) truth, we need to find Dana and protect her."
That's where we're headed.
(groans)
"Christopher, where the hell have you been?"
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.
"I know, King, I'm sorry, and I'll explain it when I get in."
"Wait, wait, wait."
Where are you?
Are you anywhere near the track?
"Avondale, maybe five, ten minutes, why?"
Okay.
"I need you to head over there as fast as possible, take Dana Wells into protective custody."
"Arrest her if you have to, just get her out of there, and don't do it in front of any of her crew."
I'll fill you in when you get here.
You got it.

PRIDE:
"Yeah, Chris."
"King, I think we're too late."

- Looks like Dana's been taken.
"Track surveillance camera has a pretty wide angle, but those are our guys forcing Dana into that black Charger."
Add the car to the bolos.
LASALLE:
"Nobody's seen Vernon, Dane, or St. Clair since this morning."
Didn't even show up to pre-check for today's race.
They must know that we're onto them.
Yeah.
-Have you told the colonel;
"-No, I can't face him."
"I've gone that one time over, bringing him bad news."
Are you coming;
No.
"Then I'm finished, Brock, as far as you're concerned."
Too much for me.
One last word.
"I advise you to get in town, fast."
"Sarah Beth, tell your father I couldn't wait."
You can get out of this yourself or the way you got out of jail.
"What did Mr. McCurtin mean, the way you got out;"
"-He got you out, didn't he;"
-No.
-Who did;
-Chamberlain.
I guess he figures the young and foolish should have another chance.
"All right, Brock, you don't have to cover up with me."
I've known for a long time.
-When;
-For sure when I was 15.
-How;
-A lot of things put together.
"And before I went back to school the last time I knew you knew it, and I knew Papa did."
I could kill Chamberlain.
That's what the trouble was about.
"This fellow I was gambling with, he said a few things."
That's why I couldn't tell the colonel.
I couldn't let him know that I know.
"Oh, Brock."
"We've been around a lot together, the colonel and me and he never let anybody even think anything once, at least not out loud."
"Oh, don't I know."
Monorail!
t's so much cooler  to be in a band than be by yourself.

Hey.
Hey.
What's this I hear about a baby being back here?
Don't look at me.
Noogie's out of town.
"Mr. Nello, it's just for tonight."
Please?
I couldn't find a babysitter.
"Look, you've got 15 minutes to find one... and be back here in a tutu and on the floor."
Cut her some slack.
What the hell are you doing here?
Babysitting.
"for those of you who don't follow the Nobel Prize, I'm Morty Price."
"But seriously, I would like to thank right now..."
Mr. Cannata and Mr. Doss for bringing me back to glorious Miami.
"In fact, I was so eager to come, I turned down a chance... to be an extra in Coma Part II."
Not bad.
What?
"Not great, but not bad."
You ought to bottle his jokes and sell them for sleeping pills.
"I know it's hard to believe, I used to work in the stock exchange... till one of the brokers told me when my IQ hit 20, I should sell."
I really appreciate you helping me out.
This job is really important to me right now.
Better cover those.
You got husband troubles?
Not anymore.
I left him.
"- Yes, you did."
- I came to tell you the truth.
- You don't owe me an explanation.
Allison didn't leave home because of Nellie's suicide but because she hated me.
- She won't answer my letters or calls.
- Why not?
"The night you walked out, Marion Partridge called me."
She told me Allison and Norman...
I heard about that woman and her phone calls.
"Well, I've always been so afraid of scandal."
I believed Marion.
I believed that phone call.
"Without thinking, when Allison returned, I told her some terrible things."
What things?
"Come on, Connie, what things?"
"I'm Allison's mother, but I've never been married."
"Not to Angus MacKenzie, not to anyone."
I went to New York and lived with a married man.
"After he died, I came back here and lied and I've been lying ever since."
"You want the truth and when you get it, you're just like everybody else."
- They want anything but the truth.
- Connie.
Connie!
I told you once that the offer was always open.
"That I'm committing myself to you all the way and that I plan to worry about you, and take care of you."
I meant that.
"Oh, Michael."
- How's that?
- Fine.
I'll get it.
- Merry Chris...
- Ain't you gonna invite me in?
- Apology accepted.
"For God's sakes, you're the only woman for me, now hang up the fucking phone!"
"Listen, your skills are missed around here, Frank."
I need you.
"Oh, my God."
"So, how about you come see me at the airport tomorrow?"
It'll be great to have you back.
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, God, yes!"
"All right, Frank."

I have the cat wrangler here for you.
"Oh, is it that horrible little--Hi."
Hey.
Greta Johannsen.
"It's short for ""LaGreta."""
"Hi, great to see you again."
You too.
I'm here to introduce you to feline actors you're gonna be working with tonight.
Okay.
This is Po-Po.
And this here is Captain Boots.
Hello.
"Uh, would you describe yourself as ""cat competent?"""
"Oh, yes."
I love cats.
I used to have two cats.
"But then I moved to this place with hardwood floors, so we had to put them down."
I'm joking.
"I've done several focus groups, on this show, and what I've gleaned--"
"The blonde, big-eyed girl is popular with women and older gays."
"Jenna, that's my friend Jenna."
"And the kid with the funny hair is liked by women, but you're missing men between 18 and 49."
"I'm not missing them, they're just not there."
I think I can fix that.
"So your job is, you take things that are already working, and you fix them."
That's a great job.
"Okay, let's-- Why don't we, um--"
You're missing that third kind of heat.
I want you to think about Tracy Jordan.
Okay--the black guy?
The black movie star.
"I flew with him on a private jet to the Super Bowl recently, and I found him very entertaining."
I'm very disappointed in you cowpokes.
"We're playing our inaugural round of ""Wild West and Witches,"""
and I'm the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.
(spits) Patooie.
"We're not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon."
It looks ridiculous.
"And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?"
- Yeah.
- Very.
- Incredibly so.
Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
- Yeah.
- Very.
- Incredibly so.
"All right, fine."
Let's just play.
We should go easy on him.
Amy's out with Stuart tonight.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that Sheldon's patented blend of condescension and no sex isn't enough to hold on to a woman?
"Cluck, cluck, cluck."
"What are we, ladies at a quilting bee?"
Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?
Sorry.
Creepy Tepee.
Annie Ogly.
Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
"And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me."
I think you need to ask yourselves who's really being ridiculous here.
(spurs jingling  jangling)
- It's you.
- You are.
"Trap Door, have you got any milk in there?"
Thank you.
- Perhaps you'd like to mix your own.
-Thank you.
Delicious milk.
"Well, now, my dear, this may come as a surprise to you but I have a little problem."
"You, Black Widow?"
I thought business was good.
Business is boring.
I've completely run out of banks to rob.
I've run through them all.
"Now, that's where you may come in handy."
Me?
How?
"Well, everyone's heard about your Batcave and everyone's heard about your Batcomputer in your Batcave."
Oh.
You want me to get the Batcomputer to give you a bank to rob.
Precisely.
Do you think that you could send for it?
We don't have to send for it.
I have right here in my Utility Belt a remote control Batcomputer oscillator.
"Oh, heh."
- How convenient.
How does it work?
-Simple.
I just press this button and it activates the radio frequency Bat-generator.
- And I just talk to it?
"-No, I talk into it."
It wouldn't recognize your voice.
"Now, question:"
ls there any bank in Gotham City which Black Widow has not robbed?
"My word, wherever he is Batman must be operating his remote control Batcomputer oscillator."
Help!
Fredo!
"-I can't control her, Mikey."
"-You're my brother, don't apologize."
Clemenza promised the Rosato brothers three territories after he died.
You took over and didn't give it to them.
I welched.
Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.
-He hated them more than I do.
"-Frankie, they feel cheated."
You're sitting up in the Sierra Mountains and you're drinking...
-What's he drinking?
-Champagne.
"Champagne cocktails, and passing judgment on how I run my family."
Your family's still called Corleone.
And you'll run it like a Corleone.
"My family doesn't eat here, doesn't eat in Las Vegas and doesn't eat in Miami with Hyman Roth!"
You're a good old man and I like you.
You were loyal to my father for years.
The Rosato brothers are taking hostages.
"They spit right in my face, all because they're backed up by that Jew in Miami."
I know.
That's why I don't want them touched.
-Not touched?
"-No, I want you to be fair with them."
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?
"Tom, listen."
"They recruit spics, they recruit niggers."
They do violence in their grandmothers' neighborhoods!
And everything with them is whores!
"No, Dawkins knows his face is all over the news by now."
"If he wants to get off the island, the first thing he needs to do is change his appearance."
Coming in?
It's the men's room.
"It's the luxury of carrying a badge, kid-- you can go anywhere."
Lemonade mixed in mayo.
It's an old prison trick for dyeing hair.
Seriously?
Looks like our man's a blonde now.
Purchases were made at an ABC Store just up the street.
15 minutes ago.
"Factor in the time for a dye job, he couldn't have made it very far."
He could still be around here.
You see that?
"Excuse me, sir."
Every time I come across...
He wouldn't be there if it weren't for me.
The Frabjous Day is almost upon us.
You must prepare to meet the Jabberwocky.
"From the moment I fell down that rabbit hole,"
I've been told what I must do and who I must be.
"I've been shrunk, stretched, scratched and stuffed into a teapot."
"I've been accused of being Alice and of not being Alice, but this is my dream."
I'll decide where it goes from here.
If you diverge from the path...
I make the path.
"Take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard, and don't forget the hat."
There's only one way across.
"Lost my muchness, have I?"
Bayard!
The hat!
Your Majesty.
"Thank you, Miss ""I'm in love with Dylan the spy."""
Wait.
"I'm confused, because the papers are right here."
They've been switched.
How do you know that?
They're in Russian.
Because I speak Russian.
"Sure, Jerry."
Ask me to say something.
"Okay, um..."
"Say, ""I've been lying to my sister about speaking Russian."""
[speaking Russian]
And you wonder why I don't trust you.
[dramatic music]
"I swear to God, sometimes I feel like I know you better than anyone else on the planet, and then there's other times that I--I feel like I don't even know you at all!"
I'm sorry--
Why would you keep something like that from me?
Because I wanted to protect you.
I've done some things I'm not especially proud of over the last five years.
Like what?
There was a time I was running from arms dealers in Tunisia.
"I didn't have a weapon, and they were chasing me, so I-- You know what?"
Stop.
"You're right, I don't want to hear this right now."
I'm sorry about the papers.
It's all right.
I'm just glad that you're okay.
[sighing] Great.
Angela.
Yes.
There are things you don't know about me.
"But seriously, there is no question you are the closest person to me on the planet."
He studied in New York when he was young.
"And Yoon Sang Min is a Korean American, from New York."
"Although, I'm sure there are countless Koreans in New York..."
"And the man taking orders from all of them, our killer."
"And, working under Park Seon Woo, the suspects of our current murder case."
The two unknowns.
"If our predictions are right, and Chief Jung is Park Seon Woo's boss..."
It's good to look at this from different angles.
"If we catch these two guys, as well as Park Seon Woo..."
"We could knock them off balance, and get them all at once."
You could have came home to change.
Why did you ask me to bring you clothes?
Your lips are chapped too...
- I might have to work overnight.
- What case is it?
And your clothes...
Whose blood is this?
Hey!
Why are you staring at us like that from over there?
It's making me angry.
- Are you monitoring him right now?
"- No, no, we're not."
They just wanted to say hello.
"- Hey, say hello one more time."
"- Yes, hello."
I'm pretty quick with my wits.
"Something is... not going well, right?"
This is all...
because of that Park Seon Woo.
Park Seon Woo?
"I knew I had to watch out, but I didn't know he would come at me so fiercely."
- What's going on between you two?
Seth-chan!
Don't think you can do stuff just 'cause you got her all alone!
"Esther is injured, you know!"
As if I would ever-
"Well, I'm off!"
Esther...
Does your injury hurt anymore?
No.
I see...
Esther!
Want to see the view outside?
Yes!
They think that they'll see flowers if only they give water
But the harvest season's over the time has past
Here in the dark I'm sitting'
The answer that soon I'm getting'
How do I know where it comes from?
Just want to feel safe with you
Now let me hear your voice just for once
'Cause you've mixed all my bits
You've grabbed all my soul
You've taken everything over
Now let me hear your voice just for once
You know you can make me smile
You can make me cry and take me out from these nights of longing
It's so beautiful...
What are the buildings on that mountain?
"Oh, that's Sarai."
The palace where the New Human Empire's mother and empress lives.
All of that?
!
Her Majesty is the very embodiment of the mpire.
"""Athletic""?"
"Sideburns, no cans."
She is hot.
"So why can't she come in, Ted?"
She can come in.
In six and a half months.
Wait.
Are you saying she's...
Twenty.
And a half.
Almost.

Ah-ah!
"Hold up, guys."
She had to bounce.
"Um, a flash mob broke out in front of a line of Korean-Mexican food trucks in Williamsburg."
The only thing that would make her more of a 20-year-old is an ironic form
- of transportation.
- Yeah.
She's roller skating there.
I don't know which is more pathetic-- that you're going out with a 20-year-old or that you bought a leather cuff to get a date with her.
I didn't buy this to get a date.
"I just happened to be out catching up on some Saturday afternoon leather cuff shopping, Oh."
and she just happened to be a leather cuff saleswoman.
"God, I am so glad I am done chasing bimbos."
"Now that I'm engaged, that whole part of my life just seems sad and empty."
"I don't want this to sound too harsh, Ted, but you disgust me."
"Until a month ago, your headboard had a lube dispenser."
"Uh, yeah."
"We got rid of that, okay?"
Yeah.
I may want to live differently now-- quite differently.
I'm even stopping off on the way to the train to buy a new sport jacket.
[chuckles]
"Mr. Sandover, your wife is here."
My wife?
What in heaven's name?
She said she stopped by because you didn't pack your sweater.
"All right, all right."
Thank you.
I told her she could put the sweater in one of your bags.
I showed her where the luggage was in the office.
I said all right.
Thank--
"Beth, here, give me that."
Of all the things I don't need on the desert.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
But I suppose I didn't kiss you goodbye this morning.
All right.
There.
"Now run along, dear, for heaven's sakes."
"Sandy, I ran into Frank Sellers in the hall downstairs."
He said he was surprised to hear I hadn't wanted to go to Phoenix with you.
He said the company would gladly have paid--
"Beth, how you could have worked here all of these years and still be so stupid and gullible--"
"Sandy, you're upset about something."
You know you are.
"You didn't eat your breakfast this morning and last night you talked in your sleep again about waterskiing, of all things."
Please leave me alone.

"All right, the sample of sawdust from the roof is identical to the sample we found in Coach Nelson's chest hairs."
And I finally determined the species it came from.
Fagus Sylvatica.
Beech Willow Tree.
"Which is indigenous to Flushing, Queens."
Could be where our killer lives.
Or just where he set up his chop shop.
See if anyone who got that e-mail hails from Flushing.
Got ya.
Kyle Sheridan?
"Three count, buddy."
You lose.
High school wrestling team?
Four oer brothers.
Come on.
"Whoa, Coach Nelson."
What happened to his neck?
It was separated from his body.
And the rest of him was stuffed in garbage cans all over the city.
"Whoa, wait, you think I had something to do with this?"
We found sawdust on his torso.
"Sawdust from a tree indigenous to Flushing, Queens."
So?
"You're the only kid on the wrtling team who is from Flushing, Queens."
We found that same sawdust on Coach Nelson's roof.
"You were up there, weren't you with Todd Fleming?"
No.
"You leeched off his Wi-Fi signal, sent out the incriminating photos of the young boy."
"Right, when the coach found out about it, he came to you, and what'd you do?"
"No, like Teto"
Still an animal?
"No, a sex beast"
"Big Sis, you're too open"
It's because you passed out even without drinking
My role was supposed to be yours
"No, Bebi as Lin, and me as Bebi, I guess"
It's not like I got my tits sucked or had my anal fingered
All he did was hug me.
And only for a couple of seconds
Even so...
Good boy
What now?
It's just love... hug!
Still think you are treating me like a sexual beast
Hee hee
Umm...
"You're late, sex criminal."
I told you to come in 10 secs!
That's why you'll never have sex without paying for it
What's that bag?
It's my breakfast
"Mr. Animalistic Desire, you ditched your stakeout?"
"Sorry, I've been on since midnight and I got hungry..."
You're complaining?
Even after the crime you committed?
I'm sorry...
Your heart wasn't in it
Really?
"Well then, I guess it's time I send this pic to your company"
I'm so sorry...
I truly appologize.
"I was gonna say, they seem like..."
Albany girls.
"Uh, so, anyway, we just wanted to drop by... and find out if you've seen this guy."
"Well, I'll let you know."
"Although, with Jerry, he could be shacked up anywhere."
"He's a bookie, for Christ's sake."
It was nothing.
Nothing.
"The word ""lotto"" never even came up."
"- See, Mr. Crazy Man?"
- Thank God!
- They were checking on Jerry.
- They asked about Jerry?
"- Yeah, yeah."
It was just routine.
- Not routine.
It's called a murder investigation.
"No, trust me."
Dale took care of every thing.
They'll find a cure for cancer before they find Jerry.
[MaleAnnouncer] Live from Harrisburg and News Center Six.
"Covering Harrisburg, New York, Lancaster and Lebanon, it's News at Five with Dan Shuff, Heidi Zimmer... and Russ Richards with the weather."
This is News at Five.
Our top story tonight:
The body of a local bookmaker was found floating in the river today.
Police say it was foul play and are following leads.
More on that story in a moment.
"First, let's check in with the weather center... to see if we can expect more of these spring-like temperatures."
Russ?
Russ?
"Oh, yeah?"
- How about these temperatures?
And then--
"- So wait a minute, wait."
The Homicide gang were chasing them.
"- Thank Christ, at least from our point of view."
"So these ill-fated Jolly Stompers run past us and we're standing there frozen, can't move, and this running mob runs around us like a herd of buffalo and we're just standing there and then ten seconds, just standing around us yelling."
"Homicides, Homicides, and running after these poor souls, who are probably dead by now, by the way."
And--
"And ten seconds later, they're gone."
"Just me and my daughter, standing there, my 13-year-old daughter and me, and we still have nothing to talk about."
(women laughing)
"- Hey, Pete."
Give me another one?
- Cash first.
- What?
"- Horace, come on."
What is this shit?
- Hey.
You ain't paid for the last three I poured you.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
- Cash first.
- So Iâm broke.
I've got...
I've got a quarter.
You know what?
What if I could make a one dollar bill that you gave me change into a twenty.
"- Ooh, I wanna see it."
- I wanna go dancing.
- Then you'll give me a free drink?
- What are you talking about?
- If I can make your one into a twenty.
Can I-
- Can I borrow this?
"Once he's got him, she's got all of little Stempington."
- Does the whole town know about this?
- No.
But those who do are too frightened to talk.
I haven't told you about The Wicker Barn.
"God's sake, get down, Joyce."
Ah!
"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
I'm pissing blood all over Margaret's new rug.
- It's Scotchgard protected.
"- Better answer that, Joyce."
"You might want to move the Panda, Joyce."
We've decided to issue a little warning.
"You could help us take her down, Joyce."
- How?
- We've never had anyone on the inside.
Think about it.
That's all I ask.
- You should go now.
(Pam) Welcome to Little Stempington.
"(Hilary) Hello, Joyce."
- ..someone I'm dying for you to meet.
"Joyce, at last."
"Hold this and press that little red button, would you, Joyce?"
You're the only suspect in that nasty little business back at The Wicker Barn.
(Hilary) I wouldn't want to be separated from my husband if he had buns like that.
"(Camilla) You don't want Jeremy's first day in the job to involve sending you to the click-clink for the next ten years, do you...do you...do you?"
- They made me do it.
"- Too late for excuses, Joyce."
"darling, please."
I'm afraid...
I'm gonna have to take you straight upstairs for questioning.

I had to bring him back Khartoum along with that bloody journalist woman.

"They're prepping him for surgery, now."
"You've let Stonebridge go off on some suicide rescue mission, with the only lead..."

"And we're trusting him as our guide, why exactly?"
It was Tahir's men who destroyed my village.
And my family.
"And, your friend, Scott, he promised me much money."
"And a new car if I help you, yes?"
You gotta love that mercenary spirit.
"So, what's your reason?"
"This isn't only about Latif, is it?"
Not for you.
"Mac became ""Dr. John."""
Seemed like a whole 'nother life...
Another person came in and started something new over here.
"He's a character, man."

- He's an original cat.
He's cooler than you.
And he's cooler than everybody you'll ever meet.
Did you create Dr. John to be a front man?
No.
"I was gonna make Ronnie Barron be ""Dr. John,"""
"and I was gonna call him ""Reverend Ether."""
"Frank Sinatra's manager or arranger, or whatever the hell he was, said, ""If Sonny and 'Cheryl' could sing, and if Bob Dylan could sing, you could sing, asshole."""
I think he hit a raw nerve with me and it hit home.
"He's amazing, you know?"
"It's like, everything that he plays is the best thing ever."
It's perfectly behind the beat.
Everything he knows about music is so pure and so... complete.
"It's like, nasty and dirty, but intelligent and, uh... you can hear a million years of music in everything he does."
It's that guy's bachelor party this week.
I fucking met that dude yesterday.
Right there.
That dude with the fucking headband and the sunglasses.
"- Oh, not him."
- No way!
Yep.
I told him we were playing here tonight.
And his dad!
He's with his dad!
What's up?
"Look, dude's in the headband."
He brought his dad on his bach' party.
Johnny's build.
It might be Johnny.
It might not.
No hardware on him?
Wilson had a wristwatch.
Nothing.
He'd been cleaned as though somebody didn't want him identified.
"The only thing was a hunk of melted gold, like a tooth."
Only it's big f or a tooth and it's got some black stuff on it.
Black enamel and gold.
Johnny's senior society pin.
"So, Johnny had taken his last jump."
- What's it look like to you?
- Gold bullet?
Are you kidding?
That's an idea.
The newspaper boys will go f or that.
Kincaid would check with Missing Persons and find out I'd never been there but I wasn't worrying about that.
"I was thinking, now I won't have to say goodbye to Johnny."
I remembered him in Berlin.
The crazy song he always sang.
"I used to say, ""You drive me nuts with it. "" Yeah."
"Why, I used to say to him--"
"Let's just say I remembered Johnny, laughing, tough and lonesome."
Let's just say that.
But I knew all at once I had a job.
They don't give out the Congressional Medal to guys wanted for murder but he was gonna get it.
I was going after whoever tried to gyp him out of it.
Why should anybody kill Johnny?
Because he hadn't shot Chandler and maybe knew who did?

That was the ship's commander.
All 215 sailors reported back for duty this morning.
"All except Petty Officer Adams and this man... 21-year-old Petty Officer Brian Smith, from Virginia."
Maybe a second victim?
Or maybe involved.
No way to know that yet.
Figure it out.
Go on.
"Hey, I'm just grateful for this time of year."
"Liberty Week, the sales almost double my regular day."
But you do not remember ever seeing
Petty Officer Adams this morning?
No.
"It's a real shame about that kid, but no."
I-I never saw him.
"I mean, look around."
"Not exactly easy telling 'em apart, you know."
"I think it was Mae West who said,"
"""You've seen one sailor's anchor, you've seen 'em all."""
"No, I just kind of meant that it gets hectic in here."

"Oh, no, nothing like that."
"No, no, these are all good kids."
I-I never had any trouble.
Are you guys here about Caleb?
Come on.
Help me!
Those other girls already took them.
What?
"Well, at least we don't have to wear those ugly, yellow bridesmaid dresses at the wedding."
Yup.
"Now, you only have to wear ugly, yellow dresses here, every night."
This is the best thing that's happened to me since I realized that weird mole on my arm was just a Grape-Nut and not cancer.
"Girls, great news."
You stuffed Han in the microwave and you're ready to hit power?
Come on.
We've tried.
You know he doesn't fit.
The one thing he's too big for.
"No, I got Ilia Jorbich to be our wedding photographer."
He's the best photographer at The Warsaw Times.
"Well, he's the only one who still has both arms."
"Wait, it's the Warsaw Times?"
"All this time, I've been thinking it was The New York Times."
New York Times?
This is much more exclusive.
You can only get it in two places.
Poland and the deli in New Jersey that sells missiles.
This is amazing.
My comeback in The New York Times has been preserved.
"Max, I'm gonna go ahead and smile."
My life is good again.
"Don't smile yet, 'cause Sophie told me that because you said she had such good taste, she's designing our dresses herself."
"What was that, like a second?"
Yup.
You just went from the best of times to The Warsaw Times.
Thirty.

You gonna be all right?
Thanks for asking. I'll be fine.

"Without Jésus, he will be difficult to identify, so keep your eyes open."
The Crime Squad should not have the info on Niko.
We're ahead of them.
We're pretty sure that Ronaldo taught Niko his MO to carve up Tatiana.
Niko could then tell Jésus how to mutilate her.
And Tatiana then becomes a victim of the Butcher of la Villette.
And Ronaldo gets freed.
- Niko and Ronaldo know each other?
Yes.
It's the only explanation.
But we're not 100% sure.
"Ronaldo had no visitors in jail, except his lawyer."
Now what's important is how to catch Ronaldo before he kills a new victim.

World War II.
The winter of 1944.
"The Nazis penetrated the Allied lines, and surrounded a division of Americans in a little town called Bastogne,"
"freezing and starving and running out of ammunition, but they knew that they had to hold that ground."
"Just before Christmas, the Nazis sent a note to the American commander telling him that he could surrender and save the rest of his men, or they could stay and fight."

That's weird.
Adam!
That's weird.
"You know, his eyes."
"I swear, I'll never forget his eyes as long as I live."
He wasn't breathing.
I saw him die.
There was blood...
"Oh, God."
"Okay, sir, calm down."
Tell me where he was;
I need an address.
In an alley off of 57th.
You-you got to send someone out there.
"We will, but I need you to stay on the line with me, okay?"
Police say the call came in at 5:47 this morning.
- Tracks with Michael's account.
- Sounded genuinely upset.
Connection to the victim?
None that I can find.
I searched e-mail accounts and phone records for both Michael Thomas and Petty Officer Adams.
No communication between them.
Michael's boss said that Adams was never a customer at the shop.
Background.
"Petty Officer Caleb Adams joined the Navy right out of high school, had two overseas deployments and a spotless record."
C.O. called him a bright and hardworking man.
Assigned to the Hagen destroyer in 2010.
Adams was one of 215 sailors off the ship last night for liberty.
"Tracking down others who may have been with him, but we do have this."
He called someone named Meredith Bilson five times in five hours.
The last call came in at 4:34 a.m..
That's an hour before his death.
Location?
Apartment manager at her last known address says she hasn't lived there in three months.
Keep looking.
- We need more police.
- When you going to send us some help?
"Glad you're here, Mr. Mayor."
The father's seated in the corner.
"I'm all yours, Leslie."
Questions and answers.
Who's up?
- The Post.
- Marx or Sadler?
Sadler.
Then I know what's coming.
"""Has probation become a sentence in this town?"""
Judge Stern has a powerful record.
He served six years and meted out the stiffest punishments in the city.
"If the report recommends probation, then probation it has to be."
"After that, they'll start in on the mandatory crap."
Good morning.
I want to welcome the Revs.
Williams and Birch...
- You got the probation report?
- In the office.
I'll be there in a minute.
"- And my dear friend, Reverend Milton Parks of the First Church of Harlem Reverend Chapman and Reverend Murray."
Thank you for coming here today.
I know it wasn't easy for you.
"Well, what can I say?"
How do I start this?
"There is one thing, as Mayor that I will never get over and that is the death of a police officer."
There is one thing in life that I will never get over and that is the death of an innocent child.
But this is an incident that won't go away...
Tino Zapatti's probation report.
"The whole city  all parts of the city  Bushwick, Jamaica, Washington Heights  Brownsville, Harlem..."
If I'm going to be somebody's plaything why not work at a dancing house and earn a bit more money to send home
"Congratulations, sir"

Virtually none
Please don't mind my saying lt's not a good idea to stay with that gang
But it's not like I enjoy it!
My guess is that his bitching is just for show
Don't say that.
I'm pretty scared
"Oh, you're scared?"
Yeah...
It's like I feel this overwhelming power
"Yeah, that makes sense"
So then the two of you are normal
"Yes, other than the fact that I want a penis I think I'm super normal"
What does that mean?
I just wanna be a top
With Lin bottoming?
I used to want that but not too much recently
He was really cute back in middle school
You two have been together for so long
We aren't dating
That's not what...
I'm not interested in dating right now
"I don't mean Lin only, but men in general"
I'm just not interested
What I am interested in now is puttin Lin's hard penis inside Bebi's anal
So kinky
That's so kinky
Stop it Big Sis
Lin is gonna fuck me?
It's Ok.
"Come on Sis, don't!"
"Sorry, I need to go to the bathroom"
He's coming on to you
"Big Sis, you're getting too excited"
"Yep, my sparkly index is at 200%"
"Fredo, you're nothing to me now."
"Not a brother, not a friend."
"I don't want to know you, or what you do."
I don't want to see you at the hotels.
I don't want you near my house.
"When you see our mother, I want to know in advance, so I won't be there."
You understand?
Mikey.
I don't want anything to happen to him while my mother's alive.
There's more people than at a ballgame in here.
"-Hey, there's Willi Cicci!"
-Frankie Five-Angels...
This committee will come to order!
"-State your name, please."
-Frank PentangeIi.
-Where were you born?
"-Partinico, it's outside of Palermo."
Where do you live now?
I Iive in an army barracks with the FBI guys.
We have here a witness that will further testify to michael corleone's rule of a criminal empire that controls all gambling.
This witness has had no buffer between himself and michael corleone.
He can corroborate enough charges for us to recommend a charge of perjury against michael corleone.
-Senator.
"-Thank you, Chairman."
Mr. PentangeIi.
Mr. PentangeIi.
Were you a member of the CorIeone family?
"Did you serve under Caporegime, Peter Clemenza, and under Vito Corleone, also known as the Godfather?"
I never knew any Godfather.
I have my own family.
"Mr. PentangeIi, you..."
You are contradicting your own sworn statement.
Heart attack.
Higgins?
Who's playing for Mrs. Blackmore?
"Well, no one."
The funeral's today.
The game's tomorrow.
What a strange little man.
[ Magnum Narrating ] I really had to hand it to Higgins.
"In less than an hour, he'd dug up four articles on Caine, gassed the Ferrari and packed a lunch."
"After bridge tomorrow, Zeus and Apollo might be having me for lunch."
But until then--
Caine's life was a Horatio Alger story.
"Orphaned at birth, he ran away to sea at 1 4, sailed freighters until the war, then enlisted."
He fought in Europe and was decorated for bravery twice.
"After the war, law school on the G.I. Bill and a lucrative practice in New York and so on, until he was nominated for the Supreme Court."
[ Engine Revving ]
All the articles read the same:
Robert Caine was an amazing man.
"I wasn't sure a brief marriage to a prostitute who disappeared 40 years ago... was going to do him any real damage, even if it did leak."
Not with his record.
But I couldn't help feeling there was more to it than that.
Right on time.
Have you found her?
"Let's go for a ride, Mr. Caine."
[ Engine Revving ]
Well?
I haven't found her yet.
"Well, where are we going?"
"On the phone, you led me to believe--"
That I had a lead?
You remember a bartender used to work the Wiki-Wiki?
Big Hawaiian named Maku?
Stand up.
It means yes.
- Go!
' Tangakl
Morning to dawn
Give it to Zahireh_
Go ahead.
Did Zaer Kheder allow you to play Kettledrum?
I don't understand.
How you don't understand?
Didn't you go to talk to Mr. Zaer Kheder'?
I said I don't get it.
I said I don't get it.
So don't talk about Tangak anymore.
If I'm going to go to Tangak there is nothing related to Zaer Kheder regarding my decision to go to Tangak_
So what?
My decision of going to Tangak is separate from bringing the cradle.
I have to go to Tangak_
Say it again please!
How there was no word of tangak before yesterday?
Now we are talking about it!
I've decided to go there and I will.
"Mr. Bashirou, did you think if you go to another city, you'll become a real man?"
We have been faced so many problems because of Tangak's people.
"They forced your father to move in to Bushehr, don't you remember?"
Why are you silent?
"It was because of you and Hanieh that my father had to move in to Bushehr and put Zaer Kheder in trouble, but now for you and Hanieh I have to go to Tangak_"
Tangak's people will put you in trouble my little son.
- You can't survive.
- How can they put me in trouble?
They are unable to confront me.
I am so tough-skinned_
Can you hear me?
"Hello?"""
I've just killed two people.
My aunt and my uncle.
My name's John Mercer. sync:baozi
The Fixer S01E01
How did I become a hitman for the state?
It all began five years into my life sentence and the day Lenny Douglas came to take me out of prison.
I killed my aunt and uncle because they'd hurt somebody that I love.
Maybe that was what got Lenny's attention.
He liked emotions.
They...gave him something to manipulate.
"So, while the rest watch The Champions League, you stop trying to push down the walls."
You pick up your book...
..and you worry about the mystery of things.
Lenny offered me a new life.
A new home and a new family.
But there was a price.
There was the job that he wanted me to do.
Lenny Douglas ran a secret team in the war on organised crime.
I never knew who gave him his orders.
But somebody at the highest level had approved our existence.
Lenny's first trick was to reunite me with an old acquaintance.
"Now, how can I describe him?"
Take the person who annoys you the most and multiply it by ten.
You think you've left them behind.
You think you'll never have to see their face or hear their idiot voice again.
That's Calum.
Yeah!
Hey!
First time I heard this tune I was in a club in San Antonio with these two mental birds Niamh and Catherine.
"Cousins from Burnley, mate."
"""And now Teterin's been promoted And everyone feels truly blessed And now let's everyone together Bow down so low and kiss his ass."""
"I think the rhyme is good, and Comrade Teterin will like it, too."
What have you done?
That was Teterin on the phone.
Even better
"Pavel, what are these silly jokes?"
Do you understand how you made me look?
"I will dial it again, you go and apologize"
"Do you hear me, Pasha?"
"Pasha, what's happened?"
Do you have troubles at work?
"My little hampster, please answer when asked"
"Oh come on, I ironed this dress, and now I have to do it all over again"
--I find your flattery distasteful --What flattery?
A person is retiring with a farewell party.
Some warm words for him...
"--Who is retiring, Teterin?"
--Kovalev is.
Kovalev.
--And Teterin is taking his place --Precisely
"What, precisely?"
!
What?
!
--Lucy is in tears --What happened?
--What else has he done?
--I do not tolerate calculating people
"--Dad, you choose your words more carefully --Go, dad has some troubles"
"Dad, who's calculating?"
Lucy?
How?
That she married a student without a stipend?
He'll blame me all the same
What should I do?
"How dare you, you're still alive"
You've scared me so much!
Where's Gao Jian?
Didn't see him
"Master, I'll get him!"
Shut up and go!
Gao Jian!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
A while back I carelessly... bumped into 2nd Brother
You know the time now?
"Lazy boy, go and practice!"
"Master, have you heard of someone by the name Jin Tianyun?"
Why did you ask about him?
"Nothing, it's just that I've heard about"
How amazing Jin Tianyun's technique is
He is pretty skillful
A pity that he didn't come from a decent school
Just in case you run into him in future
You better turn away
"Master, will you turn away..."
If you run into him?
Nonsense!
"Gao Jian, if you'd rather leave us"
I'll make it easy for you!
"Master, you got me wrong"
Got you wrong?
"Master, this blockhead... didn't really want to learn martial arts"
He just wants a place to stay
"And have three meals a day 3rd Brother, can you shut up!"
- Three bombs went off.
"He claimed there was a fourth,but it was never found."
All right.So where do we start?
I'm gonna work on the locations.You're gonna work on finding Petty.
Petty was a combat engineer in the Korean war.
Something bad happened in Wonju...
schoolchildren killed by U.S.land mines.
Petty was the prime suspect.
Is that what sent him into Alcatraz?
No.Court-martialed.
They reassigned him to the Presidio graveyard detail while they did the investigation.
Eventually he was tried and convicted.
********
"After five years in military prison, he came back to the city and started doing this."
All right!
Everybody down!
"Oh,my God."
"On March 21,1963,Alcatraz officially closed."
All the prisoners were transferred off the island...
Only that's not what happened.
Not at all.
Alcatraz Season 1 Episode 6
"You're checking her for TBI,right?"
Concussions?
"Honestly,I barely bumped my head.Thanks."
A guy is walking around with a backpack full of mines.
SFPD back in '60 thought he stole 'em from the Presidio while he was there.
"The Presidio isn't a base anymore,so where is he getting them now?"
"Maybe same guy who bought Cobb his rifle,Hastings and Sylvain their guns."
Someone's helping these guys.
"I mean,maybe unfreezing 'em."
It's like when captain America was trapped in the Antarctic ice...
I asked Temu to bring me here
"Mouna, I asked Temu to teach him"
"Even so, you cannot trespass into our Mehebu hunting ground"
This used to be our Toda hunting ground when my uncle was alive
You Mehebu clansmen robbed it from us
Rob it back if you can
Enough!
"Mouna, can you do me this favor?"
Favor?
"Kojima... if you lived in Mehebu now,"
I'd do you this favor
But you live in Tnbarah Clan
Take these red-foot pheasants and get out of my hunting ground
I don't care if it's your hunting ground or theirs because everything here belongs to us Japanese now
"Temu, you just wait and see"
Some day I'll destroy your Tnbarah Clan
Go on and do it if you dare
Let's see who's killed first
I don't care if you're Mouna Rudo
"Wow, well done"
Can a girl carry such a heavy load?
Go!
Go!
Good girl!
"The men in your clan are all out hunting, aren't they?"
Wanna make some extra bucks?
- Come with me to my boardinghouse!
- No!
- I'll give you two dollars
- No!
What the hell?
Bastard!
Where's Bradley Walsh?
Is Bradley Walsh here?
APPLAUSE
"I think you'll find it's not daytime, it is access prime."
"That's what it is, very different."
"I'm sorry, access prime?"
Isn't that an account on Amazon?
"What time is that, Richard?"
"It's when non-middle-class people are home, but middle-class people haven't got home from work yet."
Ah!
"Middle-class people say, ""People who don't work watch your show."""
"You go, ""It's on at 5.15pm and most people finish work at 5pm"
"""and live quite near where they work."
"""Just cos you work in London"
"""and it takes you 4?"
"hours to get home to Northampton."""
"Someone's a bit touchy about their early start time, aren't they?"
"I can tell you, David Beckham is not one of our favourite Brits."
Aw.
"According to reports,"
"David Beckham's tax arrangements means he'll never get a knighthood, which is not even in the top five reasons I'm not getting one."
"OK, fingers on buzzers."
BUZZER
"OK, go on, what do you think?"
Is it the Queen?
"Fan of the Queen, Aisling?"
"Yeah, sure."
It's about time Britain gave her break.
"She's 91, she's been doing the same job for 65 years."
"I feel like she should do what all old women are allowed to do - grow out your chin hair, tour the Canaries on a boat, let a gas man in with an invalid ID."
Just...
I think that's what she deserves now.
6- year-old James Bone  on his way to school.
Ballistics from the police lab confirm  the wayward bullet that killed the boy came from Zapatti's gun...
"Here you are, Mr. Zapatti."
Michael find Vinnie.
I want to have a little talk with him.
"Yesterday, on the corner of Broadway  and Marcy Street, gunfire broke out  claiming 6-year-old James Bone  along with 21-year-old Tino Zapatti  a convicted felon on probation  and a 32-year-old police detective, Eddie Santos."
The Police Commissioner has disclosed  that an investigation is underway into Santos' activities.
Question:
What was Santos doing with a drug dealer  wanted for probation violations?
Good morning.
It will raise serious questions of corruption in the courts.
"Stern gave Tino Zapatti, a drug dealer  probation instead of sending him to prison."
The question everyone is asking  because of this unusual disposition  is why did the judge do that?
"Good morning, Mrs. Santos."
I'm Marybeth Cogan.
We met at the hospital.
That's Randy and Maria?
These are my kids.
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry to have to talk to you here.
- It's all right.
Hear from anyone in the department today?
A couple of the guys.
What did they say?
I called to pick up his things from the precinct.
They said his locker was sealed.
But the captain came to see me.
He was very nice.
What captain?
Homicide South.
Eddie's commander.
- She called ita wild animal.
"- Yes, sir."
Before his judgmentseat
"Oh, be swift, my soul to answer him be jubilant, my feet"
- OurGod is marching on - [Gunshot]
"- Glory, glory, hallelujah - [Growling Sound]"
- Glory- - [Explosion]
"[Newscaster] In Washington, the size ofthe crowds... have swelled to overa quarter ofa million demonstrators... protesting the ongoing war in Vietnam."
"There must be a quarter million ofthem out there, Edgar."
"You know, they've been at it nowfor a whole year."
"Young kids, just like Tricia."
I don't know.
"Do you think they gota point, Edgar?"
This whole damn system of government.
"Rememberwhat Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President,"
"""The powerwas lying in the streets, waiting for someone to pick it up."""
The Communists have never been closerthan they are now.
Now's the time to get back to the old themes.
The ones that made you president.
Letthe Communists know you're onto them.
Those bastards.
Think they can ruin Tricia's wedding... by dancing naked in the reflecting pool.
"Well, don't listen to them and don'tquit."
"Remember, Kennedy and King were against the war."
Where are they now?
[Chuckles]
Howthe hell the Times gota hold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace.
Yeah.
"You know, we can't keep a damn secret in this government."
They're stealing papers rightoutofthis office.
"Johnson had the same damn problem, till he bugged his own office."
We took thatsystem out.
"Mr. Moreau, excuse me."
They just informed me
Which unfortunately our president will arrive later.
We can offer a visit to His Majesty and to the Belgian Ambassador
Of the Miniatiürk Park while we are waiting?
"Mr. Moreau, what about the Atomium?"
"The Turks have a lot to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk,"
Commander of the Turkish forces in the War of Independence
And founder of the Turkish Republic.
And they expressed their gratitude by building this colossal mausoleum.
Freedom or death.
"He was a man with a clear vision, did not he?"
Yes.
"We all admire Kemal Atatürk, His Majesty."
"Listen to your vision, Turkey today would be a very different country."
This is the last reappearance of the king running in the park like a puppet.
There was going to be a news bomb and there would not be a script.
Ludovic!
Wallonia has declared independence!
Belgium collapsed!
Their declaration of independence is called 'We're Tired'.
Fed up?
About what?
"The valleys feel faint, humiliated, and misunderstood by the Flemings."
They are tired.
We must go back to Belgium immediately.
We will arrive at the airport in ninety minutes.
Ready?
Could you repeat that?
His Majesty the King wishes to speak to the Minister-Walloon President.
Ready?

Please give her back.

"And that was Senator Jeffrey Collins speaking from his home in Buckhead, Georgia."
The disappearance of his wife Sara has aroused national attention.
"Judy, does the FBI have any leads in this investigation?"
"Well, Jeff, all we know is, Senator Collins' ex-wife, Jessica Nevins, is being sought as a person of interest."
Officials now confirm she was registered at the Biltmore Hotel on the night of the current Mrs. Collins' disappearance.
Officials urge anyone with information to contact the Sara Collins hotline immediately.
"Thanks, Jeff."
"All right, thank you, Judy."
That was Judy Nash...
"Cap, forget about it."
It's not her.
"Messages of support and concern have been flooding in from around the country, as Sara Collins' disappearance approaches the 48-hour mark."

"Baladhandayuthapani, Sornammal, Thirukumaran, Velkumaran, Senthil"
-Before that Arul Kumaran will be there
- It is not there
"Check again I have checked, check for yourself"
Mom!
"Mom, am I not your son?"
Did you not give me birth?
Is that man my dad?
My name is not there in ration card
How come it is missing?
Who gave names?
Am I so unwanted?
Atleast girls can have husband's name in initials after marriage
"But males, have to use dad's name in initials, no other go"
He may say I am not his son
"But for me, till my death he is my dad"
Otherwise it will be a stigma on you
I don't want to defame you
"Go, all of you"
Have you heard him?
No one can give troubles to one's son more than this?
"Magnum, P.I.?"
"I'm Barbara Terranova from Bayonne, New Jersey."
"Your answering machine said I could find you here, so I came right over."
"Hi, Barbara Terranova."
I'm Rick.
"I, uh, manage this club."
This is T.C. The fella you're looking for is standing right behind you with the baseball hat on.
Figures.
"I've only been here two days, but already I know everything in Hawaii is a little cuckoo."
Oh...
Maybe you'd like to step out on the beach where we can talk more privately.
"Magnum, I'm gonna be up front."
I have enough cash to pay your salary for one day... exactly one day.
So I gotta have results in 24 hours.
What do you say?
"I'm sorry, Miss Terranova, but no respectable private investigator... can guarantee a one-day result."
"Well, almost none."
I know.
That's what they all said.
All?
I phoned every investigator in the phone book.
Oh.
"Well, alphabetically, of course."
"Thomas, we gotta do something with your listing."
We gotta move it up or somethin'.
I just figured I could count on you somehow.
"I mean, your voice on your answering machine was so sympathetic."
I quit my job back in Bayonne at the Firmer Body in Ten Days Exercise Salon... and I spent all my savings on new outfits and a plane ticket one way.
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
"Once I said yes, it was like punching a clock."
Barbara barely gave me time to shower and change into some gear I kept at the club.
"I wanted to grab a cab back to the estate and pick up the Ferrari, but she said that would be a waste of her time and money."

Building the Cambodian army up?
"My God, thatwould be harder than a Vietnamese Army."
They have no tradition.
"Mr. President, the government there will collapse."
"- So you're saying, do nothing."
"- No, sir, continue the bombing."
The same old horseshit.
"Well, that's not good enough."
"I'm sick of being pushed around by the, uh, Vietnamese... like we're some, uh, you know, pitiful giant."
They're using our P.O.W. S to humiliate us.
"Whatwe need now is a bold move into Cambodia, and go rightaftertheir, uh,V.C. Base camps, and, uh, uh, make 'em scream, hit'em in the ass."
"- What do you think, Henry?"
"- Well, as you know, mostof my staff have weighed in againstthis incursion."
They believe itwill fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily... and will result in crushing criticism domestically.
I didn'task whatyour staffthinks.
"What do you think, Henry?"
"What I think is, they're cowards."
Theiropposition represents the cowardice ofthe eastern establishment.
"They don't realize, as you do, sir, thatthe Communists only respectstrength, and theywill only negotiate in good faith..."
"- ifthey fearthe madman, Nixon."
- Exactly!
Unpredictability is our best asset.
"We gotta take the warto 'em, hit'em where it hurts, right in the nuts."
More assassinations.
"Right, AI?"
"That's whatthey're doing, Mr. President."
"See, your people in the State Department, Bill, they don't understand."
- You gotta-
- Mr. President.
You gotta electrify people with bold moves.
"I mean, bold moves make history."
"There is a bomb inside my bag,"
"Bomb is inside your bag,"
Is it Bomb?
"It is the cover of bomb,"
Then where is bombs?
"Bombs inside your bag D'Melo Yadav,"
Who are you?
Laxminarayan!
"Orange never be hard and,"
"Batla's enemy never have time,"
"A bomb you made will take your life, Give me the remote,"
"Papa, don't listen to him, we changed our bag's tag,"
"And I replaced it, Papa, I... with my personal hands... replace the left side bag's tag to right side bag."
And I replace left one with right one
"I don't understand,"
Can I come in guys?
Can I?
Ok!
Can I say something?
"You people put guns down,"
"Please, Thank you, Now listen to me very carefully,"
"Get me the table please, The left one,"
"The left right, The right one,"
Now tell me who replace the tag first?
"Me, Me, How?"
"Show me,"
"I replace the left one's bag to right one's, when you replace left to right one, That time your left was yours or mine,"
"That was my left,"
"Then I replace left one's to centre, and... replace right one's to left, That's it, simple."
"One, Two, Three, BBC, Bomb Brand Cash."
"Then They turned 1,2 to 2,1,"
"Then again he turns 1,2 to 2,1 and then replace 1 to 3, One Two Three."
"Damn, damn, ain't that a shame?"
"You""re lost so pay the cost Shouldn't have played the game"
Should've listened to the Frost
"When I was tryin"" to come across to ya"
"But no, you didn""t think Sucker."
"You just keep gettin"" yourself more deep"
Until you sink
So there's no one else to thank but yourself
So go ahead and take a bow for a job well done
"But you""II never see the day of the sunshine"
Or the fun times
Just the old days and your old ways
True.
Corrupt and wicked
"Out there doin' dirt instead of just kickin"" it"
Pow-pow bang-bang and all that noise
"Yeah, you and all your homeboys"
You take time to read between the lines
'Cause ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine
"Any time, hey"
Ain't no sunshine
"Yo, kick it."
"I know about bein"" macho"
"Callin' the shots, the big time head honcho"
But here's somethin' even more gacho
One of my homeboys is your old lady Sancha
"Yo, shit happens"
Her number lights up on his beeper
"Right as I""m rappin"""
While you sit in your cell writing' a letter
"Sayin' when you get out Yo, things""II be better"
I asked him to do something for me.
To run a background check on Im Tae Ho.
You investigated Im Tae Ho's records?
This murder case...
"Im Tae Ho reported it himself, didn't he?"
And I'm sure that you found no fingerprints at the scene.
Are you suspecting that Im Tae Ho is the killer?
"Last time, you forced Chan Gyu to make a false statement."
"But this time, you want to turn a police officer into a murderer?"
"That time, I wanted to figure out his relationship with Baek Shi Yoon."
I wanted to see if he would side with Baek Shi Yoon after hearing my orders.
I wanted to figure that out.
Do you understand what he's saying?
"That time, Choi Chan Gyu took Baek Shi Yoon's side!"
"So, that means, they already have a relationship some emotional ties."
Between Choi Chan Gyu and Baek Shi Yoon!
"As well as with his boss, Im Tae Ho."
"If you don't believe me, let's go."
I'll show you the truth.
"After the murders started unfolding, you did nothing... and you never will."
President Hwang rescued me...
"I'm just a life... that was extended, thanks to President Hwang..."
He never should have acted alone.
He may have involved himself even deeper because he worked with Park Seon Woo.
"He knew, the kind of person he was dealing with."
Everyone had the wrong idea about Yong Moon Plan and Park Seon Woo.
"They say that they're a legal company, associated with the agency externally."
"But really, they're a private group, moving secretly according to orders."
Who could be controlling them?
The person who ordered them to monitor us...
Think about it carefully.
"Who was involved in the mission in Macau, three years ago and also involved in Seo Jun Suk's murder and President Hwang's murder?"
Shaolin and Hung Dong have been beaten by you
I wonder if you have the guts to fight against the swordsmanship of Kwun Lun School
and that of the wa Shan School
Union of the our sword styles
Many heroes have died in this
Yin and Yang formation
Really?
"Hero Chang, choose a weapon"
This is it
"Alright, then use the dried branch as weapon"
You are not showing any respect to our Schools
Chian Kuen Moving Technique
"That's right, Hero Chang has mastered the Chian Kuen Moving Technique what?"
why did you stab me?
I didn't.
That kid must have used some evil magic what are you doing?
How did my sword injure you?
This lad has strange kung fu
Don't know where he learned it?
Now all schools have been defeated by hero Chang
Now only Er Mei and wu Dong remain
"Abbess, you're mistaken"
I've come to resolve the situation not to challenge the six mighty clans
I hope you'll listen to me...
Shut up
The six mighty clans want to annihilate the Ming Cult
"If you wish to leave, go now"
Or die with members of the Ming Cult here
Chang wu Ji
The Heaven Sword of Er Mei will not return to its sheath unless it draws blood
Do you really want to die at
Summit Guang Ming?
Mercy
Stop fighting...
Stop fighting...
Deadly Finger
Shadow Finger who are you?
"I am Yuen Chun, before I became a monk"
I was called Shing Kwun
Shing Kwun
I am the cousin of the Master's wife we were in love at the beginning but her parents married her to your Chief for money
Because of this
I've sworn to try my best to destroy the Ming Cult
I manipulated the fiery temper of my student Tse Shun
I raped and killed his wife and daughter
I used him to fight against the martial arts world
As a result the six mighty clans are attacking Summit Guang Ming today
Although we are seriously wounded
I still have strength left... to give the last blow
"Now, let's see who recovers first will win this fight, or we'll die altogether"
"Little brother, maybe you have to give some help to the Ming Cult"
Little brother?
I've brought a person in my bag
You can't tear it open
Jump slowly
"Alright, tell me where he is"
I Chang wu Ji have to avenge for my father's death what?
Chang wu Ji
"He's five steps from your left, hop over"
One

"That villain is right in front of you, fight him"
Will call you dear and darling
Talk about marriage He will run away
Will call you dear and darling
Talk about marriage He will run away
"It is pulling If you peel off, it is nothing"
Love is like an onion
"Oh pappad of Ukkadam, spinned top"
Ask for grace from Arul
Oh Peelamedu chariot The drum adorned with a dot
Love is a boredom
Because she is excited She is asking for the garland
A garland
After 5 comes 6 And from cotton comes yarn
"Oh lady, likewise, desires come from heart"
Among rivers it is 'Siruvani' If 'achi' it refers to Pollachi
"But love refers to lies, listen"
Don 't love a stranger Don 't trust an unclaimed land
Don't love a stranger Don't trust an unclaimed land
"Ponni madam, love is like hot water"
Marry the boy suggested by parents
"Oh pappad of Ukkadam, spinned top"

Kong Yuen Sang wins
Ladies and gentlemen I am interviewing Kong Yuen Sang right now
Kong Yuen Sang...excuse me
Spare me some time for an interview
"Si Sun, I've won, I'll take you to America"
Good
Are you happy that you've won tonight's match?
We'll go to America
Wait for me. I'm coming
Over the five rounds of this whole free fighting competition I feel that Kong Yuen Sang should win
But who will actually be the winner?
The judges will decide
Whoever is the winner will be representing the Asia-Pacific region
"Alright, they'll soon announce who the Champion is"
"Everybody, the Chairman of the Chinese Boxing Society will be presenting the prize to the Champion"
"I am sorry, the organizers have received a complaint that a contestant has used banned drugs"
There will be a urine test
"Please wait, the result will soon be announced"
What is it?
It's from boss
Was there any drug in what I drank?
"Ladies and gentlemen, after the urine test lt's proved that Kong Yuen Sang has taken stimulant so he is disqualified"
Ah Mut Sha leads the Championship 3 times in a row
Go
"Kong Yuen Sang, you bastard"
You dare to play tricks on me
"If you don't want to do it, just say so."
It's so tacky hedging like this.
I'm not good at talking.
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Do you know howl feel every time I go home after we meet?
No.
What do you think?
You don't think about that?
No.
Your underwear.
Can't you give me a call when you're not coming home?
It's not a big deal.
- Eat before you go.
- That's okay.
I'll just go.
Where are you going?
I'm going to look for a job.
You never last three days.
"Still, I'm going to look."
I don't want to shrivel up and die at home like this.
- It's tingling.
"-Why, why, why?"
"Ah, My beard?"
- Yes.
Go shave!
- I don't want to.
- Go shave!
Go now!
- Let's just do it.
- Don't get it on me.
- Come here.

Where is the gold?
"- I have the gold, sheikh."
But how could I have brought it here?
I have hidden it in the mountain.
You can take your share.
"Let""s go."
Where is the gold?
Fish contains all the vitamins!
Eat this and your face will glow like gold!
"Mama and saridon""s health is not fine. so I got fish!"
How is that possible!
I will eat this fish!
And their health will improve! of course it will!
I will improve my health!

Take your fish and leave!

This man is a fool!
People are crazy for fish!
And he is returning fish!
Gold!
Gold! oh my God! ..oh my God!
Did you see?
"DDT, you crook!"
You have made a big blunder!
Why are you yelling?
"I didn""t do anything!"
Your husband made a blunder!
Yes!
You idiot!
"Had you not asked for dowry, we wouldn""t have got in this mess!"
You fool!
You took the dowry!
You took it!
You took a lot of risk for us till now.
You just go.
How can we leave you like that?
"Yes, we will also come with you."
You go from here.
- Listen to me.
They have entered the forest.
We got a message from Kasi.
He said that he will kill that man and .. .. bring the girl before the hour of marriage.
He said he will not be your brother if he fails.
"Uncle, make me as bridegroom."
He kept the ring I gave to him.
That means father lied to me.
And I believed his words.
I did a big mistake.
Come on.
Move away.
Do you want to die?
What do you want?
- I want a lift.
This bus belongs to a marriage party.
You will not get the lift.
"This is your bus brother, come inside."
Why dont you pick up the cell?
- It is your cell phone.
What?
My phone?
Hello?
Who is it?
I am unable to listen.
"Tayaru, is that you?"
We are coming.
I want to go somewhere quiet.
What about you?
What's wrong?
No.
It's just... a bit uncomfortable.
Is it very discomforting?
"The world seems strange, doesn't it?"
Don't worry.
No one knows.
Let's go some place far.
It's so strange.
I don't think I'll ever come to a place like this again.
My heart is racing like a fish's.
"My heart's beating like a goldfish's, too."
Are we really going to do this?
"We don't even have any protection, do we?"
Condoms?
We come all the way here and don't do it?
Okay.
I'll go get some.
This place is not bad.
"Look at you, getting nervous."
Your face is burning.
I'm not nervous.
Wow!
You're really sensitive.
I am a little.
I like sensitive women.
Hey!
That tickles!
Don't!
I'm gonna start from the toe.
I said I won't charge you for this idol.. ..but I will have to pay the sage.
"Yes, of course."
Here you go.
100 rupees.
Only 100.. - Mahadev.
Mahadev.
This is a question of devotion.
We cannot force anyone.
Do you how much I had at that time?
Only 20 rupees.
Only 20 rupees.
Remember?
So do you know what I did?
I was wearing a similar gold chain.
And I gave that to him.
It's all about faith.
Anything you give is less.
Anything you give is less.
Wow.
What a thought.
"Not just my gold chain, I will give up my gold ring too."
That's it.
Here.
Here you go.
- Great.
Take of everything.
Take of everything.
- Take it.
"Great, great, great."
Glory to.. - Lord Krishna!
Glory.
"Now, where will this idol emerge from?"
Do you see this star?
I want you to draw this star down here.
Take your time.
You worked so hard on that!
I want you to pick up a penny in one hand and then you're going to put it in these fingers.
Drop it in here.
OK can you do three of them?
You do one at a time.
Take one from that hand and put it in that one.
Great job!
Let's put them back.
This time I'm going to count while you do it and then time you.
So you're going to go as fast as you can when I say go.
Ready?
Go.
OK.
Let's do it one more time.
Ready?
Go.
OK.
Start with one hand and one foot in front of us and the other hand and other foot are going to be behind us.
I'm going to jump and switch them.
Jump and switch them.
Can you try it?
Alright.
You have to switch your hands and your feet at the same time.
OK are you ready?
When I say go I want you to go until I say stop.
Ready?
Go.
Good.
Stop.
"You are blind, your father is blind !"
What are you doing?
Why are you boxing?
Neelambar!
How come you are here?
I'm in trouble.
- Are you out of it?
How did you get rid of the trouble?
- I stuck it on someone else.
That's the rule.
Everyone transfers his trouble to someone else.
What's happening?
Why are horns blaring?
I think there is a queue for petrol.
- It's a traffic jam.
Tell him!
"Before the traffic gets jammed, let's go to our Neelambar Pitambar store."
Let's go to our store.
Understand in one attempt sometimes atleast.
Where are you going?
"Drive fast, sister."
- I am driving fast.
"This is not a plane, it is a rickshaw."
Where do you want to go?
Left or right?
- Take a right.
Take a left.
Stop.
In the garden.
Over there.
- Where?
I'll tackle him.
Did Jamie take care of him?
He did.
But she's not going to talk now.
There's no way.
I tried.
"Well, you should try again."
What did you do to me?
You'll be fine.
But don't try and use spells.
Those herbs I used muted your magic.
Where's Elena?!
"She'll be fine, too."
"Bonnie, listen to me."
I need your help.
I need you to tell me where those coffins are.
Why?
"Because if you don't, that man compelled Jamie to kill himself."
I can't.
This goes beyond you and me.
All you need to do is tell me where they are.
Then we'll have held up our end of the bargain.
"Bonnie, please."
I've almost got it.
Abby hasn't called yet.
"Jamie, please, just let us go."
No!
"Please, don't do anything."
"Look, I don't know why I shot him."
"I don't know why I'm holding this gun, but if you move or do anything,"
I'm going to shoot him again.
"Ok, I won't."
Who gave you that gun?
You cannot claim insurance in such cases.
Because these are natural calamities.
But I don't believe in God.
Tell him.
I don't care if you do or don't.
You're signatures are right here.
I am so sorry.
Sorry?
What sorry?
Sir.
"Sir, I've invested my entire earnings in the shop."
Even my house is mortgaged.
And you're saying sorry.
"I know, but your claim cannot be approved."
You may go now.
"No, sir."
I won't leave until my claim isn't approved.
Security.
Sir..
"Sir, why are you calling security?"
I'm talking to you decently.
"- Yes, sir."
"Take him away, please."
- Why call the security..
Come on.
- Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Come on.
You just know how to swindle our money.
Mind your language.
You should be publicly beaten.
Throw him out.
I had a chance to be somebody else.
"To be Abby Wilson, the woman..."
"Not Abby Bennett, the witch."
"I'm not proud of what I did, Bonnie."
I ran.
I know I ran.
"But you had your dad and your grams, and, ok, let's face it..."
Your grams is way better at this stuff than I am.
You don't know?
What?
Oh.
How?
We were doing a rough spell...
And we both exhausted ourselves.
Her more than me.
"Well, she raised you right."
I'm sure she was very proud of you.
"Well, now you know my whole story."
Yep.
How about you tell me yours?
What brings you to me?
"It was a dream, actually."
I thought you were supposed to help us.
"But if you don't have any magic, it's..."
"Well, no spells, no."
But I'm not completely useless.
"I mean, the earth still provides herbs and such."
There might be something I can do.
I...Don't think so.
"Bonnie, please."
Let me help you.
"So what, you'd think I wouldn't find out?"
Don't wait here then go mind your business.
Don't worry this much about me.
"- Is where you will go, a near place?"
- No.
It's not like Kuzey will reply to your letter right away.
"I'll leave you alone, but it's best if I go now."
It is best.
You could wait.
How are you gonna go from here?
"It's okay, I saw a taxi stand near here."
Want me to walk there with you?
"Okay, as you wish."
- Goodbye.
- Bye bye.
Annoying.
"Sorry, for making you having to put up with this."
It's clear enough for me.
You don't have to explain anything.
"If I tried to explain it would take ages, anyway."
I have no hurry.
I will get to know you guys slowly.
- My son!
- Don't leave your seat.
- Hoşgeldiniz.
"- Hoşbulduk, my son."
"The air is damp, it could rain any minute."
"- You won't start will you, mom."
"- No, son."
I won't cry this time.
- How are you?
"- Fine, thanks to God."
How are you guys?
She asked me to put her in touch with some juvenile delinquents.
But I am a juvenile delinquents!
She doesn't know that.
"To send her off, I introduced her to Sylvester."
He's most probably the one and only dumb-writed triad member in HongKong.
He's know for his capability to kill.
He's getting a real reputation for that.
Moon!
Moon!
Fuck you!
"How do you do, Mrs. Leung?"
Can I borrow some soya sauce?
Sure.
Come in!
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
"Moon, who's she?"
She's from the social welfare department.
A charming lady!
I won't charge you for this.
"Thanks...More, please."
Take the whole bottle.
That's too much.
He visits you often?
Not really.
He used to live in the shop he worked for.
But he lost his job.
That's why he hangs around with me.
He got bullied a lot on the street.
He has to find himself a job.
What and how?
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Not something forced.
Something natural.
I got it.
I'll try again.
It was gym class.
There were students outside running around...
So we secretly went into the closet.
Pushed a girl onto a mat...
"But suddenly, the students were gathering, outside, the teacher is pounding on the door."
But we couldn't stop.
The girl's voice was getting louder and louder.
And the door was about to open.
But she was reaching orgasm.
I'll have Sam- gae-tang.
You don't even have any money!
Aren't you gonna buy me?
You just watch while I eat!
Don't drool!
You drive me crazy.
Really.
Don't pout.
"Alright, just for today."
You always treat me.
"Next time, bring some money."
You get free sex and now free food!
That's too much.
Sam- gae-tang.
Are you always so quiet?
I like people's voices.
Why are you so attached to talking?
- Yes.
But I'd still be good at it.
Really?
It's really big!
- Really?
- Yes.
For real.
- Take it out!
- What?
"Your thing, pull it out."
Here?
"Take it out, underneath!"
It's not so big.
"- Yes, it is."
"- No, It's not."
"When it's hard, it's really big."
I don't think so.
"Yes, it is."
It is big.
- Then make it hard.
- Here?
Hey...let's go somewhere else.
Don't make me laugh!
No way...
"That thing, I doubt it can even get hard!"
"No, It gets hard fine."
-What's your major?
- Astrophysics.
You go to a regional college and you think you're going to build spaceships?
"Well, not exactly make spaceships but we study the creation and evolution of the universe."
We also observe and research the cosmic space of the earth's mesosphere and
- planetary movements...
And the court wants to punish me for it.
Prince.
Will I be banished?
Will I have to go away again?
Will my mom have to go through that cause of me?
"No, Prince Yuning."
- Crown Prince.
- Prince.
That won't happen.
What's with the long face?
Guess you're not glad to see me.
"No, not at all."
I'm really REALLY glad to see you.
Then why do you look so depressed?
"Look, you haven't even called me, 'Brother.'"
It's just...
I thought maybe you didn't want to see me again.
What?
"You went through lots cause of me, though."
"No, cause of you?"
Where'd that come from?
It was my idea to skip out.
But you told Father it was yours.
"Listen, you're the one that's had it tough because of me."
I'm really sorry.
"You stood up for me, worried about me."
"Some brother I am, watching you take the blame."
"No, I'm to blame."
If I didn't go on the bridge you wouldn't have been arrested or gotten sick...
It's all my fault.
No.
"No, Yuning."
There is only one way we can reach the ship.
We have to go underwater!
"But if we do that, we may freeze!"
I'm prepared to die!
"If we make a hole in the ship, they will have to delay!"
You're right.
Here!
They made this for us to help us breathe underwater.
Young Sook!
Mother is going!
God of the Sea!
We are laying down our lives to save our daughter!
Please have mercy!
We... we made a hole in the ship!
It's our turn now!
Let's go!
What?
We can't leave today because of a hole in the ship?!
It will take at least a day to repair it.
"As of today, you owe me forty thousand yang."
"Goodness, awesome!"
Increase security!
"Seize any trespassers and torture them! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yes, sir!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
In Soon!
Next!
- Choon Dang!
- Myung Shin!
The front has been fortified.
Go for the back!
Alright!
What do we do?
It's fifty thousand yang already!
"He wouldn't say ""See you later"" slowly unless he means ""See you later."""
"Otherwise he would just say ""See ya later."""
- Don't you get it?
- When is later then?
I don't know.
I'm not boy lingual yet.
But I tell you what.
I see a snog at the end of the tunnel.
Big fish little fish cardboard box
Big fish little fish cardboard box Fill the trolley fill
"Lindsay, stop it."
You don't have to come.
"Oh, Robbie, stop."
I promise I won't get in the way.
"Oh, no."
"I don't mind, honestly."
Come on.
"Lindsay, stop messing about there."
All right?
Or you'll just have to sit in the back then.
"Oh, Robbie."
Maybe they're just mates.
"Don't be a plonker, El."
Mates don't hold hands.
"I already feel fed up with boys, and I haven't had anything to do with them yet."
I don't know how she got in there before you.
- I can never compete with Lindsay.
"- Yes, you can."
You've got much better qualities than her.
Yeah?
Like what?
"- Well, you're really funny."
What did I?
Didn I tell you not to see him anymore?
But who am I talking to?
God...
God damn both of you!
What if someone saw you together?
Huh?
"Call that ****, tell him to come here immediately!"
Right now!
He wants to break up.
"If you let a slander separate you like this, maybe you should break up."
"Really, just end it."
"- He wouldn't do such a thing, mom, would he?"
- Of course he wouldn't.
How can you even think that?
Did I do anything to you?
My memory about that night is so blurry.
I don't remember anything.
- Shut up.
- Believe me that I...
Shut it!
- Fatmagül...
- Don't say my name!
"- I swear, I didn't do anything to you."
- Shut up!
I don't want to hear your voice!
"- I can't do such a thing, I wouldn't."
- Shut up lowlife!
- I am not saying I am not guilty.
- Enough!
- I am guilty because I didn't stop them.
"- Back off, or I swear I'll kill you."
Hey!
Do something.
Build a wall.
Do you know my father?
- Yes we know.
"Hey, Salim!"
He is coming this side.
There is an auto coming behind.
Stop the auto.
Take it and go.
Will the meter work?
It will cost 5 rupees more than the meter.
Ok bye.
Good night.
Did she go?
"- Hello Salim, how are you?"
"Hello, Mr. Ranga Rao!"
Are you fine?
Do we look like thieves who steal rings?
No.
Because we sell the rings before you can steal them.
Did you get your Anarkali?
"Yes sir, by your grace?"
So are you daily going to the movies and parks with her?
Even that happened just now with your grace.
When is the marriage?
That too will depend on your grace.
"That is, should the girls father not agree?"
Why should you worry about the girls father?
I advise you to elope with the girl.
That will fix the father and you will enjoy the thrill.
"Sir, do you know what your greatness is?"
Ok.
Ok.
How are you holding up?
Oh.
I'll be fine.
"I'm not here to get my mom back, I'm just here to get her help."
So I hope you guys are hungry.
"'Cause, uh, food has always been my go-to icebreaker."
You have a really beautiful home.
You're so sweet.
Just like your mom.
You knew my mom?
Miranda was my best friend.
So you had a daughter and a best friend and you still left?
My best friend is why I left.
"15 years ago, a vampire came to town."
"Looking for you, Elena."
Looking for the doppelganger.
"No one could manage to kill him, so I lured him out of town and cast a spell to desiccate him."
Mikael.
He was an original vampire.
It took every ounce of power I had.
Almost killed me.
I recovered.
But my magic didn't.
My powers never came back.
And neither did you.
It wasn't that simple.
It wasn't?
"You cast a spell, put Michael down, then..."
What?
You had to teach Jamie how to drive?
Enjoy this short life.
"Cemre, her mommies one and only."
My dear.
"Sweetheart, my fortune."
"Be so happy, I don't want anything else in this world, Cemre."
Be happy with the man you love.
And have joint purpose with him.
But have your own purpose as well.
"And have a beautiful girl, like I do."
What if it's a boy?
"A child is a child, canım."
"Boy or girl, doesn't matter."
But have your child from the man you love.
Like I did.
So how did it go?
You saw Kuzey?
Sami Amca gave him the cookies and the letter.
We didn't have a feast like that in a long time.
- Thank you brother.
- Afiyet olsun.
Thanks to everyone who helped bring these to our table.
"Come join us, brother."
Come sit with us.
"Don't feel left out, come on."
"Well, since you are our guest here."
I will accept your invitation.
Let's make the best of your short stay.
"God gave us our punishment, anyway."
"Let us not punish each other, too."
"- Come sit, let us eat böreks of peace."
- Thank you.
- Come sit.
Okay what page am I on?
"Okay, oh okay."
Sorry.
"There, okay, ready, ready."
Okay.
"A, is the following."
Negative four on the diagonal .
"Ready, ready."
This is what makes it complicated.
Once.
An occasional zero.
"And then 1s, and then, an occasional zero."
Okay.
We'll get it though.
"By the way its the same over here, one's occasional zero's, zero's one down from here."
So this zero.
Is in that first M by M block.
Sorry.
No its not.
"It's, one over."
Sorry.
That zero.
"There's an N by N block there, and then a zero, and then 1s."
"Okay, so fourth, and this one here, zero is, one down here, ones, so I got three rows."
Six more to go.
"Alright then we have these, this is all due to periodic boundary conditions by the way."
Why these appear.
Then you have these 1s on the corners.
And then these ones over on this corners.
Got five diagonals.
"Then I have some ones over here that continue, there."
Then I have some ones.
She'll escape.
"The day she tries to escape, shoot her."

You crazy?
"Besides, the wardens will open and read it anyway."
Why wouldn't I?
Abla.
We're running out on detergent.
"Okay, dear."
Cemre...
Don't write silly things in the letter.
Remember the wardens will read it first.
"And don't write anything regarding the future, like so eager."
"- Just leave it to time, will you?"
- Okay mom...
It's Sami Amca.
We're gonna be late!
It can't be him at this hour.
Maybe it's the water guy.
Why would water guy come now?
What do you want?
- Good morning Zeynepciğim.
Come in?
"- No, thank you."
Sami Amca said you made some things for Kuzey.
I'll deliver it to him.
What do you mean you will deliver it to him?
- Are you going as well?
"- Are you, too?"
"No, I mean, they don't let him see people from out of the family."
Why do you go?
Sami Amca asked me.
So I must definitely go with him.
"And he went to the registry office to make application, with Aynur Abla."
"Oh, really?"
- On 18th of February.
Sinaner Holding will make the opening.
We will ring the bell that morning.
- Shall we drink the coffee in my room?
- I need to attend to a meeting.
I need to make a few phone calls.
Then I'll be with you.
See you.
"Güney, don't you dare break Banu's heart."
- What do you mean?
"- Today, I saw you and Melda kissing."
If you want to continue your existence at home and in the company... ... you need to be careful.
Or you'll have no where to go.
You dodged a life there.
Geçmiş olsun.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
"God forbid, you could have died."
I could have.
"But I didn't, again."
"Pity, you failed again."
What are you talking about?
- Our case isn't closed yet.
- I know it isn't.
I'll talk to you about the photo-montage thing later.
- I will not stop until I expose the truth.
- That's enough.
What are you trying to say?
You know exactly what I am saying.
Don't forget that.
- What photo-montage?
"- Just leave it, he's being ridiculous."
"You don't want us to call the police, do you?"
"Doctor, he's going to kill my brother."
"Calm down, Malena, please."
The doctor isn't pressing charges.
Why not tell me what happened?
My father...
I don't know how he can still be alive...
"Excuse me, but you didn't get my message, did you?"
"After you left, your father's brain activity shot up."
"He's in a coma, of course, but his brain's active."
What?
I'm telling you that we didn't disconnect your father yet.
He's alive!
God!
The son-of-a-bitch...
The son-of-a-bitch!
"Calm down, Malena."
You have to think of your brother.
That's what I'm doing!
Please let me go.
He's going to kill him.
"Pablo, do you understand?"
Please.
Please.
Wait.
What is it now?
How can anyone hate like that?
And hurt another human being without feeling remorse?
What do you mean?
"I'm talking about the torture, the diary... the photographs of you with my father."
Let me go.
I said let me go!
Where's the fourth?
Show me!
"Well, ehh, here's the thing."
They can't.
It's not here.
What did you do?
"Well, Bonnie gave me the head's up."
"I mean, I didn't have enough time to get all four, but I did have time to get one."
I will tear you limb from limb.
"And only then, when you are a writhing mass of blood and flesh, will I rip your heart from your chest."
Sorry.
Same rules apply.
Leverage and all.
I know you want your family back.
But something tells me you want what's in that coffin a lot more.
You want to tell me what you're up to?
You talked to Damon.
"Yeah, I did."
He wasn't supposed to wake up so soon.
I used enough vervain to sedate him for hours.
"Well, he drinks it, every day."
To build up an immunity so people like you don't get the jump on him.
"I'm not crazy, Ric."
Really?
Then what are you?
Watch your back.
You really want to know?
Stick around.
Is that bill Forbes?
Aaah!
I'm just trying to help!
"Just get it out, Elena, please."
Are you sure you want.......
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He rides across the nation the thorough bread of sin.
He got the application that you just sent in.
It needs evaluation so let the games begin.
A heinous crime to show of course.
A murder would be nice of course.
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He's bad!
The evil league of evil is watching so beware!
"The grade that you receive will be your last, we swear."
So make the Bad Horse prideful or he'll make you his mare.
"You saddled up, there's no recourse."
"It high ho silver, signed Bad Horse."
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding?
This is great!
I'm about to pull a major heist!
"You know, the Wonderflonium that I need for the freeze ray?"
It's being transported tomorrow!
Armored car?
Courrier van.
Candy for a baby.
Do you need anything dampened or made soggy?
Thanks but... the league is watching.
I gotta do this alone.
Will you lend a caring hand to shelter those who need it?
"- All right, all right!"
- Come on.
- What are you reading?
- Chekhov.
- Why?
- He's funny.
- You laugh too much.
Go read the Counsellor's Magazine.
Deal with your inexperience.
- And here's the Queen of the Fields!
"Maestro, music!"
"- Well, hello there Corn!"
- Did you win a cake at the factory?
- Yes I did.
- And a cake from the post office?
- Yes I did.
"- And you'll win a cake here, too."
- Indeed.
- We sure won't be giving a cake to some Puss-in-the-Boots.
"- Comrade Dynin, these days the legumes are mentioned a lot."
- Maybe the bean pod will be better?
- Then they would have done so at the factory.
Don't you worry.
- Same old costumes all year 'round.
So tired of seeing them!
"- Well, don't look at them, then!"
"- Seriously, why can't kids make their own costumes?"
"All you need is some construction paper and glue, that's all!"
- And our pride?
Are we so poor that we wrap kids in construction paper?
"Let's better pick who should be our ""queen of the fields!"""
- That's easy:
It's all a disgraceful lie.
She came into my office and tore off her clothes.
Who's to believe that?
I'm disappointed.
What you did was inadmissible.
I've worked here night and day for three years.
- I sacrificed my marriage.
- Your divorce changed you.
I was just congratulated on our sales.
Which you owe to colleagues like Ms Limmer.
Don't you get it?
Ms Limmer wants my job.
"You're paranoid, Mr Fuchs."
Now what?
The consequences are quite clear.
You want to fire me?
I'll take you to court.
I know of similar cases.
You don't stand a chance.
Who do you think you are?
I won't stand for this!
Leave my office at once.
What if he goes to court?
He'd be in more trouble.
"Brigitte, don't forget you stand to profit too."
Ms Limmer.
- Are you feeling better?
"- Yes, I'm all right."
"If you need anything, you can call me any time."
That's very kind.
Thank you.
I don't think Rex has earned his ham roll today.
The view is great.
When I earn a lot of money
It'd be nice to visit with family.
"There's a pool, a gym with treadmill, a spa,"
"A great view, and so many rooms."
Haven't you all been to places like this?
When I travel with family or with friends
I've been to places like these so I'm quite used to it.
How many rooms are there?
I'm used to this.
"Please be quiet, curly head."
What is Zelo's concept today?
How awesome.
"Zelo's concept is a Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven kind of feel."
The prime of music!
Not Rome...
"Zelo is to be a composer from Vienna, Austria."
He can't hear.
"He can't hear, but he's writing out what's in his head."
I don't think he can play the piano.
Why are you filming my feet?
I'm embarrassed...
Dae Hyun has sexy feet.
He's a man with sexy feet.
My feet turned ugly from dancing.
I have calluses.
- That's what's pretty.
- The trace of life!
It's beautiful.
My feet have gotten dauntless.
Zelo has flat fleet.
- I don't have flat feet.
"If you do, I'm going to shoot you."
This is great.
-Look at that.
"-Oh, that's a legion of elephants."
I'm going to enjoy a real safari after not having one for a long time!
Huh?
Are you guys really going to shoot real elephants?
There was a passage behind the waterfall.
We can just say that we thought this place was also a part of the park.
Atom!
Don't cut in.
This is the place for perfect aim.
Pura!
Zora.
Good!
Zora!
I'm going to fight you!
"Here, Pura."
Now it's time to say goodbye.
Go ahead.
You can be happiest when you are with your kind.
I had no idea there was this kind of natural passage behind the waterfall.
I should have investigated it more thoroughly.
"I just didn't know about this passage, but Pura's mom was..."
She's beyond recovery now because of Zora.
"No, it's all good now, Doctor Hura."
"Ah, that's right!"
Let's build an ocean safari next time.
It will be a great item!
Cannibal whale this time?
Don't invite me.
Atom!
(intrigued) Oh.
There's the first one.
- (pulsating echo) - Ah.
- (pulsating echo) - No.
"No, I remember now."
"Oh, now he's gonna come."
"- (pulsating echo) - (gasps) Oh, my God."
It's thundering.
- (pulsating echo) - (whimpering)
- (faint static) - What is that?
Uh-oh.
Please don't be in here when I get out.
Is this it on the wall?
What is that?
- (Finebros) I don't know.
"- Do I go straight? - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, God!"
- (headphones clatter) - (high-pitched static)
- (pulsating echo) - (footsteps crunching)
- (claps) - (Finebros laugh)
My fault.
Messed up the microphone.
- At least I got one.
- (Finebros chuckle)
"I was about to quit, too, man. - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh!"
What the (bleep)?
(high-pitched static)
"Am I going the wrong way, you guys?"
"I'm, like, shaking right now."
"I don't know if you can see it, but I'm kind of shaking."
I'm not liking Slender Man.
"I haven't even seen him, but I already don't like him."
Why does it have to be so dark?
So little?
Go in
Great
You can't do it drunk like that
Let me do it for him
Go out of the window， just in case
You two keep the door
You go and get a hot towel
Landal， Landal
Landal
What are you so surreptitious?
Nothing， sir
You must go down tonight
I know.
Let me have more chat before the time's up
I'll come back to pick you up
Don't go away
Take care
Time's running out.
I'll have the make-or-break try
Keep away， bloody ghost
Wake up
A cup of ginseng tea to sober him
What，s up?
Nothing.
It's scalding
It's scalding
I want to drink wine
You'll wake up soon after drinking
You're nice.
Mimi， you give me wine
Drink， drink it quickly
Keep them under your pillow.
Just eat your fucking breakfast.
"If this happens again, I swear on my mother I'll beat you to hell."
"- It won't happen again, abi."
- Shut up.
Pour the teas.
Fucking idiot.
- Abi.
- What?
I'll wash clothes once the cleaning is done.
- Give me if your clothes need washing.
"- It's okay, young one."
I can paddle my own canoe.
But this is our tradition here.
It's my job.
I am not good with traditions.
Thank you.
Is this why your neck is thick?
Because you do things on your own?
I don't know if my neck is thick.
But my hand is heavy.
"Oo, tough guy."
Leave him be.
- You turned on the oven?
- It's on.
"Did you have to do this, I mean, as if you're racing Sami Bey."
You're making cookies for him.
- His father will be offended.
- It's not the same thing.
I want him to eat something I made with my own hands.
If your cooking improves until Kuzey gets out maybe we should open a pastry for you as well.
He won't be staying for too long in there.
"It's not this, but it's your imagination."
It's a big difference.
[sighs]
Now do this again.
Again.
How do you feel now?
I don't know.
Playing stupid?
I'm not playing stupid!
I don't know the right answer.
"You see, ""I don't know,"" this is playing stupid."
You did something with your heel there.
It's very chance [indiscernible]
-No.
-No.
Okay.
"No, but your hair and your features go along with the feeling I had about you earlier."
I had a feeling I could be afraid of you.
And you're the type of person that seems
"like you demand so much respect, and you're...[sighs]"
Please tell me.
I demand so much respect.
Play this what you just saw.
"Well, you know how smart I am."
"I know more about psychology than you do, Gloria, so anything I say of course is right."
Can you say the same as Gloria?
Something similar as Gloria?
Or like the same as Gloria?
I demand respect because...
I don't know.
You don't know?
"No, I don't."
These people will be like this only.
What a big house this is?!
You have seen only the outside.
Now see the inside.
It will be great.
What is this?
"I am afraid of dogs, sir."
Thieves must be afraid of dogs.
Why should you be?
That is why I am afraid.
He is counting notes by the heap.
The boss is coming.
"Boss, this mans name is Kona Ranga Rao."
A good friend of mine.
He came to seek your help.
Dont be afraid.
A blood relation started between us.
Ask him.
"Sir, I tried various businesses in different parts of the state."
I also tried different precious stones.
"When I was that my fate would never change, I met you."
Ask him a loan.
"Sir, I need some financial assistance from you."
Uncle!
The God has granted the wish but the priest created hurdles.
Take this.
"Sir, you helped me as soon as I asked."
If you please visit my home for dinner.. ..
I will repay your kindness.
"Hey, why will he come to your house?"
Stay within your limits.
"Uncle, he made the request himself."
Didn't the government ignore this fact even though reports were made?
We have suffered great losses in this as well.
We did this under your instructions as well as for the good of the people.
Please overlook our involvement in Choi Chul Joo's death.
Then I will ask you one question.
Some people were blocking the arrival of the police.
Do you know who they were?
- Did such a thing happen?
- Were they involved with Yongmun?
Why would we block the police's arrival?
We sacrificed a great deal because the police arrived too late!
He can't be caught!
He'll be killed!
- I feel like I'm going to die with worry!
- How will we find him on a day like this?
Young Miss!
Young Miss!
Gomi!
It's me.
Let's go!
"Gomi, come to your senses!"
Gomi is acting strange again?
Gomi!
Gomi!
The police are headed this way.
We should get out of here.
I'll head them off.
You take care of Gomi.
- Follow him!
Run!
"- Yes, Sir!"
"First explosives, and now strange fellows."
Please welcome the first lady of the United States of America - Michelle Obama.
[song: ladies night]
[cheering applause]
"..how are you? ah, well welcome"
I'm so happy to see you again.
"And you still, you still moving."
"I'm trying to, trying to move."
"You're moving it, you're doing it."
You still got the moves.
It's all about movement.
Let's move.
"We're trying to get people up and dancing, dancing is a great way to lose a little weight, be healthy be healthy, be happy."
You are demonstrating it every day.
"I, I try to promote it every day."
I like to move.
"It doesn't matter how well you move, it's just moving."
You're good though.
"You're, you're a good mover."
"But, still I, I think maybe still better than your husband."
I hate to say it.
"I, I'm sure of that."
[laughing]
Yeah.
He tried to dispute it when he was here.
He's rural.
"Yeah, yeah."
[laughing]yeah.
I think we have proof.
Yeah
We do have proof.
"No, you're definitely a better mover."
"Ahm, well"
"I'm afraid that uh... ...that you're going to have such a direct attack that uh, you're going to get me in the corner, and I'm afraid of that."
I want you to be more on my side.
"You said I'll get you in a corner, and you put your hand on your chest."
-Mm-hmm.
-Is this your corner?
"Well, it's like...yeah, it's...like I'm afraid."
You know.
Where would you like to go?
Can you describe the corner you'd like to go to?
Yeah.
Uh...it's back in a corner where...
I'm completely protected.
And you would be safe of me?
From me?
"Well, I know I wouldn't really, but it feels safe."
[overlapping]
But while you're in this corner you're perfectly safe now.
What would you do in that corner?
I'd just sit.
-Just sit?
-Yes.
How long would you sit?
"I don't know, but this is so funny you're saying this."
This reminds me of when I was a little girl.
"Every time I was afraid, I would feel better sitting in a corner."
Not panicky.
Okay.
Are you a little girl?
"Well, no...but it's the same feeling."
Are you a little girl?
This feeling reminds me of it.
Are you a little girl?
"Because well, it's very important!"
Come on...
We're going to Ankara.
"- Perihan, you get prepared, too."
- I'm not coming.
- What do you mean you're not coming?
We should be there as a family.
- I am not coming!
"I can't lie, looking in their eyes."
You go.
What are you waiting for!
Go!
And you go find out if it's that journalist who put it on the Internet.
"Go, we're doing all this for you."
It's all in vain...
It's too late.
Everyone will know it by tomorrow.
I don't know how we'll recover from this.
Make a call and sort out the tickets.
So that we depart as soon as we get to the airport.
And tell Perihan not to talk to them.
"If they know we're going, they might refuse us."
"""It's on the news and Internet... ... we've got to talk!"""
They are gone.
They ran away.
"""Münir Telci Law Office."
We can't answer your call right now.
"Please leave your message after the tone."""
"God damn you, Münir Telci."
This is ridiculous.
Throw dirt and hope it sticks.
"You've been doing that to the Yaşarans for years, I know."
I am very happy.
I have invested 14 crores in the movie.
If you had not brought her I would have been doomed.
Take these 10 lakhs.
I dont need 10 lakhs.
Only three lakhs is enough.
"Oh, you do not seem to belong to this age."
He is saying no to money.
I need to send this money urgently to Vizag.
Can you make any arrangements please?
When he is requesting us why do you stare with an open mouth?
Move now.
I will have it done.
Are you looking for Venkat?
- He is upstairs.
He is taking money from the producer for bringing you back.
He must have taken five or 10.. lakhs not thousands.
This is true.
I swear by my mother.
Dont try to cheat me anymore father.
You told me that he threw the ring down.. ..and I stayed away from him believing you.
Now you are telling me that he took money.
Even if he took money they would be the strong reason for it.
I will believe only Venkat and not you.
Why are you backing him?
Do you know how much trouble I took to make you.. ..a heroine?
Will you now go away with him?
What will happen to the movie?
Come with me.
Wait.
Leave her.
I left her.
"What am I gonna do, huh ?"
Broadcast her over the lnternet ?
- Yeah.
- You can do that ?
[ Scoffs ]
No.
I cannot do that to her.
"Jim, get some fuckin' balls."
"If you don't have the guts to photograph a naked chick, how you gonna sleep with one ?"
"I don't like the kid, but he's got a point."
"See, even shit-brick knows you should do it."
All you gotta do is set up some sort of private link or whatever on the 'Net... and tell me the address.
You can send me the address too.
I'll save you a seat.
"- How sweet it is to be loved by you, by you -"
- - I needed the shelter of someone's arms - - - Someone's arms -
"- - There you were - - - You were, oh -"
- I needed someone who understands my ups and downs -
- There you were --**
"Okay, that was good, but I want to thicken-up that solo."
"Michigan State is this Saturday, and I want that part to smoke."
"Yeah, I know, my timing's off."
"No, it's not that."
I think it'll work better as a duet with a tenor part.
I'll do it.
- [ Whispers ]
Dick.
- I'll do it.
Great.
See you tomorrow.
Hmph.
- Why are you doing this ?
"İnşallah, inşallah."
"I mean, I'm not getting out of your livesafter the lawsuit ends."
I told Meryem Hanım as well.
I see you as my family.
I hope our faces will smileafter the trial as well.
We're just leaving the house.
"No, we'll get there in time.Don't worry."
"Okay, will do, my dear."
"Your enişte is saying hello to you.He's already there, waiting at the airport."
- Take care sweetie.- Have a nice trip.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Don't pout.You are going away from hell.
- May God be with you.- Have a good trip.
"- There you go, miss."
Your bill.- Thanks.
You're welcome.Have a nice day.
You too.
Doing as I'm told.What else could I do?
"As you said, we delayed the abortion.We'll do it tomorrow."
As if I don't have enough to deal with...
"But I am telling you, Münir.When this is done... ..."
I'll be done with this womanno matter how much money you offer me.
"Okay, okay."
I got it.
When is your trial?
"Okay, call me when it's over though."
You too.
"Who are you?Who are you, God damned man!?"
"- Stop yelling at midnight!- That bastard bought you as well, didn't he?"
God damn it!
You are Münir's man.God damn you!
Please leave this place.
Shailu is mine.
Bhadranna!?
I can die ten times for Shailu.
Can you die once?
"I am ready, what about you?...Are you ready?"
"Uncle, why are you supporting him?"
I called you from vizag to convince him not to support him.
Why are you being hasty?
I will talk to him.
Why do you interact with that rowdy?
What is the necessity that you want the girl he loves?
He wants the girl I love.
Have you seen how arrogantly he is speaking?
Do one thing.
Leave this city and come to Vizag with me.
I will not come.
Dont talk like that.
Why do you want to stay here.. ..and have a dispute with that rowdy.
Why do you try to scare me?
What if he is a rowdy?
What is his specialty?
I am also a rowdy.. .. if anyone tries to interferes in my matter.
Beat me.
I kicked my mother when I was a kid.
She never beat me.
I kicked my father when I have grown up.
He never beat me.
You shouldnt have leaved him brother.
You must have killed him there itself.
What is the need for that?
He only announced that.. ..he can die ten times for her.
"Not to mention, your Jedi friends caused an unspeakable amount of damage!"
The bill must be paid!
"Oo, I have an idea, how about we DON'T pay the bill?"
"Qui Gon, you old piece of shit!"
How are you?
"What's the matter, old buddy?"
You face is crustier than a patch of wookie butt fur!
Gross!
"Whoah, you look terrible"
"Maybe you need a Viagra prescription... ...to turn on your lightsaber, you know what I mean?"
This kid doesn't.
"Seriously though, are you losing your edge or what?"
You're absorbing more abuse than a hutt tampon!
(sorry)
The Qui Gon I knew would have been kicking my teeth in right now.
"Hey, I'm just kidding, it's all in good fun."
Put 'er there!
(laughs)
"Alright now get out of here, you old creep."
Why don't you take this kid with you?
I know you're into that.
"Seriously though, kid, watch out for that guy."
He uh... he has a past.
Look at him.
Such a... bumbling creature.
So foolish.
He's made of so much skin.
I will make him part of us.
Yes!
I will wear his face!
Look how much the others hate him!
Almost as if they wish he was gone.
"And only after that call themselves lndian! very good, dear!"
I am glad to see your patriotism!
Ms. seema.. your patriotism has cast a spell on me. can I expect to have one more meeting with you?
"lf it won""t happen, then it will be my bad luck."
"You have come so close, that staying apart is out of the question."
Thanks a lot.
"Mr. Diwan, give me the permission to leave."
"Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Rajesh."
Thank you very much for the nice food.
Yes!
"- Hello! sP Rajesh please! sorry, sir! sP sir is not here!"
There is a gift for him.
You can take it. keep a close watch on all the trucks.. ..passing through Dharampar road.
"What""s your name?"
- A patriot!
Hello!
Today I have nabbed you!
"- What happened, constable?"
You will find out soon! search the truck! okay! - come on!
Why is this truck empty?
"lt""s not a crime to drive empty truck, constable!"
"lt""s a crime!"
This truck is used to deliver goods.
"And it""s a crime to drive empty truck."
"Henceforth I shouldn""t see it empty!"
Got it?
"Let""s go!"
"When I signaled you to stop, why didn""t you stop?"
I am sorry.
"I didn""t see the signal. okay!"
We will find out soon! constables! search the truck and frisk them! sure! sure!
Hey!
I'll never meet Radha!
Never!
I just asked for Radha's hand in-marriage.
And not asked for her in alms.
Kishan!
"- See, how he humiliated us."
"At least have some shame, you insolent!"
"No, father!"
Don't do that.
He has given many tests of love.
He's really a noble man.
"If this will not happen, no body will trust love."
We've spent every year in tears.
Only... only for your prestige.
"Father, I'm begging for my love."
Give my love to me.
And you... is this the reward you gave me for my love?
Is this the reward of my love?
Tell me... tell me.
- Father!
Tell me...
Tell her that her father is dead.
He's dead.

What sort of parents do you think we are?
- Do you really want me to answer that?
"- That's enough, missy."
- Why would we damage you?
- We made you.
"Honestly, Georgia, this attitude is..."
Welcome to the tragic universe that is my sad life.
Why?
I'll give you five major reasons why.
"Number one, my parents are from the Stone Age."
"- No us, no you."
- God knows what you'd do.
- You understand?
You wouldn't exist.
- Yeah.
"Number two, they hate me having a life 'cause theirs are practically over and mine's just starting."
- And it's not good enough.
- Honestly.
Every year it's...
- Number three. ...a performance...
My little sister's bonkers.
Poor Angus will need even more therapy than me.
- A lot of trouble! ...because of your fifteenth birthday...
- Number four... ...it's not good enough. - ... my nose is the size of Jupiter. ...so ungrateful.
- I need to go into an ugly home.
"- Georgia, what have you gone and done now?"
How did you manage to pluck them all so quickly?
"You haven't, have you?"
"Oh, crikey."
"Bob, she shaved them."
"Number five, I'll never get a boyfriend."
What's the hurry with growing up so fast?
"'What, love marriage?'"
"'What, love marriage?'"
"'What, love marriage?'"
"'What, love marriage?'"
Result..
'We believe that a boy and girl.. ..can have only one relation willingly.'
'And that's Raksha Bandhan.'
"So what I, I wasn't successful the first time."
But I still desired for love-marriage.
'Here's my marriage card.'
She handed me the card to her arranged marriage.
The third time I went up to the temple for the love marriage.
But I was slightly late.
No..
When love marriage isn't possible.. ..then what's the point of falling in love?
"Here, keep the glass."
And don't forget to pay him.
Fool.
- Yes!
What are you doing?
"Father, I am frying fritters."
Here.
Keep 10 rupees.
For the household expenses.
-Yes.
And if anything happens to the rose plants in my absence.. ..then I will send you to hell.
"But, Father, how is that possible?"
"Quiet, fool."
How many times have I said keep the ignition running.
That heroine will come any moment.
- Where do you want to go?
All India Radio.
"I-I mean, the scars healed really well."
"- Hey, Stifler."
- Eat shit.
What was that all about ?
- He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.
- Who told you that ?
"What do you mean, ""no comment"" ?"
- Did you two hook up or something ?
"- What, are you kidding ?"
No.
Then how did all this get started ?
"Well, I guess it's all right for me to tell you now."
That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.
"Cheese, please."
"Finch comes up to me and says, ""Jessica,"
"I need your help with this, blah, blah, etcetera."""
"So I said, ""All right."
"Pay me 200 bucks, and I'll tell a couple of girls that you're dynamite in bed."""
"So he did, and I did."
- That actually works ?
"- Well, duh !"
Of course.
"Naturally, I embellished a little bit."
Did you hear that Finch had an affair with an older woman ?
[ Chuckling ]
"No, I didn't hear that one."
That one was my favorite.
[ Laughing ]
"Do that cheerleader. - - Thank you, baby - - She wants me."
She calls me up--
- How sweet it is to be loved by you --**
"Oh, my God, you're gay !"
Who are you?
Why are you standing there and blocking the entrance?
Please come in sir.
Please have this seat sir.
"This is the house of a poor man, built with a lot of effort."
"Come here, he is Badri, a very famous man."
He has a very big heart.
He is the king of Telangana.
He does not go to anyones home.
He visited only ours.
"She is Shailaja, my daughter."
"Will you get some coffee, my dear?"
She is learning dance.
He brought that rowdy with him.
One scoundrel joined another.
You leave quickly.
What about the coffee?
I will take care of all that.
You leave now.
Otherwise you may not meet that guy.
Why did the young girl become an old woman?
"Sir, coffee!"
Please take it.
She is my mother in law.
But she is more than my mother.
Then why do you make her serve the coffee?
You should have asked your child to do it.
She went to the temple for her prayer.
She should have gone after an hour.
After an hour the priests will close the temple and leave.
My child has a lot of devotion for God.
There is a temple on the side and that side too.
"I'll go check it, so you wait here."
"Ah, it's a cave."
There was a passage in this kind of place.
Pura and his mom must have entered through here.
Pura!
Don't do anything suspicious.
"If you do, the baby elephant won't survive."
Pura!
"Atom, right?"
What's behind that waterfall?
Are you not going to tell me?
There is a passage leading to where wild animals are...
-What?
Real animals?
-Is that for sure?
"All right, guide us to there."
"Hey, surely they are not going to cut our heads off for real, right?"
"They will just pretend to do it, unless they have some kind of breakdowns."
Breakdowns?
"My, that's horrible."
It's Zora.
It's looking this way.
Hey!
I made you!
Help.
My blood is draining to head.
You will fall if you keep wriggling.
Stop!
"Hello, hello."
Control Center!
Zora has escaped the surveillance and has invaded the wild animal protection area!
"Atom, don't do anything suspicious."
YJ shoes.
I put my initials on it as well as our team B.A.P.
"To the left, you see this side and to the right, that side."
Walk like this.
Then B.A.P will show.
"So for the left shoe, I drew on the outer side."
"And for the right shoe, I drew on the inner side."
And on the back is our Matoki.
It's good.
I'm 150% satisfied.
It came out very well.
I got some good help.
It's good!
It's great!
I'll be wearing these shoes the day I go back to Korea after the tour.
The sun will be up soon.
The sun should be up soon.
It's 7:10AM now
It's 15 degrees (Fahrenheit) out right now.
"From this street, you can see buildings and bridges over the rivers."
I think the view here is the best in early morning.
"Right now it's early morning, so the setting matches ""Coffee Shop"" perfectly."
"What we're going to do now is, we'll start filming first."
What we'll be filming is.
You two standing like this while alternating singing.
"Lip sync, then that'll be it. - oh no."
- Why?
We both wore hats.
- Both of you?
- But we meet each other in this scene.
Dae Hyun and I were both supposed to be wearing hats.
But I heard later there's a scene where we meet each other.
- It's okay.
- Cemre and Zeynep are also waiting downstairs.
They didn't let them inside either.
They're waiting at the door.
Cemre came here to make an appearance?
What business does she even have here?
Her husband is the one who  made them put you in here.
"Handan Hanım, let us not talk about things we don't know."
- They sent you letters.
- You brought them with you?
They will control them first.
Then you will have the letters.
Cemre also sent you some food and drinks.
"And Zeynep, some clothes."
We have only 15 minutes.
And we'll spend that talking about Cemre and Zeynep?
"Okay, don't start arguing again."
So?
"Is there any problems, anything bothering you here?"
"No, why would anything bother me?"
Thank God...
- It is fine.
- Stay away from the bad lot.
"Yes, son, you won't spend much time here."
Just make sure you don't get in trouble.
Just close your eyes and ears.
Don't let it happen like the last time.
"Okay, don't worry."
It's not the first time I end up here.
- I talk to your lawyer everyday.
"- Me too, son."
I call him everyday.
"I am ASlAN, Man."
Who cares?
"Dude, Asian guys are the bottom of the totem pole (Slap) Owwww.."
"""Bottom of the totem pole""?"
That is the most low self-esteem crap.
I have ever heard
This is a fact
The only people that say Asian guys are the bottom of the totem pole are Asian guys!
I have never heard a girl go
I don't date Asian guys cuz they are
The bottom of the totem pole
Oh my god.
You are so right!
Never heard that before... from a girl
Asian guys!
Why are we so pessimistic?
We are smart
We are clean
We don't sweat a lot.
We are exotic.
We are super exotic!
Asian guys are really at the bottom of the totem pole which we are not it's not cuz we are ugly or cuz we smell bad
It's cuz we have little.....
Confidence
Yeah.
Confidence.
You..
"You were thinking something dirty,"
Weren't you?
"Asian guys, we need to stand up."
We need to stand up and... and be brave.
We need to stand up and grow a pair
Thank you sweetie.
"Happy birthday, sister.May your face always smile."
"Thank you, abiciğim."
I wish you a happy and healthy life.
Amin.
"- Fatmagülcüğüm, may your wishes come true, my child.- Thank you."
I am glad that you were born.
Thank you.
"Kerim Abi, everyone gave their presents.But we couldn't see yours."
He gave his present yesterday.
"Go on, cut your cake."
You see what happened to you because you didn't listen to me.
You'll do as I tell you from now on.What happened has happened.
It can't be helped.
Your blood will fade from the ground.
But you will be left alone.
It is already decided.Mustafa won't accept you anymore.
Don't cry.
Look.
Don't cry.
I was just outside for a minute.You know how everyone was staring at me?
Like this.
They're talking about you.
They say that it happened with your permission.
"You did it with your own will, they say."
- No...- Shh.
"- There were four people.- Shut up, someone will hear."
I know their faces.They were four.
Stop saying four.One was more than enough to ruin your life.
Mustafa can't help you.But I will.
"I will help you get up.And we'll go home, okay?"
You're not safe here.
My Goodness!- I heard that uncle Hasan is afraid of Turunc Nadir.
I made Giray tell him as if Kenan said that he has to take his complaint back or...
Turunc Nadir will get to know about it..
You really don't know?
Did you wake up?
Come.
I didn't know you were home.
"We work at night girl, I wake up only now."
"While you sleep, probably nothing will be left to the bazaar."
I am waiting for you many hours already..
Wait I will wash my face and we will go.
I will leave as you will go to bazaar.
"I am sorry.- No dear, that takes the cake!"
I will come again.
Goodbye!
Say hello to your mom!
-Yes of course!
It means I was deceived but this**** girl and I didn't know.
The account for this will be asked.
"Here you are,- Thank you!"
Have a nice day! &amp;gt; Good day!
"I'm alright, I'm good, sweetie, don't worry."
"Okay , we'll talk later."
"Okay, my dearest, kisses for you too."
Bye - bye!
Are you done?
If yours (Orkun) is worried you can go if you want.Don't let him reproach later.
"I was talking with Eylul, she calls constantly to ask how I am."
Again.
"If you have things to do, I won't keep you."
If you are going to meet and so on...
You start to cop out right away?
"No problem we can do it later too, the important thing is that you know and don't object."
That's my work boat.
Your work boat?
"Very good, then pay it on your own!"
"Okay, Mert, we'll talk later."
"Yaman, come on son, today is the big day."
You are in the last level now.
Ah yes!
-You didn't eat anything.
I ate something
I think these frowning eyebrows are from exam's stress and...
I wish you good luck.- Thank you!
I am leaving!-Aren't we going together? :
"No, no need."
I can go on my own.
I don't want to go all together.
"It can't be, Yaman!"
I have to introduce you to the people from interview.
These things are important son.
Come on!
"I will take my jacket ,Coming..."
Madam we have to do the processing.
Please!
"No, it's impossible!"
"No- Look, don't cause trouble!"
"This can't be like this, you have to inform us first... there has to be done something before."
We sent you the notification.
I am doing my work madam.
Don't interfere please!
Don't cause trouble.
Permit us to enter in.
"Dad we are going to be late, what's happening?- Okay, dear."
"Choi Chul Joo tried to harm me, but there was always you, and grandfather, and... ..."
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
What?
There's this tall man who wears this black hat.
"When you struck Choi Chul Joo, didn't you meet him?"
The man who helped the women's parents stop the boat from leaving!
- That man rescued me!
- Did you meet him?
So you do know him!
Don't you know who he is?
"He said he couldn't reveal his identity, so I didn't see his face."
Did you see it?
Do you know who he is?
He hid his identity from me.
It is not up to me to reveal it.
But I still want to see his face.
"I'm really good-looking, aren't I?"
You shouldn't look at me too often.
You'll only spoil yourself for other men.
I wasn't looking at you.
So you know how to be shy too?
What was that?
Why do you carry such a dirty thing with you?
It's a pouch.
That thing?
It's embroidered too!
Where is that thieves' mountain retreat?
"Young Miss always blindfolds me when we go, so I don't know."
"But if he's the one that took her, she should be safe."
"She was taken by force, I'm worried."
"If she went voluntarily, then I'm more worried!"
Is there no way to find her without causing too much commotion?
But it's a lie
Not to them
So tell them the truth
If it helps you lie.
Janelle are you getiing any of this?
Me too.
I'm just testing you
"Look, sir."
All you gotta do is go back out there tell them you actually slept with Janelle and it pops### their whole balloon. it's over.
"I can't do that, Mike."
I didn't sleep with Janelle.
I'm gonna sully### her good name just to save my political hide###.
Sully.
Janelle bagged the mayor of the city.
"Am I right, janelle?"
Give me some
We'll work on it
Why are we stopping here?
I thought we were going to lunch
Bennet.
We need to talk
"Yo, carter, I thought we agreed we wasn't gonna it's all right."
These are my friends.
So they know about us
"Oh, my god, it's a gay boxer"
Bennet. lightheavy
I had you pegged for cruiser.
"That's a good idea Stuart, taunt the professional ass kicker"
I'm not afraid of him.
I used to box in college
You're way out of your league
Does anybody else smell that?
"We're gonna be late.- Be a good boy in there, okay?"
Are you really okay?
"You look very pale, my child.Come, take my arm."
"- Are you here, jerk?- Kerim what are you doing."
Collect yourself.
I will make you pay for everything you did.
"- Come on, Kerim."
What are you doing?- He can't stare at us from there.
"- Abi, it's okay."
"Not here.- Come on, walk inside Kerim."
- He lost it again.
"Take him inside.- Okay, leave it to me."
"- Fatmagül...- We're come, we're coming."
"It's your turn Fatmagül, okay?Don't let them scare you."
"Be brave, stand straight."
You will be victorious.We will be.
My knees are shaking.
My whole body feels stiff.
I've waited for this day for months.
I've waited patiently.
It's time for revenge.
It's time to stand against thosewho tried to take my life away.
Why are you looking at me with hatred?
Why?
Because I didn't yield to you?
Because I didn't loose against youand I didn't accept the life you forced upon me?
You expect me to hang my head in shame as I walk before you.
I'm not the one who should be ashamedand you know that well.
Hence the hate in your eyes.
You wanted to clean your dirty consciences by staining me.
Even giving up your honors for it.
"*""We won't hurt you."
I thought I'd die from hunger.
Ha-seok!
I've something to tell you.
What?
Slow down.
I've got tons to say too.
"Let's eat first, then talk."
You said you were hungry.
Sook-hyun!
"Try this, it's great."
Once a fireman rescued a girl from a blaze.
"Everyone else gave up on her, but he charged in like a madman."
"The fireman and the woman, they survived against crazy odds."
"So the fireman and the girl started dating, right?"
"No, he dated her sister."
She was the woman of his dream.
Aren't you glad to see me?
"I keep doing sign language, so I forget how to speak."
"I remember how to say it with my hands, but not with words."
It stays at the tip of my tongue.
"But there are words that even if I remember,"
I can't say.
Maybe I just wanted to hear it from you first.
"I have something to say too, but not here."
"This isn't a sky lounge, and there's no wine."
I can't treat you like a princess.
Hey hey!
What's going on here?
You shouldn't use public equipment for these purposes.
Can our model fireman act in this way?
Give us an explanation.
"OK, stick closer."
There isn't one penny at the bank
We could find the money here
What if we don't find anything?
"I dunno, but I'm sure we'll find something"
Hopefully
"What's all this, grandpa?"
To know just how much I still remember you
It's all mine?
All of it is yours
"And when you get bored of it, I'll buy you more toys"
We'll play together
And they won't play with us?
"No, they have another game they're playing, nevermind them"
Let's just play together random stuttering
Grandpa
What?
They're all asleep
"Good, I needed to tell you a secret"
What secret?
A very big secret but you can never tell anyone
No-one?
Yes
Ok I won't
"No you'll tell them, but I'll tell you when to tell them"
Okay
What's wrong dad?
Are you gonna kill us?!
Hunting season has begun!
Hunting?
Yes!
Have you forgotten how great of a hunter I was?
"Come on, we're going to fayoum to go hunt ducks"
"Wow, it is gone."
What is this?
I missed the opportunity.
Is she that beautiful?
Who may be the blessed person that gave birth to.. ..such a beauty?!
She is from the abode of the gods.
Give me 2 liters.
Wait for 5 minutes.
We are in important discussion.
You came without knowing the name or address of the girl?
I could not find.
- Why was that happened?
What will you do here without those details?
That is the issue I am unable to solve.
Nothing is there to solve.
Just forget about her.
Why do you discourage him like that?
Encourage him.
Look here my dear Salim - My name is Venkat.
No.
If you are searching for your Anarkali then you are Salim.
You look so dynamic.
Why are you.. ..listening to this burnt out fellow?
Thats it.
"Look here, dont be depressed that you missed her."
Search!
- There is nothing you cannot find if you search.
"Who are you sir, giving advice freely?"
"Ranga Rao, a big name in the states."
I came here now.
I am planning to settle down in Warangal.
Thinking to settle in Warangal?
I am coming....
Here.. drink...
I threw my beautiful daughter into the fire with my own hands.
She had so many opportunities!
I fell under the spell of this huge mansion.
"But, now, I am in pain inside."
My daughter has no more tears left from crying so much.
This fire is going to consume me and you..
"Look, Naciye... you look like this, but.. ... you are a mother, too."
How do I look?
Frizzy haired Naciye from Odakli Village..
"Look, idiot.."
"Pay for the soda, then leave... is this a charity house?"
Here.. if only your soda had some flavor!
"Rude, insolent!"
Idiot!
Thank you.
"Ya, Yasar..?"
Is he still not using anything?
"That is, Mustafa, in that condition?"
"Look, I am going to say something, but..."
"Maybe, Mustafa is faking?"
This is Mustafa Bulut we are talking about!
"Medicines, needles, mean nothing to this man!"
"Abi, I told you, I saw it with my own eyes!"
The man doesn't recognize any of us!
Don't you think I would know from his gaze?
Of course!
Why would he fake this?
"Well, maybe he is trying to guilt you all, because you put him in the nut house."
"It's possible, isn't it?"
"You can go tomorrow, and see for yourself, then!"
They said he only recognized Narin from a picture and pointed her by his hand.
"And they say ""Maybe, if Narin sees him, it will be good for him."""
I won't go.
Nobody can make me go there.
I will die..
Why do you bring this topic up when she is here.
You know better...
I had to say it Mom.
"Of course, it is up to her..."
They are cursed by many people.
"Now, these curses take their toll on their children."
I have never cursed.
This is not my curse...
Not my curse...
It is from my Lord...
"How is Duriye, Doctor Bey?"
Her blood pressure is normal now.
I gave her a medicine and she is sleeping.
"But, we have to be careful."
"It doesn't matter if we are careful, her son is always on her mind."
Have you talked to Narin?
I told her everything.
"But, You have to see it from her side."
Narin said she won't go.
She already did what she wanted to do to us.
She had Mustafa wrapped around her finger.
"She stole my husband, too."
She must be laughing at us right now.
You don't eat...
You don't drink...
"And then you don't have any strength for anything, of course..."
Does a wheelchair suit a handsome young man like you?
- Find her quickly!
"- Yes, Sir!"
Try and stand up.
You should act more like a lady.
You got hurt because you involved yourself with thieves.
But it's fun.
You must think this is fun because you've never been hurt before.
But it's not fun if you're really hurt.
"Yes, I've never been hurt before."
Because I never got involved in anything.
Now you know that you can get hurt if you get involved in things you don't know about.
Just live like you normally live.
I let you do all this because I thought you knew where your boundaries were.
But you crossed that boundary today.
But I was worried about you.
That's crossing the boundary.
You can't come any closer.
Go back behind your boundary.
You're smart so you should understand.
Yes.
I understand very well.
Then go home.
Hong Gil Dong!
"Because of you, I hurt myself for the first time."
But I don't mind being hurt for you.
That's because you've never been badly hurt before.
I'm scared of the pain.
"But if I'm that scared, then perhaps I should stop."
- Don't come to the mountain again.
- Then come here in two weeks.
I'll wait for you.
For the last time.
Awesome.
You'd do that for me?
"Yeah, I would."
"First you have to get your audition tape put together, and, uh, Mr. Collins has final say."
Don't worry about the camera.
"I normally only loan it out for a couple of days, but for you, you can keep it for as long as you want it."
Thanks.
Let me know if there's ever anything I can do for you.
Good luck on your audition tape.
I hope we'll be working together soon.
Count on it.
"What are you gonna do for your audition tape, Liz?"
I'm not sure yet.
Something with substance.
"Well, I don't know about you guys, but I want to be the director."
How hard can it be?
I choreographed all our best cheers this year.
I'm sure I can handle a little news show.
"Hello, future fans and news junkies."
Make room for Sweet Valley's new Barbara Walters.
Since when are you interested in journalism?
Journalism?
It's TV news.
"Easy, Babs."
You have to research and write your own stories.
"Details, details."
It's a small price to pay for having my face in every classroom.
"Hey, Winston!"
What's up...
Patman?
"Now, why so suspicious?"
"""Winston""?"
"My story is, I can't work, because who else would look after my kids?"
"My wife passed away, my children's mother."
I've got a 20 year old son who is sick.
He's a retard.
We have to tie him up all day to stop him wandering off.
Fourteen people live in this place.
"We have no electricity, no water, no drains."
But we are still alive.
God will not forget us.
He created us.
That is what I believe.
God wouldn't have created this population just to forget us.
[muffled chatter]
[man speaking native language]
[muffled chatter]
Ayomatty:
My name is Ayomatty.
I've been in Dubai for 13 years.
"I work as a gardener, and I am very happy."
man speaking native language:
There is no work at home.
It's more profitable to come to Dubai.
I'm here to earn money to send back to my kids.
man speaking native language:
"Pray, be seated. woman:"
All you think about is your belly.
[man speaking native language] man:
Did you see the fence fell down in those thistles?
Goddamned thistles everywhere.
And you think I'm a prick.
[laughter]
man:
"Don""t worry, sir."
Friendship is nothing compared to duty. very good!
This is what I expected from you.
Now you can declare him a criminal.
"And declare a reward of 50,000 rupees on his arrest. okay, sir."
- Thank you!
All the best!
How come you all are here today?
What has brought you here?
"What""s the matter, Mr. Diwan?"
- Where is shekhar?
I dismissed him a long time ago.
"But what""s the matter? shekhar has disappeared with gold worth 7 crores."
Gold worth 7 crores!
"Well done, shekhar!"
Great!
"You have served our country well! served? constable, our country needs gold desperately! our country could have got gold worth 7 crores! shekhar should receive a reward for this deed!"
"Bhuta singh, you too are misunderstanding!"
- How so?
You brought gold worth 100 rupees. okay.
But when did I bring it?
Just assume that you brought gold worth 100 rupees. okay.
- How will you make the payment?
By giving the goods.
- How much?
"For gold worth rupees 100, I will sell it at 200. so it""s a loss to the country."
Goods worth 100 came in.
"And goods worth 200 went out. constable, how can this be a loss to the country?"
The gold entered the country for free.
That is what I am asking.
Where is that gold?
"That is the problem, constable."
If I kill him now.. ..he will become a hero in her eyes.
He must not become a hero.
"Hey Godess Laxmi, daughter of ocean God."
Take the Arathi baby.
Why are you looking me like that?
I have really changed.
I promise.
Come here I will explain you.
I accept that I am a bad man.
But I am not a bad father.
Sit down.
For the first time in my life I worshiped the God.
I took one decision after I prayed to all the Gods.
To perform your marriage with Venkat.
You are not understanding me.
I am not against your love.
I just want to know one thing.
"What is the difference.. ..between me, who is useless and him?"
I dont have any job and neither does he.
I am spending my time in clubs and he in the petrol bunk.
I dont have any shame so I am running this family.. ..by borrowing money from others.
But he is very hotblooded.
What will he do?
How will he earn money and look after you?
The house owner does not understand your love.
He demands his rent every month.
"The milk man, the provision store owner.. ..no one will understand your love."
Every one demand money.
How will you manage?
Did I say anything wrong?
He is also trying for a job.
What is his fault if he failed?
"Really, you made me so happy by coming here."
I was so touched that day...
"I couldn't stop the car, you couldn't talk with Yaman..."
"Enough to know that he is fine, I will come from time to time to see him even if it's from distance."
It's okay even if I don't talk.
It's enough for me to know that he is happy.
What's up?
Fine! &amp;gt; It's been a while we have met.
Do we use to meet in the past?
What's happening to you?
Let me know if we are on outs.
"No... far from it, why should be on outs.. for being on outs... there has to be a communication... right?"
What? &amp;gt; All the best with your studies!
See you!
Rudeness...
"He has grown in the mud but ,my kid didn't become dirty."
Don't let him become dirty!
Keep it if you want.
Really?
- Take !. there are more in the photo album.
Do you love Yaman?
"Yes...I mean like a friend,i love him.."
I have a boyfriend.
We are together for a long time.
Do you love him then?
"In fact if you look, it's very stupid to think of something like sitting here... but Orkun was always in my life, from my childhood."
We grew up in the same aquarium.
"I don't know if it's really love, habit or we got used to each other..."
We get on well.
"I mean Orkun is very nice, cheerful, ..."
Funny.. -Yaman is funny too...
"Yes, Yaman Is very different of course..."
Whoa!
"Sarcasm, that's original!"
"""Where are the gold bars you were supposed to pull out of that bank vault with your transmatter ray?"""
"""Obviously it failed or it would be in the papers."""
"Well, no, they're not gonna say anything in the press but..."
Behold!
Transported from there to here!
The molecules tend to shift during the...
Transmatter.... uh... events.
But they were transported in bar form.
And they clearly were...
"And by the way it's not about making money, it's about taking money."
Destroying the status quo because the status is not quo.
The world is a mess and I just...
Need to rule it.
I'm gonna...
Smells like cuman.
So transmatter is 75%.
And more importantly the freeze ray is almost up.
This is the one.
Stops time.
Freeze ray.
Tell your friends.
We have...
"Oh, here's one from our good friend Johnny Snow."
"""Dr. Horrible, I see you are once again afraid to do battle with your nemesis."
"I waited at Dully Park for 45 minutes."" Okay, dude."
You're not ... my nemesis.
My nemesis... is Captain Hammer
Captain Hammer corporate tool.
He dislocated my shoulder.
Again.
A man came by here earlier today.
He said it was wooden buckshot.
"Told me if anyone got in our way,"
I'm supposed to shoot 'em.
What else did he say?
If Abby didn't find the location of some coffins...
I'm supposed to shoot myself.
What about me?
What did he say about me?
I'm not supposed to hurt you.
Are you sure?
Because...
These ropes are so tight that it is hurting me.
What can I do to help?
"Every time I move, the wood shifts inside of me."
I can feel it scraping against my heart.
You need to get the pieces out.
Aahh!
What took you so long?
I've been hiding behind your witchy friends.
"And in squalor, no less."
Insulting a bunch of dead witches...
Not smart.
I made the exact same mistake first time I came in here.
"Well, you know the funny thing about the witches is that living or dead, they care about their own."
A hundred dead witches have a thousand living descendents...
And I have no problem killing every last one of them if I don't get my coffins back.
"As we speak, my hybrid friend is prepared to end the Bennett line."
Now.
Please...
Show me the coffins.
Here we are.
(Applause)
That's right.
"Now, since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators,"
I need to make sure that they are all working properly.
"Would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number, please?"
How about a two-digit number?
Audience:
22.
AB:
22.
"And another two-digit number, sir?"
Audience:
47.
AB:
"Multiply 22 times 47, make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working."
"Do all of you get 1,034?"
"1,034?"
Volunteer:
No.
AB:
594.
Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there.
(Applause)
"Would you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case?"
"OK, great."
What I'm going to try and do then --
I notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.
That's OK.
I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator.
"There is something called the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself."
"For instance, five squared would be?"
Audience:
Looking good.
Different and uncommon.
"lndeed, Reporter Jung of B.A.P."
He's a sensitive man who knows how to be romantic.
It's just piece of art no matter how you take it!
I heard that bridge was built in 1935.
"lts height is similar to that of ""63 building"" in Korea. &amp;lt;""The island across from here is the world's largest prison""&amp;gt; Wow, that?"
- That looks like an island.
- That's the world's largest prison?
I heard there are Dementors living inside.
Look at him enjoying nature.
It's freezing.
It would be so much fun to have a concert in a place like this.
My hair is stiff because of all the mousse I have in there.
That goes totally well with him.
He's got the aura.
Doesn't he look like a celebrity?
The wind is crazy.
I'm happy but it's cold.
It's always cold.
You can't tell on screen.
But this is a cliff.
I'm scared.
So when I was shooting that scene
I felt like it was life or death for me.
Great job.
Hi.
We're in San Francisco.
It's supposed to be a normal street in a town but the aura is totally different.
Taking pictures anyway still looks professional.
It's cold.
This is a port city in San Francisco.
He will go in and Kuzey Tekinoğlu will go out.
That was the deal.
"Yes, he's the one who offered to go to prison instead of an innocent person."
You're still so sure about Kuzey's innocence.
You're both the prosecutor and the judge of your father's case.
That man isn't my father.
He's a killer.
"Whoever pulled the trigger Kuzey or his men, doesn't matter."
They are not more guilty than Ferhat.
"So yes, an innocent person killed Ferhat."
Mirza knew he would die soon.
And when I told him Kuzey's story he wanted to help him.
But now... ... it hurts to know that he's spending his last days like that.
Wish I could see him at least for the last time.
"Okay, I'll try to do something."
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.
I went and checked on the Makara stalls a few times.
"- Everything's going smoothly, don't worry."
"- Okay, good."
Soon you'll be out of here anyway and get back to business.
We'll see.
It's too early to talk about that.
I'll handle the business until you're out.
Don't worry about it.
- Thank you.
- There's not much until 4th of the month.
The visitation is over.
"Warden, could you please give us 5 more minutes."
It was already over 5 minutes ago.
"Okay then, talk to you later."
God be with you.
"Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine"
Dressmaking's easy Every customer's call
Brings a whole new revision
Have to pick up the pace Still hold to my vision
"That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor."
"French haute couture, please."
What if it rains?
Galoshes!
More balloons!
"Oh no, that's too many balloons."
More candy!
"Oh, less candy."
"Oh wait, I know."
Streamers!
-Streamers?
-Whose dress is this?
Streamers it is.
What?
Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
"No, I just want my dress to be cool."
Do you not like the color?
"The color's fine, just make it look cooler."
Do you not like the shape?
"The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler."
It needs to be about 20% cooler.
All we ever want is indecision
All we really like is what we know
Gotta balance style with adherence
Making sure we make a good appearance
Even if you simply have to fudge it
Make sure that it stays within our budget
Got to overcome intimidation
Hello!
May I speak to your sister?
- Sure.
Don't hide your face.
I recognised you as soon as I saw you.
My husband died 4 years ago.
I have been looking for you ever since in order to apologise to you.
To apologise to me?
- Yes.
He told me everything about you before his death.
So you know that... - Suraj is your son.
And I also know the circumstances under which my brother died.
I am ashamed of myself.
I was very mean to you.
Forgive me if you can.
"- What are you doing, sister?"
Since the day I have learned the truth... ...
I have not considered Suraj my son but your safe keeping.
And I am waiting for the moment when I can give him to you.
Suraj must never learn the truth.
He is an excellent pilot.
He will soon marry Renu.
They have a bright future together.
"If he learns that it is not you but I who am his mother,... ... a woman who has spent 12 years in prison for murder,... ... he will be shattered."
He won't be able to hold his head high.
His life will be destroyed.
Don't you care about your own life?
Won't you accept your son after going through so much pain?
Only you have the right to be called his mother.
You are responsible for what he is today.
"But, Suraj is your son."
"No, sister."
I can let Emily answer that.
"""Last night, on Allhallows' Eve... ...Father Moore tried to cast six demons from my body."
They refused to go.
"After the attempted exorcism..."""
"*I was taken to my room,* *and I fell into a deep sleep. *"
"*I awoke a few hours later,* *hearing a voice calling out my name. *"
"*""Again, I heard a voice* *calling my name. *"
It was the Blessed Holy Mother of God.
And when I looked at her... ...she smiled at me and said:
"'Emily, heaven is not blind to your pain.""'"
She said the Virgin Mary spoke to her in the middle of a field?
- Yes.
- And do you believe her?
I believe Emily spoke the truth.
Please continue.
"*""I asked the Blessed Mother,* *'Why do I suffer like this?""'*"
Why did the demons not leave me tonight?
"*""She said, 'I am sorry, Emily. *"
*The demons are going to stay* *where they are.'*
"*Then she said,* *'You can come with me in peace... *"
*... free of your bodily form... *
*... or you can choose* *to continue this. *
*You will suffer greatly. *
"*But through you, many will come to* *see that the realm of the spirit is real. *"
"*The choice is yours.""'*"
I choose to stay.
"""In the end, good will triumph over evil."
Through my experience... ...people will know that demons are real.
People say that God is dead.
"But how can they think that... ...if I show them the devil?"""
Did you see these wounds on both of Emily's hands and both feet?
Yes.
You will surely meet me.
Hello!
Hello!
"Law can reach far and wide, shekhar."
"By closing your eyes, don""t think everybody is blind."
"Law won""t spare you."
When did I beg for mercy from law? sP.. if you have any evidence then you can arrest me.
I have not come to arrest you.
I have come here as a friend.
Your wife is missing for the past 4 days.
"Maybe you don""t even know.. whether she is dead or alive."
"This is my personal matter, Rajesh!"
You have no right to interfere! - shut up!
You could stoop to this level.. I could have never imagined!
"You are my friend, Rajesh. l can""t raise my hands on you."
"Don""t put a stigma on friendship, shekhar!"
I am ashamed to call you my friend!
"The man who can betray his country.. ..how can he be anybody""s friend?"
There is a patriot who helps law in every step.
And you.. you have betrayed your country in every step! shame on such a friendship!
"I wish I could rip apart my heart and show it to you, Rajesh."
I wish I could rip apart my heart and show it to you!
Where are my goods?
Where are my goods?
- We want our goods!
You have got the gold!
We want the goods!
From where will we give it to you?
"- I don""t know anything! shut up!"
The police have blasted our den.
The gold perished in the fire!
Now how can we give you the goods? kaka sir..
Everything I worked hard for is happening.
Isn't that part I'm supposed to be happy
Hail
Hey Daddy
First day of your sophomore year.
You're growing up too fast
"Brook, you start making your old man look old"
"Listen, when I get back, what do you say we stop by doctor you know just to touch base##."
It's been a while since we've seen him.*
"Daddy, I'm fine."
I don't need to say him
I stopped by the store on the way home picked up the requested item*
"Dad, I told you..."
I use the kind with wings.
"But these came with , i thought you'd like that."
How long are you gonna be gone this time?**
I'm gonna reorganize the clients' portfolio in New York.
I should be back on Sunday.
I left all the phone numbers with Clara*
I just wanted to go to my routine with you
Are you cutting classes?
My cheerleading routine.
I told you about it.
Just let go.
I'll get it
"Just let go, okay?"
"Brooke', I mean look at me."
I'm trying
"Hey,"
I'm so worshipping your Gwynethness
"So Calvin, but hi, Brooke mutual admiration society is screeching to a dead halt*"
What?
Can I come in?
"- Our Father, who art in heaven..."
- Emily?
Father Moore is here.
Can you come downstairs? - as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread...
"Emily, can you hear me?"
Let's get her off the floor.
"Alice, no!"
"You've suffered a terrible loss, Mr. Rose."
I know this is difficult.
So thank you for being here today.
"Sir, do you often read the Bible?"
"- Yes, I do."
- So do I.
What about the DSM?
The *Diagnostic and Statistical* *Manual of Mental Disorders*... ...commonly referred to as the bible of abnormal psychiatry.
- Have you read that?
- No.
So you're not aware that according to the DSM... ...a person's refusal to eat is a common indication of anorexia?
Objection.
"The witness just said he hasn't read the DSM, Your Honor."
- Sustained.
- Mr. Rose... ...are you aware that catatonic rigidity... ...specifically a locking up of the body's joints... ...is a known symptom of psychosis?
No.
I haven't studied these things.
Have you ever visited an insane asylum... ...or a hospital for the mentally ill?
Once.
My aunt was in one before she died.
Really?
So there's a history of mental illness in your family?
I suppose.
Why do they involve you?
Good heavens...
"Okay, I won't to talk about these now Orkun."
Come here!
Please!
Take me out of this nightmare.
Please I want you to be by my side today.
"Sweety I can't come now, I am at school."
I am solving the registration procedures.
You know our department has the courses selection today.
I can only come at the evening.
Let's do something at the evening.
"Anyway... good, forget about it."
"But, don't..."
Hello?
"What happened again?-Nothing, come on let's get these things done and go right away."
Where do you see yourself after five years?
"Probably I will graduate until then, I will find a job."
"A higher degree?- I don't want a higher degree or something like that, straight to the working life."
"It looks like you're in a hurry, do you have to go somewhere?"
I have one more exam today and...
I am stressed a bit because of that.
"Good, what's your life's philosophy in general?"
Not to quit the right way even in the hardest times.
Hello children.!
Do you know where is Yaman's house?
Yaman Koper?
"I don't know, do you know, dude? &amp;gt; No."
"Okay, but do you know where is the reeve?"
Thank you.
He is coming. &amp;gt; How was it?
"I don't know, Mert give me the scooter's keys."
- I'm glad you're safe.
Have you been hurt?
That evil bastard!
- How dare he hurt my daughter!
- It wasn't his fault I was hurt.
It was my own fault.
I'm afraid that bad rumors may start.
"Now that I am safe, please inform the police to stop searching for me."
"Alright, fine."
"- Granny, take Eun Hye outside."
"- Yes, Sir."
Did you meet him?
I hope he's safe.
"Seeing how the young miss is protecting him, it seems that she has already fallen for him."
I thought you were discussing marriage between the eldest son of the Interior Minister.
Isn't Hong Gil Dong his illegitimate son?
If the marriage negotiations break down because of this...
"If they break down, the Interior Minister's relationship with me ends too!"
We must proceed with the wedding!
"If we have Eun Hye followed, we should be able to catch Hong Gil Dong."
Find him for me and get rid of him!
"If it concerns you and the Interior Minister, then of course we should help you."
Was it really him that I saw?
"No, that's impossible!"
I must have been mistaken.
I came on behalf of everyone because too many people would cause trouble.
Thank you so much.
"If people find out about us, it'll be trouble."
"Since people think that Yongmun solved this problem, let them."
- Don't spread other rumors.
- We know.
What did Yongmun do anyway?
"And today, a human has accused our God."
This is not a personal war.
"lnstead, it's a battle for all humans.. ..who have faith in God."
"So I've decided that l, Siddeshwar Maharaj.. ..and Gopi Maiyya, will go to the court.. ..to give that shameless human a fitting reply."
Down with.. - Kanji!
"Yes, it's a democracy, where everyone is treated equally."
"And now, even God."
Even God will have to stand in the High Court's witness box.. ..where the most dangerous criminals stand for trial.
"Strange, but true."
"I still say, think about it once."
I already have.
Today's the first hearing.. ..and the judge will decide whether.. ..such a case can be accepted or not.
It's a good omen.
Really nice.
Let's go.
Many believers are standing outside the court shouting slogans against Kanji.
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Many 'dharma gurus' have come to the court.. ..to give a reply of Kanji's baseless allegations.
Very few people have been allowed in the courtroom as well.
"Swami, give me your blessings."
"Move aside, no one will touch the swami."
"Move aside, move aside."
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
You shouldn't have come here.
Can't we see them as they're being taken out?
- Maybe you will.
But you can't talk to them.- That'll be enough for me.
What about the girl?
She's here under control.She departed from Istanbul early.
"- So she should be already here.- Be sure, and then talk to me."
"Okay, okay, okay."
- Yes?- Where are you?
I'm here.I've arrived.
"Okay, good."
- See you at the courthouse.- Okay.
- She is here.- What about that dog?
He's on his way.He should be here shortly.
I'm going inside now.
Kadir Bey wants to talk to you.
"Fatmagül, my child.Look, this is a very difficult day for you."
"You have been waiting and preparing yourself for months, for this day."
"It was very important, and also difficultfor you to even come here."
And you managed it.
We will manage to get them punished as well.
Together we will.
You will feel very tense during the trial.
This won't be a surprise.
You will be hurt and affected negativelyby what's going to be talked about in there.
Shortly it will shake you up badly.
"You may feel prepared for anything now.But during the trial, unexpected things can happen."
"It is okay, if you don't want to come."
Trust me and believe methat I will do my best to represent you there.
Don't come to the trialif you ask me.
But the decision is yours.
"My child, it will be better for you."
[people speaking foreign language]
"Yeah, speaking of Ass Violator."
"Oh no, it gets worse."
You've been warned.
[people laughing]
"Wow, that Ugandan pastor would not approve of such behavior."
"Ugh, this video is some s--t, ain't it?"
So to speak.
Why did you guys make me review that?
"And more than that, why is the other elephant just sitting there like,"
"-Yeah, go ahead."
Stick your trunk in there.
"Oh, very nice."
"-Ugh, I don't know."
Maybe that's how this guy gets his peanuts.
"Oh, why did I make that joke?"
"All right, that's it guys."
"Don't make me review anymore videos of nasty turd-burgling elephants, all right?"
"Okay, so I actually do have something interesting for you."
"It's one of those things that's kind of racist but kind of f--ked up, but also kind of funny."
And it's just a commercial for a local mattress store.
"-Hi, I'm Gary."
At the one and only Gary's Mattress.
Now with locations in Koreatown and Little Tokyo.
We are karate-a-chopping a-prices just for you!
Oh cho!
Even we would buy it.
"At Gary's Mattress, we're blowing up prices!"
Yayayaya!
"-Wow, that is unfortunate."
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that I wouldn't buy mattresses from that guy.
"I mean, who's your target demographic when you trash everyone?"
I-I really don't think they liked it.
How do you know that ?
- She's already on a plane back home.
- [ Groans ]
Yeah.
"You know, guys ?"
"Maybe I'm just not good with girls, period."
"No-no-no, really-really."
Like-- Like I was born without that part of the brain.
"I mean, I can't talk to girls."
"And when I do talk to them, I screw it up."
"Yeah, well, come prom those excuses aren't going to do you any good."
- [ Sighs ]
- [ Michelle ]
"And one time at band camp, we weren't supposed to have pillow fights, but we had a pillow fight, and it was so much fun."
"A-And this one time, we all lost our music and we were supposed to play this song, but we didn't know it, so we just made it up and we kept playing and playing, and the conductor didn't know what we were doing, and it was so funny."
"-So, you're pissed about somethin', huh."
-[ Scoffs ]
You know what I do when I'm angry ?
I just play some Bach on my flute.
It's so relaxing.
- I learned to do that at band camp.
"- Hold on, uh--"
You have no idea why I'm angry ?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow ?
Sometimes I get cranky...
- when I know I have a big test to study for.
- [ Laughs ]
- Yeah.
"Yeah, that's pretty much it."
- I thought so...
- because this one time at band camp-- - W-What's your name ?
"Which hospital, what happened to you? :"
Finally I ran off the rails.
Your lawyer knows it.
"What happened, didn't he tell you?"
"No, nobody told me anything."
Why are you at the hospital?
"Anyway, leave it now Yaman."
I need money.
Tomorrow the committee will have a meeting.
"They will decide, they will decide if I am crazy or not."
I have to please someone so that he gives me a sick certificate for being crazy. what are you saying man?
"Yaman, listen to your brother."
"I can't return to jail, if I return I will really go crazy."
"Until tomorrow until midday you find 1000 TL and bring it to me, OK?"
Hello?
Yaman?
"I am not asking if you can find it,i'm saying..find it and bring it."
"Yaman, it's very important, please!"
Where are you?
Which hospital?- My lion!
This is it!
Good morning &amp;gt; Same to you.
"You are so excited, look at your state.-Don't touch me."
"Suzan, today the men will come, you check the invoice, it must be around 500 TL..."
"OK, Mr Selim, don't worry at all."
I won't pay it without having the invoice
Thanks!
"If there is something, you call me."
"While we are here, my sail has to be renovated too."
"Fall in the middle as soon as you find a chance, of course, don't wait at all."
How much do you need?- 8040 EUR
Where am I going to get so much money for you Mert?
He says that we have a stronger hand now that the killer has come out.
"That's great news son, I feel light as a bird."
He says that you will definitely be free in just one session.
Inshallah...
The nightmare will be over.
"- Well, we can't say for sure."
- Kuzey...
Don't think about bad things.
Obviously there's a misunderstanding.
"Yes, son, it's not like they'll keep you here for lifetime... ... just because you called him to the forest."
Do you know anything about that man?
Who is he?
What is his story?
His name is Mirza Çeltik.
Ferhat killed that man's son.
"Actually, got him wounded."
Are you gonna allow me?
Or keep interrupting?
What?
Who says you're the only one who can talk?
"Handan Hanım, did you swallow a microphone or something?"
Why do you sound so loud?
"After the incident, the boy was never the same."
"I don't know what Ferhat did to the boy but... ... in the end, he suicided."
"- Hence, his hatred to Ferhat."
He couldn't track Ferhat until he saw his picture on the newspaper upon Ali's death.
"And then, he chased him down."
Had Ferhat served time in prison because of that?
"When you first met Ferhat, that was why he was in prison."
He could kill a man without blinking an eye... ... just because he is my lover.
He's a monster with bloody hands who does not fear any prison.
That boy was Deniz's lover.
Approximate.
Did you find anything on that flight?
No.
"No, not that I remember, no."
"Of course, the thing I remember most was that landing."
I thought that was absolutely great.
Yes.
Frozen brake and 180.
"Yeah, and then have to run another runway."
"Like I said, He didn't let it bend or whatever"
"Now, the next day"
"I don't know if it was the next day or not, but you mentioned that the bodies started washing -"
"Yeah, even that first day they were picking some up."
"And the second day when we were at the Coast Guard station, yeah."
"They brought in the boats, you know."
"Smaller boats, and the 40-footers..."
"And there might have even been some private boats, I'm not sure."
"I can't remember, but they were consolidating at the Coast Guard"
Station.
But they were bringing the bodies in.
You could see them bringing them in.
They'd be in the fetal position.
For warmth.
I don't think they got them all.
I don't know how many there was but there was enough that -
"That's what they would do, obviously, when they froze to death."
"When they drowned and froze to death or both, a combination, I imagine."
That's bad.
"Hell, about two of them were from Rogers City."
"They left 50, 60 kids and stuff."
It was...
It wasn't anybody from the Island here on it.
ASSPlRATES!........ASSPlRATES!!!
The Albion Brotherhood will help you!!!
That's right.
"Bennet, mess him up"
Oh my god.
Your face.
Your beautiful face
I mean.
"How are you gonna nail all those chicks now, dude"
"Hold on a second, last night your police chief arrested over 60 African Americans and detained them for two hours while the records were check####."
You don't consider that revolting###
Have you ever seen strom thurmond in his gym shorts?
"Alright, remember your 3Ds."
"Deflect, dodge and deny"
"Hold on, you were saying"
"The police chief works for you, Mr Mayor"
And you know what that kind of policy says### to me.
It says that you're a racist.
Don't be ridicious.
I'm not a racist
I marched on Washington in 1963.
I've supported the affirmative action in my entire career
"Here you go, sir."
You got them on the run now.
Now lower the boom.
"In fact, I'm dating a black woman"
Boom
Then who would that be
My secretary
"Okay, well."
We'll take a break and we'll be right back
"Dodged that bullet, Mike?"
Good.
Um.
"Two uh, galleries, online galleries, and stuff like that."
Mm-hm.
"But, I have some real good stuff on there, but."
"You know, we have um, an interesting series, it's, it's um, Wordpress."
"But, we are doing an interesting series with one of our authors, uh, Morton Ran Hendrickson."
"And he's doing this series called Start With A Theme, and he looks at three free Wordpress themes."
And ah looks at how to tweak them best for your website and the one that j ust released was on creative portfolios.
"Oh so you can actually, so you know if there's some advice on how to tweak them."
"Oh, that'd be great."
"Yeah, so, he did one on um, photography portfolios, and then the one that just came out yesterday I think is creative portfolios, and then he's doing another one this fall, on, um."
Magazines.
Styles.
Oh.
Magazine work.
I'd be interested in that one.
Yeah.
"My husband and I have a podcast, uh, uh, and we're using WordPress to kinda fix the audio thing."
Uh.
It's very hard to find a WordPress that actually has a good audio for the internet.
Um.
"We're having an earthquake. , Hm?"
We're having an earthquake.
Usgs?
What?
Yeah.
Oh right now?
"Uh-huh. , check on the USGS's website."
Have you been on the earthquake site?
I always am on the earthquake site.
"Is there, is there an immediate uh?"
"Her father the king said, ""Don't whistle."""
"Her mother the queen said, ""Hai, don't whistle."""
But the princess continued whistling.
(Whistling)
"The years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman, who whistled even more beautifully."
(Whistling)
"Her father the king said, ""Who will marry a whistling princess?"""
"Her mother the queen said, ""Who will marry a whistling princess?"""
But the king had an idea.
He announced a Swayamvara.
He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.
"""Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage!"""
Soon the palace filled with princes whistling.
(Whistling)
Some whistled badly.
Some whistled well.
But nobody could defeat the princess.
"""Now what shall we do?"" said the king."
"""Now what shall we do?"" said the queen."
"But the princess said, ""Father, Mother, don't worry."
I have an idea.
I am going to go to each of these young men and I am going to ask them if they defeated correctly.
"And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."""
"So she went up to each and said, ""Do you accept that I have defeated you?"""
"And they said, ""Me?"
Defeated by a woman?
"No way, that's impossible!"
No no no no no!
"That's not possible."""
"Till finally one prince said,"
"""Princess, I accept, you have defeated me."""
"""Uh-huh ..."" she said."
"I wouldn't [laughter]...thank you, thank you."
Joy:
Just lie down.
Joy:
That'll be $100.
Dr. Joy.
Star:
I was trying to figure out were you going to analyze him or teach him.
[laughter]
Star:
I didn't know which one.
[laughter]
David:
It's funny you would say that because [laughter]
"I feel like, I mean in some ways my life would be so much easier if I were just interested in sex."
"There's a whole...I mean, there's some things that I don't have to worry about."
But there's all kinds of other stuff that I do worry about
I mean I can always exchange one big set of worries for another big set of worries.
Elisabeth:
What about when you're dating?
Like if you're dating someone and you've had romantic relationships in the past is this something you come out and tell them right away?
Do you only date other people who are asexual?
"And if the person you're with is sexual, how do you match up?"
David:
I date people who are sexual.
I pretty much have dated people who are sexual.
Elisabeth:
You tell them right away?
David:
"Yeah, and I tell them."
They find out right away.
I mean it's...I'm pretty out.
"Because Faruk is lying,... because Faruk is an unreliable man."
"Ah,Selim..-An hour long he was droning ""No i'm not a thief,no the business went wrong ""... ..."
"""No, don't worry , when i get the money, i'll pay back..."""
""" Is it not so?"
Couldn't he tell this on the phone?
He wanted to talk face to face - And with it we are alright !
"Again, he wanted to ask for money from you.. and when he saw me, gave up that idea."
And he is taking me for a fool... as i don't understand his mind..
Again he did a wrong calculation.
He couldn't guess we would come together of course.
"It 's enough now, Selim.- And you, if I were not there when he called you, would you tell me? would you tell me come,we go together?"
He is even calling you to come to the hotel..Impertinent( Inappropriate.)
"What is there, he did not want to be seen."
"Anyway you're the lawyer of the other side, but don't forget a common friend of ours is in a very difficult situation."
"Okay, i know, you're right, see you."
"Yes, Burcu."
Okay i know i'm late.
I am on my way.
I am coming to the office.
What?...
"Oh, No..."
Which hospital?
"I am not crazy, I am not crazy man!"
I am not crazy.
Untie me!
"Find my lawyer, let my brother come to me."
"Man is okay, be quiet... - Leave me, i'm not crazy.."
Man i am not mad...
Leave me!
"Untie me ,i'm not crazy- Stop man, stop,they left.."
You will get mad by force!
Did they really inform my lawyer?-Yes they did..&amp;gt; Good...
Probably 50 feet high
There's a picture of the ice house right there.
They put it right up to the heaves.
You can imagine how much - how many tons and tons of ice would be in there.
500 pound case.
"That was to supply the whole island all summer, or?"
"Yeah, in the 40s, yeah."
Probably 90% of them.
There wasn't that many refrigerators then.
"And in the 50s, you got more."
"But the people still that owned refrigerators, there weren't much size to them or anything."
"And even if the people got one, their old ice boxes, I still delivered a lot of ice."
"They delivered every day, pretty much."
Who did?
Dad.
And he knew every size of every ice box.
"One day he might be going along the harbor, next day he'd be out different places."
"Of course, there wasn't any out here then."
"But, Brother's, they'd take a couple hundred pounds every day."
Couple wash tubs.
"One would be full of the pop and stuff, and the other the cooks would use for the lettuce and -"
The Christian Brothers?
Yeah.
The hotels.
Talk a little bit about the Christian
Brothers at that time.
What were they like?
"Oh, real nice friendly guys"
They come here - there'd be two batches.
"I think 40 at a time, maybe."
40 rings a bell.
And then there was - they had a German guy and his wife were the cooks.
And this is the prime communication tool for the congress.
"- We actually position us as European, as international."
"Of course Europe is a very mature market in terms of internet, so we decided to adopt .eu as the main domain of the company."
"- We felt hat if there was a dot-EU, we should clearly be part of it. - .eu Is used because it is a European congress."
- Europe has become an open space in many ways.
"- We are in the European Union, ... yes?"
"Why not use .eu, we are European."
"- In Portuguese, EU spelled e-u, means ""I""."
"- I would say that we are a Portuguese company, but we are also a European company."
We are not a global company - yet.

THE ELUSlVE AVENGERS
"Based on "" Little Red Devils ""  by P. Blyakhin"
Screenplay by Sergey YERMOLlNSKY Edmond KEOSAYAN
Here's our token of appreciation from us to you.
Paul:
"Aw, thank you."
That's a beautiful knife.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Read it."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" What's that say?"
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
What does it say?
Paul:
"It says, ""Prepared for life."""
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
"""Prepared for life."""
Paul: ...I'd like to think I was.
Paul:
I let my Scoutmaster down because I dropped out of
Scouting and it's a big regret for me now.
"But I came out here today, I felt like I've redeemed myself."
I think Scoutmaster McCauley would be proud of me.
I really think he'd be proud of me.
"In the last video, we set up this definite integral to evaluate the volume of the solid of revolution that we set up using the shell method."
"So now, let's just evaluate this thing."
So the main thing is just simplifying this expression.
I'll start off by trying to simplify this part of it.
So that's going to be y plus 1.
"I just ate an apple, so something weird just happened in my throat."
"But anyway, that's done with. y plus 1 minus y squared minus 2y plus 1."
I just expanded out this binomial.
And then that would simplify to-- another apple in my throat moment-- so that's going to be y plus 1 minus y squared plus 2y minus 1.
So this 1 and this negative 1 cancel out.
And let's see.
You get negative y squared plus 3y.
"This challenge tests skills for rifle shooting, pioneering, and first aid merit badges."
There are three tasks.
One... ...hit three targets at a 22-rifle range.
"Two, complete the fourth wall of a pioneering tower."
From the top of this tower... ...shoot a slingshot... ...and hit three targets to retrieve this map.
"Three, follow the map to Lake Ida, then handle a life-threatening situation."
"Paul, you and Will are up on the rifle range first."
Go ahead and take your spots and we'll get started.
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" Get him Big South"
"Will ""Big South:"" All right."
"All right, you guys."
Paul:
I am determined to win this competition.
"I, I want this bad."
And I really hope that my Scoutmaster... ...gets to see me do the best that I can.
Somebody's going to have to cut off one of my limbs to stop me from winning.
"Will ""Big South:"" Honestly, I think the targets are kind of big."
"So I think this is a matter... of speed, and who gets it off first."
NARRATOR:
All right.
Eyes and ear protection are on both.
Rounds are being chambered.
Will is sighting in.
Stand by.
"Three, two, one, commence firing."
And Will has a miss on his first target.
Paul:
I hit something.
NARRATOR:
Paul's first shot takes down his target.
"All right, Will takes down his target."
Paul is sighting in on his second target.
What happened?
What did they say? &amp;gt; Why? &amp;gt; Tell us Yaman!
Later.
"Come on,Mert!"
"What's happening?- I have something to do, I will solve it and be back."
Come on man!
You will take the exam.- I will come until then
"What can be more important than exam? &amp;gt; Yaman!- I will come, don't worry!"
Your exam is at 3 o'clock you have to be her at 2:30.
Can it be that the interview was bad?
Wait for me..
Subtitles brought to you by Ebb and Tide Team @ Viki
"Hello, can I come in?"
"Please Mr. Selim, you're welcome.- I won't take your time..."
I wanted to ask how was the interview?
Take a sit.
Don't say it wasn't brilliant.
"Actually as you said, Yaman is a very intelligent boy."
He shows this with the grades from the previous exams but...
"But... -I don't like these ""but-s"" at all ...by God,"
Really..- I don't think he is suitable for this school.
He is a tensed boy and I found him emotional too. which one of us wasn't like that in that age?
"Yaman is very intelligent, very wise and... hardworking..."
"A determined boy,"
I believe that if he has an opportunity he will be very successful .
Be sure..&amp;gt; You did what you could about him Selim.
After this he will find the opportunity for himself on his own.
According to the grade he will get in the last exam otherwise...
I don't even want to think about a contrary possibility!
Have an easy work!
"Master, I need 1000 TL urgently!"
1000 TL??- As an advance payment. you will cut it from my weekly salary.
The dad.
Good question.
What about the dad?
[ Silence ]
[ Inaudible ]
"Oh, come on."
I don't have to do all the talking.
Who would be-- who was the dad?
Something to do with the dad.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maybe the baby was illegitimate. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Bingo.
Okay.
"So if the baby's illegitimate, who would the dad be?"
"And who would be mad at Lucy for having the baby with the dad? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The wife [inaudible] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The wife of the father, exactly."
Okay.
"So Lucy wasn't married, and the baby wasn't legitimate, and I went with her that day."
She-- we went and confronted the wife schoolteacher who happened to be the father of the baby.
"So Lucy took the baby; we walked to the other end of the village and she said, listen, I had this baby."
Your husband is the father.
We had an affair.
The affair is over.
I don't want him anymore.
"You know, the baby is an innocent."
So let's please all just get along.
And then she went back.
Did the baby get conjunctivitis anymore? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
Absolutely.
That was not a very serious illness.
But Ferdinand's was.
"He first had minor aches and pains, turned into a fever, got steadily worse, and into the second week he couldn't stand up."
The family was searching frantically for the witch that was causing his illness.
They were trying witch after possible witch after possible witch after possible witch.
It works fairly well for typical cases.
And then we've got the Knuth-Morris-Prath

Very beautiful
Have you worked in places other than Istanbul?
He worked in so many locations that we forget the number
My mother is right
But the last location would be Istanbul
I mean this is what it looks like
I'm going to see Nakiye
"I didn't expect to get to know you in such occasion, Mr. Murat you can call me Murat only"
Do you have a fiancee? mom what kind of question is this? not yet for now
What are you doing here?
What do I do I could not eat in front of them
My head is spinning from hunger you too take one
It's really very delicious
How did it turn out that delicious with all the rush ..
I don't know does it need more salt?
"No, it is perfect"
Look at what I'm doing?
I'm eating dolma with you
What's happening inside
They're gazing at each others wondering what to talk about they didn't ask for my hand yet?
Did he abandon me? he didn't..
Everyone is waiting for the coffee Nakiye
Am I to prepar it? don't drive me crazy Nakiye.. of course you'll prepare it.. who will?
I am in shock Mrs. Nesrin
Thank you all
An good evening to you all.. bye bye get up again .. again ..
Again
See they want us to sing again
No again
Which is it?
"Please stop asking me this, I..."
"Well, just tell me what you really think."
"No, that's okay..."
Tell me.
No... it's fine...
Tell me!
I... like it...
"Tell me, tell me, tellmetellmetellme!"
All right!
Since you really wanna know...
"The arm's sized tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel... ...the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile... ...you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch... ...and the overdesign is reminiscent of prêt-à-porter and not true French haute couture."
"But, uh... you know... um, whatever you want to do is fine."
"Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate."
"Orion has three stars on his belt, not four."

How may I help you
Hello!
Could I get some invisibility powder please.
"Yes, would you like the older or the newer kind, the patented powder."
"Of course the patent power, I've heard that it's better, it was invented abroad after all."
"Yes, indeed."
"It's called ""Through the walls"" powder, I recommend it."
"Look, dear young sir, if you ingest this powder, not only do you turn invisible but you can also walk through walls."
"Because in this case, n could be-- could this would be n and this is would be n plus 1-- so n is either equal to 2 or n is equal to minus 3."
That's a little tricky.
The intuition is to just assume that n is positive but it doesn't have to be positive.
So n could be 2 or minus 3 here.
That's a tricky one.
So that one by itself does not help us solve the problem.
"The second part of it, point two it says, 2 to the 2n is equal to 16."
"And whenever you have these in the SAT or the GMAT or anything whenever you have a variable in the exponent, your goal really is to just get everything in the same base."
So we could write the left-hand side the same.
So that's 2 to the 2n.
And how do we write 16 with the base 2?
"Well, 16 is just 2 to the fourth, right?"
And so we get 2n is equal to 4. n is equal to 2.
So this statement alone is enough to figure it out.
This statement alone is not.
So the answer is B.
Statement two alone is sufficient.
40 is B.
"And this was tricky because one, you think that 1n alone is sufficient but it is ambiguous because and n could be minus 3."
41.
41.
OK.
"They've drawn a bunch of, if I see this right,"
They draw a bunch of-- two lines.
Let's see if I can draw this.
So a line and then there's a bunch of circles.
"One circle, two circles they have, and then they keep going."
"Three circles, and then one more."
It's going to be right there.
Four circles.
I think that's about right.
And they say essentially that the circles just keep going on and on.
"Detroit and I started going down there, well then that changed that."
She had a good job at [?].
She was the [?]
Detroit area automobile association
They must have a hundred dealers
But she came back to Grand Rapids and we got married and that was it.
Picked up a couple of part time jobs.
And then when the kids got in high school
She didn't work until after they were in high school
And then she started out with a part-time job.
The kids were working part-time.
They went to [?] and Catholic Central
Worked janitor work over at the school and different things
No problem.
They're good workers.
Few grey hairs but that happens.
They didn't get in jail.
So they're both doing good and I'm doing good but we came up here every summer.
We rented over at Archie's.
Archie's Place is there.
We rented there for 30 years.
Even though I'd had some property up where [?] is and I sold it to him and bought this.
What year did you buy this property?
"Let's see, we built in"
"'98, so probably bought it in '94, maybe."
"So, when you say you never left the island?"
"I went some, like, 28 St. Patrick's Days and never missed one."
You never missed a funeral or a wedding or vacations.
We worked 4-day weeks at Spartan so you could switch.
You could work Sunday to Wednesday one week and
"Tuesday to Friday the next, or something like that and get a 4-day weekend to shoot up here pretty easy."
How did your bride like Beaver Island when you first brought her out here?
And they're both going to be negative because their sum is negative.
And there's something interesting here.
49 is a perfect square.
"Its factors are 1, 7, and 49."
"So maybe 7 will work, or even better, maybe negative 7 will work."
And it does!
Negative 7 times negative 7 is 49.
And negative 7 plus negative 7 is negative 14.
"We have that pattern there, where we have 2 times a number, and then we have the number squared."
This is a perfect square.
"This is equal to x minus 7, times x minus 7, is equal to 0."
Don't want to forget that.
Or we could write this as x minus 7 squared is equal to 0.
So this was a perfect square of a binomial.
"And if x minus 7 squared is equal to 0, take the square root of both sides."
You'll get x minus 7 is equal to 0.
"I mean, you could say x minus 7 is 0 or x minus 7 is 0."
But that'd be redundant.
So we just get x minus 7 is 0.
"Add 7 to both sides, and you get x is equal to 7."
Only one solution there.
Let's do another one in pink.
Let's say we have x squared minus 64 is equal to 0.
Now this looks interesting right here.
A bell might be ringing in your head on how to solve this.
"This has no x term, but we could think of it as having an x term."
We could rewrite this as x squared plus 0x minus 64.
"So in this situation, we could say, OK, what two numbers, when I multiply them, equal 64, and when I add them equal 0?"
"And when I take their product, I'm getting a negative number, right?"
This is a times b.
It's a negative number.
So that must mean that they have opposite signs.
"POLlCE STlLL CAN'T IDENTlFY REPRESSOR, INVOLVED IN MANY CRlMES."
"This one here... the teacher, is my husband, Mario Portela."
We got married in 1976.
For me it was stupid having a white wedding because I wasn't a virgin.
But you know people.
Sometimes you must pretend to be what you are not.
"I had already made love with Mario for the first time on October 3, 1975."
It was beautiful.
Though I haven't got the photo.
And this thin kid here is Sebastian Garcia.
"When he was 16 years old, the ""Triple A"" kidnapped him."
"The ""Argentine Anticommunist Alliance""."
They said he was a subversive.
He went to a rally and they took his picture.
"The thing is when they tortured him, the poor kid, they wanted names and he didn't know what to say."
"So they used a cattle prod because he was silent, and he just said the first thing that came into his head."
"The names of his classmates, his teacher..."
I remember coming home that day.
"They'd broken the door down, they grabbed me, and I saw Mario with a hood over his head."
"Amanda, you don't have to tell me this, or hurt yourself."
"No, honey, you're wrong there."
This doesn't hurt.
It shouldn't hurt me.
What I...
You know what hurt most?
"Not the cattle prod, or being raped, or that son-of-a-bitch... flaying the soles off my feet with a razor blade..."
What hurt most was seeing Mario alive for the last time.
They brought him back after a session... two or three minutes...
"I remember he looked bad, and I thought I must look like that too."
Like looking in a mirror.
He could barely stand up.
His body was mangled.
On edge.
"Frustrated, 'cause I was like, ""Where is the paper?"""
I was pretty creeped out.
"Very, very scared."
Scared.
How else would I feel?
Am I supposed to be happy or something?
The sounds they had
I didn't think were going to affect me as much as they did.
"Just, ""Boom."""
Just constant bass is just nerve-racking.
"(Finebros) So, the villain in the game is called Slender Man, which is an Internet meme that's been around for a while that some people have even started to like to say is real."
"Oh, my gosh."
(Finebros) And people will post pictures of sightings of the Slender Man.
Someone just walked by.
"(chuckling) Oh, my god."
(Finebros) What have you seen?
What do you know about the Slender Man mythology or whatever?
"It was like some mythological creature, and it was like this man who's really tall with a suit and everything and no face."
He was there before mankind.
"He kidnapped children and whatnot, and there's, like, several accounts of it too."
"Like, there was this picture--"
"Oh, God, I just got chills from it."
I don't like it.
There's this picture of a park and there's a bunch of kids.
"In the picture, he has four or five arms, and the kids in the picture later on went missing."
Those are just Photoshopped.
I've seen those pictures.
Photoshop.
"Oh, my God."
(Finebros) What is it about the Slender Man that is making people care so much that they're creating so much content about him?
He's scary and people seem to like being scared.
"- Oh, God!"
He's right there!
- (chuckles)
"- (laughs and curses) - Oh, he has tentacles!"
Oh!
I never saw that before.
What?
Poor guy.
(Finebros) Why are people uploading videos of themselves getting scared?
"Uh, 'cause it's hilarious."
All YouTube videos-- the reason they upload it is to get views.
"(Finebros) Do you think that everyone was being legit scared, or were some of them pretending to be scared?"
"I feel like a lot of them were exaggerating,"
"'cause if they were videotaping themselves, they knew what was happening."
"Tobuscus, I felt the after part was a little overdone."
But I bet you most of the people are legitimately scared.
"(Finebros) So, this game is a fairly simple game and there's not much to it and it's short, but it's so popular."
"Why do people love playing ""Slender""?"
"I didn't love playing ""Slender."""
"I don't know why people love playing ""Slender."""
"Because it's so hard to win and it's so fun to play because of the suspense, I guess."
"There's not a whole lot to do with it, so, like, anyone can play it."
"The simplicity of it could, like, attract them."
It attracts a lot of people that maybe aren't into gaming that--
- (cracks up) - (Finebros) There's nothing there!
"People like to be scared, you know?"
People like to have that adrenaline rush.
I don't do well with scary movies.
"I got nightmares from ""Harry Potter."""
"(Finebros) And what advice would you give to somebody who is about to play ""Slender"" for the first time?"
Just don't do it.
Just don't.

I'm under orders from Caesar...
Caesar is dead!
I am Caesar now

Please....
"Okay, here's the deal."
I have an explanation for### this picture
I'm gonna back it up as soon as this hooker comes in here and tells you she's not with the mayor last night
Having the police pick her up right now.
On what charge?
"I don't know, James."
Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope she does soemthing illegal while she's trying to get people to pay her to have sex
Don't bother Mike
I already talked to her.
"And she 's already writing a book detailing### her 5 year-relationship with the mayor, sorry buddy"
"Carter, do something"
"So, we still on### for tonight?"
"She's lying, Jason."
How could you possibly know that?
Do you have some kind of alibi?
No.
I don't
Mike's mom is the perfect alibi
Should I go remind him?
Only if you're bucking#### for a promotion.
Wait a minute.
So close!
"Under three, high twos."

"As Gerry said, I tried to avoid giving  this talk, but couldn't get out of it."
I came here to tell you that  I organize TEDx events.
I have three under my belt and  a fourth is due in a couple of months.
"And I do it because my Mom  inspired me to do so as her father inspired her,  to do things wholeheartedly."
"Well, it turns out that it's been  a year since she passed away."
"She had been struggling  with cancer for two years and she had a stroke three days  before my last event, which left her quadriplegic  and unable to speak or move."
But are the points in the number line still there?
"Yes, they are embedded in Q, right?"
"So, you might wanna say how Z is embedded in Q. Ok?"
"So, we want these pairs to extend Z so that..."
"Ok, which classes will correspond to Z... to the elements of the natural numbers?"
"What will I... if I... give me the number five, what class would you hope that it somehow associated with?"
"Yeah, how about five over one, so that, for instance, n over one in Q corresponds to n in Z."
So this is the other thing that we might hope for in our construction.
Ok?
Ok.
"Now, if you've taken an Algebra course, then what we are looking for is an isomorphism of a..."
Z into Q.
"But, if you don't know these words yet, that's ok."
"Ok, so tell me what the equivalence relation should be."
"So, after grade school, or after enough examples, we see that, what?"
"Q is the set of all, let's say, m over n..."
"Here's a def... here's a... these are equivalence classes... such that m, n are in Z, n is not zero, where m over n is an equivalence class of a... is the equivalence class of m coma n with the relation..."
What relation?
"Ok, tell me when p... two things, two ordered pairs are equivalent."
When will p coma q be equivalent to m coma n?
Steve.
[Student speaking].
Good!
This is otherwise known as the... what are some name...
You cross multiply to check whether fractions are the same...
Yes that's the equivalence relation...
So with this relation these are equivalent if... if what conditions are true?
Steve suggested doing what?
"Let's take p times n, and check whether it's the same as what? q times n."
And what else?
Let's just demand that n and q not be zero.
Ok?

"Oh, he's in Grand Rapids."
He's got a good job.
He worked a couple different jobs but he's working with ACI now.
On ComCast - the place in the
He's got about a dozen guys that work for him.
He trucks them all around.
"My daughter, she's an airplane mechanic."
Civilian mechanic for the National Guard in
North Carolina.
But she had to join the Guard to do it.
And she picked up her pilot's license in high school.
Her AMV license at Western.
And went to Alaska and worked on float planes.
DC6s.
"First year there, she got laid off"
She was the head mechanic of the car wash.
"Next year, when she got laid off she went and flew in the - worked mechanic for these"
DC6s at Air Alaska or something like that.
The guy got a 4-engine piston plane.
He flies down to Kodiak and around there.
"She blew it there, in a way"
"I think, because she's a mechanic so she's working as a mechanic and he found out - of course, it's a small outfit, just a dozen planes."
He found out that she had a pilot's license but also the engineer thing.
So there was a panel that - she was an engineer not a flight mechanic.
Flight mechanic was on the 130.
"I could fly - any crew member could fly - flight mechanic get drunk or something like that, I could handle it because all you did was flip a couple fuel switches and some tea handles."
"If you had a fire, you'd just pull the handle."
So that was
"But, if something happened on the ground, well"
"""he's a mechanic,"" you know."
But as far as the flying part of it...
"Anyway, she flew the panel for him and he said, ""You've got a pilot's license."
Subtract 8 from both sides of this.
You get x could also be equal to negative 8.
Let's do one more.
"Just to really, really get the point drilled in your head."
Let's do one more.
Let's say we have 4x squared minus 25 is equal to 0.
So you might already see the pattern.
This is an a squared.
This is a b squared.
"We have the pattern of a squared minus b squared, where, in this case, a would be equal to x, right?"
This is 2x squared.
And b would be equal to 5.
"So if you have a squared minus b squared, this is going to be equal to a plus b times a minus b."
"In this situation, that means that 4x squared minus 25 is going to be 2x plus 5 times 2x minus 5."
"And of course, that will be equal to 0."
And this will only be equal to 0 if either 2x plus 5 is equal to 0 or 2x minus 5 is equal to 0.
And then we can solve each of these.
Subtract 5 from both sides.
You get 2x is equal to negative 5.
Divide both sides by 2.
You could get one solution is negative 5/2.
"Over here, add 5 to both sides."
You get 2x is equal to positive 5.
Divide both sides by 2.
You get x could also be equal to positive 5/2.
So both of these satisfy that equation up there.
Now we can write down our precise definition of dimension.
"So if we do what we've been doing, we create a geometric structure from a given D-dimensional object,"
"like a 1-dimensional object like a line, a 2-dimensional object like a square, etc., by repeatedly dividing the length of its sides by some number N."
"So, when we were bisecting the sides , the number N was two (2)."
"When we were trisecting the number N was 3, and so on."
"This is our recipe, and we saw that at each new level we got N raised to the D (N^D) copies of the previous level."
I'm really looking forward to how the MV turns out.

And they asked me to come and explain myself.
I refused.
I sued the judge.
I sued the prosecutor.
"And I sued all of the members of the Ethics Committee, forced them to come to my office."
I took their depositions.
And the case went all the way up to the United States Supreme Court.
"United States Supreme Court said,"
"""Well, Hinds could not have understood the seriousness of the charges; otherwise, he would not have made that sort of statement."""
They sent the case back to New Jersey.
The New Jersey Supreme Court agreed and tossed it out.
AG:
"You're still a lawyer today, and you—"
LH:
I'm still a lawyer today.
AG:
And you represented South African President Nelson Mandela?
LH:
"That's correct, yeah."
JG:
"I wanted to ask you about the trial itself, the only trial for which Assata Shakur has ever been convicted."
LH:
And so then what we can do now is plot these things.
So let's do the following.
I'm sorry.
How many coeffients of A and B which you were two of them which.
"You're trying to get new a's and b's. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I'm sure like with many of those, like 35. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Yeah, you can give, if you have something a higher, for instance, if you want to fit it a parabola, ax^2 + bx + cx, you've passed in a, b, c and you'll find out Yeah."
"The higher dimensional, the harder it is to, you get a lot more local, it finds a local minima, not your global minima."
"Your guessing is very important in this, 'kay?"
"The higher, the, the more complicated your guess, or the, your thing you're trying to minimize, the curve you're trying to fit to, the more important it is to have a really good guess."
"So there are my coefficients, A and B, and let me do this here for A1 too and B1, and these are, so now what we want to do is say okay, my data, let's say XP for X plot, pretty much goes from zero To five, and now we'll just say is my y2 fit, What is it?"
It's a2 * xp
"*, oh + b2."
"There's my curve fit, y1 is gonna be a1 * xp * b1."
"And now I can say, hold on, and I will plot xp versus y2."
"And lets plot the L2 fit in red and the y, and the y1, L1 fit in magenta."
Sound good.
"Oh, here, yeah, thank you."
Okay.
There we are.
Look at that.
Beautiful!
I have an L2 fit and an L1 fit.
And look at that.
They kind of don't look very much different.
Like you don't really expect them to look that much different I suppose.
Okay?
Everybody good with that?
There's my data.
"And you can see that the L2 and L1, slightly different, especially up here, but slightly different."
"Now here's t he question I'm gonna ask, and this is why L1 becomes important."
We think about our data Pretty easy thing about putting a line there.
"Now, what would happen if i had out-layers."
"Now, lets talk about that formula a little bit."
Come on.
What about the picture Mike?
"Simply misunderstanding, media distortion###."
Tabloid sensationalism.
I don't know Mike.
I saw the mayor this morning and he didn't look like a man that had spent the night alone
I'm happy to report that he's alone and unloved
"Alright, let's move on to something little lighter"
"Hey Paul, how's your headwound"
Hank's still suing### you Paul?
But....
The last thing I need is publicity* about one city hall employee suing another one
Here's the thing
"I have already applied and been accepted on Ed koch's the people's court , taping this afternoon"
Please tell me if you lose you're going to jail
Here it is
My family's thanks giving recipe for the best sweet potato pie in the world
Guard it with your life.####
This is a xeroxed page from the Joy of cooking
That book has been in my family for years
I can't wait to go home for thanks giving.
I love the whole thing.
A little snow on the ground a little touch football game before dinner.
Get to sit at the kiddie table.
You still sit at the kiddy table?
"Big fish, small pond"
Thanks giving at my house is nothing but a bunch of fat overstuffed### drunk sitting in front of a TV turned### up so loud they can't hear each other
"Oh, and me in the bedroom rifling** through jacket"
"So, that's 5 days and 4 nights at the Bahama Hilton? is the continental breakfast included in that?"
Thank you
Your family's going to The Bahamas for Thanksgiving?
I hope not.
TOM BEARDEN:
Do you ever get mad about this?
DANlEL BELL:
It gets frustrating.
It definitely does.
TOM BEARDEN:
"Bell says the ranch has become a much more dangerous place, too."
Do you fear for your life out here?
DANlEL BELL:
"Yes, when we're out in places like this, where we don't have communications, and you're always thinking, what am I going to do if something happens?"
TOM BEARDEN:
Have you ever come across armed people coming across the border?
DANlEL BELL:
"Yes, I have, on several occasions."
And the most recent one was actually when we were building this fence.
"We were hauling material in with a mule and we came around on a trail that's used by smugglers, and ran right into a group of about 10 people."
I have two daughters now.
That's Ida and her baby sister Rosa.
And to the junk food industry I say this: my children - all of our children - are none of your business.

Thank you.

TV VOlCEOVER:
"What Jimmy didn't know was that Ralph was sick, a sickness of the mind."
"You see, Ralph was a homosexual, a person who demands an intimate relationship with members of their own sex."
One never knows when the homosexual is about.
"He may appear normal, and it may be too late when you discover he is mentally ill."
VAUGHAN MENESES:
"The problem, or some of the challenges, that are faced with being gay are actually not through being gay itself, but through the discrimination and the challenges that other people put upon us."
My name is Vaughan Meneses.
I'm the General Manager of OUTLine New Zealand.
Because this'll have some positive value.
It might have an insignificantly small value.
We could make it 0.000001.
But it's still going to have some positive value.
"So no matter what y we choose, as long as it's greater than 0, 2x minus 3y will be greater than 2x."
"So we could say that as long as if 2x is less than x squared for any x we pick, then 2x minus 3y is definitely going to be less than x squared."
Why is that?
"Because minus 3y is going to subtract from the 2x, because we know that y is greater than 0."
So let me ask you a question.
Is 2x always going to be less than x squared if x is greater than 2?
Sure.
"I mean whatever x is, on the left-hand side it's going to be 2 times--pick a random number--2 times xŁŹit could be 2.5."
"But on the other side, on the right-hand side, you're going to have 2.5 squared."
"So if you think about it, you're going to have 2 times a number."
That's always going to be less than--ŁŹthat number which happens to be larger than 2 squared.
The smallest possible is 2 times 2.0001.
You could make a lot of 0's there.
But I think you get the point.
That's still going to be less than 2.0001 squared.
Because you only have a 2 here instead of a 2.0001.
"So actually, statement 2 alone is sufficient."
Hopefully that made sense.
"You just have to see oh, if y is greater than 0, then the 3y is definitely going to take away from the 2x."
"Then as long as x is greater than 2, 2x is always going to be less than x squared."
"If that makes sense to you, then you should realize that statement 2 alone is sufficient for this."
That was interesting.
"Oh, no sorry."
Either of them alone were sufficient.
"We did that in the first one, right?"
"Statement 1 or statement 2, independently are sufficient to answer that question."
120.
"A report consisting of 2,600 words is divided into 23 paragraphs."
Helene.
Wow.
"Um, what is that?"
"That is saffron risotto, topped with scallops that are crusted in a red peppercorn-smoked sea salt wrapped in burdock root."
"So, visually, when you can still see the center &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of that bright grain of rice,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what does that mean?"
That it's perhaps undercooked?
"""Perhaps."""
That's not perhaps.
It's definitely undercooked.
The basket...
What the [Bleep] is that? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;A basket.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
[Bleep].
Uhh!
"God, I could scream."
The scallops are still raw.
"I'm looking at that, and I'm looking at the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; trophy, I'm thinking, ""nah."""
"All right, guys."
You guys understand the spirit of this competition? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What we're looking for here?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Scallop basket...
Go in the garbage basket.
[Scoffs]
"&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We're not fooling around here.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We're looking&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;for specific things,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; it's not a game, and you're not here to waste our time."
- You understand?
- Yes.
"The rice is undercooked, and the scallops are a joke."
You guys understand the spirit of this competition? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What we're looking for here?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Scallop basket...
Go in the garbage basket.
[Scoffs]
"The rice is undercooked, and the scallops are a joke."
"They really seemed offended by these creations that I made, but at least I went to the edge of my comfort zone."
I tried something new.
And then we're going to multiply that times y plus 2.
"So when you multiply y plus 2 times this, so you have y times negative y squared, it gets us negative y to the third power. y times 3y is going to be plus 3y squared."
2 times negative y squared is negative 2y squared.
And then 2 times 3y is plus 6y.
So then you go all the way down here.
"This thing can simplify, too, because you have 3y squared minus 2y squared."
So this going to be negative y to the third plus-- this part right over here simplifies to just y squared-- y squared plus 6y.
So that's this entire part simplified to this down here.
We can take the 2 pi out of the integral sign.
So let's do that.
We're integrating from y is equal to 0 to y is equal to 3 dy.
"And I took the 2 pi out here, and that is equal to our volume."
"And so now, we're essentially ready to take the antiderivative."
This is going to be equal to 2 pi times the antiderivative of this business evaluated at 3 minus evaluated at 0.
And I'll color code it.
I found this useful.
"The antiderivative of y to the third is y to the fourth over 4, so this is negative y to the fourth over 4."
"Antiderivative of y squared is y to the third over 2-- or y to the third over 3, I should say."
"And then finally, I'll do it in yellow."
"Antiderivative of 6y is 3y squared, so plus 3y squared."
And we are going to evaluate all of this business at 0 and 3.
So this simplifies.
"This going to be equal to 2 pi times-- well, let's see."
Let me do it in the same colors.
3 to the fourth power is 81.
"So it's negative 81 over 4, plus-- 3 to the third is 27 divided by 3 is 9, plus 9."
"And then 3 squared is 9 times 3 is 27, plus 27."
"And then when you evaluate all of these things at 0, you just get 0."
"So you're just subtracting out 0, so we really don't have to do anything else with the 0."
And now we are ready to simplify.
Let me see.
"Actually, let's just add them all up."

These Air Force guys.
"We can't pick a nice day - if it's windy we can't say, ""No, leave them float down there for a couple days."""
"So, they really practiced."
And they were good.
I was impressed with them.
The paramedics?
Yeah.
The Air Force.
They were before the Green Berets or before any special forces.
The Air Force had them in the 50s.
One other short one.
When I left Yemen when we flew back - we left Saudia Arabia or Beirut - and we flew back to the States so that was maybe 30 hours of flying time.
"30, 35 hours from Beirut back to Zl."
So they'd have a volunteer crew out over Christmas and single guys would always sign so that married guys could be home with the wives and kids.
So I signed up for it.
"It was like the 5th of May, and... went up to Pakistan up to Peshawar, where Gary Power, you know, the guy got shot down."
The U-2 pilot.
Yeah.
"Anyway, that was around that I happened to get on."
"Not a very particularly good run, because you're in"
Turkey and Pakistan...
"So, I couldn't even fly because I needed like 70 hours."
You could only fly 120 a month or 330 in three months.
So I was pushing my 120 hours flying time with getting back to the States... and then with this thing for a round trip.
So we get over there and spend the night there in civilian clothes.
"Normally we can stay in a pretty decent hotel but because it was Christmas Eve, they had us stay in the Embassy Compound because the Marine guards and everything like this just because there wasn't really any hostility with - animosity with - You weren't an American walking around on a Christian holiday, you know."
So we run up to Peshawar the next day
Christmas Day.
And had a load of stuff.
"Food, and, you know vegetables, perishables, whatever."
"Unloaded and they said, ""Hey, we've got a trailer over here."" It was like a 32 foot semi trailer and"
"""Can you haul that?"""
"There are so many different countries, I don't know, where should I go?"

"Never go there, it's no good."
The Italians are as false as the Chinese.
"Everything depends on sympathy, if you sing well or not doesn't count."
The teacher sais about France:
"France is super, everybody wants to go there."
"Paris is an excellent city, but when your no genius, you don't have a chance to get in there."
Then he gave me a good advice:
Germany is the best.
Why is Germany so good?
In Germany there are theatres everywhere.
Also in the small towns.
Therefore you build your career from place to place with endurance and passion.
In the end you can stand on the big stage in Bayreuth.
"And in Germany, the teacher said, there is an important difference:"
In Germany the north is more liberal than the south.
Therefore I wanted to go to Berlin.
I then asked everybody who is concerned with Somalia for advice.
"Wolrd Hunger Aid, journalists in Africa, UN, foreign ministry, everyone said the same: don't go there, it's too dangerous."
"But then I found out, that noone I spoke with was in Somalia in the last years."
Everything I found out was only hearsay.
"Entrance examination in Berlin, the next is Bee Chang from Taiwan, with an aria by Rossini:"
Semiramide.
Semiramide by Rossini.
This is really very beautiful.
Wonderful.
But I think you really can't sing Rossini this way.
"This was the sentence that the professors in Berlin said to Bee, when they rejected her."
This european way of singing turned into a legend for Bee.
She later sang a concert in a church in Germany and found out: there's also something about the architecture.
My voice sounded just as the voices on the european CDs that I was always listening to in Taiwan.

Chechnyah
"During our journey in this show 'Travel with the Quran' we have travelled to many countries to spot light The Quran institutes.. to find the miracles of the Quran around the World. and amongst these countries, is the Country of Chechnyah."
Everyone knows that Chechnyah have been through many wars and it finally became stabilized 6 years ago
When i first decided to come to Chechnya - people thought that the war is still on!! even my mother asked me:
Isn't There a war in Chechnyah?
I replied to her:
"""No mother, Chechnyah is now stabilized"" after it was stabilized.. their main focus was on the book of Allah swt and they have a great Quran institutes now"
This is why we came here to introduce to you.. the Kids of Chechnyah and how well focused they are When it comes to the Book of Allah swt
"Also to show you the Quran insititues here which I am sure you will love, here in Chechnyah but while I was recording, those two young boys were heading to register for Summer Quran classes so I've asked them to join me"
"May Allah protect them and keep the Quran firm in their hearts, and may Allah preserve you all as well."
"Ok, well, the moment we've all been waiting for.. this is what I'm getting Judy for May Day, these cool underwear things."
I'ts a new style for panties.
They were my mom's when she was little.
So I'm pretty sure Judy'll be really happy to wear my mom's used underwear.
Here I go.
"Judy, happy May Day; here's your new panties."
"Judy:Ew, get away!"
"Fred:How could you say that, Judy?!"
"Oh, my God!"
I'm so embarassed!
"Oh, my God, this is so embarassing!"
This is so embarassing!
I didn't get it on video tape but Judy put the panties on my head.
She's so mean!
Yet so attractive.
"Whatever, I guess I'll give them back to my mom."
I'm going inside my house and never coming back out.
Nobody understands me.
(singing) My May Day didn't turn out
How I wanted it to
Everything went wro-o-o-o-o-ong
I hope next year is better
I can't believe Judy threw panties on me (high-pitched note)
"Fred:Okay, well, that's all I have for you guys."
"I hope all you guys' May Day was better than mine, okay?"
"No need to rub in how good your May Day was compared to mine, no offense."
"Okay, well, see y'all."

The early detection of the risk of suffering from depression during or after pregnancy may reduce the negative effects in both the mother and the foetus.
"Researchers from the Universitat Jaume I in Castelló and from the Universidad de Zaragoza have developed the computer application 'Mamá Feliz' [Happy Mum], which enables to anticipate depression."
-The main objective of our project 'Mamá Feliz' is studying the risk factors which the scientific literature has proven to be related to the greater probability of developing depression during the pregnancy or after birth.
"Therefore, we have created a computer application, 'Mamá Feliz', which includes these variables."

Their mission is to destroy the arsenal in the National Theater.
Ever since the theater has no roof.

"And everybody is sitting under the open sky, as in ancient greek theaters."
Liu Xenfang is standing behind me.
"He is from Hongkong, about 55 years old,"
And he worked as a young man at the construction site of the National Theater in Somalia.
"When I'm standing in this picture, I always think:"
Please give the Peace Nobel Prize to this human being!
I showed him the picture once and told him what I think.
"Lui, Peace Nobel Prize?"
"He laughed at me and said, the only Chinese that got the Peace Nobel Prize, was a provocation of the West."
Liu how are the real human rights conditions in China?
"Well, China is ok, much more stable, than other countries."
"But, Liu, stability and human rights have no bearing on each other."
"Well, I think it has."
"Liu, China is the state with the most executions."
"You know, in some occasions, politics must kill the people."
"China is such a big country, it's hard to establish discipline, but you need it."
"When the construction of the theater was finished, Liu stayed in Africa."
"Now he runs a shop here in Nairobi, where he sells lots of different things."
"Plastic bags, clothes, mobile phones, akkus, shoes and so forth."
"There is one bestseller, which is this: a multi-band radio."
With slack joint.
"This is Ahmed, a friend of mine, from Somalia."
"He was born in Bonn, Germany, maybe he is not somali."
We studied together in Berlin.
"We can make buildings like trees, we can be carbon positive."
"We can look at a child and say instead of, ""Oh, shit, overpopulation"", we can say, ""Holy shit!"

Thank you very much!
The city swings and 200 dancers from 20 nations are swinging with it.
At the first Jazz festival in Heidelberg [Germany] over the weekend.
This is the first dance of my life;  I used to boycott the dance school
It is extremely multisided as you can be extremely creative and playful.
Because it is fun and you meet people; for example somebody like this.
There are nearly no rules.
You can't make mistakes.
Everything is  just a variation.
You can do what you want.
It is really the best dance that I know.
"Katja and Ali are dance partners, but also married couple."
They teach Lindy Hop all over Europe.
With the first Jazz festival here in Heidelberg they both realised themselves a dream.
"Swing is for the vice european vice champions not only a music and dance, but also an attitude towards life and limitless."
"It is like a language; first you learn the grammar in class and then everybody can ""speak"" with each other on the dance floor."
"New York, 1927:"
"Black and White, poor and rich,  meet on the dance floor in Harlem."
"At the Savoy ballroom the Lindy Hop is created, the most original way of swing dancing."
There are no written rules.
Lindy Hop thrives on improvisation.....
...to this day!
"That makes it so exciting, fun, sexy, full of energy!"
"The atmosphere is boiling in Heidelberg's town hall when the Shim Sham song comes on, one of the highlights of the evening."
But what would Swing and the 20s be without Big Band and dresscode.
"Part of it is a proper hair-do, the adequate outfit."
"It also makes you dance differently, compared to dancing in jeans and T-shirt."
"Katja and Ali met in Paris, dancing on the banks of the Seine."
And their enthusiasm is as fresh as on the first day.
The coffee will always be black with that bitter taste
"O nation, flutter away"
And clutter the hill of coffee
Melt the dead hearts and make it soulful again
Because they have dreams like young beautiful girls
"O nation, it's enough black coffee for our hope"
I long to see the coffee defeated by your sugar
"Taste it, then kiss my sweetheart"
With your dream flavor
"O nation, flutter away and include me into your swarm"
"O nation flutter, as the sweet taste is your own secret!"""
(audience clapping)
After many travels
I met someone called (Gehad)
He was Lebanese
Who adores Egypt
He visited many places in Egypt
And camping there with my knowledge
I told him that people stop asking
"People used to ask before, but now, no one cares!"
"Then he told me:"" in order to be a good traveling"
You have to lose your feelings
So that you can feel the other things that surround you carefully
"Like mountains, sands, and the signer girl from Nubba"""
"Then I wrote (El Ghorba) ""the exile"""
"That exile, which mourn on that stranger"
Its call spreads between the wind &amp;amp; echo
"Crying,"
"Stray, and the wheel of sadness loss its scope"
"O exile, why your call lose its kindness?"
Why it doesn't have any kindness?
Or being loved ?

Dealing with an eye injury is probably one of the most scary things for people to deal with.

So somebody with any eye injury is gonna be very very scared.
Now you can damage your eye through different things.
"Maybe just a bit of dirt or grime in the eye, maybe a scratch, maybe an impaled object into the eye."
"Also got chemicals, and things like this can all do damage."
"All right, both teams did a good job."
"Paul, Lee, go ahead and finish up your campsite."
I'll see you guys later.
Lee:
You know I think my sons at home are going to look at me and realize that I did everything I've taught them to do.
"And I've taught them the most important thing is not to quit, not to give up."
"And no matter what the odds are against you, you keep on fighting."
NARRATOR:
"Scouts, adults, gather up, fellows."
"I know it's been a long day, but don't get too comfortable because we've got some guests coming tonight."
Children:
"We are Cub Scouts, tried and true."
We...
NARRATOR:
Think I hear them coming.
Children: ...are Cub Scouts tougher than you.
They're all at about the same place.
And with these bubbles...
"This isn't a video, the bubbles represent figures from a database that draw this diagram."
But I can still pull everything around.
That's the genius of the program.
We can choose specific bubbles and I can go to 1964 and the hostilities between Vietnam and the United States.
If I eliminate the other countries we see only Vietnam and the US.
Al Gore grabbed me and said:
And that was Al Gore!
Then Google's founders Sergei Brin and Larry Page approached me.
They wanted to talk some more and invited Ola and Anna to Google.
Rosling 's son Ola and his wife Anna developed the animated graphics along with three others.
Now they all have jobs at Google.
Google also bought the software for millions.
The money became the basis of the non-profit Gapminder foundation.
Today eight people collect data on development and distribute it free.
For example on video.
How high do they have to be?
Can you adjust the camera?
There was a gender conference on Sunday.
"Then I flew to the US and talked in Portland and at Google's AGM, called Zeitgeist, in San Francisco."
Then I was home...
And then I talked at the world dentist convention.
Then I spoke at a gas conference in Holland...
Now everyone wants to hear the professor.
"Norwegian oil companies, pharmacists, the Swedish medical association the UN Economic and Social Council, Telenor's managers"
European web developers and Bill Gates...
On April 15 I'm going to Trinidad to lecture to foreign ministers and entrepreneurs in Latin America at their meeting on development.
Then I head for Washington for the World Philanthropy Forum.
"Headed by Bill Clinton, they donate money to global development."
"You meet a lot of people, but do you feel you influence development?"
"Yes, because people gain a greater understanding of statistics."
I'm going to have to get my calculator out.
So it's going to be 1 minus 4.2 squared plus 2 minus 4.2 squared plus 3 minus 4.2 squared plus 8 minus 4.2 squared plus 7 minus 4.2 squared.
And it's going to be all of that-- I know it looks a little bit funny-- divided by the number of data points we have-- divided by 5.
So let me take the calculator out.
All right.
Here we go.
Actually maybe I should have used the graphing calculator that I have.
Let me see if I can get this thing-- if I could get this.
There you go.
"Yeah, I think the graphing one will be better because"
I can see everything that I'm writing.
"OK, so let me clear this."
"So I want to take 1 minus 4.2 squared plus 2 minus 4.2 squared plus 3 minus 4.2 squared plus 8 minus 4.2 squared, where I'm just taking the sum of the squared distances from the mean squared, one more, plus 7 minus 4.2 squared."
So that's the sum.
The sum is 38.8.
So the numerator is going to be equal to 38.8 divided by 5.
"So this is the sum of the squared distances, right?"
Each of these-- just so you can relate to the formula-- each of that is xi minus the mean squared.
And so if we take the sum of all of them-- this numerator is the sum of each of the xi minus the mean squared from i equals 1 to n.
And that ended up to be 38.8.
And I just calculated like that.
"I just took each to the data points minus the mean squared, add them all up, and I got 38.8."
And I went and divided by n which is 5.
So this n up here is actually also 5.
Right?
And so 38.8 divided by 5 is 7.76.
So the variance-- let me scroll down a little bit-- the variance is equal to 7.76.
"Now if this was a sample of a larger distribution, if this was a sample-- if the 1, 2, 3, 8, and 7, weren't the population-- if it was a sample from a larger population, instead of dividing by 5 we would have divided by 4."
"And we would have gotten the variance as 38.8 divided by n minus 1, which is divided by 4."
So then we would have gotten the variance-- we would have gotten the sample variance 9.7 if you divided by n minus 1 instead of n.
"But anyway, don't worry about that right now."
That's just a change of n.
"Some Pokémon in the anime are just MONSTROUS, such as Dragonite and Tentacruel who are roughly the size of a BUlLDlNG!"
"While these Pokémon are clearly meant to give the idea that some of these monsters have the potential to become massive, it is interesting that, on the flipside, most of Game Freak's official sizes are much smaller than what you'd expect."
Let's get back to Charizard.
"In the anime, Ash's Charizard is actually a runt compared to others, but he's still big enough to give Ash a lift with plenty of space."
"But in the games, Charizard stands at just 5 foot 7 inches and just under 200 pounds."
"At 10 years old, Ash Ketchum is probably around 4 foot 3 inches, 70 pounds."
So I can believe that Charizard is still flyable at the average size of a child.
"But, a big adult like me?"
We wouldn't be flying anywhere.
The simple fact that Charizard and I can step on a scale and weigh the same is just it's just weird. . .I weigh a Charizard.
It just doesn't sound right.
But Charizard isn't the only Pokemon with a size you wouldn't expect.
Let's take a look at some of my favorites.
Nidoking and Nidoqueen are both a little over 4 feet tall.
"By the time you hit your teenage years, you'll probably already be taller than them."
Yeah. . .
"When you start picturing them like this, they're just not nearly as cool."
"And speaking of Pokémon much smaller than you think,"
"Rosalia, who's usually pictured to be around a couple feet tall, is just one."
Yeah.
It's just tiny.
It does look hilarious in colosseum though.
"Also, I get that Joltik is a bug but- 4 inches?"
He'd fit in the palm of your hand!
"At a size that small, it's pretty unbelievable that he'd ever be able to battle with well, ANYTHlNG else."
"Also joining Joltik is the recently announced, 6th generation Pokémon, Flabébé."
"Not only does it tie for the smallest size at 4 inches, but also the lightest weight too at 0.2 pounds."
"With Pokémon this small, what do you even need pokeballs for?"
"But when you look at Dunsparse, what do you think?"
I usually picture a little snake.
Just look at the guy in
Mystery Dungeon.
"When you say, i'm born this way"

Pretty much everything you need to make awesome risotto.
"(Scott) Risotto, it doesn't have to be fancy."
"You can't really use cayenne and a blast of this or a blast of that, you know, to really mask some of the subtle errors that you might be making."
Some kind of shellfish.
Either clams or scallops or mussels or shrimp.
Everyone else can see what's in the pantry.
I can only really cook with ingredients I know about.
Innovation is going to be a big challenge for me.
Wow.
"Some half-full baskets. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Some full baskets.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you were out there&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;right now,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what kind of risotto would you be doing? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Something super simple.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;One ingredient.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You have to season&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;all the way through,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;you have to season&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the onions when they go in.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You have to toast the rice,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;add the wine,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;burn the alcohol out,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;more salt, make sure&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;your stock is seasoned.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"

Mm-hmm.
You cannot rush a risotto.
"Okay, Frank, how's your rice coming?"
"So far, so good."
What would your family think if you get sent home on a risotto?
My dad would definitely break my balls.
Dave Mack.
"Yes, sir."
Flavor.
What are you doing?
"I got some white wine, butter."
I got the morels.
I know those have a nice flavor to 'em.

"Felix, how you feel up there?"
Good.
Hi.
"At 877 pounds, he is CRlMINALLY light for his size."
"Take a look at a real blue whale, which can grow to be up to twice as long as a Wailord."
"They weigh around 150-170 metric tons. or something around 350,000 pounds."
The difference in weight is so astronomical that it's absurd!
"In fact, at that weight and that height, if you estimate Wailord's volume with around a 20 by 48 foot cylinder,"
Wailord is actually less dense than air.
"Like, he'd float! in the Air!"
Like a Blimp! and that's when you realize
Wailord's the- the what?
The FLOAT whale pokémon.
AUGHHHHHHHHHHHH!
The official pokédex is a strange one and it usually crushes my dreams every time I learn about a pokémon's true size.
I might not ever be able to ride a Charizard but it's okay bec-. . .(begins sobbing) who am I kidding?
T n T (sniffles) This isn't okay at all!
I hate my life!
Thanks for watching today's video.
I encourage you: find your favorite pokémon in the pokédex and find out exactly how long they are and what they're weight is.
"I guarantee, 9 times out of 10 you'll be surprised."
Let me know in the comments section below if one of your favorite pokémon was a size you NEVER would have expected.

"First, he promoted people based on merit, rather than family position, and, second, he brought lower classes of conquered people into his own tribe, while dispossessing the leaders of the conquered clans."
Thus he made peasants love him.
"The rich hated him, but they didn't matter anymore, because they were no longer rich."
"With these two building block policies,"
"Temujin was able to win the loyalty of more and more people and, in 1206, he was declared the Great Khan, the leader of all the Mongols."
How?
"Well, the Mongols chose their rulers in a really cool way."
"A prospective ruler would call a general council, called a kuriltai, and anyone who supported his candidacy for leadership would show up on their horses,"
literally voting with their feet.
Child John:
Mr. Green!
Mr. Green!
But horses don't have feet; they have hooves.
John:
"I hate you, Me From The Past."
"ALSO, NO INTERRUPTlNG THE THOUGHT BUBBLE!"
"After uniting the Mongols, Genghis Khan went on to conquer a lot of territory."
"By the time he died, in his sleep, in 1227, his empire stretched from the Mongol homeland, in Mongolia, all the way to the Caspian Sea."
"Thanks, Thought Bubble."
"So that's a pretty good looking empire and, sure, a lot of it was pasture, or mountains, or desert, but the Mongols did conquer a lot of people, too."
"And, in some ways, with Genghis' death, the empire was just getting started."
"His son, Ögödei Khan, expanded the empire even more, and Genghis' grandson, Möngke, was the Great Khan in 1258 when Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Empire, fell to the Mongols."
"And, another of Genghis' grandsons, Kublai Khan, conquered the Song Dynasty, in China, in 1279."
"And, if the Mamluks hadn't stopped another of Genghis' grandsons, at the battle of Ain Jalut, they probably would have taken all of North Africa."
"Man, Genghis Khan sure had a lot of grandkids."
"Well, it must be time for the open letter."
(gentle electronic harp music playing)
An open letter to Genghis Khan's descendants.
"Oh, but, first, let's check what's in the secret compartment today."
(gentle electronic harp music playing)
"Oh, a noisemaker and champagne poppers."
"Stan, you know I suck at these."
It's still 10 days away.
Ok.
"Quickly I went back to the message,  the first one and what I found is this, obviously."
"He was talking about Tuesday, August 20."
"And I was understanding, of course,  it was the time."
"There is a very thin line  between what I want to say, what I say, what the other guy  wants to hear and the way he understands it."
And any deviation in this thin line automatically puts us in what we generally call... a misunderstanding.
And even though  it produces discomfort to us
"I propose to you the idea that behind our misunderstandings  there is a lot of very useful information at first hand about ourselves, which is also giving us  an opportunity of learning, that allows us to grow and helps us  improve our relationships."
"Lets see, in 1514, spanish explorer"
"Francisco Fernández de Córdoba landed in the shores of the peninsula  he called Yucatán, because that was the word  natives pronunced when he asked them what was the name  of those shores in which he had landed."
"Later, it was known that  in the mayan language,"
"Yucatán means ""I don't understand""."
(Laughter)
"As I was saying,  our misunderstandings speak more about the way in which  we perceive things, than the way things are."
"We are constantly filtering  what we perceive and we do so all the time,  in a major or minor scale."
"As the famous adagio says,"
"""We don't see things just the way  they are, but the way we are""."
"Without going further,  a while ago I found myself working in a job presentation, totally abstracted from the exterior world and then"
I heard some kind of noise  from the exterior that was telling me
"""Bla-bla-bla the kids..."
Bla-bla-bla tomorrow ...
Bla-bla-bla balls...
"And in that moment I noticed  it was the voice of my wife, Maru, who was staring at me, and saying,"
"""Did you hear what I just said?"""
"""Who?"""
This catch phrases allow me  to gain some time.
"""Yes, yes, you were telling me that...  tomorrow I'll take the kids to school..."
"What happened with the balls?"""
"""See."
"When I speak to you,  you don't listen to me"""
"""Yes, eh..."""

Welcome to Boston Aikikai.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;TACClOLl:
Here we are in Chinatown.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
[VO]
The dojo itself started in July 2010.
"So, when the group started then, we were in the basement of the community center in Roslindale."
"Then, we moved to Chinatown, where we've been for the past two years."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;PARKER:
"But no matter what, you know how there's a saying, ""home is where the heart is?"" That's like what I feel about our dojo."
"It doesn't matter, like, where we are -- it's the people in it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;EBATA:"
"For the new dojo, it means more time."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;TAClOLl:
Keep learning with Vu Ha Sensei and the rest of the students.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
[VO]
People who enjoy or love aikido or martial arts can come together in their own space and kind of... be with other people who have the same kind of passion or enjoyment of that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;GONGVATANA:
"I think at some point, you know, there's not going to be any more dust and we won't have to wear a mask while practicing."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;TAWA:
Just to train every day.
That's something that I've wanted to do for a long time.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
[VO]
"Now we have an opportunity to have our own space, which is what we're trying to work on."
"This is our project, getting this new space."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;PERRlNS:
"I like having a dedicated space, where we have the freedom to practice outside of scheduled classes."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
[VO]
"Boston Aikikai is made up of members: we might have a nice space and all, but the dojo is the people who come and practice."

What do they use?

"Even if it's cloudy out, there's still rays that are getting through, so wear sunscreen."
I'm always gonna preach that.
"And I love this as well, this is off my bathroom counter."
"Again, Epicuren Kukui Coconut After Bath Moisturizer."
This is loved by Gwen Stafani and we all know that she looks amazing.
"This is a body product, so a lot of body products are just hydating/nourishing-type products."
"Well, this, the difference is Epicuren's After Bath has anti-aging ingredients in it, so you're putting on anti-aging moisturizer on your body, which, those of us know, our arms, our shoulders, our neck, our décolleté probably could use some of that."
"And, Kim Cattrall, she loves Epicuren."

Under no circumstances can her aide interfere with the dish.
"I want to keep the kale,"
"I want to keep the sweet potato,"
I want to keep the duck.
"I think she's at a bit of a disadvantage, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;till they learn&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;how to work together.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;With the 18 now,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;this is your first chance&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to really scare&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and intimidate people too&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and be like,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"""this is what I'm all about."""
- What would you do?
- I would start off by rendering &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that duck fat&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;off the duck breast.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I would blanch the kale and then sweat that off in duck fat, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;bake the sweet potato,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and do a really nice&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;caramelized rhubarb&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; with aged balsamic vinegar sauce."
"I am gonna pan-sear a duck breast with a sweet potato puree and sauteed kale in the duck fat, but the fact that there's no elimination on the end of this does help me feel a little more relaxed. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Take full advantage of your 60 minutes.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;One stunning dish.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"At first, I saw that duck breast, and it was stunning, and I was really excited, but then I started thinking that I have a great dish that I thought"
I kind of want to hold onto and bring that out later in the competition.
So I'm thinking right now
"I just do what I know I can handle, which is a rhubarb little tartlet."
It's kind of like a crostada.
"I'm confident, because there's a few people who I think might be a little wet behind the ears, who might be trying to put too much on their plate."
"Yes, sir."
"Scott, what are you cooking?"
- A profiterole.
- What?
A larger profiterole with yams and a little bit of duck in there.
"This is, like, a serious competition."
I'm being very serious about this.
"A duck profiterole doesn't sound serious to me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Right, Samantha,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what are you doing?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
A five-spice pan-seared duck breast of a sweet potato-rhubarb puree.
"Sweet potato and rhubarb, they go together?"
- I think so.
- Have you tasted before?

Penguin (biscuit)
Penguins are a type of biscuit that is made in Scotland. They are a bar shaped biscuits that are covered in milk chocolate. The biscuits are filled with chocolate cream. Pladis' manufacturing division McVitie's makes them at their factory in Stockport.
History.
"They were first made in 1932 by William McDonald, a biscuit manufacturer in Glasgow. They became a brand of McVitie's when McDonald joined with McVitie's and Price, MacFarlane Lang &amp; Co and Crawford to create United Biscuits in 1948. Each wrapper has a joke or ""funny fact"" printed on it and designs that feature penguins that are often in styles like that of famous works of art. These designs are usually funny."
"In the 1980s, Penguin became known for their television advertising slogan ""P...P...P...Pick up a penguin!”"
"In October 1996, United Biscuits sued Asda because they said Asda said their own brand of ""Puffin"" biscuits were part of the Penguin brand. In March 1997, United Biscuits won the case. The court found out Asda had not broken any laws on how the Penguin brand could be used."
"United Biscuits was criticised for still using trans fatty acids in the cream filling of Penguins. By December 2007, United Biscuits began to publicly say trans fats are not in Penguins anymore."
The Tim Tam made by Arnott's in Australia was based on the Penguin. Occasional references in the media include tongue-in-cheek debates over which biscuit is better.
Types.
There are four versions of the biscuit:
Spin off brands.

"During this battle, many US Ranger groups were ordered to support an attack by the 3rd Infantry Division on Cisterna. The 3rd Infantry Division had tried to capture Cisterna on 25–27 January."
The 3rd Division's attack was part of a large attack by the U.S. VI Corps to move out of the Anzio beach. The US VI Corps wanted to get off the Anzio beaches before new German troops could arrive and attack.
Background.
"On 22 January 1944, the Allies launched Operation Shingle. This was a sea landing of"
U.S. and British troops near Anzio and Nettuno. They wanted to attack the German Gustav Line defences to the southeast.
"The Allies had been attacking from the south since 16 January in the first Battle of Monte Cassino. Following the landings, the Allies built up their forces on the beach. This also gave the Germans to strengthen their defensive positions. By 29 January, there were 69,000 men in the beach. The Germans had 71,500 troops to stop them."
"On 30 January, the Allies attacked, going northeast toward Campoleone and the Alban Hills. A Ranger force tried to sneak into Cisterna."
"The Rangers expected to encounter few German troops. In fact, they were moving towards a large enemy force."
The Rangers had had many dead and wounded. New troops sent to replace the dead and wounded did not have experience or much training.
Battle.
"Many Ranger troops and the 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry tried to sneak behind German lines into the town of Cisterna. They wanted to attack and capture the town until the main attack came."

Farn-Sasan
"Farn-Sasan was the last king in the Indo-Parthian Kingdom who ruled Sakastan from about 210 to 226. There are no books that talk about him. He is only known because of the coins he issued. He was killed in 226 by the ruler Ardashir I. Because of this, the Indo-Parthian rule ended."
Origin of name.
"Then name ""Sasan"" was popular with the Indo-Parthian people. The origin of the name is not entirely known. David Neil MacKenzie and V.A. Livshits says that the name comes from Old Iranian, translating to *""Sāsāna"" (""defeating enemy""). It is also the name of a Zoroastrian deity."
Biography.
"Farn-Sasan went into the Indo-Parthian throne sometime in 210. They don't know what king was before him. They think it may have been Pacores. Farn-Sasan is not mentioned in any books. He is only known because of his coins. These coins all say ""Farn-Sasan, son of Adur-Sasan, grandson of Tirdat, son of the grandson of Sanabares, the King of Kings."" Farn-Sasan tried to make himself notable by his rule by showing that he was related to his great-grandfather, Sanabares, a famous Indo-Parthian king. He calls the King of Kings Sanabares the King of Kings. Farn-Sasan also called himself the King of Kings. This happened a lot in Achaemenid and Parthian rulers."
Adur-Sasan and Tirdat were never a ruler. This means that Farn-Sasan was probably from a cadet branch in the dynasty.
"On the front side of the coins, he is seen with a cap. On the other side, a fire altar is shown. The altar has writing around it. Farn-Sasan is the only king that is known to have a fire altar on coins that is also from Sakastan. Around the same time, Ardashir I () made coins with a fire-altar that looked like Farn-Sasan's coins. Historians are not sure if Farn-Sasan copied the fire altar or if Ardashir I copied the fire altar off of Farn-Sasan."
"Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I share a similar name. Because of this and the fact that both of their coin has a fire altar, historians think Sasanians and Indo-Parthians may have had common ancestry. Historians say that Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I were rivals. Both wanted to be the King of Kings. The Iranologist Khodadad Rezakhani argues that Farn-Sasan was a superior of Ardashir I. He said that Ardashir I was only able to say that he was the King of Kings after he defeated Farn-Sasan in 226 and ended Indo-Parthian rule."

"Where laughing corn luxuriant grows,"
Land of the myrtle and the rose;
On hill and plain the clust'ring vine
"Is gushing out with purple wine,"
And cups are quaffed to thee and thine — Australia!
There is a land where treasures shine
Deep in the dark unfathom'd mine
For worshippers at Mammon's shrine;

Collectivism
Collectivism is a kind of ethics based on people being a group. Its opposite is individualism which is based on people being individuals. Collectivists focus on what's good for a whole group. Individualists focus on what's good for each person. Collectivism and individualism are and are also part of politics.
"The word ""individualism"" was originally used by socialists to attack their enemies. They said that individualists were selfish for not supporting socialism. Instead, individualists support people being independent and chasing their own goals. They also believe in having lots of freedoms."
"Collectivists believe that one person is not as important as a group of many people. They often believe people should compromise to make things better for each other instead of just themselves. They also think that letting someone do whatever they want is not good if it hurts lots of other people. Collectivism has many different types. It can mean serving your community, your government, your social class, your race, or some other group."

In 1795, the town received a post office under the name ""Culpeper Court House"" Most maps of the time, however, continued to show the Fairfax name. The confusion resulting from the difference in official and postal names was finally resolved when the Virginia Assembly formally renamed the town Culpeper in 1869 (Acts, 1869–1870, chapter 118, page 154)."

It is also popular for late-night supper sold from street vendors. It can be found almost anywhere in Indonesia. It is also popular in Malaysia and Singapore."
"In 2011, CNN International announced that nasi goreng is the number two of their ""World's 50 Most Delicious Foods"" list."
Ingredients.
"There is no single recipe for nasi goreng, as there are various types. The basic ingredients generally include: cooked rice, ""kecap manis"" (sweet soy sauce), salt, garlic, chilli pepper, fried onions, carrot, egg and chicken. Slices of cucumber, tomato, and lettuce are included for garnishing. Eggs can be either mixed into fried rice in the beginning as scrambled eggs or served separately as fried eggs. In general, ""acar"" – pickle made from vinegar preserved cucumber, carrot, shallots, and small chilli pepper – and ""krupuk"" – deep fried prawn crackers – are provided as side dishs."
"The flavor of nasi goreng can vary depending on the region. There are some variations, such as ""nasi goreng Bali"" which is cooked in Bali; ""nasi goreng seafood"" which includes shrimp, fish and squid, or ""nasi goreng satay"" which includes ""satay"" (seasoned and grilled skewered meat chunks with peanut sauce). When cooking it, one may put anything that can harmonize with the taste."
"Even though any ingredient can be added in nasi goreng, what cannot be taken out is the ""kecap manis"". ""Kecap manis"" is very crucial in the dish which gives the flavor to the nasi goreng. It is what makes the taste of nasi goreng different from other Asian styles of fried rice. Other sauces such as ""ikan asin"" (salted dried fish) and ""saus tiram"" (oyster sauce) can be added as well. The spiciness of nasi goreng is decided by the amount of ""sambal"" (chilli sauce). The sambal can be added during the cooking process or added individually while eating, depending on the preference."

"Temporary abdominal closure techniques are used to postpone definite closure until predisposing factors causing pathologic elevation of intra abdominal pressure are resolved. These techniques include the Bogota bag, absorbable mesh, vacuum pack dressings, the Wittmann patch or velcro burr and the KCI VAC or Abthera dressings."
Temporary abdominal closure techniques are most commonly used in cases of abdominal compartment syndrome in which decompressive laparotomy is necessary to reduce intra abdominal pressure to restore system perfusion.

Sublimation is how a solid becomes a gas without becoming a liquid first. It happens when the particles of a solid absorb enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them. Most substances can sublimate only at low pressure. Many can sublimate in space.
"Sometimes snow sublimates. This is usually on sunny winter days when the air is very dry. Snow may look like it disappears on a cold sunny day, but this is not sublimation because it forms a thin layer of liquid water first."
"At normal atmospheric pressure on the surface of the Earth, only some compounds like dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) can go through this process. CO2 changes from dry ice, a solid to a gas without being a liquid. Also diamond, graphite, iodine, ammonium chloride and aluminium chloride sublime rather than melt at atmospheric pressure."

Ecgfrith of Northumbria
Ecgfrith (or Egfrith; –685 AD) was the King of Deira from 664 AD until 670 AD . When his father died he became King of Northumbria from 670 AD until his death. Ecgfrith ruled Northumbria when it was at the height of its power. His reign ended with his defeat at the Battle of Nechtansmere in which he died.
Early life.
"Ecgfrith was a younger son of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his wife Enfleda. She was the daughter of King Edwin of Northumbria. He was born . In 655 he was ten years old when Penda of Mercia took him hostage. In 660, at age fifteen, Ecgfrith was married to Etheldreda, the daughter of King Anna of East Anglia. She was the widow of the """" Tondberht of the South Gyrwas. Even though she had been married she had retained her virginity. After her marriage to Ecgfrith she refused to her second marriage and remained a virgin. She was encouraged by Bishop Wilfrid to remain . This caused friction between Ecgfrith and Bishop Wilfrid."
King of Northumbria.
"In 660, shortly after the death of his father, Ecgfrith became King of Northumbria. Ecgfrith asked Bishop Wilfrid to convince the queen the kingdom needed an heir. He paid the bishop in gold and a great many hides of land to convince her but Etheldreda would not change her mind. The marriage was dissolved before the end of 672. Ethelreda was allowed to become a nun. She retired to Coldingham Priory and a year later she became the abbess of Ely, which she had built herself. Ecgfrith married as his second wife Eormenburg. She and Bishop Wilfrid became bitter enemies."
"In 672 the Picts revolted and threw out the king that the Northumbrians had placed on the throne there. Ecgfrith sent his army into Pictland (Scotland) to punish them. He defeated the Picts and appointed his ealdorman Beornheth to rule over them. In 674 Wulfhere of Mercia and his allies attacked Northumbria. Wulfhere was trying to reclaim Lindsey. But Ecgfrith defeated Wulfhere and made him pay tribute. Wulfhere was succeeded as king of Mercia by his brother Aethelred in 675. Ecgfrith arranged for his sister Osthryth to marry Aethelred. But in 679 Aethelred defeated Ecgfrith in battle at the River Trent. To prevent a blood feud between the two royal families, Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury stepped in to prevent further bloodshed. He secured a truce between Northumbria and Mercia that lasted for 50 years. Ecgfrith next turned his attention to the Britons of Rheged. He drove them out of northern England and into Ireland. There they became mercenaries for the Irish kings and also began raiding the English coast. In 684 Ecgfrith led his armies against the kingdom of Brega, north of present day Dublin in Ireland. He won a victory and returned to Northumbria. At this point he may have become too confident. In 685 Ecgfrith again attacked the Picts but this time he was defeated and killed. On 20 May 685 his forces were drawn into an ambush at Nechtansmere near Forfar in Scotland. Ecgfrith and his second wife Eormenburg had no children. Ecgfrith was succeeded by his half-brother Aldfrith. Queen Eormenburg retired to Carlisle abby."
Ecgfrith and the Church.
"In 674 Ecgfrith had given Benedict Biscop, a Northumbrian nobleman, fifty hides of land at the mouth of the River Wear. This was to build the first of two great monasteries. In 682 King Ecgfrith gave another forty hides of land to Benedict for a second monastery. It was to be at the mouth of the River Trent at Jarrow. The two monasteries were administered as a single community and came to be called Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbeys. They became a center of learning and were where Bede wrote most of his works. Ecgfrith was at the dedication of Jarrow abbey in 685 about a month before his death."
"From 669 Bishop Wilfrid was directly involved in every gift of land and money to the Church by the Northumbrian king and queens. He became very powerful and rich in the process. In 671 he began building a great church which was financed by and confiscated British church lands. But after Queen Etheldreda retired to her abbey he lost most of his rich patronage. The new queen, Eormenburg, had no love of Wilfrid. Stephen of Ripon, the author of the eighth-century ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" (""Life of Saint Wilfrid"") accused her of being jealous and not having the proper respect for the bishop. In 678 King Ecgfrith drove Bishop Wilfrid out of Northumbria. Bede gave no explanation for why Wilfrid was expelled, but made it clear his sympathies lay with the Bishop."

Today, he is noted for the first recorded European navigation of the strait which separates the continent of Australia from the island of New Guinea. The strait is now named after him (Torres Strait)."
Origins and early life.
"Captain Luis Váez de Torres undertook a voyage from 1606 to 1607. In this voyage, the crew called him a ""Breton"" in reports. One of the reports points to an origin in the northwest province of Spain, that is Galicia. Historians accept this as evidence of his origins. The year and exact place of his birth are unknown but he was likely born around 1565."
"Torres has been presented as Portuguese, without any evidence other than his name. He is never called a Portuguese in the records but they note remarks made by crew members of the Portuguese origins of Pedro Fernandes de Queirós."
Torres entered the navy of the Spanish Crown and found his way to its South American colonies. By late 1605 he first entered the historical record as the nominated commander of the second ship in an expedition to the Pacific.

Variscan orogeny
The Variscan orogeny (Hercynian orogeny) is an ancient mountain-building event in the late Palaeozoic era. It was caused by a continental collision between Euramerica (Laurussia) and Gondwana to form the supercontinent of Pangaea.
"It explains many older features of the present-day world. The Appalachians in North America and the Massif Central in France are two examples. Other examples are the Pyrenees, Sardinia, the Rhine Massif, the Anti-Atlas in Morocco. To the east, the Variscan caused the Urals, the Pamir, the Tian Shan mountains."
"This geologic mountain-building event took place mostly in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. By then Pangaea was more or less complete. In the Triassic period of the Mesozoic, there was land between Siberia over the North Pole to Antarctica over the South Pole. Later in the Mesozoic, the opening of the Atlantic split Pangea. The various parts of the huge mountain belts ended up widely apart on the modern globe."
Higher mountain chains on present-day Earth are the product of a later episode of mountain-building known as the Alpine orogeny.

Echizen forged knives
"Echizen forged knives are traditional knives made in Echizen City, Fukui prefecture, Japan. These knives are notable for the use of two techniques in its creation. ""Nimai hiroge"" (double layering), and ""Mawashi hagane tsuke"" (shaping the knife). Because of these characteristic techniques, they were chosen as the earliest traditional craft for forged knives in 1979."
History.
"The origin of Echizen forged knives was in the early Nanboku-cho period. In 1337, Kuniyasu Chiyotsuru, a sword maker from Kyoto Prefecture moved to ""Echizen no kuni"" (present Echizen city) and made sickles for the citizens. During his stay, many citizens began to make products using his techniques. Because of this, Echizen city became an area famous for their production of farming tools. During the Edo period, these tools spread in Japan through trading. They were noted for their lightness and sharpness, and because of this, knives made in Echizen city became popular in Japan. Now, Echizen produces many products other than knives, such as hatchets."
Two main processes.
"The two main important processes: ""nimai hiroge"" and ""mawashi hagane tsuke""."
...The blade is evenly thinned by stretching the two layered plates. This is done by beating both sides at high speeds with a machine hammer.
...The tip of the blade is sharpened carefully to be close to the sharpness of a diamond.

"As part of the creation of the Muni Metro system, streetcar operation switched to light rail operation in 1981 – the last line to do so. While many streetcar lines switched to bus lines after World War II, the J Church avoided this due to the private right-of-way it uses between 18th Street and 22nd Street."
Extension to Balboa Park.
"The outer end of the line was originally at Church and 30th Streets. It was where streetcars used a triangle of railroad track to turn back. Studies to further the line from its southern terminus had been made in the 1920s and 1970's. In 1990–91, the tracks were extended to the Balboa Park BART station and the Metro Center (Muni light-rail base), giving J-line cars a much shorter connection to the yard than before. The extension opened on August 31, 1991. But the new section was used only by light rail cars starting or ending their runs; all-day J-line service was not use the new tracks until June 19, 1993."

History.
Municipal Railway.
"The San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) opened its K line along with the Twin Peaks Tunnel on February 3, 1918. The line ran from St. Francis Circle station along West Portal Avenue, through the tunnel, along Market Street to Van Ness Avenue (joining the J Church at Church Street). And along existing tracks on Van Ness Avenue to Pine Street. On June 1, 1918, the J and K lines were removed from Van Ness Avenue and went further along Market Street to a loop at the Ferry Building."
Changes in 1980s.
"More changes to the service route followed until finally on December 17, 1980. It was when the K line was light rail operated, with service from Embarcadero Station to Balboa Park, on weekdays only. Weekend service continued to use PCC cars until September 1982. This was when the Muni Metro became fully operational."
Changes in 2000s.
"From February 2001 to June 7, 2003, K Ingleside service was cut back to St. Francis Circle. It was also replaced by buses on Ocean Avenue for street repaving, and route reconstruction along Ocean Avenue."
"Following service changes on June 30, 2007, the K Ingleside and the T Third Street lines were combined inside the Market Street subway tunnel. Though keeping their line designations, resulting in an upside-down, horseshoe-shaped route from Balboa Park to Bayshore and Sunnydale. At West Portal Station, inbound K trains heading towards downtown change their signs to the T line; at Embarcadero Station, T trains heading into downtown change signs to the K line."

Scott Young (writer)
"Scott Alexander Young (April 14, 1918 – June 12, 2005) was a Canadian journalist, sportswriter, novelist and the father of musicians Neil Young and Astrid Young. Over his career, Young wrote 45 books, including novels and non-fiction for adult and youth audiences."
Early life.
"Born in Cypress River, Manitoba, Young grew up in nearby Glenboro, Manitoba, where his father, Percy Andrew Young, owned a drug store. His mother was Jean Ferguson Paterson. After his father went broke in 1926, the family moved to Winnipeg, but were unable to afford to stay there. His parents separated in 1930, and he went to live with an aunt and uncle in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, for a year before moving back to Winnipeg to live with his mother. He left high school at 16 and began working for a tobacco wholesaler."
"Young began writing while in his teens, submitting stories to various publications, most of which were rejected. At the age of 18, in 1936, he was hired as a copyboy at the Winnipeg Free Press and was soon made sports reporter. He met Edna Blow ""Rassy"" Ragland in 1937 and the two were married in 1940."
Moves to Toronto.
"Unable to get a raise at the ""Free Press"", Young moved to Toronto in 1941, covering news and sports for the Canadian Press news agency. His first son, Bob Young, was born in 1942 and five months later, Young was sent to England to help cover World War II for CP. He came back a year later and joined the Royal Canadian Navy, where he served until his release from the service when the war ended in 1945. Young returned to CP and soon joined ""Maclean's"" magazine as an assistant editor. His second son, Neil Young, was born in Toronto in November 1945."
"Young began to sell fiction to publications in Canada and the United States including the ""Saturday Evening Post"" and ""Collier's"". He quit his job at ""Maclean's"" in 1948 to write short stories full-time."
"In 1949, Young bought a house in Omemee, Ontario, near Peterborough. The family's finances would vary with Young's success in selling his stories and he began taking assignments from ""Sports Illustrated."" His first novel ""The Flood"" was published in 1956. Young moved to Pickering, Ontario and spent a year working in public relations for a jet engine company before joining ""The Globe and Mail"" as a daily columnist in 1957 and moving back to Toronto. In 1959, Young met Astrid Mead while on assignment in British Columbia and, soon after, he and his wife separated. Following Young's divorce in 1961, he and Mead were married. They had a daughter, Astrid Young, in 1962."
He was also a host on Hockey Night in Canada until getting on the wrong side of Toronto Maple Leafs co-owner John Bassett. The Leafs threatened HNIC's sponsor and advertising agency until they agreed to fire Young.
Life on the farm.
"In 1967, Young bought a farm near Omemee in Cavan Township and built a house there. In 1969, he asked to be transferred to the ""Globe""'s news bureau in Ottawa. Shortly after arriving in Ottawa, he got into a dispute with his paper over the publication rights to excerpts from a book he had just written with Punch Imlach. The rights had been acquired by the ""Toronto Telegram"", but the ""Globe"" wouldn't allow Young's writing to appear in a competing newspaper. He quit the ""Globe"" and accepted a job offer from Bassett to become sports editor and columnist at the ""Telegram"", moving back to Toronto within weeks of his move to Ottawa. Young remained at the ""Telegram"" until the paper folded in 1971. He then rejoined the ""Globe and Mail"". Young and his second wife separated in 1976, and in the fall of 1977, he moved in with fellow ""Globe"" writer Margaret Hogan. The two married in 1980. At the same time, Young had a falling out with the ""Globe"" over stories critical of Imlach written by Donald Ramsay and quit. He worked with former Toronto Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe on Smythe's autobiography, which would be published after Smythe's death in November 1980."
"In 1988, Young received the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame as selected by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association, and was also inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. Young and his wife sold the farm in the late 1980s and moved to Howth, Ireland, a suburb of North Dublin. In 1990, Young received an honorary doctorate from Trent University and donated many of his papers to the university's archives. The Youngs returned to Omemee in 1992 and repurchased their old farm, which Young owned for the rest of his life. Scott Young Public School in Omemee was named in his honour in 1993. His autobiography, ""A Writer's Life"", was published in 1994."
"He and Margaret moved to Kingston, Ontario, in 2004, where he died the following year at the age of 87."

Frank Buckles
Frank Woodruff Buckles (born Wood Buckles'; 1 February 1901 – 27 February 2011) was the last living American veteran who fought in World War I.
Early life and career.
"Buckles was born in Bethany, Missouri. He enlisted in the U.S. Army at the beginning of America's involvement in World War I in April 1917. Only 16 years old at the time, Buckles was asked by his recruiter to show a birth certificate. Later Buckles said of that event, ""“I was just 16 and didn’t look a day older. I confess to you that I lied to more than one recruiter. I gave them my solemn word that I was 18, but I’d left my birth certificate back home in the family Bible. They’d take one look at me and laugh and tell me to go home before my mother noticed I was gone. Somehow I got the idea that telling an even bigger whopper was the way to go. So I told the next recruiter that I was 21 and darned if he didn’t sign me up on the spot! I enlisted in the Army on the 14th of August 1917."""""
"Before being accepted into the United States Army, he was turned down by the Marine Corps due to his slight weight."
"In 1917, Buckles was sent to Europe on the RMS Carpathia, which had rescued RMS Titanic survivors five years earlier. During the war Buckles served in England and France, driving ambulances and motorcycles for the Army's 1st Fort Riley Casualty Detachment."
"After the Armistice in 1918, Buckles escorted prisoners of war back to Germany. Following his discharge in 1919, he attended the dedication of the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, in honor of those Americans who died in World War I. While there, he met General John ""Black Jack"" Pershing, commander of all U.S. forces in France during the war."
"In the 1940s Buckles worked for a shipping company in Manila, Philippines. He was captured by the Japanese in 1942 and spent the next three and a half years in the Los Baños prison camp."

Erwin Rommel
"Field Marshal Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel, The ""Desert Fox"" (born : 15 November 1891 in Heidenheim Württemberg/died : 14 October 1944 in Herrlingen,Free People’s State of Wurttemberg) was an officer of the German Army in World War I and World War II. He died in 1944 at the age of 52 ."
"In WWII, he commanded the German Army in North Africa during the North African Campaign (1940-1943) in a long struggle against the British 8th Army. He was finally defeated at El Alamein. Later in the war, he commanded the German forces defending the French coast against the Allied Normandy invasion (1944)."
"Rommel was well liked by the German public and respected by the Allies. He was thought to be chivalrous and humane, when other German leaders were not. His famous ""Afrikakorps"" was not accused of any war crimes. Soldiers captured by his army were treated well and orders to kill captured Jewish soldiers and civilians were ignored."
"Rommel knew of the plan by senior officers to assassinate Hitler in 1944. When it failed, all concerned were tortured and executed. Hitler offered him the choice of suicide or court-martial, and he committed suicide. His death was announced as the death of a hero in battle."
Early life and career.
"Rommel was born in Heidenheim, Germany, 45 kilometers (28 mi) from Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg which was then part of the German Empire, on November 15, 1891. He was baptised on 17 November 1891. His father, Erwin Rommel (18601913) was a math teacher, and later a secondary school headmaster at Aalen. His mother was Helene von Lutz, the daughter of a local government official. Rommel was the second of four children; Karl, Gerhard, and Helene. Rommel wrote that his ""early years passed very happily."""
"At the age of 14, Rommel and a friend built a full-scale glider that was able to fly short distances. Young Erwin thought about being an engineer, and he showed a talent with technical work; however, because of his father, young Rommel joined the local 124th Württemberg Infantry Regiment as an officer cadet in 1910 and, shortly after, was sent to the Officer Cadet School in Danzig. He graduated on 15 November 1911, and was a lieutenant in January 1912."
"While at Cadet School, early in 1911, Erwin Rommel had met his future wife, 17-year-old Lucia Maria Mollin (also called ""Lucie"") (b. 6 June 1894 in Danzig; d. 26 September 1971 in Stuttgart). They married on November 27, 1916, in Danzig, and on December 24, 1928 had a son, Manfred, who would later become the mayor of Stuttgart. Manfred died in 2013. After having met Lucie, some historians think that Rommel also had an affair with a woman called Walburga Stemmer in 1913, and they had a daughter named Gertrud."
World War I.
"In World War I, Rommel fought in France, as well as in Romania and Italy, first as a member of the 6th Württemberg Infantry Regiment, and then in the Württemberg Mountain Battalion of the ""Alpenkorps."" While serving with that unit, he gained a reputation for making quick tactical decisions and taking advantage of enemy confusion. He was wounded three times and awarded the Iron Cross; First and Second Class."
"Rommel also received Prussia's highest medal, the Pour le Mérite after fighting in the mountains of west Slovenia, in Battles of the Isonzo–Soca front. The award came as a result of the Battle of Longarone, and the capture of Mount Matajur, Slovenia, and its defenders, numbering 150 Italian officers, 9,000 men, and 81 pieces of artillery. His battalion used gas during the battles of the Isonzo and also played a key role in the victory of the Central Powers over the Italian army at the Battle of Caporetto. While fighting at Isonzo, Rommel was taken prisoner by the Italians. He escaped, and because he spoke Italian, he was back to the German lines within two weeks. Later, when the German and Italian armies were allied during the Second World War, Rommel realised that their lack of success in battle was due to poor leadership and equipment, which when fixed, easily made them equal to German forces."
World War II.
Poland 1939.
"Rommel was a commander of the ""Führerbegleithauptquartier"" (Führer escort headquarters) during the Poland campaign, often moving up close to the front in the ""Führersonderzug"" train, seeing much of Hitler. After the Polish defeat, Rommel returned to Berlin to organize the Führer's victory parade, taking part himself as a member of Hitler's entourage. During the Polish campaign, Rommel was asked to help one of his wife's relatives, a Polish priest who had been arrested. When Rommel asked the Gestapo for information, the Gestapo found no information about the man's existence."

British Rail Class AM1
"Class AM1 was allocated to the prototype AC electric multiple units, converted from fourth-rail DC electric stock in 1952 and used on the Lancaster/Morecambe/Heysham route. This route had been electrified by the Midland Railway at 6.6 kV, 25 Hz AC, but the frequency was changed to 50 Hz in 1953 to test the prototype AM1 stock."
Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)
The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 had its origins in a rise in nationalism in the Balkans as well as in the Russian Empire's goal of recovering territorial losses that it had suffered because of the Crimean War. Tsar Alexander II was fighting against the Ottoman Empire led by Abdul Hamid II .
Kingdom of Romania
"The Kingdom of Romania (or 'Romania' after 1969) was a constitutional monarchy which existed between 13 March 1881 and 30 December 1947, specified by the First (in 1866), and respectively, the Second Constitution of Roumania. Thus, the Kingdom of Romania began with the reign of King Carol I of Romania and later replaced by Michael I of Romania . It's Prime minister was Ion Antonescu who was prime minister from 1940-1944 . He was later executed in 1946 2 year's after the defeat of Nazi Germany,Italy,Hungary,Croatia,Romania,Bulgaria and Japan the Countries in the Axis Powers who were defeated in 1945 ."
"From 1859 to 1877, Romania evolved from a personal union of two vassal principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia) to a full-fledged independent kingdom. During 1918-20, at the end of World War I, Transylvania, Eastern Moldavia (Bessarabia), and Bukovina were united with the Kingdom of Romania. In 1940, Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, Northern Transylvania and Southern Dobruja were ceded to the Soviet Union, Hungary and Bulgaria. In 1947 the last king was compelled to abdicate from throne. Socialist republic ruled by the Romanian Communist Party replaced the monarchy after Joseph Stalin occupied Romania in 1945 ."
Treaty of Trianon
The Treaty of Trianon is the peace treaty signed in 1920 between the Allies and Hungary.
"Hungary lost World War I and so the treaty gave about two thirds of its land and one third of its population to neighboring countries, like Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. The partition of Hungary brought irredentism, since many people in the lost lands were Hungarian and wanted to continue being part of Hungary."
"As a result, about 400 000 people from the lost territories sought refuge in Hungary."
"Also, the treaty forced Hungary to pay reparations and to limit the size of its army."
Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye
The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye was signed on 10 September 1919 by the winning Allies and the new Republic of Austria on the other. Austria lost large amounts of territory to the Allies after it lost World War I.
"Like the Treaty of Versailles with Germany, the treaty contained the Covenant of the League of Nations and so the United States did not ratify either of them."
Treaty of Paris (1920)
"The 1920 Treaty of Paris was an act signed by Romania and the Principal Allied Powers of the time (France, United Kingdom, Italy and Japan) whose purpose was the recognition of Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia. The treaty however never came into force because Japan failed to ratify it."
Bessarabia
Bessarabia is the word for the area in Eastern Europe between Romania and Ukraine. It shares borders with Dniester River on the east and the Prut River on the west.
"During the 19th century it was sometimes part of Romania and sometimes in the Russian Empire. It was again part of Romania most of the first half of the 20th century. The Soviet Union occupied the region after 1944. Today, most areas of Bessarabia belong to the Republic of Moldova."
Bukovina
Bukovina is a historical region in both Romania and Ukraine. It can be found by the northeastern Carpathian Mountains.
"The National Assembly is a type of legislature in some countries. The best known National Assembly, and the first legislature to be known by this title, was established during the French Revolution in 1789, known as the ""Assemblée Nationale"". Almost every country in Africa has a National Assembly. However, outside of Africa there are not that many countries with National assembly. In Europe there is Britain, France, Germany etc. In Asia there is China, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan,Bangladesh etc."
Kenneth Clarke
"Kenneth Harry Clarke, Baron Clarke of Nottingham, (born 2 July 1940), often known as Ken Clarke, is a British politician. He was the Justice Secretary in the coalition government. Clarke has had a long career in politics and has served in the cabinets of Margaret Thatcher and John Major. On February 26, 2017, Clarke became Father of the House after the death of Gerald Kaufman."
Early life and politics.
"Clarke was born in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, England and was educated at the University of Cambridge. He became the Member of Parliament for Rushcliffe at the 1970 general election and became a Queen's Counsel in 1980. He held a number of lower positions in government under Margaret Thatcher until she promoted him to Health Secretary in 1988. He became Education Secretary in 1990 and when Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced with John Major he stayed on as Health Secretary until 1992 when he was promoted to Chancellor of the Exchequer. He stayed as Chancellor until 1997 when the Conservatives were defeated in the General Election."
In opposition.
John Major resigned as leader of the Conservative Party soon after he was defeated in the general election and Clarke stood for election to replace him as leader and therefore become the Leader of the Opposition. However he was defeated by William Hague in this contest. When Hague himself resigned after losing the 2001 General Election Clarke again stood for leader but was defeated by Iain Duncan Smith. In 2005 he stood for the leadership for a third time but was defeated by David Cameron. It is thought that Clarke was unable to become leader because many in the Conservative Party do not wish to see the United Kingdom replace the pound with the Euro as the main currency whereas Clarke has always been very much in favour of this policy.
As Shadow Business Secretary.
Clarke returned to the Conservative front bench in 2009 as the Shadow Business Secretary where he has the job of monitoring the performance of the current Business Secretary Peter Mandelson. When the coalition government was formed on 11 May 2010 Clarke was made the Justice Secretary.

Gengan Tonaki
"Gengan Tonaki (渡名喜元完; ""Tonaki Gengan"", 30 October 1884 – 24 January 1997) was a Japanese (Okinawan) farmer and supercentenarian, and at the time of his death at age 112 years, 86 days the oldest Japanese man ever (although the claimed 120-year-old Shigechiyo Izumi was believed to have been older) before being beaten by Denzo Ishizaki."
"Tonaki was born in late October 1884 in Sashiki (today Nanjō), Okinawa, as the second child and only boy of seven siblings, of whom one sister, who was eight years younger, was still living at the time of his death. In mid-1st decade of the 20th century, Tonaki fled to Hawaii to avoid the Russo-Japanese War and worked at a sugar refinery for about ten years before returning to Okinawa, working as a farmer until age 89. He married a woman named Kame (who was eight years younger and died at age 61 during the Battle of Okinawa) and had six children (of whom one died young of liver disease and four, all except his second son, died during the Battle of Okinawa)."
"Tonaki became the oldest living man in Japan on 20 September 1991, after 108-year-old Gihei Oka's death and also the oldest living Japanese man overall, later on 16 February 1992 after the 109 years, 13 days old Russo-Japanese War veteran Mamoru Eto's death, as Eto who was just 4 days younger than Oka emigrated to the United States, and later on 30 October 1994 only the second Japanese man who became a supercentenarian, after Eiju Tsuru who died on 11 January 1990, just 24 days before his 111th birthday, although Shigechiyo Izumi who died on 21 February 1986 was still believed to have been aged 120 years, 237 days and Denzo Ishizaki claimed to have been ten days older than Tonaki, as his birth register which showed a birth year of 1886 rather than 1884 was claimed to have been delayed by two years."
"After 111-year-old Frenchman Émile Fourcade's death on 29 December 1995, Tonaki became the last living man born in 1884 as well as the second-oldest living man behind Danish-born Americanman Christian Mortensen, although Americanman Johnson Parks has been verified to have been 15 days older than Tonaki but recently become disputed after a study proving that he may have been born around ten years later than he claimed."

"If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care."
"I, I, give me cyanide."
"I mean, is it )),"
"Yeah,"
right.
I'll take anything you know.
Uh-huh.
"I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying, you can experiment on me."
"Ri-,"
Exactly.
Go ahead.
"And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, if these people knowingly consent to be, research monkeys and well, let them,"
Exactly.
"let them, do it."
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's what I think they're saying too.
Have you had any snow up your way?
"No,"
"we haven't had any since, uh, oh, just before Christmas"
"and, uh we had a lot before Christmas."
Um.
The ski resorts were really
"and, uh,"
"but, now we have, we've had fog, for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion,"
"so,"
"but no, uh, no snow."
Um.
"The snows all melted off uh,"
"Well, I talked to a woman who lived up in the hills, uh, mountains in, uh, Utah, I guess this last weekend"
"and she had, uh, quite a bit of snow on the ground her way."
"Uh-huh,"
Yeah.
If it could just be spread out a little bit.
Right.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Yeah.
"It has really been nice here, uh,"
"we are supposed to have some rain this weekend,"
but I don't know if we'll get it or not.
A lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us.
"The, the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us. Just by, well not too many miles."
Uh-huh.
Are you in an agricultural area?
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"We have,"
"Well, I know the I know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of, off of the land."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Yeah.
We have quite a few farmers.
"We, we live out in the country."
"We are on a farm,"
but we are not a farming person
Uh-huh.
"Uh, we have a garden."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, but we are not farmers."
Huh.
"Well, you know there are some disadvantages to being down south."
Uh-huh.
"And that is, it gets so hot that, you know, a lot of things die during the Summer from the heat."
So you do spend less time then?
Yeah
"because they don't want to know, they almost don't want to know us."
They want to be with their friends.
How old are your kids?
Are they married or what?
"Uh, yes,"
"I have, uh, two married, two and then two almost married"
"and the other two, I'm not sure."
"Well, Two two, two, uh, uh, for sure are single."
"Oh, boy, you have a lot of kids."
"Yeah,"
"we have, between the spouse and myself we have six."
"Oh, well, that's kind of nice, though."
"You you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday, huh?"
Because I came with a split family
"and she had,"
"Well, no,"
there is so much of them are gone
and they're doing their own things
"and and a lot of times they, they've got, you know, uh when the holidays,"
"Well, that's true."
"They have to see their other parent, I guess too."
Yeah
"and sometimes they want to do their own thing,"
so sometimes it's just spouse and me.
I know.
"And, and you know what?"
What?
Sometimes that's okay.
I know
"Because,"
"I, I was pretty fortunate this Christmas"
"I didn't get in debt,"
so.
"Oh, that's good."
"I'm taking like, uh, sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what I can"
Uh-huh.
so I won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore.
"Oh, uh-huh."
It's so rare
you hear anybody doing that any longer
I know.
"I even bought myself a Surgery , you know,"
and I just love it.
I haven't learned everything to do on it yet
but I figure that will help me save you know.
Yeah.
"My, uh, roommate does sew some"
"and, and, uh, she hasn't sewed anything in a long time"
"but I, I'm sure that she could pick it up again."
My mother always sewed.
She tried to teach me when I was young but not interested
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, see, some people are, some aren't"
"because  I have some sisters, I have three sisters"
Yeah.
and none of those are really interested in sewing.
Yeah.
"But that's a real good way to save money, though by doing that."
"Yeah,"
"and then I can also, you know, do some crafts and sell those at garage sales."
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I know exactly what you mean."
"We are fortunate or, uh, we are on a, where we are we get flooded, it floods below us behind us."
Uh-huh.
"But we are, uh, we are high enough that our house itself we never, you know, have had any problem like that."
"Oh, well, that is fortunate."
Yeah.
It is an old farm house
"and, uh, we really like it here."
Uh-huh.
"Well, I, I like it, I like it here."
"Uh, I, I grew up here."
I have lived other places
"and, and, but I, I did grow up here"
Uh-huh.
and this is very much home for me.
Uh-huh.
"And,"
It is nice down there.
"I, I, I liked it when we visited there."
I hope you visited during the winter.
Uh-huh.
"One of my, one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter"
"and you go to cold, cool places, that, well, I go to cool places during the Summer if I can anyway."
Right.
Right.
That is the best time to go.
Yeah.
"and usually it has been when we have gone, it has been nice."
"It has been hot,"
"but it is, it is hot to me in the wintertime down there."
"Oh, sure."
Quite a difference.
Yeah.
"What, uh, what kind of climate do you have?"
"Well, uh, it's, we just moved recently"
"so now we're in the, uh, Dallas area"
and it's very very nice
Oh.
"and,"
"The only experience I have,"
I don't have any children
"but I've, uh, I was a baby-sitter in high school."
"And then, just recently, after we were married, I baby-sat for a dentist while she worked."
"And I just, uh ..."
<talking> Yeah.
"That's the only thing I've ever done also, is baby-sit."
Is it? ery faint.
"But, uh, I've heard people that I work with talk about, you know, child care."
"Especially, I guess it's even harder on single mothers."
"Oh, yeah."
The expense.
Yeah.
"Having to pick up the kid by, you know, six o'clock"
or it's five dollars for every minute you're late. And stuff like that
Uh-huh.
Which is understandable.
"I mean, these people can't, you know, stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late"
Just sit around
That that's true.
but
"See the lady I did it for,"
that's why she picked me is because I would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up.
So she could sleep in.
"no,"
"I watch those if I,"
"but my husband likes to watch, um, old movies, especially war movies, or, or, uh, sports, which I'm not,"
"Oh, see, I like sports."
"No,"
I don't.
"Well, I, I do, I like ice skating"
"and I like, uh, gymnastics, and some track and field,"
Uh-huh.
"but I, I,"
and I'll watch snippets of baseball games
"and I, I just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing."
Uh-huh.
"And I don't ever, no matter what's on, I don't ever just sit and watch T V."
"I'm usually either doing dishes,"
"or I may be sewing,"
"or, you know, I always have, or letter writing,"
I know.
"or I may be working around in the room somehow,"
"but I don't, I don't ever just sit and,"
"I, that's something that comes from your old age, you know."
"No,"
I don't sit.
Idle hands are the devil's workshop
I know.
Who has time?
"I don't have time to sit, I know."
No.
"It's, it's, uh,"
That's why I don't get to watch that much.
"I mean, I, watch nine o'clock"
Right.
so I'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again.
"<Laughter> That's neat,"
that's neat
"And, uh, I, I don't know,"
"now I, I know eastern,"
"now the other thing we do here, of course, is a single, not quite a single climate."
"We have, uh, we do have some snow in the wintertime"
and it can be quite warm in the summertime.
Uh-huh.
"Not hot like, uh,"
I lived in the midwest for a while.
Oh.
"And I know that, uh, you know, it can be freezing cold in the wintertime, and hot and, uh, sticky in the summertime."
Uh-huh.
We don't have that much.
"It's, uh, it's a very mild climate."
"Oh, well that's nice."
"That's good for the clothes budget, I would imagine."
"Yes,"
it is.
"Because here, gosh, we had, uh,"
the winter hasn't been bad this winter.
"It's, it it's only snowed maybe once or twice"
but it's been cold.
"Low twenties, let's say,"
"and then the summer gets up to eighties, nineties"
"so,"
You interested in woodworking?
Yeah.
"Actually, I, uh, I guess I am"
"Um, it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion."
"Uh, I do, uh, some, uh, woodworking myself"
"But, you also manage to make them."
"uh, actually, we, we have only made one of them since we got married about four years ago. One of the family reunions."
Yeah.
But we are both in school
so that makes it kind of tough.
Yeah.
"They usually, uh, they have been happening, uh, just after the summer semester starts."
You can't really get away.
Usually not.
We managed to get to one.
That was before I started school
and she took that summer off.
"But, uh,"
"Well, now that we have been talking about it, I, uh, I am kind of getting home sick now."
Because it has been over three years since I have been home  to see my grandparents.
Oh goodness.
"Well, my, my grandfather is the only one that is still around."
Yeah.
"And see, my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically."
Yeah.
"So, unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together, it is kind of like."
"She was like the glue,"
so.
"Yeah,"
I understand.
Where is home for you?
"Originally, uh, I, uh, was born in Missouri."
Yeah.
"But, uh, you know, we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana, Mississippi, uh, here in Texas"
Yeah.
"but it is harder for everyone to get in, get home."
Yeah.
"Huh. So you have a M F A in, in what division of art?"
"but,"
"Well, I, I actually have a Masters of art"
and it's in art education.
"Oh, okay."
"So, I'm a licensed teacher"
"but jobs being what they are, I substitute teach"
Yeah.
and that way I have time for my kids too.
And I've been fortunate that I can afford to work part-time.
I don't know how long that's going to last
"Oh, yeah."
"And, uh, they're cutting back,"
so I don't go in all that often
"but I've been real interested in some of those cute country, country kind of things."
"Uh, I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars"
"and I say, oh no"
"and , and I go"
and I make it.
Yeah.
That's how I started jewelry making.
"I, I love to cook."
"Oh, that's great."
"And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and, and, and knife and, and a fork and all kinds of stuff"
and I went
"and I signed up for class because then again, you get, you know, get someone to guide you"
and you get the tools you don't feel like buying.
Exactly.
And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars
It took me a lot of time
"but  it didn't,"
"Oh, yeah."
more because of their personalities than their sportsman
Uh-huh.
Well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship.
Another part of it was I'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for
"so you know, the competitor,"
and I became involved in following his career.
Right
"And, uh, I know that, that my husband,"
Tom Kite was his fair haired boy.
Oh.
And he thought he was spectacular.
"I said, Whoa."
"I'm not going to, I'm not going to stay interested in him."
So I decided Andy Bean was good competition
Uh-huh.
"Any time they both played, why, he was just real excited when Tom was, you know, shown on the television,"
and I followed Andy Bean.
Uh-huh
We both followed Lee Trevino into the Seniors.
"Oh, he's interesting."
He is.
I like to watch him.
"He is a character not just a golfer,"
Yeah.
but he's quite a character.
Yeah.
"And there are some really, really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
I think you're right.
"And I think it's critical, it's critical to have a good role model in any field, any sports."
Yeah.
"Now they've gotten larger and larger as, as they have developed the land."
"And, of course, it's pretty static right now"
and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy.
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
How about you?
"Well, I am, uh, I'm, gosh, I'm barely in Dallas."
I'm just north of Addison Airport up on the tollway.
Okay.
Okay.
"And, I guess we have a similar situation."
"I mean, we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy, eighty thousand"
Uh-huh.
and then we've got Bent Tree right across the street
"so I don't I don't even know how high those go,"
Okay.
but some of those are pretty big.
"Yes,"
those are over a million.
Yeah
"So, it's, that's the strange thing about, I guess, Dallas because back where I'm from, you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all."
"They'd all be pretty similar to one another within a, a couple miles."
"So,"
"Well, we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas."
Yeah.
"Not as bad as Houston,"
"but, exactly what you're describing is what happens all over."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
I've noticed that.
"Well, now, do you live in a, a home, or zero lot home,"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, that's fantastic."
"Yeah,"
"I used to, uh, kind of be that way myself when I lived in, uh, north western Florida in the panhandle,"
I used to sail about every day.
"I'd work, go to work,"
I'd like to do some sailing.
"Yeah,"
it's a lot of fun.
"It's, uh,"
"especially if you get a, a pretty fast boat"
like those catamarans are pretty fast.
"Yeah,"
"what,"
"You can actually,"
"Do, if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that"
"or they just,"
"Well, actually, I, I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life."
"Uh, my family's pretty into it"
Yeah.
"and, uh, I took sailing lessons when I was about six"
"and then, uh"
Is it pretty easy?
"Yeah,"
"it, it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while, you know, uh, just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and, and the physics behind it."
Yeah.
"So it's, it's not too bad,"
"it's pretty easy to get the hang of, I think"
"and, uh, generally, everybody I've, I've known has kind of gotten into it,"
"but some people are more motorboaters, you know which is fine."
Yeah.
"Well, that's about all we have"
"Yeah,"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah"
"I guess it's what sells newspapers, you know."
It's a very low way of living.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, so,"
"and, and, and as far as, uh, you know, myself having any particular personal, uh, knowledge or insight into politics or politicians, it, I'm not terribly involved in it."
Uh-huh
Just in a very cursory way.
Right.
I vote
"and I, you know, try to do whatever I can on the little local area,"
"but, I, I, it just is not one of the things that I have, uh, placed, uh, uh, a, a lot of my particular time and effort into,"
Yeah.
"so, I, I always feel very outside this kind of, uh, this kind of an issue."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"But, uh,"
I am kind of the same way.
"I just kind of read the paper follow up on I mean, you know, just keep an eye on what's going on"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
right.
but I don't really play an active role in any kind of politics
"Yeah,"
"uh,"
"Uh, uh-huh."
"I'm not, I'm not in there,"
"I'm not one of those, uh, you know, volunteers that's down at headquarters and whatever, uh, although I admire the people that do that"
and they certainly do get inside information
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Exactly.
"Well, we have a lot that needs be done."
"We have, uh, uh, carpeting,"
"and, and we did have a new, uh, floor put in our kitchen."
"And, um, I have my mother living with us"
and so she was in a room with a carpet
"and, of course, she's quite aged,"
"she's ninety-three now,"
so that meant she had problems now and then
and it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a linoleum down.
So it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was
"and  so that was a really positive, uh, uh,"
Huh-uh.
it was fairly expensive though.
"I, I was impressed,"
"I think, that, uh,"
we had somebody do it
"and it was, it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet."
Huh-uh.
"Kind of depends on the quality of carpet, I suppose,"
Yeah.
"but, uh, in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and, and fix the floor"
"so it's, uh,"
"I don't know,"
"what ever,"
but they have to put stuff on the floor
"and it's, uh, kind of a process."
"Well, it sounds like you have some pretty good experiences with, uh, with, uh, uh, home repair."
Huh-uh.
We have.
It's been really fun.
"Oh, I see."
"uh, but, uh, we did a lot of fishing when we were up there."
"But down here, I have a brother that likes to go over on the east, in East Texas, and do fishing."
"I can't remember what the name of the lake is,"
and he was just here this past weekend.
"I could have,"
"I, I think he mentioned it again,"
but I couldn't remember what it was.
"Uh, I want to call it Salt Fork, or Lake Fork."
"I, I can't remember,"
but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places.
"Oh, oh, oh, uh, I think I know where, uh, Lake Caddo, or something like that."
"I, you know,"
that may be it.
That may be it.
"If it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places. They hold tournaments there, and everything."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"and he said that he has never gone anywhere before,"
"and he's fished all over the United States, in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen."
So I would love to go over there.
"They were talking about going over there, and, and some time in the spring,"
"and I was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing, and, uh, and catch some bass."
"I would love to do that,"
"but they have snakes over there,"
"and I'm not too welcome around,"
"I don't, I really don't want to share a boat with a snake."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I just, I, I, I don't see it."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"well, that, that was number one for the week actually, too,"
"so, so it was a little bit, uh,"
"I was thinking, Wow,"
people must be into crime movies again.
"But, but in the middle of that conversation we sort or picked an, um, an interesting point."
Last year's number one movie for the year was GHOSTS.
Is that right?
I don't know if you saw GHOSTS or not.
I did see GHOSTS.
"Yeah,"
"and, and, and that was, that, that helped us sort of feel good about, you know, about ourselves and about one around us, in that at least, at least, if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that, at least they're still going to see the real good movies, you know."
Yeah.
I think that GHOSTS was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good.
Yeah.
And it turned out to be an excellent movie.
Yeah.
"It was, it, I was absolutely enthralled by it."
"I've forgotten the guy's name who was in it, who had the lead role."
"Oh, Patrick Swayze?"
"Yeah,"
and I especially like him.
"Yeah,"
he's very good.
He's a really good guy.
"Other than that, DANCES WITH WOLVES seems like to be the only thing I've seen in the past several months to have any,"
"Really,"
I'm trying to think what else I've seen recently.
What else have we seen recently.
"Oh, you know, what's pretty cute actually. Um,"
DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.
"Well, you know, the little boy, the little one was trying to decide if there was a Santa Claus."
"Uh-huh,"
"oh, that's right"
"and the neighbor,"
they thought it was the neighbor.
They thought it was the neighbor.
He gave the two doubting Thomases a rubber band and a paper clip.
Yeah.
I thought that was wonderful.
"And then, uh, it, it's, it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor."
"And, uh, on Sunday, used to be on Sunday nights, now I can't figure out where they've moved it."
"On our, uh, public television, they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show."
Uh-huh.
"And it showed the latest, uh, developments from all the computer companies."
"Uh-huh,"
I've never seen that program.
"Well, you know, it's,"
"unless you're really into computers, you and software, you probably wouldn't be interested,"
Uh-huh.
"but I don't know,"
Uh-huh.
it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there.
Oh.
"And, uh, you know, what, they, they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets, you know, and then they also, the hardware."
Oh.
Uh-huh.
So you could see what the new developments were and what to look for
"and, I enjoyed that."
Uh-huh.
It was just a thirty minute show with no commercials.
"Oh, okay."
"It's public television, course, doesn't have the commercials during the show"
Okay.
"Um, well I guess first of all I, I could have asked that before."
Do you have children?
No.
No.
Okay.
"Because I, I didn't know if that would make a difference  in how you felt."
Yeah.
"Um, what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two,"
I think it's a good idea.
"I think everybody should, should, uh, put in their time so to speak for the, for the good of the, the nation and for the good of themselves."
Yeah.
"I think it's, uh,"
"would everyone grow up and mature and, and realize what this country's all about."
"I just, um,"
"I guess that's my, that's something that my family has always believed strongly in,"
"and, uh, I had opportunities in high school, to work in some programs, um"
Did you?
something Oh!
"and, and I agree with what you said that it's, uh, it benefits the person doing it  so much I don't think they realize"
Uh-huh.
"and I, uh, I, I think it gives you a better perspective, on life"
"and, uh, it gives you a little bit, uh, more a glimpse of the, the real world"
"and  and it would certainly help the country, too, uh."
Yeah.
Really
"Yeah,"
"I think that's probably like, uh, quite a few things that, that the kids, uh, maybe not so much nowadays but used to  go through, you know,"
Yeah.
"they, just, they were, they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do."
Yes.
Yeah.
"And, uh, since, since everyone is going out and working now, whether it be because of finances or just the economy,  uh, the mother's not there anymore"
"and restructuring, stepfamilies,"
yeah.
"and the children are,"
"I think, I think a lot of society is suffering."
"Not to say that women shouldn't, you know, go out and do what they want to do"
"but I think that, um,  society's really going to have to get used to it."
Right.
And they're not quite used to it yet
"and that's I,"
"The schools or the the schools or the parents,"
yeah.
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"Um, I'm trying to think of what else."
I have a lot of opinions on this except all of a sudden I went blank
"A lot of the things, um, the demographics do,"
"I mean, there are more,"
"I don't have the numbers in my head right now,"
"but, a lot of the things that brought feminism, I mean there are just more women in, in, in the demographics, just generally,  in the United States, in terms of being,"
"Right,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I'm the typical baby boomer,"
"I hate that term,"
"Oh, yeah."
"but in terms of women,  women going out, I mean twenty-three, I remember that."
Yeah.
"What's it like to be twenty-three as a woman today,"
"I mean, when I was twenty-three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married,"
Uh-huh.
"um, those were the general issues."
"Speaking of getting married, I was talking to someone yesterday on this, on the project,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, uh, we were talking about child care"
and he asked me if I had any kids.
He was about forty or fifty years old
"and I said no, I'm just twenty,"
"He was ancient,"
yeah.
"and I said no, I'm just twenty-three,  you know, because I don't think of myself as needing to have children"
Uh-huh.
"but the first thing he says is, well don't you miss that part of your life."
"And I just,"
"I,"
"my, my mind just went,"
You didn't know what you're going to be missing.
"I went, what. You know,"
"because it it really didn't, doesn't even occur to me right now to have children,"
I don't have any either
"and I've been a married for eleven years,"
so.
"Yeah,"
"and I, it just, you know,"
"I think that I'll probably have children when I'm about thirty, thirty-five, something like,  just because, I'm not sure if it's just, if it's just me, or, or women in general that are twenty-three right now, because, um, I'm really into my career."
"Yeah,"
"when it's time,"
uh-huh.

"""No Good Advice"" is a song by British girl group Girls Aloud, taken from their debut album ""Sound of the Underground"" (2003). The song was written by Aqua's Lene Nystrøm Rasted, Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. It has themes of rebellion, reflecting Higgins' general mood of failure after a business partnership fell through."
"Following the overwhelming success of Girls Aloud's debut single ""Sound of the Underground"", the group waited five months until May 2003 before releasing the follow-up. The song cemented their success when it peaked at number two in Ireland, Scotland and on the UK Singles Chart. ""No Good Advice"" performed moderately elsewhere, reaching the top forty in the Netherlands, the top fifty in Belgium and peaking at number 88 in Australia."
"The music video features Girls Aloud dressed in futuristic silver outfits and hologram effects. ""No Good Advice"" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on Girls Aloud's first three concert tours. Described as ""a disco track with guitar"", the song has heavy 1980s influences. The track was lauded by many contemporary music critics, who deemed it a worthy sequel to its predecessor and praised Higgins' production."
"Musically, the song was labelled ""a disco track with guitar - a cross between Blondie and The Bangles."" The song was written in the key of Bb minor. The song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. In place of a middle 8, there is a guitar solo instead. The song ends with a spoken outro."
"Originally written for Miranda Cooper under the pseudonym Moonbaby, ""No Good Advice"" seems to be about a rebellious girl who doesn't need ""no good advice"" and does things independently. However, according to an interview for ""The Guardian"" in July 2004, Brian Higgins said that the song reflected his general mood of failure after a special deal between Xenomania and London Records fell through in 2000, and about persisting in spite of what people told him to do or not to do. The song's chorus originally began with the phrase ""I don't like fried rice"". ""No Good Advice"" was sung over a rave backing track, until different Xenomania musicians were asked to contribute new backing tracks. Higgins was inspired by indie rock. He stated, ""pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise [...] The guitar riff on No Good Advice is very very similar to the riff on the track Michael by Franz Ferdinand."""
"Brian Higgins said that Girls Aloud initially didn't like the song - ""we played them some of it, and they said: 'That's not our sound.' I objected to the use of that phrase 'our sound'. I told them they had five minutes to talk about whether or not they wanted to continue with me. They went away and spoke about it and since then it's been fine. They come in expecting to work, and there's a trust there which, I think, dates back to that day."""

Both of his teachers, in Paris, were famous exponents of 'Grand manner' naturalism. During this period at the Salon he became interested in the work of Jean-Louis Ernest Meissonier who was already popular with the French public."
"Brymner specialized in domestic figure scenes and avoided large historical subjects.

In 1886, he settled in Montreal after staying in Paris ""on and off for almost seven years"". Two years prior to leaving Paris, at Runswick Bay, Yorkshire, he completed ""A Wreath of Flowers""."
"Many members of the Beaver Hall Group studied under Brymner, who encouraged them to explore new modernistic approaches to painting."

A slice knot is a type of mathematical knot.
"In knot theory, a ""knot"" means an embedded circle in the 3-sphere"
and that the 3-sphere can be thought of as the boundary of the four-dimensional ball
"A knot formula_3 is slice if it bounds a nicely embedded 2-dimensional disk ""D"" in the 4-ball."
"What is meant by ""nicely embedded"" depends on the context, and there are different terms for different kinds of slice knots. If ""D"" is smoothly embedded in ""B"", then ""K"" is said to be smoothly slice. If ""D"" is only locally flat (which is weaker), then ""K"" is said to be topologically slice."
The following is a list of all slice knots with 10 or fewer crossings; it was compiled using the Knot Atlas:
"6, formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, formula_21, formula_22 and formula_23."

Kong Jie (; born 25 November 1982) is a Chinese professional Go player.
"Kong Jie turned professional in 1994 at the age of 12. He was promoted to 7-dan after eight years in 2001. In 2004 he was sent into the Teda Cup as China's representative against Lee Chang-ho and Yoda Norimoto. Kong Jie is China's 29th professional 9-dan, doing so by being runner-up in the 13th Samsung Cup, and entering the finals of the Asian TV Cup for the first time. In 2009, Kong Jie achieved a major international breakthrough by winning the Asian TV Cup—defeating Korea's top three players of Lee Sedol, Lee Chang-ho and Kang Dongyun respectively. His win marked the end of several years of poor personal international results. Later in the year, Kong Jie followed up by reaching the semi-finals of the 14th Samsung Cup and won the title by defeating his two compatriots Gu Li and Qiu Jun."
"In 2010, Kong Jie passed the preliminary rounds of the 14th LG Cup to face former champion Lee Chang-ho in the finals. Kong won the match 2–0 and also the tournament. Later in the year, Kong Jie successfully defended his Asian TV Cup, defeating Korea's Lee Chang-ho and Japan's Yuki Satoshi. He followed that with another big win over a red hot Lee Sedol, to win the 23rd Fujitsu Cup. He arguably cemented his status as the 2010 world's strongest Go player. In 2011, Kong overcame compatriot Meng Tailing to again reach the LG Cup Final, but was unable to defend his title against another compatriot, Piao Wenyao, thus allowing the latter to win his first world title and be promoted to 9-dan professional on the merit of winning a world championship."
"This was the last international final Kong played in. Within the next few years, with the rise of new 1990s generation professionals and the increased competition at the international level, only Gu Li and Lee Sedol would continue to have high tournament placings in big international tournaments. During the 15th Samsung Cup, Kong defeated a soon to be wedded Lee Chang-Ho before succumbing to Kim Ji-Seok in the quarterfinals. The match, with Kong playing Black, turned out to be a crucial ""fight to the death"" of both sides' dragons, but Kong miscalculated a combination by Kim on move 150, and on move 202, resigned, thus failing to defend his crown."
Kong Jie is considered to be an expert at life and death problems. In China he is known as the King of Tsumego (King Kong).

The Signal Company acquired a controlling stake in the company in 1969, and in 1971 renamed it Hayes Trucks. In 1975, Signal sold the company to Paccar, which closed the Hayes plants."
"The British Columbia company was established in 1920 by Douglas Hayes, a parts dealer, and partner W. Anderson from Quadra Island, and was originally the Hayes-Anderson Motor Company Ltd. It was renamed Hayes Manufacturing Company Ltd. in 1928, when the company built a large factory on the False Creek flats in Vancouver. The company eventually had over 600 employees and three plants."
"Along with trucks, Hayes manufactured buses, moving vans, tractors and trailers. Its few bus models included the Hayes ""Teardrop"", a very streamlined design introduced in 1936. Several Teardrop buses were purchased by Pacific Stage Lines, one of which has been preserved by the Transit Museum Society."
"The truck hood ornament was a die-cast, chrome-plated, 5-pound bear or a bronze cast bear. The chrome bear was found on the clippers and the bronze was off the square nose logger with butterfly wings. There was also a small bear ornament on each door."
"The Signal Company, the parent firm of Mack Trucks, acquired a controlling share in Hayes Manufacturing in 1969. The company was renamed Hayes Trucks in 1971. In 1975, Signal sold the company to Paccar, which closed the Hayes plants."
"In addition to operating the truck company, the founder's son, Donald Hayes, continued and expanded family logging operations, establishing Hayes Forest Services Limited in 1956. In 2006, Donald P. Hayes, President, and grandson of the founder, proudly accepted the award for being one of Canada's 50 Best Managed Companies - Public or Private."
= = = Aldgisl = = =
"Aldegisel, Aldegisl, Aldgillis, Aldgisl, Aldgils or Eadgils (fl. c. 678) was the ruler of Frisia (as king or duke) in the late seventh century contemporarily with Dagobert II and a very obscure figure. All that is known of him is in relation to the famous saint that he harboured and protected, Wilfrid, but he is the first historically verifiable ruler of the Frisians. What the exact title of the Frisian rulers was depends on the source. Frankish sources tend to call them dukes; other sources often call them kings."
"Wilfrid, deposed from his Archdiocese of York, exiled from Northumbria and on his way to Rome to seek papal support, landed in Frisia in 678. and was warmly received by Aldegisel, who entertained him for several months over the winter, probably at Utrecht. According to Stephen of Ripon, Wilfrid's biographer, Aldegisel encouraged Wilfrid in his effective evangelism and ""[the Frisians] accepted his [Wilfrid's] teaching and with a few exceptions all the chiefs were baptised by him in the name of the Lord, as well as many thousands of common people."" It is possible that Aldegisel was one of the early converts. However, it has been doubted whether Wilfrid was actually successful in Frisia, since there is no other evidence of the success of Christianity there before the work of Willibrord."
"While Wilfrid was at Aldegisel's court, the Frankish mayor of the palace, Ebroin, offered a bushel of gold coins in return for Wilfrid, alive or dead. Aldegisel himself is said to have torn up and burned the letter from the Frankish mayor in front of the ambassadors and his household. It has been surmised by some that Aldegisel's kindness to Wilfrid was a mode of defiance of Frankish domination. His successor and possibly son was Radbod, who followed the older pagan ways and was an enemy of Charles Martel."

"KZOO has been broadcasting continuously in Japanese since the station signed on October 18, 1963. It was not the first Japanese-language station in Honolulu (competitor KOHO/1170 signed on in 1959), but it is the only one still on the air today."
"The station has been owned by Polynesian Broadcasting since 1967, when businessman Noboru Furuya took over KZOO's operations. Furuya's son David and his wife Robyn took over management of the station in the mid-1990s when Furuya's health began to decline. Noboru Furuya died in 2002 at the age of 82; David and Robyn Furuya (now the president and vice-president, respectively, of Polynesian Broadcasting) continue to run KZOO today."
"Though most of their programs are broadcast from their offices at the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii, in 2011 KZOO began broadcasting special interviews from a studio in the Shirokiya in Ala Moana Shopping Center."
"KZOO's programs include news, talk shows, and Japanese music. Most of it is original programming, but some of the talk shows are from Japan."
"Many of KZOO's current on-air staff have been with the station for decades, including Keiko Ura, host of an Okinawan language show on Sundays, who joined the station in early 1964; Maki Norris, one of the hosts of a popular daily talk show called ""Moshi-Moshi Time,"" who has worked at KZOO since 1976; and Harumi ""Danny"" Oshita."

The station's broadcast day also includes simulcasts of programs from Japan as well as local talk and advice shows on a variety of topics, from health to the law."
"When KZOO was knocked off the air by the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake, the station's assistant general manager, Kaoru Ekimoto, contacted English-language adult contemporary music station KSSK, who put her on the air with disaster relief information in Japanese; the station also set up a hotline to answer listener questions.

= = = Angletarn Pikes = = =
Angletarn Pikes is a fell in the English Lake District near the village of Patterdale. Its most notable feature is the summit tarn from which it derives its name.
"Angletarn Pikes stands on the western arm of the long horseshoe ridge which surrounds the Martindale catchment, a system of valleys draining north into Ullswater. The adjacent fells on this ridge are Place Fell to the north and Brock Crags to the south. Beda Fell, a subsidiary ridge, also juts out into Martindale from Angletarn Pikes. This separates the heads of Boredale and Bannerdale."
"The western side above Goldrill Beck is steep and includes the faces of Dubhow and Fall Crags. The long eastern flank above Bannerdale is also pock-marked with crags, Heck Crag being the principal feature. The narrow north eastern slopes above Boredale, although steep, are less rocky and are cut by the upper ravine of Freeze Beck."
"North from the summit a long ridge drops over Stony Rigg (1,640 ft) to the walkers’ crossroads of Boredale Hause. From here paths run down to Hartsop, Patterdale and Boredale, while a further bridleway cuts across Beda Fell to Bannerdale. Boredale Hause carries the tiny ruin of a building named ‘Chapel in the Hause’ on OS maps. A mountain pass at 1,300 ft seems a curious place to construct a church. From the Hause a good path carries on northwards up Steel Edge to Place Fell."
"The north-east ridge to Beda Fell is also well defined, a fair path traversing a series of rocky knolls before the final rise to the summit, named Beda Head."
"Southward from Angletarn Pikes is Angle Tarn itself. This indented waterbody is about a quarter of a mile long with an island in the middle and forms a picturesque foreground for views of the Pikes. The tarn sits in a hollow on the centre of the ridge, issuing westwards through a break in the parapet via the ravine of Angletarn Beck. The ridge proper runs to the east of the tarn above the Bannerdale face, rising again to the unnamed 1,870 ft top above Satura Crag. This overtops the summit of Brock Crags, but was made subservient to it by Wainwright in his ""Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells""."
"Angletarn Pikes takes its plural from the two rocky towers at the summit, separated by perhaps 200 yards of peaty bog. The northern top is the true summit, the other being some six feet lower. The southern top is compensated by a clear view of Angle Tarn, described by Wainwright as ""among the best of Lakeland tarns"". The wider view stretches from the Helvellyn range to the spine of the Far Eastern Fells across Martindale."
"The fell can be climbed via Boredale Hause, making Patterdale, Bridgend, Hartsop and Boredale Head all possible starting points. An alternative is to climb from Martindale Old Church, ascending via the Beda Fell ridge or Angle Tarn. The route from Patterdale is often undertaken as the first section of the ascent of High Street."

"They are small fish, up to in total length. Uniquely among killifish, ""Campellolebias"" and the closely related ""Cynopoecilus"" have internal fertilization. A part of the males' anal fin forms a ""pseudo-gonopodium"" that is used for inseminating the female."
There are currently four recognized species in this genus:
"The generic name ""Campellolebias"" is a combination of Campello, which honours the Brazilian chemical engineer, aquarist and amateur ichthyologist Gilberto Campello Brasil (1945-2008) and ""lebias"" a Greek word for a small fish which was applied to Killifish by Georges Cuvier and is now used a root for names within the order Cyprinodontiformes.

"Sol Goldman (born Usher Selig Goldman, September 2, 1917 – October 18, 1987) was an American real estate developer. Together with his partner, Alex DiLorenzo, Goldman became the biggest non-institutional real estate investor in New York City in the 1980s, ultimately owning a portfolio of nearly 1900 commercial and residential properties."
"Goldman was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of Fannie and Charles Goldman. His father owned a grocery store. Goldman briefly attended Brooklyn College, before turning to real estate during the Great Depression. At age 16, he purchased his first of many foreclosed properties by raising money from his neighbors. In the 1950s, he partnered with Alex DiLorenzo Jr. Together they were very active purchasers through the 1950s and 1960s and their portfolio included the Chrysler Building which they bought in 1960. Although the 1970s were difficult—he lost the Chrysler Building to foreclosure and his partner, DiLorenzo, died in 1975—Goldman continued to invest, purchasing more than 600 buildings in the subsequent years via his company Solil Management (named after Sol and his wife, Lil). Goldman was known for holding onto his properties and rarely selling, preferring instead to sign tenants to long-term ground leases (typically 99 years) where the tenants pay an annual rent to Goldman but are responsible for taxes and upkeep of buildings on the properties."
"The Sol Goldman Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at Johns Hopkins University is named in his honor, following a gift of $10 million."
"In 1941, he married Lillian Schuman, who was also Jewish. They had four children: Allan H. Goldman, Diane Goldman Kemper, Amy P. Goldman, and Jane Goldman. Upon his death at the age of 70 in 1987, he owned New York's largest private real estate portfolio with more than 600 properties valued at $1 billion. His wife and three daughters engaged in litigation over his assets with his wife eventually receiving 1/3rd of his estate.

"Bunge Church () is a medieval church in Bunge on the Swedish island of Gotland. The church seen today was largely built during the 14th century and is in a High Gothic style typical for churches on Gotland. Inside, the church is richly decorated with medieval frescos, including depictions of medieval knights whose significance remain contested. Bunge Church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby (Sweden)."
"Archaeological excavations carried out in 1916 and 1971 have shown that the present, mainly Gothic church was pre-dated by a Romanesque church, dating from the 12th century. The massive, fortress-like tower of the church is somewhat later but belonged to this first edifice. The nave and choir were built in the 14th century in a form of High Gothic typical for Gotland: the nave is high and spacious, divided into two by slender columns; the choir lacks an apse; and the east end of the church instead finishes in a straight wall adorned with three slender windows."
"The church and churchyard are surrounded by a wall which originally reached much higher and had a defensive purpose. Four medieval gates still survive in the wall. The church complex evidently has fulfilled a defensive role, as there are marks from pikes and crossbow bolts in the sturdy tower-door, still preserved in its original place. In addition, the inside of the church is profusely decorated with frescos depicting, among other things, fighting knights. The frescos and the church wall may date from the short period in history when Gotland belonged to the Teutonic Order. This has led some scholars to speculate whether the church for a time might have been owned by the crusading Order, and turned into an ""Ordensburg"" (albeit on a small scale)."
The church today belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies within the Diocese of Visby.
"The church is one of the largest on northern Gotland. As mentioned, it displays a mix between Romanesque (the tower) and Gothic (the nave and choir). The church has a southern portal, rich in sculpture, and a northern portal with Romanesque details, possibly partially incorporated from the earlier church building."
"The most distinguishing feature of the interior is no doubt the richly painted walls, with frescos executed by a master painter probably from Prussia or Bohemia. These are from the late 14th century or early 15th and depict different Christian themes, like the Last Judgement, the crucifixion, a few of the apostles but also the Mass of Saint Gregory and legends of saints. As for the previously mentioned depicted knights, scholars have different views of what they may depict or represent. One theory is that they are Teutonic knights. Another claims that they represent a depiction of the Battle of Visby, while others believe they are, in line with the other paintings, representing the Christian theme of the martyrdom of the Theban Legion. A single remaining painted glass window remains, a baptismal font from the 13th century and an oddity: a mite box in stone, which is signed by the stonemason in runes, ""Lafrans made this stone""."

"Joseph H. ""Cyclone"" Miller (September 24, 1859 – October 13, 1916) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball born in Springfield, Massachusetts. He played just two seasons in the majors, but did play with four teams in three leagues. He stood at 5'9""."
"Miller's major league career began in 1884 for the Chicago Browns/Pittsburgh Stogies of the Union Association. He lasted just one start, in which he threw a complete game victory, allowing only two runs. He then moved on to the Providence Grays, filling in the rotation due to injuries to their top pitchers, Charles Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney. Even though he did pitch well for long stretches during the games, he struggled to secure the victories in the late innings and had to be replaced. On July 31, 1884, in a road game versus the New York Gothams, he was appointed umpire due to the scheduled umpire calling in sick. The New York fans thought his calls were decidedly one-sided toward his Grays team, and he had to have a police escort off the field after the game. The game ended in a 3-3 tie."
"On one occasion, with Miller playing right field, the manager had wanted Sweeney to switch from pitcher to right field to bring in Miller to pitch in the 9th inning. Sweeney refused the move and walked off the field, and because of the rules during that time, Miller had to pitch the game with only two outfielders. He went on to lose the game, and Sweeney was suspended for a game to violating the manager's order. Instead of serving the suspension, Sweeney quit the team and joined the St. Louis Maroons of Union Association, leaving Radbourn to shoulder the team's pitching duties for the rest of the season. It was that season that Radbourn set his all-time record for wins with 60, which under today's rules would have only been 59 because in one game, he relieved Miller with Providence having the lead after five innings. On September 13, when the team departing on a lengthy road trip, they decided not to bring Miller along with them, thus ending his short tenure with the team. He compiled a 3–2 record with them in five starts and one relief appearance that resulted in a late-inning loss."
"He is also on record as having pitched one game for the Philadelphia Quakers during the 1884 season. In that game, he pitched a complete game loss, giving up 19 runs, 10 of them earned."
"Miller spent 1885 in the minor leagues. He started 1886 with Macon of the Southern Association but finished it with the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association. He went 10-8 that season, completing all of his starts and throwing one shutout. On August 20, he threw a one-hitter, giving up his one hit in the ninth inning and losing 1-0 to the Baltimore Orioles, and their young fireballer Matt Kilroy. During this season, he played one game at third base, becoming one of only 36 left-handed players to have played at least one game at that position."
"Miller died at the age of 57 in New London, Connecticut, and was interred at Comstock Cemetery in Montville, Connecticut."

"The Easter Island butterflyfish or white-tip butterflyfish (""Chaetodon litus"") is a species of subtropical fish in the family Chaetodontidae. It is endemic to the seas round Easter Island, off the coast of mainland Chile."
"Butterflyfish have deep, laterally flattened bodies, a slightly upturned snout, uninterrupted dorsal fins and unforked, broadly wedge-shaped tail fins with flat ends. ""Chaetodon litus"" has a rectangular outline and is silvery-grey with white-edged scales. The maximum length is long. The dorsal fin has 13 spines and 23 to 25 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 19 or 20 soft rays."
"The seaman were classed as either Able Seaman, Ordinary Seaman, or Landsman. An Able Seaman was an expert all rounder, happy aloft in the rigging or taking the helm and all other aspects of shipboard life. An Ordinary Seaman was one who had a grasp of basic seamanship and could be useful aboard ship but was not yet an expert or skillful sailor. A Landsman was a man with very little or no prior sea experience at all, most commonly a product of the press gang."

He is currently the founder of Light Chaser Animation Studios, an animation studio based in Beijing. Wang is also a novelist, screenwriter, and playwright. He holds a Computer Science degree from the Johns Hopkins University, and an MBA from INSEAD. He received his bachelor's degree in international business from the College of Staten Island, CUNY, in 1995."
"Wang's first full-time job out of college was as a salesman of apparel snap fasteners, although he ""wore an ill-fitting $90 suit and didn't know how to pronounce Christian Dior."" He later moved on to a position at Hughes Electronics, where he worked from 1997 to 2001 through roles in engineering and last held the role of business development manager. After obtaining his MBA at INSEAD in 2002, Wang served as the corporate development director of Bertelsmann Group, an international media company, and also served as the managing director of Bertelsmann Online China, a company operating the e-commerce businesses of Bertelsmann Group in China, from 2003 to 2005."
"Wang founded Tudou in January 2005 (a few months before YouTube), citing the tightly regulated nature of television content in China and his hope to ""bridge the huge gap between those people who have creative ideas and talent, but cannot get their work to the audience"" as his primary reasons."
"Wang formally launched Tudou online on April 15, 2005, and the website soon took off. Tudou started as a website hosting user-generated content (UGC), but soon expanded to include UGC, premium licensed content and content developed in-house, commonly described as a combination of the YouTube, Hulu, and HBO business models. The number of monthly unique visitors to Tudou increased from approximately 50 million in December 2007 to approximately 182 million in December 2010, and to approximately 200 million in May 2011. The number of registered users increased from approximately 35.6 million in December 31, 2008 to approximately 78.2 million as of December 31, 2010 and further to approximately 90.1 million as of June 30, 2011."
"Wang took Tudou public on NASDAQ in August 2011. On March 12, 2012, Tudou and competitor Youku.com announced a merger to form Youku Tudou Inc., with Tudou valued at US$1.2 billion. Since the merger was formally completed in August 2012, Wang has retired from the new company's daily operations."
"In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on March 12, 2013, Wang announced his new project, Light Chaser Animation Studios, to produce animated feature films targeting the rapidly growing Chinese movie market, which grew by 30% in 2012 and is widely expected to overtake the U.S. market in size by 2020. He cited the lack of quality domestically produced animation content, a rapidly growing domestic market, and improving environment for movie distribution, promotion and copyrights in China as the main reasons behind his decision."
"Light Chaser Animation Studios is based in Beijing, China."
"Wang is also a novelist and playwright for stage and ballet. At 24, Wang wrote the novel ""Waiting for Summer"", loosely based on his early experiences studying and living in the United States. Wang published the novel in 2006, first serially in the acclaimed Chinese literary magazine ""Harvest"", and then as an independent work a year later. In 2011, Wang wrote ""The Residential Compound"", a stage play about urban development and relocation in Beijing. In the same year, Wang wrote the libretto for the San Francisco Ballet's critically acclaimed ""RAkU"", a story about a ""triangle of obsession"" taking place in the Tokugawa Era."

"Frederick Tansley Munnings (1875, Lowestoft – 1953) was a 20th-century British spiritualist medium and former burglar. He was exposed as a fraud."
"Munnings lived in Hastings and worked as a boarding-house keeper. He was convicted of burglary for housebreaking at Woking and was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment. Munnings claimed to be a ""direct voice"" medium, but was exposed as a fraud when one of his séance sitters turned the lights on, revealing him to be holding a trumpet by means of a telescopic extension piece and using an angle piece to change the auditory effect of his voice."
"In February 1926 a public warning against Munnings was issued in the press by Arthur Conan Doyle, Abraham Wallace, R. H. Saunders, and H. D. Bradley. The psychical researcher Harry Price also exposed his fraudulent mediumship. Munnings claimed to produce the independent ""spirit"" voices of Julius Caesar, Dan Leno, Hawley Harvey Crippen and King Henry VIII. Price invented and used a piece of apparatus known as a voice control recorder and proved that all the voices were those of Munnings. Munnings admitted fraud and sold his confessions to a Sunday newspaper."

= = = Powell-Cotton Ethnographic Films = = =
"The Powell-Cotton ethnographic films is a collection of over 70 ethnographic, documentary and wildlife films made by the Powell-Cotton family between 1922 and 1973. The films relate exclusively to the family's expeditions in Africa during this time. The original films are held in the British Film Institute archives, and the Powell-Cotton Museum own copies contemporaneous with the originals."
"Between 1887 and 1939 Major Percy H G Powell-Cotton undertook a total of 28 expeditions to Africa and Asia. Alongside the extensive collection of game and animal specimens he bought back, Major Powell-Cotton also shot several reels of 16mm film footage whilst out in the bush."
"His films mainly depict African game and wildlife, as well as market scenes, craft making and tribal ceremonies from the African rural communities. One particular film, ""Gorilla Drive, Cameroons"", is believed to be the only one of its subject from this date in existence. It shows the mustering of the animals by the local people, their herding and despatch by the natives with spears."
"Powell-Cotton made 17 films in total, either independently or together with his daughter Diana or wife Hannah. All the films are 16mm black and white silent films, made in a non-narrative documentary style. The major also shot all his films using a handheld, windup Bell & Howell Filmo 70 camera, which is currently on display in the Powell-Cotton museum. The first recorded use of colour film was in 1950’s in the film ""South Africa: Victoria Falls & Livingstone Game Park"" made by Christopher and Diana Powell-Cotton."
"Most of the films in the collection were made for private viewing only and for the purposes recording keeping from the expeditions. However, Major Powell-Cotton did present several of his films to the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1932, including ""Crafts in the Cameroons"" (1931) and ""Osonigbe Juju House and Benin Brass Cutting"" (1931)."
"The most notable films of the collection are those by Major Powell-Cotton’s daughters, Diana and Antoinette Powell-Cotton from their expeditions to Angola in 1936 and 1937."
"The result of their trips was just under three hours of edited black-and-white 16mm film, accompanied by nearly 3,000 objects and 2,000 photographs. The films portray local ceremonies, craft-working and family life in rural Africa. Together they provide a unique record of the region at a crucial time in its history, before the full impact of the massive cultural changes brought about by missionization and colonial rule."
"Diana and Antoinette filmed their entire footage on a single, small windup Kodak cine camera which is currently on display in the Powell-Cotton museum. The sisters were not able to review or edit any footage on location, and so were constantly anxious they had not captured the events and activities in Angola successfully. They only edited their footage on their return, and would give private viewings accompanied by music and live narration to family members in their screen room which is now Gallery 4 in the Powell-Cotton museum."

"After John Lennon's murder in December 1980, Starr returned home to England to live at Tittenhurst Park, which Starr had purchased from Lennon in 1973. In early 1982, Starr was eager to move on to his next solo project. Deciding that he needed more consistency this time around, he would work with only one producer, Joe Walsh, a former member of the recently disbanded Eagles. Walsh and Starr had known each other since the mid-1970s, having met and befriended each other in Los Angeles. Walsh immediately agreed to work with Starr and they met at Tittenhurst in February to begin writing material. Recording shortly afterwards begun and instrumental backing tracks for seven songs were recorded at Startling Studios, after Starr had previously converted Lennon's recording studio. Engineering duties were handled by Jim Nipor. These sessions were mainly done with a team consisting of Starr on drums and percussion, Walsh on guitar and backing vocals, Mo Foster on bass and keyboardists Gary Brooker and Chris Stainton."
"Sessions came to a halt when Walsh and Nipor went to California on 19 March. Sessions recommenced on 6 April for a few days until 16 April. On 15 April, ""Rolling Stone"" broke the news that Starr was ""in London working on a new album with Joe Walsh acting as the producer."" Lead vocals were laid down from 19 to 23 April. Sometime in May, Starr requested permission to build a new building on his Tittenhurst Park land, which he would use for video and recording purposes, from Windsor and Maidenhead District Council. Sessions resumed from 31 May until 10 June; the next day, taking the masters recorded up to that point with him, Starr and his wife Barbara Bach fly from London to Los Angeles, and return on 14 June. The album was finished with a third batch of sessions from 24 June into early July."
"""Everybody's in a Hurry But Me"" came about from a jam session between the Who's former bassist, John Entwistle, drummer and percussionist Ray Cooper and also Cream's former guitarist, Eric Clapton. ""As Far as We Can Go"", was originally recorded at Sweet Silence Studios, in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 23 July 1978. From that original rendition, only the vocal was used. Walsh re-recorded an entirely new track utilizing one of the latest technology synthesizers."
"The album was originally titled ""It Beats Sleep"". The portrait on the album cover was shot in a booth in northern England. As Starr's RCA contract had been cancelled, he needed to find a new label for ""Old Wave"". Though it was just over a decade after the Beatles' dissolution, no major UK or US record company was interested in signing him. Starr would not accept that and was determined to have ""Old Wave"" released any way he could. The album was due to be released on the Boardwalk label, but never appeared due to the death of the label's head, Neil Bogart. RCA Canada ended up distributing the album in June 1983 in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Brazil; while in Germany, the album and lone single pulled from it, both released on 16 June, appeared on the Bellaphon label. The Canadian release of the album occurred on 24 June. However, ""Old Wave"" failed to achieve success in any of these territories, and would be Starr's last studio album until 1992's ""Time Takes Time"". Two singles were pulled from the album: one in Germany, ""In My Car"", backed with ""As Far as We Can Go"", and the other in Mexico (""I Keep Forgettin'"" b/w ""She's About a Mover"")."
"Walsh's 1987 album ""Got Any Gum?"" included a cover of ""In My Car"", which was released as a single and became a moderate hit. Four tracks from the album appear on Starr's US compilation """" in 1989. The album was reissued on CD, on the same day as ""Stop and Smell the Roses"" (1981), in the US by The Right Stuff on 22 August 1994. A further release, on 6 September, as both CD and cassette deluxe editions, included a bonus track, the original 1978 version of ""As Far as We Can Go"". ""In My Car"" was re-released, this time on yellow vinyl, with ""She's About a Mover"" as the B-side, on The Right Stuff on 1 November 1994. A promotional CD was released in 1994 by Capitol, featuring three songs from both ""Old Wave"" and ""Stop and Smell the Roses""."

"The ""Payroll Room"" is how much money in a National Hockey League (NHL) team's salary cap is left to acquire players, whether such players are signed as free agents or join the team via a trade or waivers. The term originated in 2005 with the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which was negotiated following a season-long lockout. The new CBA includes a salary cap (formally titled the ""Upper Limit"" of the ""Payroll Range"" in the agreement). Payroll room is often called cap room in the media."
"A team can increase its cap room if it trades high-salary players to other teams and gets lower-paid players in their place. A team cannot trade its cap room to another team or defer its cap room to subsequent seasons. Other practices once common in the NHL, such as exchanging cash for players or agreeing to pay a portion of a player's remaining salary after trading him, have been explicitly forbidden in the new CBA to try to prevent wealthier teams from evading the restrictions of the cap."

= = = Lead(II) hydroxide = = =
"Lead(II) hydroxide, Pb(OH), is a hydroxide of lead, with lead in oxidation state +2. It is doubtful that such a simple compound exists. Lead basic carbonate (PbCO·2Pb(OH)) or lead(II) oxide (PbO) is encountered in practice where lead hydroxide is expected. This has been a subject of considerable confusion in the past."
"When a hydroxide is added to a solution of a lead(II) salt, a hydrated lead oxide PbO·xHO (with x < 1) is obtained. Careful hydrolysis of lead(II) acetate solution yields a crystalline product with a formula 6PbO·2HO = PbO(OH). This material is a cluster compound, consisting of an octahedron of Pb centers, each face of which is capped by an oxide or a hydroxide. The structure is reminiscent of the MoS subunit of the Chevrel phases."
"In solution, lead(II) hydroxide is a somewhat weak base, forming lead(II) ion, Pb, under weakly acidic conditions. This cation hydrolyzes and, under progressively increasing alkaline conditions, forms Pb(OH), Pb(OH)(aqueous), Pb(OH), and other species, including several polynuclear species, e.g., Pb(OH), Pb(OH), PbO(OH)."
The name Lead hydrate has sometimes been used in the past but it is unclear whether this refers to Pb(OH) or PbO·xHO.

Most of the Whites came from the city proper. A Black Brotherhood, so-called in opposition to the White, was soon formed and the two factions went to war in the streets of Toulouse. According to Puylaurens:"
"Daily the two parties would clash, banners flying, bristling with weapons, even with cavalry in evidence. Through the agency of His servant the bishop, Our Lord came to bring them, not a bad peace but a good war."
"From the White Brotherhood Folquet selected 500 men-at-arms and sent them to aid the Albigensian Crusade in besieging Lavaur. The bishop even composed pro-Crusade ""sirventes"" for the troops to sing. Count Raymond VII, however, forbade the citizens to go and tried to force Folquet from the city. The White Brotherhood did go, however, and the bishop eventually left as well, to join the siege at Lavaur."
"The White Brotherhood gained notoriety among the opponents of the Crusade. The troubadour Gavaudan wrote the song ""A la plus longa nuech de l'an"" in which he criticises the ""foolish white people"", almost certainly a reference to the Whites of Toulouse."

"= = = An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman = = ="
"""An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman"" is the opening line of a category of joke popular in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The nationalities involved may vary, though they are usually restricted to those within Ireland and the UK, and the number of people involved is usually three or sometimes four. In Ireland, the characters are sometimes called ""Paddy Irishman, Paddy Englishman, and Paddy Scotsman"". Depending on who is telling the joke, one nationality fares well and the other nationalities fare poorly according to national stereotypes. For example, in England the punchline is usually based around the Irishman being stupid, the Scotsman being mean or miserly, and the Englishman being posh (or a snob but ultimately not the butt of the joke), whereas in Scotland and Ireland, the Englishman will typically be the butt of the joke. Sometimes, when the joke requires four people, a Welshman is brought in."
"The joke typically starts with the home or favoured nationality and ends with the nationality and associated stereotype against which the joke is made. For example, in England, the joke begins ""An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman..."" whereas in Ireland it begins ""Paddy Irishman, Paddy Englishman, and Paddy Scotsman""."
"The joke typically places the three characters in a scenario. How each person in the joke reacts to the scenario is then explained in order by person, the final reaction being the punch line, playing up to the stereotype of that nationality. The joke uses the rule of three, the first two characters being used to set up an expectation which is then subverted in some way by the third."
"The ""three nationalities"" joke format is also very common in other countries. In these cases, the two foreigners are almost always portrayed as cocky, stupid, or naïve, while the home national is smart, practical, or in any case ultimately victorious."
"The joke need not necessarily involve nationalities. Jokes about the hard sciences may begin ""A mathematician, a physicist and an engineer..."""

"Waqar Hasan attended Government College, Lahore, where he played for the cricket team. He toured England with the Pakistan Eaglets team of young cricketers in 1951."
"An ""attractive stroke-making right-handed batsman, who was ideal in a crisis"", he played in Pakistan's first 18 Tests, including its first five victories. In Pakistan's first Test series, against India in 1952–53, he was the highest scorer on either side, with 357 runs at an average of 44.62, playing several defiant innings when Pakistan were in trouble. He was less successful on the 1954 tour of England, with 103 runs at 14.71, but impressed with his fielding in the covers."
"He scored his only Test century against New Zealand in 1955–56 at Lahore, when he made 189 in 430 minutes, adding 309 for the seventh wicket with Imtiaz Ahmed after the score had been 111 for 6. His 189 set a new record for Pakistan's highest Test score which lasted only until Ahmed (who made 209) overtook it the next day. Hasan played five more Tests without reaching 50."
"He played first-class cricket in Pakistan from 1949 to 1966, with a highest score of 201 not out for L. W. Cannon's XI against Hasan Mahmood's XI in 1953–54. He captained Karachi Blues to victory in the final of the 1963–64 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and in his last first-class match he captained them to victory in the 1964–65 competition."
He served as a national selector several times from the 1960s to the 1980s. He was the chief selector when Pakistan beat India 3–0 at home in 1982-83.
"He married Jamila Razaaq, the daughter of actress Sultana Razaaq, one of the earliest film actresses from India. Jamila is also the granddaughter of India’s first female film director, Fatima Begum, and the niece of Zubeida (the leading actress of India's first talkie film, ""Alam Ara""), who was the younger sister of her mother Sultana."
"In 1954 Waqar moved from Lahore to work for the Pakistan Public Works Department in Karachi as a cinema inspector. In the early 1960s he went into business. He became Corporate Director of National Foods Limited, one of Pakistan's largest food companies. In 2002, with the assistance of the cricket journalist Qamar Ahmed, he wrote ""For Cricket and Country: An Autobiography""."

"""Spartan Assault"" received mixed to positive reviews upon release; the game has a weighted aggregate rating of 70/100 on Metacritic, based on 17 reviews. Critics including Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer and Chris Carter of Destructoid wrote that while ""Spartan Assault"" was not going to be a Windows 8 killer app, it was a worthwhile purchase for gamers on the Windows 8 platform."
"Reviewers praised the game for its authentic ""Halo"" look and feel. ""Game Informer""s Kyle Hillard called ""Spartan Assault"" ""a true ""Halo"" game, even if the series’ signature scope and size are scaled down"", with the game featuring familiar ""Halo"" moments, enemies, and sounds."
"The microtransaction features of ""Spartan Assault"" were generally negatively received. While reviewers such as Destructoid's Carter felt that the microtransactions could be ignored and did not impact enjoyment of the game, Hillard wrote that ""it’s hard not to feel as though an important part of the game is being withheld after buying into the agreed-upon price of admission."""
"""GameZone"" Jake Valentine gave the Xbox One version a 5/10, stating "" Halo: Spartan Assault is a soulless, boring, chore of a game. The small glimpses of fun arcade like gameplay are drowned away by frustration and money grabbing."""

The Brandywine Valley Railroad is a class III railroad operating in Pennsylvania.
"It was established in 1981 by the Lukens Steel Company to operate trackage at Coatesville, Pennsylvania and the neighboring town of Modena. It was acquired, with the rest of the Lukens properties, by Bethlehem Steel Corporation in 1998."
"The Brandywine Valley's main line was originally built by the Wilmington and Northern Railroad, largely following the Brandywine Creek, to connect Reading with Wilmington, Delaware. By the time of the Brandywine Valley's formation, the line had been abandoned north of Valley Station, just north of Coatesville. BVRY took over the line from this point, the site of an interchange with Amtrak's Keystone Corridor, south to Modena, below which the ex-W&N was owned by PennDOT and operated by a number of shortlines over the years."
"Under Bethlehem operation, BVRY took over operation of the Delaware Valley Railroad, then operating the remainder of the ex-Wilmington and Northern, in early 1999. This gave the railroad interchange access not only to Conrail at Coatesville (subsequently replaced by the Norfolk Southern Railway), but to CSX Transportation at the southern end of the line at Elsmere, Delaware. It also thus began to operate a connecting branch of the former Pennsylvania Railroad from Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, on the W&N, to Nottingham."
"After the acquisition of Bethlehem Steel's assets by International Steel Group in 2003, Brandywine Valley began to scale back its operations. The ex-PRR line, also known as the Octoraro line, was taken over in that year by the Morristown and Erie Railroad. In 2005, the ex-W&N line south of Modena was turned over to the East Penn Railroad, reducing the Brandywine Valley to its original extent."
"With the merger of ISG in 2005, the railroad and steel plant were taken over by Mittal Steel Company, which became ArcelorMittal in 2006."
"= = = Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, 9th Duke of Portland = = ="
"Victor Frederick William Cavendish-Bentinck, 9th Duke of Portland, (18 June 1897 – 30 July 1990), known as Victor Cavendish-Bentinck until 1980, was a British diplomat, businessman, and peer. He served as Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee during the Second World War and was British Ambassador to Poland between 1945 and 1947."
"Cavendish-Bentinck was born in Marylebone, London on 18 June 1897. He was the second son of Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck, whose father, George Cavendish-Bentinck, was a grandson of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. Although formally Victor Cavendish-Bentinck he was known informally as Bill. Like other members of his family he informally dispensed with the name ""Cavendish"", being known simply as Bill Bentinck. He was educated at Wellington College."
"Queen Elizabeth II is also descended from the 3rd Duke of Portland through her maternal grandmother Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck. The Queen and the 9th Duke of Portland were third cousins, once removed."
"Cavendish-Bentinck did not pursue a university education, instead entering the diplomatic service in 1915 at the age of 18 before taking leave to fight with the Grenadier Guards in the First World War, returning to the Foreign Office in 1919. In 1922, he took charge of administrative arrangements for the Lausanne Conference. He served in the British Embassy in Paris and also in the League of Nations Department in the Foreign Office. Other postings included Athens in 1932 and Santiago in 1933. The high point of his diplomatic career came in 1939 when he was appointed chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. He managed to develop the body as a highly effective instrument of government and, as a result, became counsellor to the Services Liaison Department of the Foreign Office in 1942."
"However, he cast doubt on reports that were received regarding the Nazi genocide of the Jews. In late August 1943 the Polish Embassy in London informed the British government of the deportation and annihilation of hundreds of thousands of Jews from Lublin and Bialystok provinces. The chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, deplored Polish and Jewish information about atrocities. He wrote this information as an attempt to ‘stoke us up’ He added: ‘I feel certain that we are making a mistake in giving credence to this gas chamber story.’ This error of judgement makes his subsequent appointment as ambassador to Poland the more surprising."
"In 1945, Cavendish-Bentinck was given his final diplomatic posting on his appointment as Ambassador to Poland. When visiting the formerly German City of Stettin (Szczecin) in 1946 he was invited to talk to German civilians suffering from months of internment so their possessions and property could be taken over by Polish resettlers from territories lost to the USSR. Cavendish-Bentinck refused to do so, ignoring certain inhuman circumstances under which mainly old people, women and children had to suffer, by noting to his Polish hosts, he was ""convinced that they will complain as usual""."
"He held the position for two years before the Foreign Office applied to appoint him Ambassador to Brazil. He never took up the latter post, being obliged to resign from the Foreign Office, without a pension, as a result of the publicity surrounding his divorce. Bentinck's aristocratic background attracted press attention; Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, apparently sympathetic, remarked at that the time ""I could have saved him if his name had been Smith."""
"After his withdrawal from the diplomatic service, Cavendish-Bentinck embarked on a business career, becoming Vice-Chairman of the Committee of Industrial Interests in Germany. From this position, he was able to advance the interests of British companies such as Unilever. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group."
"In 1980 he succeeded his elder brother Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck as the 9th Duke of Portland. Upon his own death in 1990, the dukedom and the Marquessate of Titchfield became extinct because his only son had predeceased him and there were no other surviving male heirs of the 1st Duke. However, the earldom of Portland had been created in an earlier generation than the dukedom and there were surviving descendants in the male line to inherit it. That title was therefore inherited by his kinsman, Henry Noel Bentinck, who became 11th Earl of Portland, together with its subsidiary titles of Viscount Woodstock and Baron Cirencester. He was interred at the traditional burial place of the Dukes of Portland in the churchyard of St Winifred's Church at Holbeck."
"Bentick married Clothilde Bruce Quigley (died 1984), an American, on 16 February 1924. She was the daughter of James Bruce Quigley. They had two children together:"
Soon after World War II began Bentinck received a telephone call at his office from his Hungarian maid to tell him that his wife had left him and taken their children with her. They were finally divorced in 1948.
"Portland married secondly, Kathleen Elsie Barry (died 2004) on 27 July 1948. She was the daughter of Arthur Barry. This marriage produced one child:"

A controversial aspect of this was the withdrawal of Muslim children, especially Muslim girls from integrated schools as secular single-sex schooling died out in England. Less controversial were efforts to encourage religious education in Britain to expand beyond the teaching of Islam. The Trust also began supporting efforts to open private Islamic schools in 1974, and by 1992, 23 Islamic schools were open, all supported by the Trust. Important leaders in this movement were Ibrahim Hewitt Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens), Afzal Rahman, and Gulam Sarwar. In 1991, Sarwar wrote a book, ""British Muslims and Schools"", which focuses on why such schools should exist and why they should receive public funding like other British schools."
"Human Rights Activist Nuzhat Abbas has criticized MET for supplying literature on sexual education that echos the anti-LGBT views of clerics like Sheikh Sarkawy, formerly of London Central Mosque.

"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 (), also commonly referred to as ""the farm bill,"" is one of two United States ""farm bills"" that were introduced in the 113th United States Congress. The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 is the bill that was introduced into the United States Senate. A second bill, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 () was introduced into the United States House of Representatives. The two bills cover similar topics and programs, but have significantly different provisions. The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 passed the Senate on June 10, 2013 and has received the support of the President."
"However, the Senate bill failed to pass in the House, so the two chambers organized a conference committee. The result is the Agriculture Act of 2014 (H.R. 2642; 113th Congress), which passed the House on January 29, 2014. The Agriculture Act of 2014 includes provisions from both the House and the Senate bills."
"One of the major provisions of the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 is a $4 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a controversial provision, with some Democrats arguing that the cuts were too large, while some Republicans arguing that the cuts did not do enough to cut the deficit."
"A ""farm bill"" is one of the primary tools of the United States federal government to set policy related to agriculture in the United States. Farm bills are passed roughly every five years. The farm bills typically cover laws and policies related to supplemental nutrition, land payments, crop insurance, environmental practices, some international trade, and research."
"A similar bill to the proposed Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 was also passed by the Senate in the 112th United States Congress, but never received much attention in the House and failed to become law. The current ""farm bill"" expires on September 30, 2013."
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 would cut spending $24 billion over 10 years. Overall, however, it would still cost nearly $955 billion over 10 years."
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 would reduce spending on food stamps by $4 billion over 10 years."
"""This summary is based largely on the report on S. 954, as it was reported by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry on May 14, 2013, written by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source."""
"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that direct spending stemming from the program authorization in S. 954 would total $955 billion over the 2014-2023 period. That 10-year total reflects the bill’s authorization of expiring programs through 2018 and an extension of those authorizations through 2023, consistent with the rules governing baseline projections that are specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
"Relative to spending projected under CBO’s May 2013 baseline, the CBO estimates that enacting the bill would reduce direct spending by $17.8 billion over the 2014-2023 period. ""The estimated budgetary effects of S. 954 are summarized in Table 1."" CBO estimates that section 10012 of the bill would increase revenues by $54 million over the 2014-2023 period. ""Further details of the changes in direct spending and revenues are displayed in Table 2."""
"Assuming appropriation of the specified and necessary amounts, the CBO also estimates that implementing the bill would cost $30.1 billion over the 2014-2018 period and $39.9 billion over the 2014-2023 period. ""Further details of that estimate are displayed in Table 3."""
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). In general, state, local, and tribal governments would benefit from the continuation of existing agricultural assistance and the creation of new grant programs."
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 would impose private-sector mandates, as defined in UMRA, by expanding reporting requirements on manufacturers of dairy products and establishing regulations for dairy handlers that purchase milk from dairy producers participating in the Dairy Market Stabilization Program. Additionally, the bill would prohibit individuals from attending animal fighting ventures in states and U.S. territories that permit such ventures. Because the compliance cost for dairy handlers would depend on future regulations, the CBO has no basis to determine whether the aggregate cost of the mandates in the bill would exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($150 million in 2013, adjusted annually for inflation)."
"The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. Enacting S. 954 would affect direct spending and revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. ""The net change in outlays and revenues that are subject to those pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in Table 4."""
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 was introduced into the Senate on May 14, 2013 by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI). The bill was considered on the Senate floor on May 21–23, and June 3–4, June 6, and June 10, 2013. On June 10, 2013, the bill passed in the Senate in Recorded Vote 145: 66-27. Only two Democrats voted against their party: Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Senator Jack Reed (D-RI). Eighteen Republicans voted in favor of the bill."
"As of June 24, 2013, the United States House of Representatives had not considered the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 or added it to a calendar. On June 20, 2013, Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) urged the House to take up consideration of the bill, speaking from the Senate floor. The Senator argued that because the Senate bill had received the support of many Republicans and cut spending, the House should have no objections to passing it as well. The bill was not put on the Majority Leader's calendar for the week of June 24."

"WPXT, virtual channel 51 (UHF digital channel 43), is a CW-affiliated television station licensed to Portland, Maine, United States, serving southern Maine and eastern and northern New Hampshire. The station is owned by the Hearst Television subsidiary of Hearst Communications, as part of a duopoly with Poland Spring-licensed ABC affiliate WMTW (channel 8). The two stations share studios on Ledgeview Drive in Westbrook; WPXT's transmitter is located in South Gray along I-95/Maine Turnpike/Gold Star Memorial Highway. There is no separate website for WPXT; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station WMTW."
"The station signed-on September 14, 1986 as Maine's first independent station and the first new commercial station to launch in the Portland market in 32 years. After a few weeks as an independent, it became a charter affiliate with Fox on October 6. In 1996, the station's original owner, Bride Communications, entered bankruptcy and WPXT was sold to Pegasus Broadcasting."
"In October 2001, WPXT switched to The WB due to a monetary dispute between Pegasus and Fox; The WB had previously aired in off-hours on sister UPN affiliate WPME (channel 35). This left Maine with no over-the-air Fox affiliate until April 2003, when Portland's Pax TV affiliate WMPX-TV (now WPFO) switched to the network and WFVX-LD signed on as the first over-the-air Fox affiliate for the Bangor area. In the interim, Fox's primetime and children's programming was only available on cable via WFXT (which was owned by the network at the time) for those living on the New Hampshire side of the market and via Foxnet for those living in Maine; WCKD-LP (which was initially expected to serve as the network's replacement affiliate) carried the network's sports programming during that time. Pegasus declared bankruptcy in June 2004 over a dispute with DirecTV (co-owned with Fox by News Corporation) over marketing of the direct broadcast satellite service in rural areas. The Pegasus station group was sold in August 2006 to private investment firm CP Media, LLC of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania for $55.5 million. Eventually, CP Media formed a new broadcast company, New Age Media."
"As a WB affiliate, WPXT was originally branded on-air as ""Maine's WB 51"", but in 2004, changed to ""Maine's WB"" to reflect its status as the only over-the-air WB affiliate in the state. Although Bangor and Presque Isle also had affiliates, they were only provided on cable through The WB 100+ (a similar operation to Foxnet)."
"On January 24, 2006, Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that they would merge the broadcast operations of The WB and UPN to form The CW Television Network. On March 9, it was announced WPXT would become Portland's CW affiliate. Later on May 1, it was made public sister station WPME would affiliate with MyNetworkTV. With the new affiliation, WPXT's branding became ""The CW Portland"". In 2007, WPXT changed its on-air branding to reflect its call letters rather than a city."
"WPXT ceased analog transmission August 12, 2008 (more than seven months prior to the original Federal Communications Commission (FCC) digital switchover deadline February 17, 2009) due to transmitter failure. On May 2, 2011, WPXT signed-on a new second digital subchannel to become the area's MeTV affiliate. On November 7, 2016, Escape (now Court TV Mystery) was added to subchannel 51.3."
"New Age Media announced in March 2012 that it would sell WPXT to Tyche Broadcasting for $75,000. The deal was contingent on WPME's concurrent sale from MPS Media to Triumph Broadcasting. On November 9, 2012, WPXT filed a non-consummation notice to the FCC, meaning the transaction is nulled and void. On February 13, 2013, New Age Media filed to sell WPXT to Ironwood Communications for $1,525,000; the deal was concurrent with a planned sale of WPME to Cottonwood Communications. The FCC granted its approval of the sale on April 2. The sale was consummated on May 20."
"On March 22, 2018, MyNetworkTV, Escape and Laff programming was moved to WPXT's respective third, fourth and fifth subchannels; the three networks had been carried by WPME, which was concurrently sold to Ion Media Networks to become WIPL, an Ion Television owned-and-operated station. Hearst Television announced its acquisition of WPXT on July 30, 2018; the $3,350,000 purchase created a duopoly with ABC affiliate WMTW (channel 8). The sale was approved on September 12 and was completed on September 21, 2018; concurrently, WPXT changed its branding to ""Maine's CW."""
"The ownership change also resulted in a streamlining of subchannels between WMTW and WPXT the next month. With Hearst's preference for its main station in the market to carry the MeTV affiliation, MeTV and H&I exchanged places, with MeTV moving to WMTW-DT2 and H&I going to WPXT-DT2, and Laff going from WPXT-DT2 to WMTW-DT3, with Escape going to WPXT-DT3 (and the likely non-renewal of the Katz Broadcasting network agreement; Hearst only tends to carry Bounce TV from that provider). The syndicated programming formerly on WPXT-DT3's ""WPME"" service was removed, and MyNetworkTV programming now airs in place of H&I's primetime, or sometimes during the late night hours on WPXT-DT2, an arrangement similar to the setup for the third subchannel of sister station KCCI in Des Moines, Iowa."
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:
"Syndicated programming on WPXT includes ""Divorce Court"", ""The People's Court"", ""How I Met Your Mother"", ""Modern Family"", ""Mom"", ""Extra"", ""TMZ on TV"", and ""Chicago P.D."", among others. Throughout its history, WPXT has also produced and aired several local programs."
"For many years, WPXT operated a news department and produced its own local newscasts. For a time, the station's nightly prime time news at 10 was simulcasted on sister station WPME. WPXT even produced a weeknight broadcast at 7 on that station at one point but the show was eventually canceled due to poor ratings and inconsistent viewership. It made national headlines a week before the 2000 Presidential election when reporter Erin Fehlau (now at ABC affiliate WMUR-TV) revealed Republican candidate George W. Bush had been convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol 24 years earlier."
"On June 15, 2002, after shuttering its own news operation, WPXT entered into a news share agreement with Maine's two NBC affiliates, WCSH and WLBZ (then both owned by the Gannett Company). This arrangement resulted in a nightly half-hour prime time show at 10 to debut on the station known as ""NewsCenter at 10 on Maine's WB 51"". On weeknights, the news and sports segments originated from WCSH's studios at Congress Square in Downtown Portland while weather forecast segments came from WLBZ's facility on Mount Hope Avenue in Bangor. Weekend broadcasts aired entirely from Portland. The WPXT newscast featured a similar format to newscasts that were simulcast on both WCSH and WLBZ (which largely serves as a semi-satellite of WCSH), with statewide news from both the Portland and Bangor markets. However, since WPXT is a Portland/Auburn market station, there was ultimately a focus on southern areas. With the affiliation switch to The CW in 2006, WPXT's news became known as ""NewsCenter at 10 on The CW Portland""."
"WPXT would not face any competition in the time slot until February 5, 2007, when current Fox affiliate WPFO entered into a similar arrangement with CBS affiliate WGME-TV. On November 6, 2008, WCSH moved the WPXT show to its second digital subchannel affiliated with NBC Weather Plus. As a result, WLBZ's production involvement in the newscast was dropped and refocused to Portland. After a six-year run, the production was eventually canceled altogether."
"On October 31, 2011, WPXT and WCSH established another news share agreement and debuted an hour-long extension of the big three outlet's weekday morning show. Known on WPXT as ""NewsCenter Morning Report Xtra"", this aired from 7 until 8 and competed with WGME's one-hour morning newscast on WPFO. This ceased in Spring 2014."
"Following WPXT's sale to Hearst Television, the station announced that a WMTW-produced prime time newscast would premiere on September 24, 2018. A WMTW-produced Saturday 7 p.m. newscast premiered on August 31, 2019 and continues through the conclusion of ABC's college football coverage which necessitates the preemption of WMTW's usual 6 p.m. newscast."

"USS ""Kaskaskia"" (AO-27) was a ""Cimarron""-class fleet replenishment oiler serving in the United States Navy, named for the Kaskaskia River in Illinois."
"""Kaskaskia"" was launched 29 September 1939 by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia; sponsored by Mrs. Joseph P. Kennedy; acquired by the Navy from Esso Oil Company, 22 October 1940; and commissioned 29 October 1940, Commander U.S. Gregory in command."
"""Kaskaskia"" cleared Boston, Mass19 November 1940 for Pearl Harbor, arriving 3 January 1941. She transported oil between West Coast ports and Pearl Harbor, making six cruises before 7 August, when she made an oil run to Johnston Island. The oiler returned to Mare Island 10 September for overhaul and repairs. In San Francisco when the Japanese made their surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, ""Kaskaskia"" immediately began preparations to join the Service Force in the Pacific."
"Sailing from San Diego 6 January 1942, ""Kaskaskia"" commenced fueling operations en route before arriving Pago Pago 20 January. For the next six months she operated out of Nom-a refueling the ships engaged in the violent struggle to stem the Japanese advance. The oiler arrived Kodiak, Alaska, 3 July with a cargo of oil and fuel to be used in the Aleutian Islands campaign. She returned to Wilmington, California, loaded oil and aviation gasoline and continued oil runs to Alaskan ports until she steamed to Nouméa late in March 1943. ""Kaskaskia"" supplied many ships, increasing the mobility of the fleet during the successful campaigns in the South Pacific."
"""Kaskaskia"" returned to San Pedro 28 July for repairs before resuming her duties at Pearl Harbor 21 September. She transported oil between California and Hawaii until she sailed 25 November to support the Gilbert Islands campaign. Returning to Pearl Harbor 10 December, the oiler resumed her cruises between San Pedro and Hawaii."
"As the Navy pushed relentlessly toward Japan, ""Kaskaskia"" departed Pearl Harbor 16 January 1944 to support operations in the Marshall Islands. After the Navy had captured the Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls, ""Kaskaskia"" supported carrier task forces during their devastating raids on Truk, the Marianas Islands, and Palau Islands in February and March."
"The oiler continued fueling operations in the Marshall Islands area until she cleared Majuro 6 June to fuel destroyers and destroyer escorts in the invasion of Saipan. Throughout June and July ""Kaskaskia"" remained on hand, assisting the fleet to take Saipee, Guam, and Tinian – important supply areas in the future campaign for the Philippines."
"As the Navy fought toward the Philippines, Admiral Nimitz decided to take the Palau Islands as a staging area for aircraft and ships during the invasion of Leyte. ""Kaskaskia"" departed Manus on 4 September with a task group bound for an assault on Peleliu. She operated in the Palau area until returning Manus 8 October. Her stay was a brief one, however, as she sailed 10 October for Leyte. Prior to the actual landings, she fueled units of the fleet, continuing this vital duty until a beachhead had been established. The oiler returned Ulithi 23 October and made another fueling run to the Philippine area early in November."
"After an overhaul at San Diego December 1944 through February 1945, ""Kaskaskia"" arrived Kwajalein 11 March to service the fleet. The oiler cleared Ulithi 30 March for the fueling area off Okinawa, the last major step before the Japanese homeland itself. Once again the oilers, the unsung heroes of the war, stood by refueling the many ships engaged in the irresistible assault from the sea on Okinawa."
"""Kaskaskia"" was relieved of fueling duties off Okinawa, only to be summoned for another important service. She departed Ulithi 3 July to refuel units of the carrier task forces, launching raids on the Japanese Islands of Honshū and Hokkaidō. When the Japanese surrendered, ""Kaskaskia"" steamed into Tokyo Bay 10 September with ships of the Occupation Forces. She continued refueling operations in Japan, China, and Formosa for an entire year before arriving San Pedro 28 September 1946."
"Between 1947 and 1950 she ferried oil and aviation gasoline from the West Coast to the Far East and naval bases in the mid-Pacific. When North Korean troops invaded South Korea, the United States accepted the challenge and ordered its forces to defend the embattled peninsula. ""Kaskaskia"" cleared San Diego 16 September to operate out of Sasebo. During October she entered the heavily mined waters off Wonsan, fueling ships blockading and bombarding that key port."
"During December she arrived off Hungnam to service ships engaged in evacuation operations in that area. Throughout the harsh winter months, ""Kaskaskia"" continued vital fueling missions between Japan and Korea. During the United Nations counteroffensive in the spring of 1951, she also stood by for fueling operations. The oiler returned to Long Beach, California, 27 August for overhaul and operations along the Pacific Coast."
"She sailed for the second Korean tour January 1952, arriving Sasebo on 22 January to refuel the ships engaged in the Korean War. In addition to services in Korea, she also supplied units in Japan, Okinawa and Formosa before returning Long Beach 31 July. Overhaul and training preceded her third Korean deployment from 27 December to July 1953. On this tour she supported ships engaged in fire support operations. Returning home 17 August, ""Kaskaskia"" underwent overhaul; she then sailed again for the Far East 4 January 1954, operated out of Sasebo and returning San Francisco 12 October. Following coastal operations, the oiler was placed out of commission, in reserve, 8 April 1955."
"""Kaskaskia"" was transferred to MSTS 8 January 1957, and operated in that capacity with a Navy crew until 21 October 1957 when she decommissioned and was turned over to the Maritime Administration 10 December. ""Kaskaskia"" was struck from the Navy List 2 January 1959."
"The Berlin Crisis of 1961 necessitated the reactivation of ships and ""Kaskaskia"" was reinstated 8 September. Following overhaul and alterations she recommissioned at Hoboken, New Jersey, 6 December, Captain John D. Howell in command. After shakedown operations in the Caribbean, the oiler arrived Mayport, Florida, 1 May 1962. Throughout the summer she engaged in exercises off the Florida Coast, and sailed to the Azores to participate in Project Mercury, manned orbital flights. She was in company with during the latter's recovery of Astronaut Walter Schirra 3 October, demonstrating the large role of the Navy in space operations."
"""Kaskaskia"" return to Mayport 22 October and two days later sailed to participate in the Cuban blockade. President John F. Kennedy ordered the blockade when the Soviet Union tried to plant offensive missiles only from the United States. The naval pressure persuaded the Soviet Union to withdraw the missiles, easing the crisis. The oiler returned to operations out of Mayport 21 November."
"She cleared Mayport 5 February 1963, for a six-month Mediterranean cruise to refuel ships of the US 6th Fleet, then resumed refueling exercises off Florida for the rest of the year. During 1964 ""Kaskaskia"" engaged in fueling operations and exercises off Florida and in the Caribbean, constantly seeking improved methods to increase the mobility of the Fleet."
"On 6 January 1965, ""Kaskaskia"" sailed for another 6th Fleet deployment. While she was operating in the Mediterranean, her crew worked day and night delivering over 19,000,000 gallons of fuel to 169 ships. ""Kaskaskia"" returned to Mayport, 7 June 1965. She operated primarily along the Atlantic Coast and in the Caribbean into 1967. Highlights of this period were service to ships patrolling off the coast of riot-torn Santo Domingo in the summer of 1965, and participation in the recovery team for an unmanned Apollo Program space flight in February 1966."
"""Kaskaskia"" was decommissioned for the final time in December 1969 and sold for scrap in September 1970."
"""Kaskaskia"", received nine battle stars for World War II and seven stars for Korean War service."

"Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) is an Indonesian survey and political consultancy institution. It was founded in 2005 by a group of public opinion makers, researchers, columnists and survey experts. LSI is active in committing political surveys, for example during the General Election (Pemilu) or District Head General Election (Pilkada). In 2011, Universitas Kristen Indonesia (UKI) awarded LSI an “Achievement Award” since it was judged that LSI has provided significant contribution to the field of social science, political communication, and election politics in Indonesia."
"Lingkaran Survei Indonesia is often made a study subject and even the place where foreign politicians conduct their comparative studies. At the end of 2010 a delegation of US Congress led by Zack Hudgins conducted a meeting with Lingkaran Survei Indonesia. That meeting was a part of their chain of political activities in Indonesia aside from visiting various other institutions such as the People's Representative Council (DPR), political parties, and other elite entities of Indonesian politics. The reasoning behind that meeting was stated as due to Lingkaran Survei Indonesia being considered as an influential political institution in Indonesia, especially as its role as the pioneer of such form of institution in Indonesia."
"According to Tempo Newspaper, LSI was founded in 2005 by Denny JA. Before founding LSI, Denny founded Lembaga Survei Indonesia and served as its Director. Denny JA founded Lingkaran Survei Indonesia as a statement that a survey and consultancy institution can be profitable. The Swa Sembada Magazine wrote that Denny wished to build an institution not only focusing on committing political survey but can also perform political consultancy. Armed with the experience of securing the victory for the team that made Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's claim to presidency possible in 2004, Denny JA founded LSI with the focus of doing political surveys as well as providing political consultancy for political parties and candidates."
"As survey institution, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) provides aid for political parties and individuals in mapping their own strengths and weaknesses. Various political parties, such as Partai Golkar, have used LSI's survey results as consideration in choosing which candidates should be supported in District Head General Election (Pilkada.) As political consultant, LSI's first client was Ismeth Abdullah, who was elected as Governor of Riau Islands in 2005. Afterwards, LSI has provided aid to various clients from legislative members to district head candidates. Until 2013, LSI worked with 24 governors and 55 mayors/regents who were later elected."
"Currently, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) has developed six subsidiaries: Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI), Konsultan Citra Indonesia (KCI), Lingkaran Survei Kebijakan Publik (LSKP), Citra Publik Indonesia (CPI), Citra Publik Advertising (CPA), and Citra Komunikasi LSI (Cikom)."
"From 2004 to 2012, LSI conducted over 800 voter behavioral surveys across Indonesia for a variety of clients, including political parties, presidential candidates, legislative bodies candidates and district head candidates. Republika Newspaper even deigned the title of “Political Foreseer” to Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) due to its ability to predict the correct victors on various elections far before the real results are announced and published. Museum Rekor Indonesia (MURI—Indonesian Museum of Records) awarded five awards to LSI due to its accuracy in predicting various election results: (1) The 1st Accurate Advertised Survey Predictions for 2005's District Head Election on the Riau Province, (2) The 1st Accurate Advertised Legislative Election Survey Prediction on 2009, (3) The 1st Accurate Advertised Presidential Election Survey Predictions on 2009, (4) The Most Amount of Accurate Advertised Survey Predictions of District Head Elections in One Season of District Head Election (13 elections from 2005 to 2008), (5) The Research Institute with the Most 100% Accurately Predicted Surveys in One Month, (6) correct predictions on March 2006"
"LSI began work as a political consultant in 2005. After LSI, similar institutions emerged, including Indobarometer, Fox Indonesia, Polmark Indonesia and Milenium Cipta Citra."

"Nicholas Theodore Nemeth (born July 27, 1980) is an American professional wrestler and stand-up comedian. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand under the ring name Dolph Ziggler."
"After a prolific career in amateur wrestling, where he established several school records for Kent State University, Nemeth signed a developmental contract with WWE in 2004 and was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he wrestled under his real name. He was promoted to WWE's Raw brand shortly afterwards in 2005, playing the caddy sidekick to Kerwin White. He was sent back to OVW shortly afterwards, being given the name Nicky and joining the cheerleading-themed Spirit Squad, who debuted on ""Raw"" in January 2006 and won the World Tag Team Championship once before returning to OVW that November. In September 2007, Nemeth was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship twice, with Brad Allen and later Gavin Spears."
"Upon his return to the main roster in September 2008, Nemeth was repackaged as Dolph Ziggler. Since then, he has held the World Heavyweight Championship twice, the Intercontinental Championship six times, the United States Championship twice, and the Raw Tag Team Championship twice. His other accomplishments include becoming the sole survivor of two Survivor Series elimination matches and the 2012 Money in the Bank winner as well as headlining multiple WWE pay-per-view events."
"Nicholas Theodore Nemeth was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 27, 1980. He has been a fan of professional wrestling since he was five years old, when he attended a wrestling event at the Richfield Coliseum, and he decided to become a professional wrestler at age 12. He later revealed on Colt Cabana's ""Art of Wrestling Podcast"" that he chose his WWE name ""Dolph"" because that was his great-grandfather's name, and his friend suggested the surname ""Ziggler"". Nemeth attended St. Edward High School in Lakewood, Ohio, where he was an amateur wrestler and holds the school record for most pins in a career with 82. At St. Edward, he was teammates with Gray Maynard and Andy Hrovat."
"During his time at St. Edward, the wrestling team won the National Championships on two occasions. He was a collegiate wrestler at Kent State University, eventually setting what was then the record for most career wins in the team's history. His record was passed in 2006; as of 2010, he stands second all-time in career victories at Kent State. He had 121 career wins between 2000 and 2003. He majored in political science with a pre-law minor. Prior to his WWE tryout, he had been accepted to the law school at Arizona State University, where he was due to start his first semester. Nemeth won championships in three consecutive years. He was a three-time All-Mid-American Conference champion, winning the tournament in 2000, 2002, and 2003; as of 2010, he is the last wrestler from Kent State University to have won three amateur wrestling championships."
"Nemeth signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2004. He was assigned to their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), debuting as ""Nick Nemeth"". He feuded with Paul Burchill and challenged unsuccessfully for the OVW Television Championship, losing a championship match against then-champion Ken Doane on August 12, 2005."
"Nemeth was called up to the Raw roster shortly afterwards, making his television debut on the September 19, 2005, episode of ""Sunday Night Heat"". He was made the enforcer and sidekick for Chavo Guerrero, Jr., who was using a golfer in-ring persona and going by the ring name of ""Kerwin White"". As such, Nemeth became White's caddy. His wrestling debut came on an episode of ""Sunday Night Heat"", teaming up with White in a tag team match against Shelton Benjamin and Matt Striker. After the death of Eddie Guerrero, Chavo Guerrero dropped the ""Kerwin White"" character, and Nemeth no longer played the role of his caddy and tag partner. After a few months of wrestling in dark matches and at house shows, he was sent back to OVW."
"Nemeth became a part of The Spirit Squad faction, a group of five wrestlers who used the in-ring personas of male cheerleaders, and adopted the name Nicky in OVW during late 2005. The Spirit Squad members trained with real cheerleaders and gymnasts to ensure their characters were believable. On January 23, 2006, they had their WWE television debut as a group, appearing on ""Raw"" and helping Jonathan Coachman win a Royal Rumble qualifying match against Jerry ""The King"" Lawler by performing cheers for Coachman and distracting Lawler. They later became a part of the ongoing scripted feud between WWE chairman Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels. The heel McMahon brought in the Squad to attack Michaels on numerous occasions, including placing them in multiple handicap matches."
"They also wrestled in the tag team division, and on April 3, on ""Raw"", won the World Tag Team Championship when Kenny and Mikey, with outside help from the other three Squad members, defeated Big Show and Kane. After winning the championship, all five members of the Spirit Squad were recognized as the champions, allowing any combination of them to defend the championship under the Freebird Rule."
"In May, McMahon signed another Handicap match, with the Spirit Squad facing Michaels. The match never started, however; instead the Spirit Squad attacked Michaels, and, as part of the storyline, shattered his knee with a steel chair. McMahon brought Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer; however, after Triple H felt that the Squad had disrespected him, he attacked the group. This led to Triple H and Michaels reforming D-Generation X (DX) and they began a feud with the Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric jokes on the Squad and the McMahons, as well as defeating the Spirit Squad in handicap tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at ""Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII""."
"At the same time as their feud with DX and their alignment with McMahon, the Squad also wrestled other teams in ""Raw""<nowiki>'</nowiki>s tag division over their World Tag Team Championship, successfully defending the championship against the teams of Jim Duggan and Eugene, Charlie Haas and Viscera, and Snitsky and Val Venis. They then entered a lengthy feud with The Highlanders, whom they eventually defeated to retain the championship at the Unforgiven pay-per-view in September. The Squad as a whole later began a losing streak with separate members losing singles matches to Ric Flair on consecutive episodes of ""Raw"", until Kenny managed to defeat him on the October 23 episode. It was then announced that Flair and a WWE legend, selected by interactive voting, would wrestle the team for the World Tag Team Championship at the Cyber Sunday pay-per-view in early November. The fans chose Roddy Piper, and he and Flair defeated Kenny and Mikey to win the championship."
"The group disbanded on the November 27 episode of ""Raw"", when they were defeated in a five-on-three handicap match by DX and Flair. In a backstage segment later that night, DX placed all members into a crate stamped ""OVW, Louisville, Kentucky"", a reference to the developmental territory from which the Squad had come."
"Nemeth returned to OVW on January 17, 2007, at the television tapings, again using his Nick Nemeth ring name, along with Mike Mondo, formerly Mikey in the Spirit Squad, as the ""Frat Pack"". The pair teamed with Mike Kruel in a match against Seth Skyfire, Shawn Spears, and Cody Runnels. The team disbanded in the early parts of 2007. Nemeth then competed in several dark matches before the OVW television tapings, competing against several wrestlers including Chris Cage, Bradley Jay and Jake Hager, before he began teaming with Mondo again in August."
"At the end of August, Nemeth and Mike Mondo were moved to the Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) developmental territory and in his debut there, Nemeth gained the nickname ""The Natural"" and defeated Hade Vansen. In November 2007, Nemeth gained Big Rob as his manager, but their alliance was short-lived. At the start of 2008, he tweaked his name to ""Nic Nemeth"" and began teaming with Brad Allen, with the pair gaining Taryn Terrell as their valet. Nemeth and Allen started a frat boy type ring character with Terrell as a sorority girl. On March 22, Nemeth and Allen won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship by defeating defending champions Eddie Colón and Eric Pérez, but lost the championship to Colón and Pérez on April 15. Throughout April and May 2008, Nemeth wrestled in several dark matches prior to ""Raw"", losing to Kofi Kingston and Ron Killings on several occasions. Soon after, he returned to the name ""Nic Nemeth"", and began teaming with Gavin Spears. The pair defeated Colón and Pérez to win the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship on August 16, but lost it to Heath Miller and Joe Hennig less than a month later."
"On September 15, 2008, Nemeth re-debuted on ""Raw"" (as a heel), introducing himself in a backstage segment under the name ""Dolph Ziggler"". On October 10, Nemeth was suspended for 30 days for a violation of WWE's Wellness Program policy. He returned to ""Raw"" on November 17 in a backstage segment with Rey Mysterio and Shawn Michaels. In his first match on ""Raw"" under the Ziggler name, he lost to Batista on the December 1, 2008 episode. The following week he got his first victory as Ziggler, by countout, against R-Truth. The next week on ""Raw"", he picked up his first televised pinfall victory, when he defeated Charlie Haas. Ziggler would compete in the 2009 Royal Rumble match, in which he was eliminated by Kane after 21 seconds."
"On April 15, 2009, Ziggler was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft. He made his debut on the April 17 episode of ""SmackDown"", defeating the United States Champion, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a non-title match, and, as a result, the following week he demanded a match for the championship. On the May 1 episode of ""SmackDown"", however, he failed to win the championship, after he was pinned by MVP. Ziggler then started a rivalry with The Great Khali, losing to him by disqualification after attacking Khali with a steel chair. As a result, Khali began coming out to the ring during and after Ziggler's matches, in attempt to gain revenge and to stop Ziggler from cheating. Over the next few weeks, Ziggler would defeat Khali by countout and disqualification after making it look like Khali had struck him with a steel chair. At The Bash pay-per-view, Ziggler defeated Khali in a No Disqualification match by pinfall, after Kane interfered and attacked Khali."
"Ziggler then entered an on-screen relationship with WWE Diva Maria and she became his valet. He simultaneously started a scripted rivalry with Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio, who defeated Ziggler at the Night of Champions and SummerSlam pay-per-views to retain the championship. In September, Mysterio lost the Intercontinental Championship to John Morrison, and Ziggler entered a feud with Morrison after defeating him by countout in a non-title match, but lost to him at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view. On the episode of ""SmackDown"" following Hell in a Cell, Ziggler ended his on-screen relationship with Maria after she accidentally cost him a match against Morrison for the Intercontinental Championship. He again failed to win the Intercontinental title from Morrison twice, wrestling him to a double countout on the November 13 episode of ""SmackDown"" and losing a two-out-of-three falls match the following week to end the feud. On the February 26, 2010, episode of ""SmackDown"", Ziggler defeated John Morrison and R-Truth in a triple threat qualifying match to compete in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXVI, but was ultimately unsuccessful."
"In June 2010, he began a romantic storyline with Vickie Guerrero, who began accompanying him to the ring. On the July 9 episode of ""SmackDown"", Ziggler defeated Chavo Guerrero and Montel Vontavious Porter in a triple threat match to qualify for the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, where he once again failed to win the match. On July 28 at the tapings of the August 6 episode of ""SmackDown"" Ziggler defeated Kofi Kingston to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship for the first time. In his first title defense at SummerSlam, he retained the championship against Kingston when the match ended in a no contest due to interference from The Nexus. Ziggler was able to make a successful title defense against Kingston at the Night of Champions pay-per-view, and against Kaval at Survivor Series."
"In November 2010, Ziggler was chosen a Pro for the fourth season of ""NXT"", with Jacob Novak as his Rookie. On the January 4, 2011, episode of ""NXT"", Ziggler won a battle royal to earn the right to choose a new rookie, and chose Byron Saxton. His original rookie, Novak, was the first rookie eliminated later that night. On February 8, 2011, Ziggler's second rookie, Byron Saxton, was also voted off of ""NXT""."
"Ziggler successfully retained the Intercontinental Championship at in a three-way ladder match against Kingston and Jack Swagger, but lost the title to Kingston at ""SmackDown"" on January 4, ending a five-month reign at 160 days. That same night, Ziggler won a four-way match against Cody Rhodes, Drew McIntyre and The Big Show to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship. At the Royal Rumble, Ziggler was unsuccessful in his title match against Edge. On February 4, Ziggler's storyline girlfriend Vickie Guerrero, who was the acting General Manager of SmackDown, banned the spear – Edge's finishing move – and decided that if Edge used it, Ziggler would be awarded the championship. Ziggler was again defeated by Edge in a rematch on the February 11 episode of ""SmackDown"", but because Edge used the spear, Guerrero declared Ziggler the new champion on the February 14 episode of ""Raw"". Prior to Ziggler's official coronation ceremony on ""SmackDown"" on February 18, Guerrero also fired Edge, claiming that he had attacked SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long several weeks prior. However, Long interrupted Ziggler's ceremony and accused Guerrero of orchestrating the attack, prompting Guerrero to reveal Ziggler as the attacker and Long to rehire Edge. Long also gave Edge a rematch against Ziggler, who lost the championship back to Edge and was then fired by Long."
"On the March 7 episode of ""Raw"", Ziggler was introduced as the newest member of the Raw roster, and defeated John Morrison in a singles match; Ziggler was accompanied by Guerrero, who had also been fired from ""SmackDown"", but she was forced to earn her spot on the Raw roster. Ziggler, along with Guerrero, and LayCool then feuded with Morrison, Trish Stratus, and ""Jersey Shore"" guest star Snooki, culminating in a mixed tag team match at WrestleMania XXVII which Ziggler and his team lost. On the April 18 episode of ""Raw"", Vickie introduced the ""new and improved"" Ziggler, who came out with his hair cut short and brown and went on to defeat Evan Bourne in a singles match. Ziggler had re-bleached his hair by the May 23 episode of ""Raw""."
"Ziggler beat United States Champion Kofi Kingston in a non-title match on the May 30 episode of ""Raw"", leading to a championship match at Capitol Punishment which Ziggler won to earn his first United States Championship. The next night on ""Raw"", Kingston invoked his rematch clause in a two out of three falls match and won via disqualification, allowing Ziggler to retain. After Jack Swagger suggested to Guerrero that she should manage him in addition to Ziggler, a jealous Ziggler teased tension with Swagger. This, coupled with Ziggler's concurrent feud with Alex Riley, led Ziggler to defend and retain his United States Championship in a fatal four-way match against Swagger, Riley, and John Morrison at Night of Champions. On the September 19 episode of ""Raw"", Ziggler lost a non-title match to Zack Ryder when guest star Hugh Jackman helped Ryder by punching Ziggler in the face. Although Ziggler later claimed to have a broken jaw due to Jackman's punch, it was reported that the supposed injury was fake. Later that night, Guerrero officially began managing Swagger, and Swagger began interfering in Ziggler's matches to help him win. Ziggler and Swagger unsuccessfully challenged Air Boom for the WWE Tag Team Championship at Hell in a Cell and at Vengeance, where Ziggler also successfully defended the United States Championship against Ryder. He went on to successfully defend the championship against Morrison at Survivor Series. At , Ziggler lost the United States Championship to Ryder."
"On the December 26 episode of ""Raw"", Ziggler defeated WWE Champion CM Punk in a gauntlet match for a championship opportunity following interference from John Laurinaitis. The following ""Raw"", Ziggler defeated Punk by countout after Laurinaitis interfered again; as a result, Ziggler did not win the championship. At the 2012 Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Ziggler failed to capture the WWE Championship from CM Punk. At the Elimination Chamber, Ziggler failed again to capture the WWE Championship after being eliminated second by Chris Jericho. Nemeth noted to Arda Ocal in an interview for The Score Television Network that the Elimination Chamber left him with multiple minor injuries and it is a match he least looked forward to working."
"On the February 27 ""Raw"", Ziggler and Swagger unsuccessfully challenged Primo & Epico for the WWE Tag Team Championship in a Triple Threat tag team match, also involving Kofi Kingston and R-Truth. On the March 19 ""Raw"", Ziggler and Swagger were announced as the newest members of Team Johnny for the 12-man tag team match at WrestleMania XXVIII and on the April 2 ""Raw"", Ziggler and Swagger unsuccessfully challenged Santino Marella for the United States Championship in a triple threat match. After the match, Ziggler began a feud with Brodus Clay, who attacked Ziggler with a headbutt after he and Swagger tried to attack Marella. On the following episode of ""Raw"", Ziggler and Swagger were defeated by Clay and Marella in a tag team match. In the following weeks, Ziggler and Swagger lost to Clay and Hornswoggle in singles and tag matches. At Extreme Rules, Ziggler was again defeated by Clay. In May, Ziggler and Swagger unsuccessfully challenged Kofi Kingston and R-Truth for WWE Tag Team Championship, first at Over the Limit and second on the May 28 episode of ""Raw"", resulting in Ziggler showing signs of wanting to break away from Guerrero and Swagger."
"On the June 11 episode of ""Raw"", Ziggler defeated The Great Khali, Swagger and Christian in a fatal four-way elimination match to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship, but at No Way Out, Ziggler lost the title match to champion Sheamus.
