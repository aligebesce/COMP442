"I mean, when we're all like, laughing and joking and everything he's like, oh yeah really in with it  but when everyone's like arguing or whatever he  he"
Mm.

"And encourage  that's the trouble, you drop Mortimer you drop somebody who can er flip the ball in but  I think you definitely want to take the heat off Wright."
Now if if all Collymore does is distract   but Mortimer was not playing enough of the game.
"We can't afford  people like Mortimer to, I mean he scored a goal  but I mean"
Yeah.

"Anyway he got all his bricks and everything  and er  he got all his ideas what he wanted  and then they turned round and said no, we're not gonna let you build down there."
So we bought his bricks.

Wimborne market every Tuesday  and Wimborne horse sale every other Friday.
"Used to have  horse sale every fortnight, see every other Friday."
Ha!
You wouldn't think that there was a  enough business to want a horse sale once a fortnight would you?
But  mm.
"Course, it was horses in them days, not motorcars."
I can remember  first motorcar that we drove in   old Charlie  's.
"Old Charlie's  car  wooden spokes, wooden wheels  solid tyres  and he used to sit up right in there  same as I am now, like in a box  and the old chauffeur   was the chauffeur driving along."
And I suppose they go along about  I don't expect they do about six miles an hour.
"Just, chug, chug, chug, chug."
At least it was some other form of transport than a horse.
Oh yes!
Gave the horses a bit of a rest.
Mm.
Er er er  er er er
"I would think the mo , motorcar nowadays can go up to something like two hundred odd miles now is it?"
Yeah.
Mm.
And when you see them racing on the television!
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Ah!
But don't matter what it is everything is increasing in speed.
Now you see  in my days on the railway  sixty miles an hour was a good speed for a train it di it didn't reckon to  do much more than that see.
"I know  er, down at Corfe Junction or a  one road across or one another across or  there was one road going to Wimborne, one going to Broadstone, up road and down road."
"And of course, they had these signs up  about la up close to a signal  er  twenty, twenty five or thirty or whatever it was, that was miles an hour, they were supposed to reduce to that."
"And er  I can remember one day a driver, Len  his name was and  he er  he said to the inspector, oh he says er  I've been through Corfe Junction he said at sixty miles an hour!"
What!
"Ooh he said, you don't wanna make a song about it!"
"But he said, I have done."
"And er  course, that where the restrictions was on see  at the  and of course, after that, a few years after that, of course take no notice of it now."
"and er, like Christmas, erm, they have these things on the telly when there's about, every, every night there's like a fifteen minutes' programme, just before the close-down, of like, B B C One."
One?
"And there's people, like famous people of the telly just sitting and talking erm, and saying prayers every night, and walking around a typical area that means something to them."
Oh.
"And we watched it one night, and it was Mrs Hewitt off Eastenders."
"Oh, really?"
"And er, she was really"
"by Michael Aspel, weren't she, or Michael Parkinson?"
between them.
Yeah.
Aspel tomato.
"Erm, and so, we had a good old walk around there, and like this place where she was, I swear it's Highgate Cemetery where she was talking,"
"Oh, really?"
"and like she was pointing different things out about this cemetery, and, I mean, you know, you there can't be many cemeteries"
No.
"like that in, in London and she was in London, but we missed the beginning of it,"
Oh.

"So er,"
It's quite  to get on with your bruv .
"Yeah, because you know, we're always messing about, or  around, or, you know, never like you know, together, really"
Yeah.
"Because even when I go up to his place, like it's always been, like dropping him off, always being in a hurry."
"I mean, I sat in his room, had a coffee today, it was like, I actually sat here and relaxed and always being on the move, you know."
"Thank you, it's a verb, right, to do something, so it's the same spelling that can be used in different ways."

"Yes it's the magic E, isn't it, and what's it making that A say?"

"Erm, say anything about that?"
"Well it's not sort of place you can get it to, before, before breakfast is it, so er, no."
Mm.
"It's not, we, we have sometimes gone very early on a Saturday morning to places like Nottingham, but, it's not too far for that."
"Right, well that's good, erm, and, so in, in relation to the A G M erm we did, we were asked about putting in motion's erm, are you having to leave the one about the press  after what John said?"
How do you feel?.
"One, what, one that we erm, one, yes, yes, but as a group why don't we review having another prisoner when we got"
"When we got, when we got the next one yes certainly."
"Yeah , and then to see."
"Mm, mm, right and are we, I mean if anybody still wanted to put in a motion, there is still time just about."
"Yeah about , just about, yeah ."
"But eh, you'd have to have it sort of written out and more or less ready I think to go."
"All groups are invited to send resolution which may or may not be actually debated but erm, we, we don't normally send one in, but some, some groups they send them in, no, no one 's thinking"
Think the closing dates a few days time isn't it?
Thursday.
"Thursday, yeah."
"Oh, right, so it's very close."
"Got to be ready tonight, if they're to get it."
No.
"Right, erm, so, I think, I think, as far as future events that's all what we need to mention?"
"Now, erm Rose is secretary and she's had things through from er British Section Headquarters and she'll tell us what she's got there."
"Erm  I don't know if this one concerns us, it's about er, a working group for children, do we have, we don't have a working group for children ."
"No, we've never been very close to the  now."
I won't obviously .
"Erm, I've also received information from the Region, erm with lots of events that's coming up in the East Anglian Region, erm, just run through those quickly, er, there is a workshop on  this Thursday at the Courts , erm, there is on Thursday twelfth of March there is er, somebody from the Columbian committee for human rights speaking at an open meeting, that's the fifth  er, Wednesday first of April there is er somebody called Duncan , he's a paediatric surgeon who works part time as a volunteer at the Medical Foundation for the Care and Victims of Torture who will be speaking at St. Mary's and St. Edmunds group, and that, that's Bury St. Edmunds, and then the next East Anglia Regional Meeting is on Saturday May the twenty third at Bury St. Edmunds again."
May twenty third?
"Yeah May the twenty third, it's a Saturday two to five pm at the Friends' Meeting House, Bury."
Bank Holiday weekend isn't it?
I don't know.
He knew now that he had made a mistake in coming tonight ; he could not help her .
His own pain had unmanned him .
Presently he would say something foolish or selfish in spite of himself .
Sara turned her eyes on him .
"`` There is nothing anybody can do , Jeff , '' she said piteously ."
"Her eyes , those clear child-eyes , filled with tears ."
`` I shall be braver -- stronger -- after a while .
But just now I have no strength left .
"I feel like a lost , helpless child ."
"Oh , Jeff ! ''"
She put her slender hands over her face and sobbed .
Every sob cut Jeffrey to the heart .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , Sara , '' he said huskily ."
`` I ca n't bear to see you suffer so .
I 'd die for you if it would do you any good .
I love you -- I love you !
"I never meant to tell you so , but it is the truth ."
I ought n't to tell you now .
Do n't think that I 'm trying to take any advantage of your loneliness and sorrow .
I know -- I have always known -- that you are far above me .
"But that could n't prevent my loving you -- just humbly loving you , asking nothing else ."
"You may be angry with my presumption , but I ca n't help telling you that I love you ."
That 's all .
I just want you to know it . ''
Sara had turned away her head .
Jeffrey was overcome with contrition .
"Ah , he had no business to speak so -- he had spoiled the devotion of years ."
Who was he that he should have dared to love her ?
"Silence alone had justified his love , and now he had lost that justification ."
She would despise him .
He had forfeited her friendship for ever .
"`` Are you angry , Sara ? ''"
`` Would ye lie there idle ? ''
cried Matcham .
`` Let us back into the open .
We have the better chance ; he can not steal upon us unawares . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick ."
"`` My time is come , and peradventure he may pass us by . ''"
"`` Bend me , then , your bow ! ''"
cried the other .
`` What !
will ye be a man ? ''
Dick crossed himself .
`` Would ye have me shoot upon a leper ? ''
he cried .
`` The hand would fail me .
"Nay , now , '' he added -- `` nay , now , let be !"
"With sound men I will fight , but not with ghosts and lepers ."
"Which this is , I wot not ."
"One or other , Heaven be our protection ! ''"
"`` Now , '' said Matcham , `` if this be man 's courage , what a poor thing is man !"
"But sith ye will do naught , let us lie close . ''"
"Then came a single , broken jangle on the bell ."
"`` He hath missed his hold upon the clapper , '' whispered Matcham ."
`` Saints !
how near he is ! ''
But Dick answered never a word ; his teeth were near chattering .
"Soon they saw a piece of the white robe between some bushes ; then the leper 's head was thrust forth from behind a trunk , and he seemed narrowly to scan the neighbourhood before he once again withdrew ."
"To their stretched senses , the whole bush appeared alive with rustlings and the creak of twigs ; and they heard the beating of each other 's heart ."
"Suddenly , with a cry , the leper sprang into the open close by , and ran straight upon the lads ."
"They , shrieking aloud , separated and began to run different ways ."
"But their horrible enemy fastened upon Matcham , ran him swiftly down , and had him almost instantly a prisoner ."
"The lad gave one scream that echoed high and far over the forest , he had one spasm of struggling , and then all his limbs relaxed , and he fell limp into his captor 's arms ."
Dick heard the cry and turned .
A sweet pretty place you have of it here .
"Ah , there 's Jim !"
"The top of the morning to you , Jim ."
"Doctor , here 's my service ."
"Why , there you all are together like a happy family , in a manner of speaking . ''"
"`` If you have anything to say , my man , better say it , '' said the captain ."
"`` Right you were , Cap'n Smollett , '' replied Silver ."
"`` Dooty is dooty , to be sure ."
"Well now , you look here , that was a good lay of yours last night ."
I do n't deny it was a good lay .
Some of you pretty handy with a handspike-end .
And I 'll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook -- maybe all was shook ; maybe I was shook myself ; maybe that 's why I 'm here for terms .
"But you mark me , cap'n , it wo n't do twice , by thunder !"
We 'll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the rum .
Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind 's eye .
"But I 'll tell you I was sober ; I was on ' y dog tired ; and if I 'd awoke a second sooner , I 'd ' a caught you at the act , I would ."
"He was n't dead when I got round to him , not he . ''"
`` Well ? ''
says Captain Smollett as cool as can be .
"All that Silver said was a riddle to him , but you would never have guessed it from his tone ."
"As for me , I began to have an inkling ."
Ben Gunn 's last words came back to my mind .
"I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire , and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with ."
"`` Well , here it is , '' said Silver ."
"`` We want that treasure , and we 'll have it -- that 's our point !"
"You would just as soon save your lives , I reckon ; and that 's yours ."
"You have a chart , have n't you ? ''"
"`` That 's as may be , '' replied the captain ."
"`` Oh , well , you have , I know that , '' returned Long John ."
"`` You need n't be so husky with a man ; there ai n't a particle of service in that , and you may lay to it ."
"What I mean is , we want your chart ."
"Now , I never meant you no harm , myself . ''"
"`` It was a coward blow , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are but a lout and bully , Master Dick ; ye but abuse advantages ; let there come a stronger , we will see you truckle at his boot !"
"Ye care not for vengeance , neither -- for your father 's death that goes unpaid , and his poor ghost that clamoureth for justice ."
"But if there come but a poor creature in your hands that lacketh skill and strength , and would befriend you , down she shall go ! ''"
Dick was too furious to observe that `` she . ''
`` Marry ! ''
"he cried , `` and here is news !"
Of any two the one will still be stronger .
"The better man throweth the worse , and the worse is well served ."
"Ye deserve a belting , Master Matcham , for your ill-guidance and unthankfulness to meward ; and what ye deserve ye shall have . ''"
"And Dick , who , even in his angriest temper , still preserved the appearance of composure , began to unbuckle his belt ."
"`` Here shall be your supper , '' he said , grimly ."
"Matcham had stopped his tears ; he was as white as a sheet , but he looked Dick steadily in the face , and never moved ."
"Dick took a step , swinging the belt ."
"Then he paused , embarrassed by the large eyes and the thin , weary face of his companion ."
His courage began to subside .
"`` Say ye were in the wrong , then , '' he said , lamely ."
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I was in the right ."
"Come , cruel !"
"I be lame ; I be weary ; I resist not ; I ne'er did thee hurt ; come , beat me -- coward ! ''"
"Dick raised the belt at this last provocation , but Matcham winced and drew himself together with so cruel an apprehension , that his heart failed him yet again ."
"The strap fell by his side , and he stood irresolute , feeling like a fool ."
"`` A plague upon thee , shrew ! ''"
he said .
"`` An ye be so feeble of hand , ye should keep the closer guard upon your tongue ."
But I 'll be hanged before I beat you ! ''
and he put on his belt again .
"`` Beat you I will not , '' he continued ; `` but forgive you ?"
-- never .
"I knew ye not ; ye were my master 's enemy ; I lent you my horse ; my dinner ye have eaten ; y ' ` ave called me a man o ' wood , a coward , and a bully ."
"Nay , by the mass !"
"the measure is filled , and runneth over ."
She dared not say it was impossible .
But Aunt Emma had no such scruples .
"With a great clatter and racket , that lady fell upon the dishes that held Patty 's almost untasted dinner and whisked them away while her tongue kept time to her jerky movements ."
"`` Goodness me , doctor , do you think you 're talking to millionaires ?"
Where do you suppose the money is to come from to send Patty to the country ?
"I ca n't afford it , that is certain ."
"I think I do pretty well to give Marcella and Patty their board free , and I have to work my fingers to the bone to do that ."
"It 's all nonsense about Patty , anyhow ."
What she ought to do is to make an effort to get better .
She does n't -- she just mopes and pines .
She wo n't eat a thing I cook for her .
How can anyone expect to get better if she does n't eat ? ''
Aunt Emma glared at the doctor as if she were triumphantly sure that she had propounded an unanswerable question .
A dull red flush rose to Marcella 's face .
"`` Oh , Aunt Emma , I ca n't eat ! ''"
said Patty wearily .
"`` It is n't because I wo n't -- indeed , I ca n't . ''"
`` Humph !
I suppose my cooking is n't fancy enough for you -- that 's the trouble .
"Well , I have n't the time to put any frills on it ."
I think I do pretty well to wait on you at all with all that work piling up before me .
But some people imagine that they were born to be waited on . ''
"Aunt Emma whirled the last dish from the table and left the room , slamming the door behind her ."
The doctor shrugged his shoulders .
He had become used to Miss Gibson 's tirades during Patty 's illness .
"But Marcella had never got used to them -- never , in all the three years she had lived with her aunt ."
They flicked on the raw as keenly as ever .
This morning it seemed unbearable .
It took every atom of Marcella 's self-control to keep her from voicing her resentful thoughts .
It was only for Patty 's sake that she was able to restrain herself .
"It was only for Patty 's sake , too , that she did not , as soon as the doctor had gone , give way to tears ."
"Instead , she smiled bravely into the little sister 's eyes ."
"` Yes , I shall only bring a fairy story for my dowry , ' said he , and so they parted ."
But the princess gave him a sabre set with gold pieces which he could use .
"Then he flew away , bought himself a new dressing-gown , and sat down in the wood and began to make up a story , for it had to be ready by Saturday , and that was no easy matter ."
When he had it ready it was Saturday .
"The sultan , the sultana , and the whole court were at tea with the princess ."
He was most graciously received .
` Will you tell us a story ? '
said the sultana ; ` one that is thoughtful and instructive ? '
"` But something that we can laugh at , ' said the sultan ."
"` Oh , certainly , ' he replied , and began : ` Now , listen attentively ."
"There was once a box of matches which lay between a tinder-box and an old iron pot , and they told the story of their youth . '"
`` We used to be on the green fir-boughs .
"Every morning and evening we had diamond-tea , which was the dew , and the whole day long we had sunshine , and the little birds used to tell us stories ."
"We were very rich , because the other trees only dressed in summer , but we had green dresses in summer and in winter ."
"Then the woodcutter came , and our family was split up ."
We have now the task of making light for the lowest people .
That is why we grand people are in the kitchen . '' '
"`` My fate was quite different , '' said the iron pot , near which the matches lay . '"
"`` Since I came into the world I have been many times scoured , and have cooked much ."
My only pleasure is to have a good chat with my companions when I am lying nice and clean in my place after dinner . '' '
"`` Now you are talking too fast , '' spluttered the fire . '"
"`` Yes , let us decide who is the grandest ! ''"
said the matches . '
"`` No , I do n't like talking about myself , '' said the pot . '"
`` Let us arrange an evening 's entertainment .
I will tell the story of my life . '
`` On the Baltic by the Danish shore - '' ` What a beautiful beginning ! ''
said all the plates .
`` That 's a story that will please us all . ''
` And the end was just as good as the beginning .
All the plates clattered for joy . '
"`` Now I will dance , '' said the tongs , and she danced ."
"`` That wo n't do with me , my man , '' interrupted the captain ."
"`` We know exactly what you meant to do , and we do n't care , for now , you see , you ca n't do it . ''"
And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe .
`` If Abe Gray -- '' Silver broke out .
`` Avast there ! ''
cried Mr. Smollett .
"`` Gray told me nothing , and I asked him nothing ; and what 's more , I would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first ."
"So there 's my mind for you , my man , on that . ''"
This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down .
"He had been growing nettled before , but now he pulled himself together ."
"`` Like enough , '' said he ."
"`` I would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape , or might not , as the case were ."
"And seein ' as how you are about to take a pipe , cap'n , I 'll make so free as do likewise . ''"
"And he filled a pipe and lighted it ; and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while , now looking each other in the face , now stopping their tobacco , now leaning forward to spit ."
It was as good as the play to see them .
"`` Now , '' resumed Silver , `` here it is ."
"You give us the chart to get the treasure by , and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep ."
"You do that , and we 'll offer you a choice ."
"Either you come aboard along of us , once the treasure shipped , and then I 'll give you my affy-davy , upon my word of honour , to clap you somewhere safe ashore ."
"Or if that ai n't to your fancy , some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing , then you can stay here , you can ."
"We 'll divide stores with you , man for man ; and I 'll give my affy-davy , as before to speak the first ship I sight , and send 'em here to pick you up ."
"Now , you 'll own that 's talking ."
"Handsomer you could n't look to get , now you ."
"And I hope '' -- raising his voice -- `` that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words , for what is spoke to one is spoke to all . ''"
Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand .
`` Is that all ? ''
he asked .
"`` Every last word , by thunder ! ''"
answered John .
"`` Refuse that , and you 've seen the last of me but musket-balls . ''"
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
`` Now you 'll hear me .
"There was a pause , then a cry of surprise , and then a voice shouting from the house , `` Bill 's dead . ''"
But the blind man swore at them again for their delay .
"`` Search him , some of you shirking lubbers , and the rest of you aloft and get the chest , '' he cried ."
"I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs , so that the house must have shook with it ."
"Promptly afterwards , fresh sounds of astonishment arose ; the window of the captain 's room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass , and a man leaned out into the moonlight , head and shoulders , and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him ."
"`` Pew , '' he cried , `` they 've been before us ."
Someone 's turned the chest out alow and aloft . ''
`` Is it there ? ''
roared Pew .
`` The money 's there . ''
The blind man cursed the money .
"`` Flint 's fist , I mean , '' he cried ."
"`` We do n't see it here nohow , '' returned the man ."
"`` Here , you below there , is it on Bill ? ''"
cried the blind man again .
"At that another fellow , probably him who had remained below to search the captain 's body , came to the door of the inn ."
"`` Bill 's been overhauled a ` ready , '' said he ; `` nothin ' left . ''"
`` It 's these people of the inn -- it 's that boy .
I wish I had put his eyes out ! ''
"cried the blind man , Pew ."
`` There were no time ago -- they had the door bolted when I tried it .
"Scatter , lads , and find 'em . ''"
"`` Sure enough , they left their glim here , '' said the fellow from the window ."
`` Scatter and find 'em !
Rout the house out ! ''
"reiterated Pew , striking with his stick upon the road ."
"Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn , heavy feet pounding to and fro , furniture thrown over , doors kicked in , until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again , one after another , on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found ."
"And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain 's money was once more clearly audible through the night , but this time twice repeated ."
"I had thought it to be the blind man 's trumpet , so to speak , summoning his crew to the assault , but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet , and from its effect upon the buccaneers , a signal to warn them of approaching danger ."
"`` There 's Dirk again , '' said one ."
`` Twice !
"We 'll have to budge , mates . ''"
"`` Ye shall have no hurt , upon the rood !"
Stand !
"Back out , Hugh Ferryman . ''"
Dick cried a taunting answer .
"`` Nay , then , ye shall go afoot , '' returned the man ; and he let drive an arrow ."
"The horse , struck by the shaft , lashed out in agony and terror ; the boat capsized , and the next moment all were struggling in the eddies of the river ."
"When Dick came up , he was within a yard of the bank ; and before his eyes were clear , his hand had closed on something firm and strong that instantly began to drag him forward ."
"It was the riding-rod , that Matcham , crawling forth upon an overhanging willow , had opportunely thrust into his grasp ."
`` By the mass ! ''
"cried Dick , as he was helped ashore , `` that makes a life I owe you ."
I swim like a cannon-ball . ''
And he turned instantly towards the island .
"Midway over , Hugh Ferryman was swimming with his upturned boat , while John-a-Fenne , furious at the ill-fortune of his shot , bawled to him to hurry ."
"`` Come , Jack , '' said Shelton , `` run for it !"
"Ere Hugh can hale his barge across , or the pair of 'em can get it righted , we may be out of cry . ''"
"And adding example to his words , he began to run , dodging among the willows , and in marshy places leaping from tussock to tussock ."
"He had no time to look for his direction ; all he could do was to turn his back upon the river , and put all his heart to running ."
"Presently , however , the ground began to rise , which showed him he was still in the right way , and soon after they came forth upon a slope of solid turf , where elms began to mingle with the willows ."
"But here Matcham , who had been dragging far into the rear , threw himself fairly down ."
"`` Leave me , Dick ! ''"
"he cried , pantingly ; `` I can no more . ''"
"Dick turned , and came back to where his companion lay ."
"`` Nay , Jack , leave thee ! ''"
he cried .
"`` That were a knave 's trick , to be sure , when ye risked a shot and a ducking , ay , and a drowning too , to save my life ."
"Drowning , in sooth ; for why I did not pull you in along with me , the saints alone can tell ! ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I would ` a ' saved us both , good Dick , for I can swim . ''"
`` Can ye so ? ''
"cried Dick , with open eyes ."
It was the one manly accomplishment of which he was himself incapable .
"In the order of the things that he admired , next to having killed a man in single fight came swimming ."
"`` Well , '' he said , `` here is a lesson to despise no man ."
I did n't dare ask him to the house for I knew Anthony was in one of his moods .
But it 's time something was done .
She 's woman grown and this is no life for her .
"And there 's nobody to do anything but me and I 'm not able , even if I knew what to do ."
I wonder why she hates men so .
Perhaps it 's because she never knew any that were real gentlemen .
This man is -- but then he 's a minister and that makes a wide gulf between them in another way .
I 've seen the love of man and woman bridge some wider gulfs though .
"But it ca n't with Lynde , I 'm fearing ."
She 's so bitter at the mere speaking of love and marriage .
I ca n't think why .
"I 'm sure her mother and Anthony were happy together , and that was all she 's ever seen of marriage ."
But I thought when she told me of meeting this young man on the shore there was something in her look I 'd never noticed before -- as if she 'd found something in herself she 'd never known was there .
But she 'll never make friends with him and I ca n't .
"If the Captain was n't so queer -- '' She stopped abruptly , for a tall lithe figure was coming up from the shore ."
Lynde waved her hand as she drew near .
"`` Oh , Emily , I 've had such a splendid sail ."
It was glorious .
"Bad Emily , you 've been carrying water ."
Did n't I tell you never to do that when I was away ? ''
`` I did n't have to do it .
That young minister up at Rexton met me and brought it up .
"He 's nice , Lynde . ''"
Lynde 's brow darkened .
She turned and walked away to the house without a word .
On his way home that night Alan met Isabel King on the main shore road .
She carried an armful of pine boughs and said she wanted the needles for a cushion .
"Yet the thought came into Alan 's mind that she was spying on him and , although he tried to dismiss it as unworthy , it continued to lurk there ."
"For a week he avoided the shore , but there came a day when its inexplicable lure drew him to it again irresistibly ."
"It was a warm , windy evening and the air was sweet and resinous , the lake misty and blue ."
There was no sign of life about Four Winds and the shore seemed as lonely and virgin as if human foot had never trodden it .
"The Captain 's yacht was gone from the little harbour where it was generally anchored and , though every flutter of wind in the scrub firs made Alan 's heart beat expectantly , he saw nothing of Lynde Oliver ."
But I just want to say something that may help you over the worst when you hear that I 've gone ` west . '
"I 've a premonition about you , Rilla , as well as about myself ."
I think Ken will go back to you -- and that there are long years of happiness for you by-and-by .
"And you will tell your children of the Idea we fought and died for -- teach them it must be lived for as well as died for , else the price paid for it will have been given for nought ."
"This will be part of your work , Rilla ."
"And if you -- all you girls back in the homeland -- do it , then we who do n't come back will know that you have not ` broken faith ' with us ."
"`` I meant to write to Una tonight , too , but I wo n't have time now ."
"Read this letter to her and tell her it 's really meant for you both -- you two dear , fine loyal girls ."
"Tomorrow , when we go over the top -- I 'll think of you both -- of your laughter , Rilla-my-Rilla , and the steadfastness in Una 's blue eyes -- somehow I see those eyes very plainly tonight , too ."
"Yes , you 'll both keep faith -- I 'm sure of that -- you and Una ."
And so -- goodnight .
We go over the top at dawn . ''
Rilla read her letter over many times .
"There was a new light on her pale young face when she finally stood up , amid the asters Walter had loved , with the sunshine of autumn around her ."
"For the moment at least , she was lifted above pain and loneliness ."
"`` I will keep faith , Walter , '' she said steadily ."
"`` I will work -- and teach -- and learn -- and laugh , yes , I will even laugh -- through all my years , because of you and because of what you gave when you followed the call . ''"
Rilla meant to keep Walter 's letter as a a sacred treasure .
"But , seeing the look on Una Meredith 's face when Una had read it and held it back to her , she thought of something ."
Could she do it ?
"Oh , no , she could not give up Walter 's letter -- his last letter ."
Surely it was not selfishness to keep it .
A copy would be such a soulless thing .
"But Una -- Una had so little -- and her eyes were the eyes of a woman stricken to the heart , who yet must not cry out or ask for sympathy ."
"`` Una , would you like to have this letter -- to keep ? ''"
she asked slowly .
"`` Yes -- if you can give it to me , '' Una said dully ."
"`` Then -- you may have it , '' said Rilla hurriedly ."
"`` Thank you , '' said Una ."
"It was all she said , but there was something in her voice which repaid Rilla for her bit of sacrifice ."
Una took the letter and when Rilla had gone she pressed it against her lonely lips .
Una knew that love would never come into her life now -- it was buried for ever under the blood-stained soil `` Somewhere in France . ''
Your voice is like music and your eyes are like pansies when the dew is on them .
You are like a tall stately queen .
Your hair is like rippling gold .
"Anthony Pye says it is red , but you need n't pay any attention to Anthony . '' '"
I have only known you for a few months but I can not realize that there was ever a time when I did not know you ... when you had not come into my life to bless and hallow it .
I will always look back to this year as the most wonderful in my life because it brought you to me .
"Besides , it 's the year we moved to Avonlea from Newbridge ."
My love for you has made my life very rich and it has kept me from much of harm and evil .
"I owe this all to you , my sweetest teacher . '' '"
I shall never forget how sweet you looked the last time I saw you in that black dress with flowers in your hair .
"I shall see you like that for ever , even when we are both old and gray ."
"You will always be young and fair to me , dearest teacher ."
I am thinking of you all the time ... in the morning and at the noontide and at the twilight .
I love you when you laugh and when you sigh ... even when you look disdainful .
I never saw you look cross though Anthony Pye says you always look so but I do n't wonder you look cross at him for he deserves it .
I love you in every dress ... you seem more adorable in each new dress than the last . ''
"` Dearest teacher , good night ."
The sun has set and the stars are shining ... stars that are as bright and beautiful as your eyes .
"I kiss your hands and face , my sweet ."
May God watch over you and protect you from all harm . ''
"`` Your afecksionate pupil , '' ` Annetta Bell . ' ''"
`` This extraordinary letter puzzled me not a little .
I knew Annetta could n't have composed it any more than she could fly .
When I went to school the next day I took her for a walk down to the brook at recess and asked her to tell me the truth about the letter .
Annetta cried and ` fessed up freely .
"She said she had never written a letter and she did n't know how to , or what to say , but there was bundle of love letters in her mother 's top bureau drawer which had been written to her by an old ` beau . ' ''"
"` It was n't father , ' sobbed Annetta , ` it was someone who was studying for a minister , and so he could write lovely letters , but ma did n't marry him after all ."
She said she could n't make out what he was driving at half the time .
But I thought the letters were sweet and that I 'd just copy things out of them here and there to write you .
I put `` teacher '' where he put `` lady '' and I put in something of my own when I could think of it and I changed some words .
I put `` dress '' in place of `` mood . ''
I did n't know just what a `` mood '' was but I s ` posed it was something to wear .
And two years ago this morning I woke wondering what delightful gift the new day would give me .
These are the two years I thought would be filled with fun . ''
`` Would you exchange them -- now -- for two years filled with fun ? ''
"`` No , '' said Rilla slowly ."
`` I would n't .
It 's strange -- is n't it ?
"-- They have been two terrible years -- and yet I have a queer feeling of thankfulness for them -- as if they had brought me something very precious , with all their pain ."
"I would n't want to go back and be the girl I was two years ago , not even if I could ."
"Not that I think I 've made any wonderful progress -- but I 'm not quite the selfish , frivolous little doll I was then ."
"I suppose I had a soul then , Miss Oliver -- but I did n't know it ."
I know it now -- and that is worth a great deal -- worth all the suffering of the past two years .
"And still '' -- Rilla gave a little apologetic laugh , `` I do n't want to suffer any more -- not even for the sake of more soul growth ."
"At the end of two more years I might look back and be thankful for the development they had brought me , too ; but I do n't want it now . ''"
"`` We never do , '' said Miss Oliver ."
"`` That is why we are not left to choose our own means and measure of development , I suppose ."
No matter how much we value what our lessons have brought us we do n't want to go on with the bitter schooling .
"Well , let us hope for the best , as Susan says ; things are really going well now and if Rumania lines up , the end may come with a suddenness that will surprise us all . ''"
Rumania did come in -- and Susan remarked approvingly that its king and queen were the finest looking royal couple she had seen pictures of .
So the summer passed away .
Early in September word came that the Canadians had been shifted to the Somme front and anxiety grew tenser and deeper .
"For the first time Mrs. Blythe 's spirit failed her a little , and as the days of suspense wore on the doctor began to look gravely at her , and veto this or that special effort in Red Cross work ."
"`` Oh , let me work -- let me work , Gilbert , '' she entreated feverishly ."
`` While I 'm working I do n't think so much .
If I 'm idle I imagine everything -- rest is only torture for me .
My two boys are on the frightful Somme front -- and Shirley pores day and night over aviation literature and says nothing .
But I see the purpose growing in his eyes .
"No , I can not rest -- do n't ask it of me , Gilbert . ''"
But the doctor was inexorable .
"`` I ca n't let you kill yourself , Anne-girl , '' he said ."
`` When the boys come back I want a mother here to welcome them .
"Why , you 're getting transparent ."
It wo n't do -- ask Susan there if it will do . ''
"When he reached the scene of the accident he dreaded to look over the broken edge , but she was lying there safely and she smiled when she saw him -- a brave smile that softened her tense white face into the likeness of a frightened child 's ."
"`` If I drop the rope down to you , are you strong enough to hold to it while the earth goes and then draw yourself up the slope hand over hand ? ''"
asked Alan anxiously .
"`` Yes , '' she answered fearlessly ."
"Alan passed down one end of the rope and then braced himself firmly to hold it , for there was no tree near enough to be of any assistance ."
"The next moment the full weight of her body swung from it , for at her first movement the soil beneath her slipped away ."
Alan 's heart sickened ; what if she went with it ?
Could she cling to the rope while he drew her up ?
Then he saw she was still safe on the sloping shelf .
"Carefully and painfully she drew herself to her knees and , dinging to the rope , crept up the rock hand over hand ."
When she came within his reach he grasped her arms and lifted her up into safety beside him .
"`` Thank God , '' he said , with whiter lips than her own ."
"For a few moments Lynde sat silent on the sod , exhausted with fright and exertion , while her dog fawned on her in an ecstasy of joy ."
Finally she looked up into Alan 's anxious face and their eyes met .
It was something more than the physical reaction that suddenly flushed the girl 's cheeks .
She sprang lithely to her feet .
`` Can you walk back home ? ''
Alan asked .
"`` Oh , yes , I am all right now ."
It was very foolish of me to get into such a predicament .
Father and Emily went down the lake in the yacht this afternoon and I started out for a ramble .
When I came here I saw some junebells growing right out on the ledge and I crept out to gather them .
I should have known better .
"It broke away under me and the more I tried to scramble back the faster it slid down , carrying me with it ."
I thought it would go right over the brink '' -- she gave a little involuntary shudder -- `` but just at the very edge it stopped .
I knew I must lie very still or it would go right over .
It seemed like days .
"Pat was with me and I told him to go for help , but I knew there was no one at home -- and I was horribly afraid , '' she concluded with another shiver ."
`` I never was afraid in my life before -- at least not with that kind of fear . ''
"`` You have had a terrible experience and a narrow escape , '' said Alan lamely ."
He could think of nothing more to say ; his usual readiness of utterance seemed to have failed him .
"`` You saved my life , '' she said , `` you and Pat -- for doggie must have his share of credit . ''"
"But I have been going to see Madge Oliver for some time , and we are engaged ."
"We are thinking of being married this fall , and we hope you will not object . ''"
Burton 's frankness nearly took away his father 's breath .
Old John fairly choked with rage .
"`` You young fool , '' he spluttered , bringing down his hoe with such energy that he sliced off half a dozen of his finest young turnip plants , `` have you gone clean crazy ?"
"No , sir , I 'll never consent to your marrying an Oliver , and you need n't have any idea that I will . ''"
"`` Then I 'll marry her without your consent , '' retorted Burton angrily , losing the temper he had been trying to keep ."
"`` Oh , will you indeed !"
"Well , if you do , out you go , and not a cent of my money or a rod of my land do you ever get . ''"
`` What have you got against Madge ? ''
"asked Burton , forcing himself to speak calmly , for he knew his father too well to doubt for a minute that he meant and would do just what he said ."
"`` She 's an Oliver , '' said old John crustily , `` and that 's enough . ''"
"And considering that he had settled the matter , John Ellis threw down his hoe and left the field in a towering rage ."
Burton hoed away savagely until his anger had spent itself on the weeds .
"Give up Madge -- dear , sweet little Madge ?"
Not he !
"Yet if his father remained of the same mind , their marriage was out of the question at present ."
And Burton knew quite well that his father would remain of the same mind .
Old John Ellis had the reputation of being the most contrary man in Greenwood .
When Burton had finished his row he left the turnip field and went straight across lots to see Madge and tell her his dismal story .
"An hour later Miss Susan Oliver went up the stairs of her little brown house to Madge 's room and found her niece lying on the bed , her pretty curls tumbled , her soft cheeks flushed crimson , crying as if her heart would break ."
"Miss Susan was a tall , grim , angular spinster who looked like the last person in the world to whom a love affair might be confided ."
But never were appearances more deceptive than in this case .
"Behind her unprepossessing exterior Miss Susan had a warm , sympathetic heart filled to the brim with kindly affection for her pretty niece ."
She had seen Burton Ellis going moodily across the fields homeward and guessed that something had gone wrong .
"`` Now , dearie , what is the matter ? ''"
"she said , tenderly patting the brown head ."
Madge sobbed out the whole story disconsolately .
Burton 's father would not let him marry her because she was an Oliver .
"And , oh , what would she do ?"
"`` Do n't worry , Madge , '' said Miss Susan comfortingly ."
`` I 'll soon settle old John Ellis . ''
"said I , waving my cap ."
`` And there 's an end to Captain Silver ! ''
"He watched me keenly and slyly , his chin all the while on his breast ."
"`` I reckon , '' he said at last , `` I reckon , Cap'n Hawkins , you 'll kind of want to get ashore now ."
S'pose we talks . ''
"`` Why , yes , '' says I , `` with all my heart , Mr. Hands ."
Say on . ''
And I went back to my meal with a good appetite .
"`` This man , '' he began , nodding feebly at the corpse '' -- O'Brien were his name , a rank Irelander -- this man and me got the canvas on her , meaning for to sail her back ."
"Well , HE 'S dead now , he is -- as dead as bilge ; and who 's to sail this ship , I do n't see ."
"Without I gives you a hint , you ai n't that man , as far 's I can tell ."
"Now , look here , you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up , you do , and I 'll tell you how to sail her , and that 's about square all round , I take it . ''"
"`` I 'll tell you one thing , '' says I : `` I 'm not going back to Captain Kidd 's anchorage ."
I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there . ''
"`` To be sure you did , '' he cried ."
"`` Why , I ai n't sich an infernal lubber after all ."
"I can see , ca n't I ?"
"I 've tried my fling , I have , and I 've lost , and it 's you has the wind of me ."
North Inlet ?
"Why , I have n't no ch ` ice , not I !"
"I 'd help you sail her up to Execution Dock , by thunder !"
So I would . ''
"Well , as it seemed to me , there was some sense in this ."
We struck our bargain on the spot .
"In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailing easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island , with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as far as North Inlet before high water , when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land ."
"Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest , where I got a soft silk handkerchief of my mother 's ."
"With this , and with my aid , Hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh , and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy , he began to pick up visibly , sat straighter up , spoke louder and clearer , and looked in every way another man ."
The breeze served us admirably .
"We skimmed before it like a bird , the coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute ."
"Soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low , sandy country , sparsely dotted with dwarf pines , and soon we were beyond that again and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north ."
"I was greatly elated with my new command , and pleased with the bright , sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast ."
"I had now plenty of water and good things to eat , and my conscience , which had smitten me hard for my desertion , was quieted by the great conquest I had made ."
Her sunbonnet had fallen back and some loose tendrils of her auburn hair were curling around her forehead .
Her cheeks were so pink and her eyes so bright from running that she looked almost girlish .
"`` Oh , Mr. Harrington , '' she said breathlessly , `` that pet pig of Bobbles ' is in your garden again ."
He only got in this minute .
I saw him coming and I ran right after him . ''
"`` He 's there , all right , '' said Harrington cheerfully , `` but I 'll get him out in a jiffy ."
Do n't tire yourself .
Wo n't you go into the house and rest while I drive him around ? ''
"Mrs. Hayden , however , was determined to help and they both went around to the garden , set the gate open , and tried to drive the pig out ."
"But Harrington was not thinking about pigs , and Mrs. Hayden did not know quite so much about driving them as Mordecai did ; as a consequence they did not make much headway ."
"In her excitement Mrs. Hayden ran over beds and whatever came in her way , and Harrington , in order to keep near her , ran after her ."
Between them they spoiled things about as much as a whole drove of pigs would have done .
"But at last the pig grew tired of the fun , bolted out of the gate , and ran across the yard to his own place ."
Mrs. Hayden followed slowly and Harrington walked beside her .
"`` Those pigs are all to be shut up tomorrow , '' she said ."
`` Hiram has been fixing up a place for them in his spare moments and it is ready at last . ''
"`` Oh , I would n't , '' said Harrington hastily ."
`` It is n't good for pigs to be shut up so young .
You 'd better let them run a while yet . ''
"`` No , '' said Mrs. Hayden decidedly ."
`` They have almost worried me to death already .
In they go tomorrow . ''
"They were at the lane gate now , and Harrington had to open it and let her pass through ."
"He felt quite desperate as he watched her trip up through the rows of apple trees , her blue gingham skirt brushing the lush grasses where a lacy tangle of sunbeams and shadows lay ."
"Bobbles and Ted came running to meet her and the three , hand in hand , disappeared from sight ."
"Harrington went back to the house , feeling that life was flat , stale , and unprofitable ."
"That evening at the tea table he caught himself wondering what it would be like to see Mary Hayden sitting at his table in place of Sarah King , with Bobbles and Ted on either hand ."
Then he found out what was the matter with him .
"He was in love , fathoms deep , with the blue-eyed widow !"
"Presumably the pigs were shut up the next day , for Harrington 's garden was invaded no more ."
He stood it for a week and then surrendered at discretion .
"He filled a basket with early strawberries and went across to the Hayden place , boldly enough to all appearance , but with his heart thumping like any schoolboy 's ."
I began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates .
"When we got to the inn , the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated together , finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it , before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection ."
"Long John told the story from first to last , with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth ."
"`` That was how it were , now , were n't it , Hawkins ? ''"
"he would say , now and again , and I could always bear him entirely out ."
"The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away , but we all agreed there was nothing to be done , and after he had been complimented , Long John took up his crutch and departed ."
"`` All hands aboard by four this afternoon , '' shouted the squire after him ."
"`` Aye , aye , sir , '' cried the cook , in the passage ."
"`` Well , squire , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't put much faith in your discoveries , as a general thing ; but I will say this , John Silver suits me . ''"
"`` The man 's a perfect trump , '' declared the squire ."
"`` And now , '' added the doctor , `` Jim may come on board with us , may he not ? ''"
"`` To be sure he may , '' says squire ."
"`` Take your hat , Hawkins , and we 'll see the ship . ''"
"9 Powder and Arms THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out , and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships , and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel , and sometimes swung above us ."
"At last , however , we got alongside , and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate , Mr. Arrow , a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint ."
"He and the squire were very thick and friendly , but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain ."
"This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why , for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us ."
"`` Captain Smollett , sir , axing to speak with you , '' said he ."
`` I am always at the captain 's orders .
"Show him in , '' said the squire ."
"The captain , who was close behind his messenger , entered at once and shut the door behind him ."
"`` Well , Captain Smollett , what have you to say ?"
"All well , I hope ; all shipshape and seaworthy ? ''"
"`` Well , sir , '' said the captain , `` better speak plain , I believe , even at the risk of offence ."
I do n't like this cruise ; I do n't like the men ; and I do n't like my officer .
That 's short and sweet . ''
"`` Perhaps , sir , you do n't like the ship ? ''"
"inquired the squire , very angry , as I could see ."
"`` I ca n't speak as to that , sir , not having seen her tried , '' said the captain ."
`` She seems a clever craft ; more I ca n't say . ''
"`` Possibly , sir , you may not like your employer , either ? ''"
says the squire .
"`` I will get up at sunrise every morning of my life hereafter , '' exclaimed Murray rapturously , not meaning a syllable of it , but devoutly believing he did ."
Just as the fiery disc of the sun peered over the sand dunes Murray heard music that was not of the birds .
"It was a girl 's voice singing beyond the maples to his left -- a clear sweet voice , blithely trilling out the old-fashioned song , `` Five O'Clock in the Morning . ''"
`` Mrs. Palmer 's niece ! ''
Murray sprang to his feet and tiptoed cautiously through the maples .
He had heard so much from Mrs. Palmer about her niece that he felt reasonably well acquainted with her .
"Moreover , Mrs. Palmer had assured him that Mollie was a very pretty girl ."
Now a pretty girl milking cows at sunrise in the meadows sounded well .
Mrs. Palmer had not over-rated her niece 's beauty .
Murray said so to himself with a little whistle of amazement as he leaned unseen on the pasture fence and looked at the girl who was milking a placid Jersey less than ten yards away from him .
Murray 's artistic instinct responded to the whole scene with a thrill of satisfaction .
"He could see only her profile , but that was perfect , and the colouring of the oval cheek and the beautiful curve of the chin were something to adore ."
"Her hair , ruffled into lovable little ringlets by the morning wind , was coiled in glistening chestnut masses high on her bare head , and her arms , bare to the elbow , were as white as marble ."
"Presently she began to sing again , and this time Murray joined in ."
She half rose from her milking stool and cast a startled glance at the maples .
"Then she dropped back again and began to milk determinedly , but Murray could have sworn that he saw a demure smile hovering about her lips ."
"That , and the revelation of her full face , decided him ."
He sprang over the fence and sauntered across the intervening space of lush clover blossoms .
"`` Good morning , '' he said coolly ."
"He had forgotten her other name , and it did not matter ; at five o'clock in the morning people who met in dewy clover fields might disregard the conventionalities ."
`` Is n't it rather a large contract for you to be milking seven cows all alone ?
May I help you ? ''
Mollie looked up at him over her shoulder .
She had glorious grey eyes .
Her face was serene and undisturbed .
`` Can you milk ? ''
she asked .
"`` Unlikely as it may seem , I can , '' said Murray ."
"`` I have never confessed it to Mrs. Emory , because I was afraid she would inveigle me into milking her fourteen cows ."
But I do n't mind helping you .
I learned to milk when I was a shaver on my vacations at a grandfatherly farm .
May I have that extra pail ? ''
"He was a pale , tallowy creature , wanting two fingers of the left hand , and though he wore a cutlass , he did not look much like a fighter ."
"I had always my eye open for seafaring men , with one leg or two , and I remember this one puzzled me ."
"He was not sailorly , and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too ."
"I asked him what was for his service , and he said he would take rum ; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it , he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near ."
"I paused where I was , with my napkin in my hand ."
"`` Come here , sonny , '' says he ."
`` Come nearer here . ''
I took a step nearer .
`` Is this here table for my mate Bill ? ''
he asked with a kind of leer .
"I told him I did not know his mate Bill , and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain ."
"`` Well , '' said he , `` my mate Bill would be called the captain , as like as not ."
"He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him , particularly in drink , has my mate Bill ."
"We 'll put it , for argument like , that your captain has a cut on one cheek -- and we 'll put it , if you like , that that cheek 's the right one ."
"Ah , well !"
I told you .
"Now , is my mate Bill in this here house ? ''"
I told him he was out walking .
"`` Which way , sonny ?"
Which way is he gone ? ''
"And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return , and how soon , and answered a few other questions , `` Ah , '' said he , `` this 'll be as good as drink to my mate Bill . ''"
"The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant , and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken , even supposing he meant what he said ."
"But it was no affair of mine , I thought ; and besides , it was difficult to know what to do ."
"The stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door , peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse ."
"Once I stepped out myself into the road , but he immediately called me back , and as I did not obey quick enough for his fancy , a most horrible change came over his tallowy face , and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump ."
"As soon as I was back again he returned to his former manner , half fawning , half sneering , patted me on the shoulder , told me I was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me ."
"`` I have a son of my own , '' said he , `` as like you as two blocks , and he 's all the pride of my ` art ."
"But the great thing for boys is discipline , sonny -- discipline ."
"Now , if you had sailed along of Bill , you would n't have stood there to be spoke to twice -- not you ."
"That was never Bill 's way , nor the way of sich as sailed with him ."
"And here , sure enough , is my mate Bill , with a spy-glass under his arm , bless his old ` art , to be sure ."
"You and me 'll just go back into the parlour , sonny , and get behind the door , and we 'll give Bill a little surprise -- bless his ` art , I say again . ''"
"It looked strange enough , to see all this wealth in a nest upon a cliff-side , wattled about growing trees ."
"And even then , I thought it seemed deep water for Alan to be riding , who had no better battle-horse than a green purse and a matter of five pounds ."
"The luck , it seems , changed on the second day ."
"About noon I was wakened as usual for dinner , and as usual refused to eat , and was given a dram with some bitter infusion which the barber had prescribed ."
"The sun was shining in at the open door of the Cage , and this dazzled and offended me ."
"Cluny sat at the table , biting the pack of cards ."
"Alan had stooped over the bed , and had his face close to my eyes ; to which , troubled as they were with the fever , it seemed of the most shocking bigness ."
He asked me for a loan of my money .
`` What for ? ''
"said I. `` O , just for a loan , '' said he ."
`` But why ? ''
I repeated .
`` I do n't see . ''
"`` Hut , David ! ''"
"said Alan , `` ye wouldnae grudge me a loan ? ''"
"I would , though , if I had had my senses !"
"But all I thought of then was to get his face away , and I handed him my money ."
"On the morning of the third day , when we had been forty-eight hours in the Cage , I awoke with a great relief of spirits , very weak and weary indeed , but seeing things of the right size and with their honest , everyday appearance ."
"I had a mind to eat , moreover , rose from bed of my own movement , and as soon as we had breakfasted , stepped to the entry of the Cage and sat down outside in the top of the wood ."
"It was a grey day with a cool , mild air : and I sat in a dream all morning , only disturbed by the passing by of Cluny 's scouts and servants coming with provisions and reports ; for as the coast was at that time clear , you might almost say he held court openly ."
"When I returned , he and Alan had laid the cards aside , and were questioning a gillie ; and the chief turned about and spoke to me in the Gaelic ."
"`` I have no Gaelic , sir , '' said I ."
"Now since the card question , everything I said or did had the power of annoying Cluny ."
"`` Your name has more sense than yourself , then , '' said he angrily , `` for it 's good Gaelic ."
But the point is this .
"My scout reports all clear in the south , and the question is , have ye the strength to go ? ''"
"I saw cards on the table , but no gold ; only a heap of little written papers , and these all on Cluny 's side ."
"Alan , besides , had an odd look , like a man not very well content ; and I began to have a strong misgiving ."
"`` I do not know if I am as well as I should be , '' said I , looking at Alan ; `` but the little money we have has a long way to carry us . ''"
"Alan took his under-lip into his mouth , and looked upon the ground ."
"`` David , '' says he at last , `` I 've lost it ; there 's the naked truth . ''"
`` My money too ? ''
` It 's true I have n't lost a husband -- I have only lost the man who would have been my husband .
I have lost no son -- only the sons and daughters who might have been born to me -- who will never be born to me now . ' ''
"` It is n't ladylike to talk like that , ' said Cousin Sophia in a shocked tone ; and then Gertrude laughed right out , so wildly that Cousin Sophia was really frightened ."
"And when poor tortured Gertrude , unable to endure it any longer , hurried out of the room , Cousin Sophia asked mother if the blow had n't affected Miss Oliver 's mind . '' '"
"I suffered the loss of two good kind partners , ' she said , ` but it did not affect me like that . '"
`` I should think it would n't !
Those poor men must have been thankful to die .
`` I heard Gertrude walking up and down her room most of the night .
She walked like that every night .
But never so long as that night .
And once I heard her give a dreadful sudden little cry as if she had been stabbed .
I could n't sleep for suffering with her ; and I could n't help her .
I thought the night would never end .
But it did ; and then ` joy came in the morning ' as the Bible says .
Only it did n't come exactly in the morning but well along in the afternoon .
The telephone rang and I answered it .
"It was old Mrs. Grant speaking from Charlottetown , and her news was that it was all a mistake -- Robert was n't killed at all ; he had only been slightly wounded in the arm and was safe in the hospital out of harm 's way for a time anyhow ."
They had n't learned yet how the mistake had happened but supposed there must have been another Robert Grant .
`` I hung up the telephone and flew to Rainbow Valley .
I 'm sure I did fly -- I ca n't remember my feet ever touching the ground .
"I met Gertrude on her way home from school in the glade of spruces where we used to play , and I just gasped out the news to her ."
"I ought to have had more sense , of course ."
But I was so crazy with joy and excitement that I never stopped to think .
Gertrude just dropped there among the golden young ferns as if she had been shot .
The fright it gave me ought to make me sensible -- in this respect at least -- for the rest of my life .
I thought I had killed her -- I remembered that her mother had died very suddenly from heart failure when quite a young woman .
It seemed years to me before I discovered that her heart was still beating .
A pretty time I had !
"I never saw anybody faint before , and I knew there was nobody up at the house to help , because everybody else had gone to the station to meet Di and Nan coming home from Redmond ."
"But I knew -- theoretically -- how people in a faint should be treated , and now I know it practically ."
"Luckily the brook was handy , and after I had worked frantically over her for a while Gertrude came back to life ."
She never said one word about my news and I did n't dare to refer to it again .
"There 's nothing to do , child , except go and see Mr. Harrison about it ."
We can offer him our Jersey in exchange if he does n't want to take the money .
She is just as good as his . ''
"`` I 'm sure he 'll be awfully cross and disagreeable about it , though , '' moaned Anne ."
`` I daresay he will .
He seems to be an irritable sort of a man .
I 'll go and explain to him if you like . ''
"`` No , indeed , I 'm not as mean as that , '' exclaimed Anne ."
`` This is all my fault and I 'm certainly not going to let you take my punishment .
I 'll go myself and I 'll go at once .
"The sooner it 's over the better , for it will be terribly humiliating . ''"
Poor Anne got her hat and her twenty dollars and was passing out when she happened to glance through the open pantry door .
On the table reposed a nut cake which she had baked that morning ... a particularly toothsome concoction iced with pink icing and adorned with walnuts .
"Anne had intended it for Friday evening , when the youth of Avonlea were to meet at Green Gables to organize the Improvement Society ."
But what were they compared to the justly offended Mr. Harrison ?
"Anne thought that cake ought to soften the heart of any man , especially one who had to do his own cooking , and she promptly popped it into a box ."
She would take it to Mr. Harrison as a peace offering .
"`` That is , if he gives me a chance to say anything at all , '' she thought ruefully , as she climbed the lane fence and started on a short cut across the fields , golden in the light of the dreamy August evening ."
`` I know now just how people feel who are being led to execution . ''
"III Mr. Harrison at Home Mr. Harrison 's house was an old-fashioned , low-eaved , whitewashed structure , set against a thick spruce grove ."
"Mr. Harrison himself was sitting on his vineshaded veranda , in his shirt sleeves , enjoying his evening pipe ."
"When he realized who was coming up the path he sprang suddenly to his feet , bolted into the house , and shut the door ."
"This was merely the uncomfortable result of his surprise , mingled with a good deal of shame over his outburst of temper the day before ."
But it nearly swept the remnant of her courage from Anne 's heart .
"`` If he 's so cross now what will he be when he hears what I 've done , '' she reflected miserably , as she rapped at the door ."
"But Mr. Harrison opened it , smiling sheepishly , and invited her to enter in a tone quite mild and friendly , if somewhat nervous ."
"He had laid aside his pipe and donned his coat ; he offered Anne a very dusty chair very politely , and her reception would have passed off pleasantly enough if it had not been for the telltale of a parrot who was peering through the bars of his cage with wicked golden eyes ."
"No sooner had Anne seated herself than Ginger exclaimed , `` Bless my soul , what 's that redheaded snippet coming here for ? ''"
"It would be hard to say whose face was the redder , Mr. Harrison 's or Anne 's ."
"`` Do n't you mind that parrot , '' said Mr. Harrison , casting a furious glance at Ginger ."
`` He 's ... he 's always talking nonsense .
I got him from my brother who was a sailor .
Jem and Walter were yours but Shirley is mine .
And I can not bear to think of him flying -- his machine crashing down -- the life crushed out of his body -- the dear little body I nursed and cuddled when he was a wee baby . ''
"`` Susan -- do n't , '' cried Anne ."
"`` Oh , Mrs. Dr. dear , I beg your pardon ."
I ought not to have said anything like that out loud .
I sometimes forget that I resolved to be a heroine .
This -- this has shaken me a little .
But I will not forget myself again .
Only if things do not go as smoothly in the kitchen for a few days I hope you will make due allowance for me .
"At least , '' said poor Susan , forcing a grim smile in a desperate effort to recover lost standing , `` at least flying is a clean job ."
"He will not get so dirty and messed up as he would in the trenches , and that is well , for he has always been a tidy child . ''"
"So Shirley went -- not radiantly , as to a high adventure , like Jem , not in a white flame of sacrifice , like Walter , but in a cool , business-like mood , as of one doing something , rather dirty and disagreeable , that had just got to be done ."
"He kissed Susan for the first time since he was five years old , and said , `` Good-bye , Susan -- mother Susan . ''"
"`` My little brown boy -- my little brown boy , '' said Susan ."
"`` I wonder , '' she thought bitterly , as she looked at the doctor 's sorrowful face , `` if you remember how you spanked him once when he was a baby ."
I am thankful I have nothing like that on my conscience now . ''
The doctor did not remember the old discipline .
But before he put on his hat to go out on his round of calls he stood for a moment in the great silent living-room that had once been full of children 's laughter .
"`` Our last son -- our last son , '' he said aloud ."
"`` A good , sturdy , sensible lad , too ."
Always reminded me of my father .
I suppose I ought to be proud that he wanted to go -- I was proud when Jem went -- even when Walter went -- but ` our house is left us desolate . ' ''
"`` I have been thinking , doctor , '' old Sandy of the Upper Glen said to him that afternoon , `` that your house will be seeming very big the day . ''"
Highland Sandy 's quaint phrase struck the doctor as perfectly expressive .
Ingleside did seem very big and empty that night .
"Yet Shirley had been away all winter except for week-ends , and had always been a quiet fellow even when home ."
Was it because he had been the only one left that his going seemed to leave such a huge blank -- that every room seemed vacant and deserted -- that the very trees on the lawn seemed to be trying to comfort each other with caresses of freshly-budding boughs for the loss of the last of the little lads who had romped under them in childhood ?
Susan worked very hard all day and late into the night .
"When she had wound the kitchen clock and put Dr. Jekyll out , none too gently , she stood for a little while on the doorstep , looking down the Glen , which lay tranced in faint , silvery light from a sinking young moon ."
But Susan did not see the familiar hills and harbour .
She was looking at the aviation camp in Kingsport where Shirley was that night .
"`` He called me ` Mother Susan , ' '' she was thinking ."
`` And I wish I did n't have to go to sleep .
"It is hideous to go to sleep and forget it for a little while , and wake up and have it all rush over me anew the next morning ."
"Do people ever get used to things like this , Susan ?"
"And oh , Susan , I ca n't get away from what Mrs. Reese said ."
Did Walter suffer much -- he was always so sensitive to pain .
"Oh , Susan , if I knew that he did n't I think I could gather up a little courage and strength . ''"
This merciful knowledge was given to Rilla .
"A letter came from Walter 's commanding officer , telling them that he had been killed instantly by a bullet during a charge at Courcelette ."
The same day there was a letter for Rilla from Walter himself .
"Rilla carried it unopened to Rainbow Valley and read it there , in the spot where she had had her last talk with him ."
"It is a strange thing to read a letter after the writer is dead -- a bitter-sweet thing , in which pain and comfort are strangely mingled ."
"For the first time since the blow had fallen Rilla felt -- a different thing from tremulous hope and faith -- that Walter , of the glorious gift and the splendid ideals , still lived , with just the same gift and just the same ideals ."
That could not be destroyed -- these could suffer no eclipse .
"The personality that had expressed itself in that last letter , written on the eve of Courcelette , could not be snuffed out by a German bullet ."
"It must carry on , though the earthly link with things of earth were broken ."
"`` We 're going over the top tomorrow , Rilla-my-Rilla , '' wrote Walter ."
"`` I wrote mother and Di yesterday , but somehow I feel as if I must write you tonight ."
I had n't intended to do any writing tonight -- but I 've got to .
"Do you remember old Mrs. Tom Crawford over-harbour , who was always saying that it was ` laid on her ' to do such and such a thing ?"
"Well , that is just how I feel ."
"It 's ` laid on me ' to write you tonight -- you , sister and chum of mine ."
"There are some things I want to say before -- well , before tomorrow ."
`` You and Ingleside seem strangely near me tonight .
It 's the first time I 've felt this since I came .
Always home has seemed so far away -- so hopelessly far away from this hideous welter of filth and blood .
But tonight it is quite close to me -- it seems to me I can almost see you -- hear you speak .
And I can see the moonlight shining white and still on the old hills of home .
It has seemed to me ever since I came here that it was impossible that there could be calm gentle nights and unshattered moonlight anywhere in the world .
"But tonight somehow , all the beautiful things I have always loved seem to have become possible again -- and this is good , and makes me feel a deep , certain , exquisite happiness ."
"It must be autumn at home now -- the harbour is a-dream and the old Glen hills blue with haze , and Rainbow Valley a haunt of delight with wild asters blowing all over it -- our old `` farewell-summers . ''"
I always liked that name better than ` aster ' -- it was a poem in itself .
"`` Rilla , you know I 've always had premonitions ."
"When the Queen sees them doing this she signs to the servants to wash up and put away , and then everybody adjourns to the dance , the Queen walking in front while the Lord Chamberlain walks behind her , carrying two little pots , one of which contains the juice of wallflower and the other the juice of Solomon 's Seal ."
"Wallflower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit , and Solomon 's Seal juice is for bruises ."
"They bruise very easily , and when Peter plays faster and faster they foot it till they fall down in fits ."
"For , as you know without my telling you , Peter Pan is the fairies ' orchestra ."
"He sits in the middle of the ring , and they would never dream of having a smart dance nowadays without him ."
` P. P. ' is written on the corner of the invitation-cards sent out by all really good families .
"They are grateful little people , too , and at the princess 's coming-of-age ball -LRB- they come of age on their second birthday and have a birthday every month -RRB- they gave him the wish of his heart ."
-LSB- Illustration : When her Majesty wants to know the time -RSB- The way it was done was this .
"The Queen ordered him to kneel , and then said that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his heart ."
"Then they all gathered round Peter to hear what was the wish of his heart , but for a long time he hesitated , not being certain what it was himself ."
"` If I chose to go back to mother , ' he asked at last , ` could you give me that wish ? '"
"Now this question vexed them , for were he to return to his mother they should lose his music , so the Queen tilted her nose contemptuously and said , ` Pooh !"
ask for a much bigger wish than that . '
` Is that quite a little wish ? '
he inquired .
"` As little as this , ' the Queen answered , putting her hands near each other ."
` What size is a big wish ? '
he asked .
She measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length .
"Then Peter reflected and said , ` Well , then , I think I shall have two little wishes instead of one big one . '"
"Of course , the fairies had to agree , though his cleverness rather shocked them , and he said that his first wish was to go to his mother , but with the right to return to the Gardens if he found her disappointing ."
His second wish he would hold in reserve .
"They tried to dissuade him , and even put obstacles in the way . '"
"I can give you the power to fly to her house , ' the Queen said , ` but I ca n't open the door for you . '"
"` The window I flew out at will be open , ' Peter said confidently ."
` Mother always keeps it open in the hope that I may fly back . '
` How do you know ? '
"they asked , quite surprised , and , really , Peter could not explain how he knew . '"
"I just do know , ' he said ."
"So as he persisted in his wish , they had to grant it ."
"The way they gave him power to fly was this : They all tickled him on the shoulder , and soon he felt a funny itching in that part , and then up he rose higher and higher , and flew away out of the Gardens and over the housetops ."
"It was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his own home he skimmed away over St. Paul 's to the Crystal Palace and back by the river and Regent 's Park , and by the time he reached his mother 's window he had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird ."
"Then he would make her presents of his favourite toys -LRB- which he always took away from her next morning -RRB- , and she accepted them with a disturbing smile ."
The reason he was now become so wheedling and she so mysterious was -LRB- in brief -RRB- that they knew they were about to be sent to bed .
It was then that Maimie was terrible .
"Tony entreated her not to do it to-night , and the mother and their coloured nurse threatened her , but Maimie merely smiled her agitating smile ."
And by and by when they were alone with their night-light she would start up in bed crying ` Hsh !
what was that ? '
"Tony beseeches her , ` It was nothing -- do n't , Maimie , do n't ! '"
and pulls the sheet over his head .
` It is coming nearer ! '
she cries .
"` Oh , look at it , Tony !"
"It is feeling your bed with its horns -- it is boring for you , O Tony , oh ! '"
"and she desists not until he rushes downstairs in his combinations , screeching ."
"When they came up to whip Maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquilly -- not shamming , you know , but really sleeping , and looking like the sweetest little angel , which seems to me to make it almost worse ."
"But of course it was daytime when they were in the Gardens , and then Tony did most of the talking ."
"You could gather from his talk that he was a very brave boy , and no one was so proud of it as Maimie ."
She would have loved to have a ticket on her saying that she was his sister .
"And at no time did she admire him more than when he told her , as he often did with splendid firmness , that one day he meant to remain behind in the Gardens after the gates were closed . '"
"O Tony , ' she would say with awful respect , ` but the fairies will be so angry ! ' '"
"I dare say , ' replied Tony carelessly ."
"` Perhaps , ' she said , thrilling , ` Peter Pan will give you a sail in his boat ! ' '"
"I shall make him , ' replied Tony ; no wonder she was proud of him ."
"-LSB- Illustration : They all tickled him on the shoulder -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- But they should not have talked so loudly , for one day they were overheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves , from which the little people weave their summer curtains , and after that Tony was a marked boy ."
"They loosened the rails before he sat on them , so that down he came on the back of his head ; they tripped him up by catching his bootlace , and bribed the ducks to sink his boat ."
"Nearly all the nasty accidents you meet with in the Gardens occur because the fairies have taken an ill-will to you , and so it behoves you to be careful what you say about them ."
"Maimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing things , but Tony was not that kind , and when she asked him which day he was to remain behind in the Gardens after Lock-out he merely replied , ` Just some day ' ; he was quite vague about which day except when she asked , ` Will it be to-day ? '"
and then he could always say for certain that it would not be to-day .
So she saw that he was waiting for a real good chance .
"This brings us to an afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow , and there was ice on the Round Pond ; not thick enough to skate on , but at least you could spoil it for to-morrow by flinging stones , and many bright little boys and girls were doing that ."
"When Tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to the pond , but their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first , and as she said this she glanced at the time-board to see when the Gardens closed that night ."
It read half-past five .
Poor ayah !
We shall all go .
Selden was a man of his hands ; he was like a brother to me .
"Well , he has gone second ; well , we shall all follow !"
For what said their knave rhyme ?
-- ' A black arrow in each black heart . '
Was it not so it went ?
"Appleyard , Selden , Smith , old Humphrey gone ; and there lieth poor John Carter , crying , poor sinner , for the priest . ''"
Dick gave ear .
"Out of a low window , hard by where they were talking , groans and murmurs came to his ear ."
`` Lieth he there ? ''
he asked .
"`` Ay , in the second porter 's chamber , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` We could not bear him further , soul and body were so bitterly at odds ."
"At every step we lifted him , he thought to wend ."
"But now , methinks , it is the soul that suffereth ."
"Ever for the priest he crieth , and Sir Oliver , I wot not why , still cometh not ."
"`` Sir Daniel , '' he said , `` here is a right intricate affair , the which , with your good leave , it shall be mine to examine and adjust ."
"Content ye , then ; your business is in careful hands ; justice shall be done you ; and in the meanwhile , get ye incontinently home , and have your hurts attended ."
"The air is shrewd , and I would not ye took cold upon these scratches . ''"
"He made a sign with his hand ; it was passed down the nave by obsequious servants , who waited there upon his smallest gesture ."
"Instantly , without the church , a tucket sounded shrill , and through the open portal archers and men-at-arms , uniformly arrayed in the colours and wearing the badge of Lord Risingham , began to file into the church , took Dick and Lawless from those who still detained them , and , closing their files about the prisoners , marched forth again and disappeared ."
"As they were passing , Joanna held both her hands to Dick and cried him her farewell ; and the bridesmaid , nothing downcast by her uncle 's evident displeasure , blew him a kiss , with a `` Keep your heart up , lion-driver ! ''"
that for the first time since the accident called up a smile to the faces of the crowd .
"CHAPTER V -- EARL RISINGHAM Earl Risingham , although by far the most important person then in Shoreby , was poorly lodged in the house of a private gentleman upon the extreme outskirts of the town ."
"Nothing but the armed men at the doors , and the mounted messengers that kept arriving and departing , announced the temporary residence of a great lord ."
"Thus it was that , from lack of space , Dick and Lawless were clapped into the same apartment ."
"`` Well spoken , Master Richard , '' said the outlaw ; `` it was excellently well spoken , and , for my part , I thank you cordially ."
"Here we are in good hands ; we shall be justly tried , and , some time this evening , decently hanged on the same tree . ''"
"`` Indeed , my poor friend , I do believe it , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Yet have we a string to our bow , '' returned Lawless ."
"`` Ellis Duckworth is a man out of ten thousand ; he holdeth you right near his heart , both for your own and for your father 's sake ; and knowing you guiltless of this fact , he will stir earth and heaven to bear you clear . ''"
"`` It may not be , '' said Dick ."
"Then the dirty-handed society went off the wash , followed by the Professor , trying to calm the anxiety of Rob , who had been told by Tommy that all water was full of invisible pollywogs ."
"`` I like your plan very much , only do n't be too generous , Teddy , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , when they were left alone ."
"`` You know most of the boys have got to paddle their own canoes when they leave us , and too much sitting in the lap of luxury will unfit them for it . ''"
"`` I 'll be moderate , but do let me amuse myself ."
"I get desperately tired of business sometimes , and nothing freshens me up like a good frolic with your boys ."
"I like that Dan very much , Jo ."
"He is n't demonstrative ; but he has the eye of a hawk , and when you have tamed him a little he will do you credit . ''"
`` I 'm so glad you think so .
"Thank you very much for your kindness to him , especially for this museum affair ; it will keep him happy while he is lame , give me a chance to soften and smooth this poor , rough lad , and make him love us ."
"What did inspire you with such a beautiful , helpful idea , Teddy ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Bhaer , glancing back at the pleasant room , as she turned to leave it ."
"Laurie took both her hands in his , and answered , with a look that made her eyes fill with happy tears , `` Dear Jo !"
"I have known what it is to be a motherless boy , and I never can forget how much you and yours have done for me all these years . ''"
CHAPTER XII .
"HUCKLEBERRIES There was a great clashing of tin pails , much running to and fro , and frequent demands for something to eat , one August afternoon , for the boys were going huckleberrying , and made as much stir about it as if they were setting out to find the North West Passage ."
"`` Now , my lads , get off as quietly as you can , for Rob is safely out of the way , and wo n't see you , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , as she tied Daisy 's broad-brimmed hat , and settled the great blue pinafore in which she had enveloped Nan ."
"But the plan did not succeed , for Rob had heard the bustle , decided to go , and prepared himself , without a thought of disappointment ."
"The troop was just getting under way when the little man came marching downstairs with his best hat on , a bright tin pail in his hand , and a face beaming with satisfaction ."
"`` Oh , dear !"
"now we shall have a scene , '' sighed Mrs. Bhaer , who found her eldest son very hard to manage at times ."
"`` I 'm all ready , '' said Rob , and took his place in the ranks with such perfect unconsciousness of his mistake , that it really was very hard to undeceive him ."
"`` It 's too far for you , my love ; stay and take care of me , for I shall be all alone , '' began his mother ."
`` You 've got Teddy .
"I 'm a big boy , so I can go ; you said I might when I was bigger , and I am now , '' persisted Rob , with a cloud beginning to dim the brightness of his happy face ."
"`` We are going up to the great pasture , and it 's ever so far ; we do n't want you tagging on , '' cried Jack , who did not admire the little boys ."
"`` I wo n't tag , I 'll run and keep up ."
O Mamma !
let me go !
"I want to fill my new pail , and I 'll bring 'em all to you ."
"Please , please , I will be good ! ''"
"prayed Robby , looking up at his mother , so grieved and disappointed that her heart began to fail her ."
"`` But , my deary , you 'll get so tired and hot you wo n't have a good time ."
"Mrs. Milton White says she never met a perfect person , but she 's heard enough about one ... her husband 's first wife ."
Do n't you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married to a man whose first wife was perfect ? ''
"`` It would be more uncomfortable to be married to the perfect wife , '' declared Mr. Harrison , with a sudden and inexplicable warmth ."
"When tea was over Anne insisted on washing the dishes , although Mr. Harrison assured her that there were enough in the house to do for weeks yet ."
"She would dearly have loved to sweep the floor also , but no broom was visible and she did not like to ask where it was for fear there was n't one at all ."
"`` You might run across and talk to me once in a while , '' suggested Mr. Harrison when she was leaving . ''"
'T is n't far and folks ought to be neighborly .
I 'm kind of interested in that society of yours .
Seems to me there 'll be some fun in it .
Who are you going to tackle first ? ''
"`` We are not going to meddle with PEOPLE ... it is only PLACES we mean to improve , '' said Anne , in a dignified tone ."
She rather suspected that Mr. Harrison was making fun of the project .
"When she had gone Mr. Harrison watched her from the window ... a lithe , girlish shape , tripping lightheartedly across the fields in the sunset afterglow ."
"`` I 'm a crusty , lonesome , crabbed old chap , '' he said aloud , `` but there 's something about that little girl makes me feel young again ... and it 's such a pleasant sensation I 'd like to have it repeated once in a while . ''"
"`` Redheaded snippet , '' croaked Ginger mockingly ."
Mr. Harrison shook his fist at the parrot .
"`` You ornery bird , '' he muttered , `` I almost wish I 'd wrung your neck when my brother the sailor brought you home ."
Will you never be done getting me into trouble ? ''
"Anne ran home blithely and recounted her adventures to Marilla , who had been not a little alarmed by her long absence and was on the point of starting out to look for her ."
"`` It 's a pretty good world , after all , is n't it , Marilla ? ''"
concluded Anne happily .
`` Mrs. Lynde was complaining the other day that it was n't much of a world .
She said whenever you looked forward to anything pleasant you were sure to be more or less disappointed ... perhaps that is true .
But there is a good side to it too .
The bad things do n't always come up to your expectations either ... they nearly always turn out ever so much better than you think .
I looked forward to a dreadfully unpleasant experience when I went over to Mr. Harrison 's tonight ; and instead he was quite kind and I had almost a nice time .
"I think we 're going to be real good friends if we make plenty of allowances for each other , and everything has turned out for the best ."
"But all the same , Marilla , I shall certainly never again sell a cow before making sure to whom she belongs ."
And I do NOT like parrots ! ''
"IV Different Opinions One evening at sunset , Jane Andrews , Gilbert Blythe , and Anne Shirley were lingering by a fence in the shadow of gently swaying spruce boughs , where a wood cut known as the Birch Path joined the main road ."
"Jane had been up to spend the afternoon with Anne , who walked part of the way home with her ; at the fence they met Gilbert , and all three were now talking about the fateful morrow ; for that morrow was the first of September and the schools would open ."
Jane would go to Newbridge and Gilbert to White Sands .
`` I knew it !
"Bring the child to me , and do n't fret ."
"I 'll see to him , and next time you do as I say , '' was the consoling welcome she received as the old lady popped up a sleepy but anxious face in a large flannel cap , and shook the bottle with the air of a general who had routed the foe before and meant to do it again ."
"Leaving her little responsibility in Miss Bat 's arms , Molly retired to wet her pillow with a few remorseful tears , and to fall asleep , wondering if real missionaries ever killed their pupils in the process of conversion ."
"So the girls all failed in the beginning ; but they did not give up , and succeeded better next time , as we shall see ."
Chapter IX .
"The Debating Club `` Look here , old man , we ought to have a meeting ."
"Holidays are over , and we must brace up and attend to business , '' said Frank to Gus , as they strolled out of the schoolyard one afternoon in January , apparently absorbed in conversation , but in reality waiting for a blue cloud and a scarlet feather to appear on the steps ."
`` All right .
"When , where , and what ? ''"
"asked Gus , who was a man of few words ."
"`` To-night , our house , subject , ` Shall girls go to college with us ? '"
"Mother said we had better be making up our minds , because every one is talking about it , and we shall have to be on one side or the other , so we may as well settle it now , '' answered Frank , for there was an impression among the members that all vexed questions would be much helped by the united eloquence and wisdom of the club ."
`` Very good ; I 'll pass the word and be there .
"Hullo , Neddy !"
"The D.C. meets to-night , at Minot 's , seven sharp ."
"Co-ed , & c. , '' added Gus , losing no time , as a third boy came briskly round the corner , with a little bag in his hand ."
`` I 'll come .
"Got home an hour earlier to-night , and thought I 'd look you up as I went by , '' responded Ed Devlin , as he took possession of the third post , with a glance toward the schoolhouse to see if a seal-skin cap , with a long , yellow braid depending therefrom , was anywhere in sight ."
"`` Very good of you , I 'm sure , '' said Gus , ironically , not a bit deceived by this polite attention ."
"`` The longest way round is sometimes the shortest way home , hey , Ed ? ''"
and Frank gave him a playful poke that nearly sent him off his perch .
"Then they all laughed at some joke of their own , and Gus added , `` No girls coming to hear us to-night ."
"Do n't think it , my son ."
"`` More 's the pity , '' and Ed shook his head regretfully over the downfall of his hopes ."
"`` Ca n't help it ; the other fellows say they spoil the fun , so we have to give in , sometimes , for the sake of peace and quietness ."
"Do n't mind having them a bit myself , '' said Frank , in such a tone of cheerful resignation that they laughed again , for the `` Triangle , '' as the three chums were called , always made merry music ."
`` We must have a game party next week .
"The girls like that , and so do I , '' candidly observed Gus , whose pleasant parlors were the scene of many such frolics ."
"`` And so do your sisters and your cousins and your aunts , '' hummed Ed , for Gus was often called Admiral because he really did possess three sisters , two cousins , and four aunts , besides mother and grandmother , all living in the big house together ."
"The boys promptly joined in the popular chorus , and other voices all about the yard took it up , for the `` Pinafore '' epidemic raged fearfully in Harmony Village that winter ."
`` How 's business ? ''
"One , tailing out behind the rest , was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey 's ; the rest were revenue officers , whom he had met by the way , and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once ."
"Some news of the lugger in Kitt 's Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction , and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death ."
"Pew was dead , stone dead ."
"As for my mother , when we had carried her up to the hamlet , a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again , and she was none the worse for her terror , though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money ."
"In the meantime the supervisor rode on , as fast as he could , to Kitt 's Hole ; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle , leading , and sometimes supporting , their horses , and in continual fear of ambushes ; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way , though still close in ."
He hailed her .
"A voice replied , telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him , and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm ."
"Soon after , the lugger doubled the point and disappeared ."
"Mr. Dance stood there , as he said , `` like a fish out of water , '' and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B -- to warn the cutter ."
"`` And that , '' said he , `` is just about as good as nothing ."
"They 've got off clean , and there 's an end ."
"Only , '' he added , `` I 'm glad I trod on Master Pew 's corns , '' for by this time he had heard my story ."
"I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow , and you can not imagine a house in such a state of smash ; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself ; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain 's money-bag and a little silver from the till , I could see at once that we were ruined ."
Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene .
"`` They got the money , you say ?"
"Well , then , Hawkins , what in fortune were they after ?"
"More money , I suppose ? ''"
"`` No , sir ; not money , I think , '' replied I. `` In fact , sir , I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket ; and to tell you the truth , I should like to get it put in safety . ''"
"`` To be sure , boy ; quite right , '' said he ."
"`` I 'll take it , if you like . ''"
`` I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey -- '' I began .
"`` Perfectly right , '' he interrupted very cheerily , `` perfectly right -- a gentleman and a magistrate ."
"And , now I come to think of it , I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire ."
"Master Pew 's dead , when all 's done ; not that I regret it , but he 's dead , you see , and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty 's revenue , if make it out they can ."
"Now , I 'll tell you , Hawkins , if you like , I 'll take you along . ''"
"I thanked him heartily for the offer , and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were ."
By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle .
"`` Dogger , '' said Mr. Dance , `` you have a good horse ; take up this lad behind you . ''"
"As soon as I was mounted , holding on to Dogger 's belt , the supervisor gave the word , and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey 's house ."
6 The Captain 's Papers WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey 's door .
The house was all dark to the front .
"Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock , and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by ."
"`` Nicely ; she is getting quite mannerly , and begins to see the error of her wild ways . ''"
`` Do n't the boys encourage her in them ? ''
"`` Yes ; but I keep talking , and lately she has improved much ."
"You saw how prettily she shook hands with you , and how gentle she was with Bess ."
"Daisy 's example has its effect upon her , and I 'm quite sure that a few months will work wonders . ''"
"Here Mrs. Jo 's remarks were cut short by the appearance of Nan tearing round the corner at a break-neck pace , driving a mettlesome team of four boys , and followed by Daisy trundling Bess in a wheelbarrow ."
"Hat off , hair flying , whip cracking , and barrow bumping , up they came in a cloud of dust , looking as wild a set of little hoydens as one would wish to see ."
"`` So , these are the model children , are they ?"
"It 's lucky I did n't bring Mrs. Curtis out to see your school for the cultivation of morals and manners ; she would never have recovered from the shock of this spectacle , '' said Mr. Laurie , laughing at Mrs. Jo 's premature rejoicing over Nan 's improvement ."
`` Laugh away ; I 'll succeed yet .
"As you used to say at College , quoting some professor , ` Though the experiment has failed , the principle remains the same , ' '' said Mrs. Bhaer , joining in the merriment ."
"`` I 'm afraid Nan 's example is taking effect upon Daisy , instead of the other way ."
Look at my little princess !
"she has utterly forgotten her dignity , and is screaming like the rest ."
"Young ladies , what does this mean ? ''"
"and Mr. Laurie rescued his small daughter from impending destruction , for the four horses were champing their bits and curvetting madly all about her , as she sat brandishing a great whip in both hands ."
"`` We 're having a race , and I beat , '' shouted Nan ."
"`` I could have run faster , only I was afraid of spilling Bess , '' screamed Daisy ."
`` Hi !
go long ! ''
"cried the princess , giving such a flourish with her whip that the horses ran away , and were seen no more ."
`` My precious child !
come away from this ill-mannered crew before you are quite spoilt .
"Good-by , Jo !"
"Next time I come , I shall expect to find the boys making patchwork . ''"
`` It would n't hurt them a bit .
"I do n't give in , mind you ; for my experiments always fail a few times before they succeed ."
"Love to Amy and my blessed Marmee , '' called Mrs. Jo , as the carriage drove away ; and the last Mr. Laurie saw of her , she was consoling Daisy for her failure by a ride in the wheelbarrow , and looking as if she liked it ."
"Great was the excitement all the week about the repairs in the carriage-house , which went briskly on in spite of the incessant questions , advice , and meddling of the boys ."
"Old Gibbs was nearly driven wild with it all , but managed to do his work nevertheless ; and by Friday night the place was all in order roof mended , shelves up , walls whitewashed , a great window cut at the back , which let in a flood of sunshine , and gave them a fine view of the brook , the meadows , and the distant hills ; and over the great door , painted in red letters , was `` The Laurence Museum . ''"
"All Saturday morning the boys were planning how it should be furnished with their spoils , and when Mr. Laurie arrived , bringing an aquarium which Mrs. Amy said she was tired of , their rapture was great ."
"The afternoon was spent in arranging things , and when the running and lugging and hammering was over , the ladies were invited to behold the institution ."
"`` The Russians are doing splendidly , however , and they have saved Italy ."
But even when the daily news of their sweeping advance comes we do n't feel like running up the flag as we used to do .
"As Gertrude says , Verdun has slain all exultation ."
We would all feel more like rejoicing if the victories were on the western front .
` When will the British strike ? '
Gertrude sighed this morning .
` We have waited so long -- so long . '
`` Our greatest local event in recent weeks was the route march the county battalion made through the county before it left for overseas .
"They marched from Charlottetown to Lowbridge , then round the Harbour Head and through the Upper Glen and so down to the St. Mary station ."
"Everybody turned out to see them , except old Aunt Fannie Clow , who is bedridden and Mr. Pryor , who had n't been seen out even in church since the night of the Union Prayer Meeting the previous week ."
`` It was wonderful and heartbreaking to see that battalion marching past .
There were young men and middle-aged men in it .
"There was Laurie McAllister from over-harbour who is only sixteen but swore he was eighteen , so that he could enlist ; and there was Angus Mackenzie , from the Upper Glen who is fifty-five if he is a day and swore he was forty-four ."
"There were two South African veterans from Lowbridge , and the three eighteen-year-old Baxter triplets from Harbour Head ."
"Everybody cheered as they went by , and they cheered Foster Booth , who is forty , walking side by side with his son Charley who is twenty ."
"Charley 's mother died when he was born , and when Charley enlisted Foster said he 'd never yet let Charley go anywhere he dare n't go himself , and he did n't mean to begin with the Flanders trenches ."
At the station Dog Monday nearly went out of his head .
He tore about and sent messages to Jem by them all .
Mr. Meredith read an address and Reta Crawford recited ` The Piper . '
"The soldiers cheered her like mad and cried ` We 'll follow -- we 'll follow -- we wo n't break faith , ' and I felt so proud to think that it was my dear brother who had written such a wonderful , heart-stirring thing ."
And then I looked at the khaki ranks and wondered if those tall fellows in uniform could be the boys I 've laughed with and played with and danced with and teased all my life .
Something seems to have touched them and set them apart .
They have heard the Piper 's call .
"`` Fred Arnold was in the battalion and I felt dreadfully about him , for I realized that it was because of me that he was going away with such a sorrowful expression ."
I could n't help it but I felt as badly as if I could .
"`` The last evening of his leave Fred came up to Ingleside and told me he loved me and asked me if I would promise to marry him some day , if he ever came back ."
He was desperately in earnest and I felt more wretched than I ever did in my life .
"I could n't promise him that -- why , even if there was no question of Ken , I do n't care for Fred that way and never could -- but it seemed so cruel and heartless to send him away to the front without any hope of comfort ."
"I cried like a baby ; and yet -- oh , I am afraid that there must be something incurably frivolous about me , because , right in the middle of it all , with me crying and Fred looking so wild and tragic , the thought popped into my head that it would be an unendurable thing to see that nose across from me at the breakfast table every morning of my life ."
"There , that is one of the entries I would n't want my descendants to read in this journal ."
But it is the humiliating truth ; and perhaps it 's just as well that thought did come or I might have been tricked by pity and remorse into giving him some rash assurance .
If Fred 's nose were as handsome as his eyes and mouth some such thing might have happened .
"Wait till I go , and then we will stay all day , and pick as many berries as you want . ''"
"`` You never do go , you are so busy , and I 'm tired of waiting ."
I 'd rather go and get the berries for you all myself .
"I love to pick 'em , and I want to fill my new pail dreffly , '' sobbed Rob ."
"The pathetic sight of great tears tinkling into the dear new pail , and threatening to fill it with salt water instead of huckleberries , touched all the ladies present ."
"His mother patted the weeper on his back ; Daisy offered to stay home with him ; and Nan said , in her decided way , `` Let him come ; I 'll take care of him . ''"
"`` If Franz was going I would n't mind , for he is very careful ; but he is haying with the father , and I 'm not sure about the rest of you , '' began Mrs. Bhaer ."
"`` It 's so far , '' put in Jack ."
"`` I 'd carry him if I was going wish I was , '' said Dan , with a sigh ."
"`` Thank you , dear , but you must take care of your foot ."
I wish I could go .
"Stop a minute , I think I can manage it after all ; '' and Mrs. Bhaer ran out to the steps , waving her apron wildly ."
"Silas was just driving away in the hay-cart , but turned back , and agreed at once , when Mrs. Jo proposed that he should take the whole party to the pasture , and go for them at five o'clock ."
"`` It will delay your work a little , but never mind ; we will pay you in huckleberry pies , '' said Mrs. Jo , knowing Silas 's weak point ."
"His rough , brown face brightened up , and he said , with a cheery `` Haw !"
haw ! ''
"`` Wal now , Mis ' Bhaer , if you go to bribin ' of me , I shall give in right away . ''"
"`` Now , boys , I have arranged it so that you can all go , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , running back again , much relieved , for she loved to make them happy , and always felt miserable when she had disturbed the serenity of her little sons ; for she believed that the small hopes and plans and pleasures of children should be tenderly respected by grown-up people , and never rudely thwarted or ridiculed ."
`` Can I go ? ''
"said Dan , delighted ."
`` I thought especially of you .
"Be careful , and never mind the berries , but sit about and enjoy the lovely things which you know how to find all about you , '' answered Mrs. Bhaer , who remembered his kind offer to her boy ."
`` Me too !
me too ! ''
"sung Rob , dancing with joy , and clapping his precious pail and cover like castanets ."
"`` Yes , and Daisy and Nan must take good care of you ."
"Be at the bars at five o'clock , and Silas will come for you all . ''"
"Robby cast himself upon his mother in a burst of gratitude , promising to bring her every berry he picked , and not eat one ."
"Then they were all packed into the hay-cart , and went rattling away , the brightest face among the dozen being that of Rob , as he sat between his two temporary little mothers , beaming upon the whole world , and waving his best hat ; for his indulgent mamma had not the heart to bereave him of it , since this was a gala-day to him ."
"Such a happy afternoon as they had , in spite of the mishaps which usually occur on such expeditions !"
"Of course Tommy came to grief , tumbled upon a hornet 's nest and got stung ; but being used to woe , he bore the smart manfully , till Dan suggested the application of damp earth , which much assuaged the pain ."
"Daisy saw a snake , and flying from it lost half her berries ; but Demi helped her to fill up again , and discussed reptiles most learnedly the while ."
"Emil went to bed sick , and Dan was an unpleasant spectacle for a week ."
"But the lawless lad had no thought of obeying , and soon transgressed again ."
"One Saturday afternoon as a party of the boys went out to play , Tommy said , `` Let 's go down to the river , and cut a lot of new fish-poles . ''"
"`` Take Toby to drag them back , and one of us can ride him down , '' proposed Stuffy , who hated to walk ."
"`` That means you , I suppose ; well , hurry up , lazy-bones , '' said Dan ."
"Away they went , and having got the poles were about to go home , when Demi unluckily said to Tommy , who was on Toby with a long rod in his hand , `` You look like the picture of the man in the bull-fight , only you have n't got a red cloth , or pretty clothes on . ''"
"`` I 'd like to see one ; there 's old Buttercup in the big meadow , ride at her , Tom , and see her run , '' proposed Dan , bent on mischief ."
"`` No , you must n't , '' began Demi , who was learning to distrust Dan 's propositions ."
"`` Why not , little fuss-button ? ''"
demanded Dan .
`` I do n't think Uncle Fritz would like it . ''
`` Did he ever say we must not have a bull-fight ? ''
"`` No , I do n't think he ever did , '' admitted Demi ."
`` Then hold your tongue .
"Drive on , Tom , and here 's a red rag to flap at the old thing ."
"I 'll help you to stir her up , '' and over the wall went Dan , full of the new game , and the rest followed like a flock of sheep ; even Demi , who sat upon the bars , and watched the fun with interest ."
"Poor Buttercup was not in a very good mood , for she had been lately bereft of her calf , and mourned for the little thing most dismally ."
"Just now she regarded all mankind as her enemies -LRB- and I do not blame her -RRB- , so when the matadore came prancing towards her with the red handkerchief flying at the end of his long lance , she threw up her head , and gave a most appropriate `` Moo ! ''"
"Tommy rode gallantly at her , and Toby recognizing an old friend , was quite willing to approach ; but when the lance came down on her back with a loud whack , both cow and donkey were surprised and disgusted ."
"Toby back with a bray of remonstrance , and Buttercup lowered her horns angrily ."
"`` At her again , Tom ; she 's jolly cross , and will do it capitally ! ''"
"called Dan , coming up behind with another rod , while Jack and Ned followed his example ."
"Seeing herself thus beset , and treated with such disrespect , Buttercup trotted round the field , getting more and more bewildered and excited every moment , for whichever way she turned , there was a dreadful boy , yelling and brandishing a new and very disagreeable sort of whip ."
"It was great fun for them , but real misery for her , till she lost patience and turned the tables in the most unexpected manner ."
"All at once she wheeled short round , and charged full at her old friend Toby , whose conduct cut her to the heart ."
"Poor slow Toby backed so precipitately that he tripped over a stone , and down went horse , matadore , and all , in one ignominious heap , while distracted Buttercup took a surprising leap over the wall , and galloped wildly out of sight down the road ."
"`` Catch her , stop her , head her off !"
"run , boys , run ! ''"
"shouted Dan , tearing after her at his best pace , for she was Mr. Bhaer 's pet Alderney , and if anything happened to her , Dan feared it would be all over with him ."
Such a running and racing and bawling and puffing as there was before she was caught !
"The fish-poles were left behind ; Toby was trotted nearly off his legs in the chase ; and every boy was red , breathless , and scared ."
"They found poor Buttercup at last in a flower garden , where she had taken refuge , worn out with the long run ."
I 'm all right .
"Do n't squeeze the breath out of me , please , '' expostulated Jack , looking so startled and innocent , as he struggled feebly , that they all laughed , and this plaintive protest caused him to be released ."
"But the next proceeding did not enlighten him much , for Frank kept waving a very inky paper before him and ordering him to read it , while Mamma made a charge at Jill , as if it was absolutely necessary to hug somebody ."
`` Hullo ! ''
"said Jack , when he got the letter into his own hand and read it ."
`` Now who put Bob up to this ?
"Nobody had any business to interfere -- but it 's mighty good of him , anyway , '' he added , as the anxious lines in his round face smoothed themselves away , while a smile of relief told how hard it had been for him to keep his word ."
`` I did ! ''
"cried Jill , clapping her hands , and looking so happy that he could not have scolded her if he had wanted to ."
`` Who told you he was in the scrape ? ''
"demanded Jack , in a hurry to know all about it now the seal was taken off his own lips ."
"`` You did ; '' and Jill 's face twinkled with naughty satisfaction , for this was the best fun of all ."
`` I did n't !
When ?
Where ?
It 's a joke ! ''
"`` You did , '' cried Jill , pointing to the rug ."
"`` You went to sleep there after the long walk , and talked in your sleep about ` Bob ' and ` All right , old boy , ' and ever so much gibberish ."
"I did n't think about it then , but when I heard that Bob was up there I thought may be he knew something about it , and last night I wrote and asked him , and that 's the answer , and now it is all right , and you are the best boy that ever was , and I 'm so glad ! ''"
"Here Jill paused , all out of breath , and Frank said , with an approving pat on the head , -- `` It wo n't do to have such a sharp young person round if we are going to have secrets ."
"You 'd make a good detective , miss . ''"
`` Catch me taking naps before people again ; '' and Jack looked rather crestfallen that his own words had set `` Fine Ear '' on the track .
"`` Never mind , I did n't mean to tell , though I just ached to do it all the time , so I have n't broken my word ."
"I 'm glad you all know , but you need n't let it get out , for Bob is a good fellow , and it might make trouble for him , '' added Jack , anxious lest his gain should be the other 's loss ."
"`` I shall tell Mr. Acton myself , and the Captain , also , for I 'm not going to have my son suspected of wrong-doing when he has only tried to help a friend , and borne enough for his sake , '' said Mamma , much excited by this discovery of generous fidelity in her boy ; though when one came to look at it calmly , one saw that it might have been done in a wiser way ."
"`` Now , please , do n't make a fuss about it ; that would be most as bad as having every one down on me ."
"I can stand your praising me , but I wo n't be patted on the head by anybody else ; '' and Jack assumed a manly air , though his face was full of genuine boyish pleasure at being set right in the eyes of those he loved ."
"`` I 'll be discreet , dear , but you owe it to yourself , as well as Bob , to have the truth known ."
"Both have behaved well , and no harm will come to him , I am sure ."
"I 'll see to that myself , '' said Mrs. Minot , in a tone that set Jack 's mind at rest on that point ."
"`` Now do tell all about it , '' cried Jill , who was pining to know the whole story , and felt as if she had earned the right to hear it ."
"`` Oh , it was n't much ."
"Tommy in bed , Teddy wheezing like a little grampus , Mrs. Jo quite used up , and the whole flock of boys so excited that they all talked at once , and almost dragged him by main force to view the ruins ."
"Under his quiet management things soon fell into order , for every one felt that he was equal to a dozen conflagrations , and worked with a will at whatever task he gave them ."
"There was no school that morning , but by afternoon the damaged room was put to rights , the invalids were better , and there was time to hear and judge the little culprits quietly ."
"Nat and Tommy told their parts in the mischief , and were honestly sorry for the danger they had brought to the dear old house and all in it ."
"But Dan put on his devil-may-care look , and would not own that there was much harm done ."
"Now , of all things , Mr. Bhaer hated drinking , gambling , and swearing ; smoking he had given up that the lads might not be tempted to try it , and it grieved and angered him deeply to find that the boy , with whom he had tried to be most forbearing , should take advantage of his absence to introduce these forbidden vices , and teach his innocent little lads to think it manly and pleasant to indulge in them ."
"He talked long and earnestly to the assembled boys , and ended by saying , with an air of mingled firmness and regret , `` I think Tommy is punished enough , and that scar on his arm will remind him for a long time to let these things alone ."
"Nat 's fright will do for him , for he is really sorry , and does try to obey me ."
"But you , Dan , have been many times forgiven , and yet it does no good ."
"I can not have my boys hurt by your bad example , nor my time wasted in talking to deaf ears , so you can say good-bye to them all , and tell Nursey to put up your things in my little black bag . ''"
`` Oh !
"sir , where is he going ? ''"
cried Nat .
"`` To a pleasant place up in the country , where I sometimes send boys when they do n't do well here ."
"Mr. Page is a kind man , and Dan will be happy there if he chooses to do his best . ''"
`` Will he ever come back ? ''
asked Demi .
`` That will depend on himself ; I hope so . ''
"As he spoke , Mr. Bhaer left the room to write his letter to Mr. Page , and the boys crowded round Dan very much as people do about a man who is going on a long and perilous journey to unknown regions ."
"`` I wonder if you 'll like it , '' began Jack ."
"`` Sha n't stay if I do n't , '' said Dan coolly ."
`` Where will you go ? ''
asked Nat .
"`` I may go to sea , or out west , or take a look at California , '' answered Dan , with a reckless air that quite took away the breath of the little boys ."
"`` Oh , do n't !"
"stay with Mr. Page awhile and then come back here ; do , Dan , '' pleaded Nat , much affected at the whole affair ."
"`` I do n't care where I go , or how long I stay , and I 'll be hanged if I ever come back here , '' with which wrathful speech Dan went away to put up his things , every one of which Mr. Bhaer had given him ."
"That was the only good-bye he gave the boys , for they were all talking the matter over in the barn when he came down , and he told Nat not to call them ."
"The wagon stood at the door , and Mrs. Bhaer came out to speak to Dan , looking so sad that his heart smote him , and he said in a low tone , `` May I say good-bye to Teddy ? ''"
"`` Yes , dear ; go in and kiss him , he will miss his Danny very much . ''"
"No one saw the look in Dan 's eyes as he stooped over the crib , and saw the little face light up at first sight of him , but he heard Mrs. Bhaer say pleadingly , `` Ca n't we give the poor lad one more trial , Fritz ? ''"
"and Mr. Bhaer answer in his steady way , `` My dear , it is not best , so let him go where he can do no harm to others , while they do good to him , and by and by he shall come back , I promise you . ''"
"I frolicked in the park with dogs , sailed boats in the Back Bay with strange boys , dined with a little Irish beggar-girl on salt fish and potatoes , and was found at last fast asleep on a door-step with my arms round a great dog ."
"It was late in the evening , and I was a dirty as a little pig , and the new shoes were worn out I had travelled so far . ''"
`` How nice ! ''
"cried Nan , looking all ready to go and do it herself ."
`` It was not nice next day ; '' and Mrs. Jo tried to keep her eyes from betraying how much she enjoyed the memory of her early capers .
`` Did your mother whip you ? ''
"asked Nan , curiously ."
"`` She never whipped me but once , and then she begged my pardon , or I do n't think I ever should have forgiven her , it hurt my feelings so much . ''"
`` Why did she beg your pardon ?
my father do n't . ''
"`` Because , when she had done it , I turned round and said , ` Well , you are mad yourself , and ought to be whipped as much as me . '"
"She looked at me a minute , then her anger all died out , and she said , as if ashamed , ` You are right , Jo , I am angry ; and why should I punish you for being in a passion when I set you such a bad example ?"
"Forgive me , dear , and let us try to help one another in a better way . '"
"I never forgot it , and it did me more good than a dozen rods . ''"
"Nan sat thoughtfully turning the little cold-cream jar for a minute , and Mrs. Jo said nothing , but let that idea get well into the busy little mind that was so quick to see and feel what went on about her ."
"`` I like that , '' said Nan , presently , and her face looked less elfish , with its sharp eyes , inquisitive nose , and mischievous mouth ."
`` What did your mother do to you when you ran away that time ? ''
"`` She tied me to the bed-post with a long string , so that I could not go out of the room , and there I stayed all day with the little worn-out shoes hanging up before me to remind me of my fault . ''"
"`` I should think that would cure anybody , '' cried Nan , who loved her liberty above all things ."
"`` It did cure me , and I think it will you , so I am going to try it , '' said Mrs. Jo , suddenly taking a ball of strong twine out of a drawer in her work-table ."
"Nan looked as if she was decidedly getting the worst of the argument now , and sat feeling much crestfallen while Mrs. Jo tied one end round her waist and the other to the arm of the sofa , saying , as she finished , `` I do n't like to tie you up like a naughty little dog , but if you do n't remember any better than a dog , I must treat you like one . ''"
"`` I 'd just as lief be tied up as not I like to play dog ; '' and Nan put on a do n't - care face , and began to growl and grovel on the floor ."
"Mrs. Jo took no notice , but leaving a book or two and a handkerchief to hem , she went away , and left Miss Nan to her own devices ."
"This was not agreeable , and after sitting a moment she tried to untie the cord ."
"But it was fastened in the belt of her apron behind , so she began on the knot at the other end ."
"It soon came loose , and , gathering it up , Nan was about to get out of the window , when she heard Mrs. Jo say to somebody as she passed through the hall , `` No , I do n't think she will run away now ; she is an honorable little girl , and knows that I do it to help her . ''"
"In a minute , Nan whisked back , tied herself up , and began to sew violently ."
"Rob came in a moment after , and was so charmed with the new punishment , that he got a jump-rope and tethered himself to the other arm of the sofa in the most social manner ."
"`` I got lost too , so I ought to be tied up as much as Nan , '' he explained to his mother when she saw the new captive ."
"`` I 'm not sure that you do n't deserve a little punishment , for you knew it was wrong to go far away from the rest . ''"
"`` Nan took me , '' began Rob , willing to enjoy the novel penalty , but not willing to take the blame ."
`` You need n't have gone .
But that 's past praying for ; and ye must lie on your bed the way ye made it .
And the point in hand is just this : what did ye pay him ? ''
`` Has he tauld ye himsel ' ? ''
asked my uncle .
"`` That 's my concern , '' said Alan ."
"`` Weel , '' said my uncle , `` I dinnae care what he said , he leed , and the solemn God 's truth is this , that I gave him twenty pound ."
"But I 'll be perfec ` ly honest with ye : forby that , he was to have the selling of the lad in Caroliny , whilk would be as muckle mair , but no from my pocket , ye see . ''"
"`` Thank you , Mr. Thomson ."
"That will do excellently well , '' said the lawyer , stepping forward ; and then mighty civilly , `` Good-evening , Mr. Balfour , '' said he ."
"And , `` Good-evening , Uncle Ebenezer , '' said I. And , `` It 's a braw nicht , Mr. Balfour , '' added Torrance ."
"Never a word said my uncle , neither black nor white ; but just sat where he was on the top door-step and stared upon us like a man turned to stone ."
"Alan filched away his blunderbuss ; and the lawyer , taking him by the arm , plucked him up from the doorstep , led him into the kitchen , whither we all followed , and set him down in a chair beside the hearth , where the fire was out and only a rush-light burning ."
"There we all looked upon him for a while , exulting greatly in our success , but yet with a sort of pity for the man 's shame ."
"`` Come , come , Mr. Ebenezer , '' said the lawyer , `` you must not be down-hearted , for I promise you we shall make easy terms ."
"In the meanwhile give us the cellar key , and Torrance shall draw us a bottle of your father 's wine in honour of the event . ''"
"Then , turning to me and taking me by the hand , `` Mr. David , '' says he , `` I wish you all joy in your good fortune , which I believe to be deserved . ''"
"And then to Alan , with a spice of drollery , `` Mr. Thomson , I pay you my compliment ; it was most artfully conducted ; but in one point you somewhat outran my comprehension ."
Do I understand your name to be James ?
or Charles ?
"or is it George , perhaps ? ''"
"`` And why should it be any of the three , sir ? ''"
"quoth Alan , drawing himself up , like one who smelt an offence ."
"`` Only , sir , that you mentioned a king 's name , '' replied Rankeillor ; `` and as there has never yet been a King Thomson , or his fame at least has never come my way , I judged you must refer to that you had in baptism . ''"
"This was just the stab that Alan would feel keenest , and I am free to confess he took it very ill ."
"Not a word would he answer , but stepped off to the far end of the kitchen , and sat down and sulked ; and it was not till I stepped after him , and gave him my hand , and thanked him by title as the chief spring of my success , that he began to smile a bit , and was at last prevailed upon to join our party ."
"By that time we had the fire lighted , and a bottle of wine uncorked ; a good supper came out of the basket , to which Torrance and I and Alan set ourselves down ; while the lawyer and my uncle passed into the next chamber to consult ."
"They stayed there closeted about an hour ; at the end of which period they had come to a good understanding , and my uncle and I set our hands to the agreement in a formal manner ."
"By the terms of this , my uncle bound himself to satisfy Rankeillor as to his intromissions , and to pay me two clear thirds of the yearly income of Shaws ."
"So the beggar in the ballad had come home ; and when I lay down that night on the kitchen chests , I was a man of means and had a name in the country ."
"Alan and Torrance and Rankeillor slept and snored on their hard beds ; but for me who had lain out under heaven and upon dirt and stones , so many days and nights , and often with an empty belly , and in fear of death , this good change in my case unmanned me more than any of the former evil ones ; and I lay till dawn , looking at the fire on the roof and planning the future ."
"CHAPTER XXX GOOD-BYE So far as I was concerned myself , I had come to port ; but I had still Alan , to whom I was so much beholden , on my hands ; and I felt besides a heavy charge in the matter of the murder and James of the Glens ."
"On both these heads I unbosomed to Rankeillor the next morning , walking to and fro about six of the clock before the house of Shaws , and with nothing in view but the fields and woods that had been my ancestors ' and were now mine ."
"""I think,"" remarked a Red-headed Woodpecker, ""that I have the best wing feathers now that I ever had. They seem to be a little longer, and they hook together so well. I almost wish I were going South to try them on a long journey."""
"""Mr. Woodpecker's wing feathers are certainly excellent,"" said his wife, who was always glad to see him well dressed. ""I am sure that the strongest wind will never part them. I don't see how the Owls can stand it to wear their feathers unhooked so that some of the air passes through their wings each time they flap them. It must make flying hard."""
"""Well, if you were an Owl you would understand,"" chuckled the Crow. ""If their great wings were like ours, the noise of their flying would scare every creature within hearing, and there would not be much fun in hunting."""
"And so they chatted on, while from the meadow came the sound of the happy insects piping in the sunshine. It was chilly now at night and in the early morning, and they could give concerts only at noonday. The next day the Wild Turkeys came and there was great excitement in the forest. The Squirrels were busier than ever storing up all the acorns that they could before the newcomers reached the oak trees; and the Blue Jays were so jealous of the Turkeys that they overate every day for fear there would not be enough to go around. As though there were any danger!"
"The Ground Hog was getting so sleepy now that he would doze off while people were talking to him, and then he would suddenly straighten up and say: ""Yes, yes, yes! Don't think that I was asleep, please. The colors of the trees are so bright that they tire my eyes and I sometimes close them."" The dear old fellow really never knew how he had been nodding."
"The Snakes, too, were growing dull and slow of motion, while the Bats talked freely of hanging themselves up for the winter. The Grouse and Quail made daily trips to the edges of the grain-fields, and found rich picking among the stubble. You could almost fancy that they came home each night fatter than when they went away in the morning."
"Life went on in this way for many days, and the birds had all stopped singing. There were no more happy concerts at sunrise and no more carols at evening; only chirrupings and twitterings as the feathered people hopped restlessly from one perch to another. All could see that they were busily thinking and had no time for music. The truth was that each bird who was not to spend the winter in the Forest felt as though something were drawing drawing drawing him southward. It was something they could not see or hear, and yet it was drawing drawing drawing all day and all night. They spoke of it often to each other, and the older birds told the young ones how, before long, they would all start South, and fly over land and water until they reached their winter home."
"""How do we know where to go?"" asked the children."
"""All that you have to do,"" the older ones said, ""is to follow us."""
"""And how do you know?"" they asked."
"""Why, we have been there before,"" they answered; ""and we can see the places over which we pass. But perhaps that is not the real reason, for sometimes we fly over such great stretches of water that we can see nothing else and it all looks alike. Then we cannot see which way to go, but still we feel that we are drawn South, and we only have to think about that and fly onward. The fathers and sons can fly the faster and will reach there first. The mothers and daughters come a few days later."
"We never make a mistake."""
"""It is wonderful, wonderful,"" thought a young Rabbit on the grass below."
"""I must watch them when they go."""
"The very next morning the Forest People awakened to find a silvery frost on the grass and feel the still air stirred by the soft dropping of damp red, brown, and yellow leaves from the trees. Over the river and all the lowland near it hung a heavy veil of white mist."
"""It is time!"" whispered the Robins to each other."
"""It is time!"" cooed the Mourning Doves."
"""It is time!"" cried the Cowbirds in their hoarse voices."
"All through the forest there was restlessness and quiet haste. The Juncoes had already come from the cold northland and were resting from their long flight. The Ground Hogs, the Rabbits, and the Squirrels were out to say good-by. The Owls peeped from their hollow trees, shading their eyes from the strong light of the sun. And then the travellers went. The Robins started in family parties. The Mourning Doves slipped quietly away. The Cowbirds went in a dashing crowd. And the Crows, after much talking and disputing on the tree-tops, took a noisy farewell of the few members of the flock who were to remain behind, and, joining other flocks from the North, flew off in a great company which darkened the sky and caused a shadow to pass over the stubble-field almost like that of a summer cloud."
"""They are gone!"" sighed the Ground Hog and his wife. ""We shall miss them sadly. Well, we can dream about them, and that will be a comfort."""
"""Jay! Jay!"" shrieked a handsome-crested fellow from the tree above."
"""What if they are gone? They will be back in the spring, and we have plenty to eat. What is the use of feeling sad? Jay! Jay!"""
"But all people are not so heartless as the hungry Blue Jays, and the song-birds had many loving friends who missed them and longed for their return."
THE RUFFED GROUSE'S STORY
"The Ruffed Grouse cocked his crested head on one side and looked up through the bare branches to the sky. It was a soft gray, and in the west were banks of bluish clouds. ""I think it will snow very soon,"" said he. ""Mrs. Grouse, are the children all ready for cold weather?"""
"""All ready,"" answered his cheerful little wife. ""They have had their thickest feathers on for quite a while. The Rabbits were saying the other day that they had never seen a plumper or better clothed flock than ours."" And her beautiful golden-brown eyes shone with pride as she spoke."
"Indeed, the young Ruffed Grouse were a family of whom she might well be proud. Twelve healthy and obedient children do not fall to the lot of every Forest mother, and she wished with a sad little sigh that her other two eggs had hatched. She often thought of them with longing. How lovely it would have been to have fourteen children! But at that moment her brood came crowding around her in fright."
"""Some cold white things,"" they said, ""came tumbling down upon us and scared us. The white things didn't say a word, but they came so fast that we think they must be alive. Tell us what to do. Must we hide?"""
"""Why, that is snow!"" exclaimed their mother. ""It drops from the clouds up yonder quite as the leaves drop from the trees in the fall. It will not hurt you, but we must find shelter."""
"""What did I tell you, Mrs Grouse?"" asked her husband. ""I was certain that it would snow before night. I felt it in my quills."" And Mr. Grouse strutted with importance. It always makes one feel so very knowing when he has told his wife exactly what will happen."
"""How did you feel it in your quills?"" asked one of his children. ""Shall I feel it in my quills when I am as old as you are?"""
"What tangles they did get into! Each little Rabbit had four legs, two short ones in front, and two long ones behind to help him take long jumps from one place to another. So, you see, there were twenty-eight legs there, pushing, catching in the hay, kicking, and sometimes just waving in the air when their tiny owners chanced to roll over on their backs and couldn't get right side up again. Then Mamma Rabbit would come and poke them this way and that, never hurting any of them, but getting the nest in order."
"""It is a great deal of work to pick up after children,"" she would say with a tired little sigh, ""but it will not be long before they have homes of their own and are doing the same thing."""
"Mamma Rabbit was quite right when she said that, for all of their people set up housekeeping when very young, and then the cares of life begin."
"One fine morning when the children were alone in their burrow, the biggest little Rabbit had a queer feeling in his face, below and in front of his long ears, and above his eager little nose. It almost scared him at first, for he had never before felt anything at all like it. Then he guessed what it meant. There were two bunchy places on his face, that Mamma Rabbit had told him were eyes. ""When you are older,"""
"she had said to him, ""these eyes will open, and then you will see."" For the Rabbit children are always blind when they are babies."
"When his mother told him that, the biggest little Rabbit had said, ""What do you mean when you say I shall 'see'? Is it anything like eating?"""
"And Mamma Rabbit said, ""No, you cannot taste things until you touch them, but you can see them when they are far away."""
"""Then it is like smelling,"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""No, it is not like smelling, either, for there are many things, like stones, which one cannot smell and yet can see."""
"""Then it surely is like hearing,"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Oh dear!"" exclaimed his mother, who was tired of having questions asked which could not be answered. ""It is not a bit like hearing. You could never hear a black cloud coming across the sky, but you could see it if you were outside your burrow. Nobody can make you understand what seeing is until your eyes are open, and then you will find out for yourself without asking."""
"This made the biggest little Rabbit lie still for a while, and then he said: ""What is a black cloud, and why does it come across the sky? And what is the sky, and why does it let the cloud come? And what is "" But he did not get any answer, for his mother ran out of the burrow as fast as she could."
"And now his eyes were surely opening and he should see! His tiny heart thumped hard with excitement, and he rubbed his face with his forepaws to make his eyes open faster. Ah! There it was; something round and bright at the other end of the burrow, and some queer, slender things were waving across it. He wondered if it were good to eat, but he dared not crawl toward it to see. He did not know that the round, bright thing was just a bit of sky which he saw through the end of the burrow, and that the slender, waving ones were the branches of a dead tree tossing in the wind. Then he looked at his brothers and sisters as they lay beside him. He would not have known what they were if he had not felt of them at the same time."
"""I can see!"" he cried. ""I can see everything that there is to see! I'm ahead of you! Don't you wish that you could see, too?"""
"That was not a very kind thing to say, but in a minute more his brothers and sisters had reason to be glad that they couldn't see. Even while he was speaking and looking toward the light, he saw a brown head with two round eyes look in at him, and then a great creature that he thought must surely be a dog ran in toward him. How frightened he was then! He pushed his nose in among his blind brothers and sisters and tried to hide himself among them. He thought something dreadful was about to happen."
"""I wish Mamma Rabbit would come,"" he squeaked, shutting his eyes as closely as he could. ""I wish Mamma Rabbit would come."""
"""Why, here I am,"" she answered. ""What are you afraid of?"""
"The biggest little Rabbit opened his eyes, and there was the creature who had frightened him so, and it was his own mother! You can imagine how glad she was to see that one of her children had his eyes open."
"""I will call in some of my Rabbit friends,"" she said, ""and let you see them, if you will promise not to be afraid."""
"The next day four of the other little Rabbits had their eyes open, and the day after that they all could see each other and the shining piece of sky at the end of the burrow. It was not so very long afterward that the Rabbit family went out to dine in the forest, and this was the first time that the children had seen their father. Often when their mother left them alone in the burrow she had pulled grass and leaves over the opening to hide it from him, for Rabbit fathers do not love their children until they are old enough to go out into the great world, and it would never do for them to know where their babies are kept. Then their father taught them how to gnaw tough bark to wear their teeth down, for Rabbits' teeth grow all the time, and if they were to eat only soft food, their teeth would get too long. He taught them, too, how to move their ears in the right way for keen hearing, and told them that when chased they must run for the burrow or the nearest thicket. ""Then crouch down on some leaves that are the color of your fur,"" he said, ""and you may not be seen at all."""
"""Why should we run?"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Because you might be caught if you didn't."""
"""What might catch us?"" asked the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Oh, a Hawk, perhaps, or a Weasel."""
"""What does a Hawk look like?"""
"""Like a great bird floating in the sky,"" said Papa Rabbit. ""Now, don't ask me a single question more."""
"""Does a Hawk look like that bird above us?"" asked the biggest little Rabbit."
"His father gave one look upward. ""Yes!"" he said. ""Run!"""
"And just as the Hawk swooped down toward the ground, he saw nine white-tipped tails disappear into a burrow near by."
THE LITTLE BAT WHO WOULDN'T GO TO BED
"""Come,"" said Mamma Bat, flying toward her home in the cave, ""it is time that you children went to bed. The eastern sky is growing bright, and I can see the fleecy clouds blush rosy red as the sun looks at them."""
"In the white lily bloom, Brave boy, is thy tomb.”"
"When the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste. When the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a dog. Then the King said, “What God does, is well done!” But a fisherman who dwelt near the water fished the little boy out again while he was still alive, and as his wife had no children, they reared him. When a year had gone by, the King again went away, and the Queen had another little boy, whom the false sisters likewise took and threw into the water. Then up flew a little bird again and sang,"
"“To thy death art thou sped, Until God’s word be said."
"In the white lily bloom, Brave boy, is thy tomb.”"
"And when the King came back, they told him that the Queen had once more given birth to a dog, and he again said, “What God does, is well done.”"
"The fisherman, however, fished this one also out of the water, and reared him."
"Then the King again journeyed forth, and the Queen had a little girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the water. Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang,"
“To thy death art thou sped Until God’s word be said.
"In the white lily bloom, Bonny girl, is thy tomb.”"
"And when the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a cat. Then the King grew angry, and ordered his wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up for many long years."
"In the meantime the children had grown up. Then eldest once went out with some other boys to fish, but the other boys would not have him with them, and said, “Go thy way, foundling.”"
"Hereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if that was true? The fisherman told him that once when he was fishing he had drawn him out of the water. So the boy said he would go forth and seek his father. The fisherman, however, entreated him to stay, but he would not let himself be hindered, and at last the fisherman consented. Then the boy went on his way and walked for many days, and at last he came to a great piece of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing."
"“Good day, mother,” said the boy."
"“Many thanks,” said she."
“Thou wilt fish long enough before thou catchest anything.”
“And thou wilt seek long enough before thou findest thy father. How wilt thou get over the water?” said the woman.
“God knows.”
"Then the old woman took him up on her back and carried him through it, and he sought for a long time, but could not find his father."
"When a year had gone by, the second boy set out to seek his brother. He came to the water, and all fared with him just as with his brother. And now there was no one at home but the daughter, and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last she also begged the fisherman to let her set forth, for she wished to go in search of her brothers. Then she likewise came to the great piece of water, and she said to the old woman, “Good day, mother.”"
"“Many thanks,” replied the old woman."
"“May God help you with your fishing,” said the maiden. When the old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried her over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her, “Go, my daughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a great black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without either laughing or looking at it. Then you will come to a great high castle, on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall, and go straight through the castle, and out again on the other side. There you will see an old fountain out of which a large tree has grown, whereon hangs a bird in a cage which you must take down. Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain, and with these two things go back by the same way. Pick up the wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and when you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it, but be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me.” The maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said, and on her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each other over half the world. They went together to the place where the black dog was lying on the road; she struck it in the face, and it turned into a handsome prince who went with them to the river. There the old woman was still standing. She rejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the water, and then she too went away, for now she was freed. The others, however, went to the old fisherman, and all were glad that they had found each other again, but they hung the bird on the wall."
"But the second son could not settle at home, and took his cross-bow and went a-hunting. When he was tired he took his flute, and made music."
"The King was hunting too, and heard that and went thither, and when he met the youth, he said, “Who has given thee leave to hunt here?”"
"“Oh, no one.”"
"“To whom dost thou belong, then?”"
“I am the fisherman’s son.”
“But he has no children.”
"“If thou wilt not believe, come with me.”"
"That the King did, and questioned the fisherman, who told everything to him, and the little bird on the wall began to sing,"
"“The mother sits alone There in the prison small, O King of royal blood, These are thy children all."
"The sisters twain so false, They wrought the children woe, There in the waters deep Where the fishermen come and go.”"
"Then they were all terrified, and the King took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again. She had, however, grown quite ill and weak. Then the daughter gave her some of the water of the fountain to drink, and she became strong and healthy. But the two false sisters were burnt, and the daughter married the prince."
"Well they all said there could be but one voice and will as to that, and when Halvor heard that he wasn't long in throwing off his beggar's rags, and arraying himself as bridegroom."
"""Aye, aye, here is the right one after all,"" said the youngest Princess as soon as she saw him, and so she tossed the other one out of the window, and held her wedding with Halvor."
THE GIANT WHO HAD NO HEART IN HIS BODY
"Once on a time there was a King who had seven sons, and he loved them so much that he could never bear to be without them all at once, but one must always be with him. Now, when they were grown up, six were to set off to woo, but as for the youngest, his father kept him at home, and the others were to bring back a princess for him to the palace. So the King gave the six the finest clothes you ever set eyes on, so fine that the light gleamed from them a long way off, and each had his horse, which cost many, many hundred pounds, and so they set off. Now, when they had been to many palaces, and seen many princesses, at last they came to a King who had six daughters; such lovely king's daughters they had never seen, and so they fell to wooing them, each one, and when they had got them for sweethearts, they set off home again, but they quite forgot that they were to bring back with them a sweetheart for Boots, their brother, who stayed at home, for they were over head and ears in love with their own sweethearts."
"But when they had gone a good bit on their way, they passed close by a steep hill-side, like a wall, where the Giant's house was, and there the Giant came out, and set his eyes upon them, and turned them all into stone, princes and princesses and all. Now the King waited and waited for his six sons, but the more he waited, the longer they stayed away; so he fell into great trouble, and said he should never know what it was to be glad again."
"""And if I had not you left,"" he said to Boots, ""I would live no longer, so full of sorrow am I for the loss of your brothers."""
"""Well, but now I've been thinking to ask your leave to set out and find them again; that's what I'm thinking of,"" said Boots."
"""Nay, nay!"" said his father; ""that leave you shall never get, for then you would stay away too."""
"But Boots had set his heart upon it; go he would; and he begged and prayed so long that the King was forced to let him go. Now, you must know the King had no other horse to give Boots but an old broken-down jade, for his six other sons and their train had carried off all his horses; but Boots did not care a pin for that, he sprang up on his sorry old steed."
"""Farewell, father,"" said he; ""I'll come back, never fear, and like enough I shall bring my six brothers back with me;"" and with that he rode off."
"So, when he had ridden a while, he came to a Raven, which lay in the road and flapped its wings, and was not able to get out of the way, it was so starved."
"""Oh, dear friend,"" said the Raven, ""give me a little food, and I'll help you again at your utmost need."""
"""I haven't much food,"" said the Prince, ""and I don't see how you'll ever be able to help me much; but still I can spare you a little. I see you want it."""
So he gave the raven some of the food he had brought with him.
"Now, when he had gone a bit further, he came to a brook, and in the brook lay a great Salmon, which had got upon a dry place and dashed itself about, and could not get into the water again."
"""Oh, dear friend,"" said the Salmon to the Prince; ""shove me out into the water again, and I'll help you again at your utmost need."""
"""Well!"" said the Prince, ""the help you'll give me will not be great, I daresay, but it's a pity you should lie there and choke;"" and with that he shot the fish out into the stream again."
"After that he went a long, long way, and there met him a Wolf which was so famished that it lay and crawled along the road on its belly."
"""Dear friend, do let me have your horse,"" said the Wolf; ""I'm so hungry the wind whistles through my ribs; I've had nothing to eat these two years."""
"""No,"" said Boots, ""this will never do; first I came to a raven, and I was forced to give him my food; next I came to a salmon, and him I had to help into the water again; and now you will have my horse. It can't be done, that it can't, for then I should have nothing to ride on."""
"""Nay, dear friend, but you can help me,"" said Graylegs the wolf; ""you can ride upon my back, and I'll help you again in your utmost need."""
"""Well! the help I shall get from you will not be great, I'll be bound,"" said the Prince; ""but you may take my horse, since you are in such need."""
"So when the Wolf had eaten the horse, Boots took the bit and put it into the Wolf's jaw, and laid the saddle on his back; and now the Wolf was so strong, after what he had got inside, that he set off with the Prince like nothing. So fast he had never ridden before."
"""When we have gone a bit farther,"" said Graylegs, ""I'll show you the Giant's house."""
So after a while they came to it.
"""See, here is the Giant's house,"" said the Wolf; ""and see, here are your six brothers, whom the Giant has turned into stone; and see, here are their six brides, and away yonder is the door, and in that door you must go."""
"""Nay, but I daren't go in,"" said the Prince; ""he'll take my life."""
"""No! no!"" said the Wolf; ""when you get in you'll find a Princess, and she'll tell you what to do to make an end of the Giant. Only mind and do as she bids you."""
"Well! Boots went in, but, truth to say, he was very much afraid."
"When he came in the Giant was away, but in one of the rooms sat the Princess, just as the Wolf had said, and so lovely a princess Boots had never yet set eyes on."
"""Oh! heaven help you! whence have you come?"" said the Princess, as she saw him; ""it will surely be your death. No one can make an end of the Giant who lives here, for he has no heart in his body."""
"When the feast was over, the bridegroom and bride were conducted to their apartment, with music, and torches, and a great procession. As soon as the door was shut, the Lindworm turned to her and said, ""Fair maiden, shed a shift!"" The shepherd's daughter answered him, ""Prince Lindworm, slough a skin!"" ""No one has ever dared tell me to do that before!"" said he. ""But I command you to do it now!"" said she."
"Then he began to moan and wriggle: and in a few minutes a long snake-skin lay upon the floor beside him. The girl drew off her first shift, and spread it on top of the skin."
"The Lindworm said again to her, ""Fair maiden, shed a shift."""
"The shepherd's daughter answered him, ""Prince Lindworm, slough a skin."""
"""No one has ever dared tell me to do that before,"" said he. ""But I command you to do it now,"" said she. Then with groans and moans he cast off the second skin: and she covered it with her second shift."
"The Lindworm said for the third time, ""Fair maiden, shed a shift."""
"The shepherd's daughter answered him again, ""Prince Lindworm, slough a skin."" ""No one has ever dared tell me to do that before,"" said he, and his little eyes rolled furiously. But the girl was not afraid, and once more she commanded him to do as she bade."
"And so this went on until nine Lindworm skins were lying on the floor, each of them covered with a snow-white shift. And there was nothing left of the Lindworm but a huge thick mass, most horrible to see. Then the girl seized the whips, dipped them in the lye, and whipped him as hard as ever she could. Next, she bathed him all over in the fresh milk. Lastly, she dragged him on to the bed and put her arms round him. And she fell fast asleep that very moment."
"Next morning very early, the King and the courtiers came and peeped in through the keyhole. They wanted to know what had become of the girl, but none of them dared enter the room. However, in the end, growing bolder, they opened the door a tiny bit. And there they saw the girl, all fresh and rosy, and beside her lay no Lindworm, but the handsomest prince that any one could wish to see."
"The King ran out and fetched the Queen: and after that, there were such rejoicings in the castle as never were known before or since. The wedding took place all over again, much finer than the first, with festivals and banquets and merrymakings for days and weeks. No bride was ever so beloved by a King and Queen as this peasant maid from the shepherd's cottage. There was no end to their love and their kindness towards her: because, by her sense and her calmness and her courage, she had saved their son, Prince Lindworm."
THE LASSIE AND HER GODMOTHER
"Once on a time a poor couple lived far, far away in a great wood. The wife was brought to bed, and had a pretty girl, but they were so poor they did not know how to get the babe christened, for they had no money to pay the parson's fees. So one day the father went out to see if he could find any one who was willing to stand for the child and pay the fees; but though he walked about the whole day from one house to another, and though all said they were willing enough to stand, no one thought himself bound to pay the fees. Now, when he was going home again, a lovely lady met him, dressed so fine, and she looked so thoroughly good and kind; she offered to get the babe christened, but after that, she said, she must keep it for her own. The husband answered, he must first ask his wife what she wished to do; but when he got home and told his story, the wife said, right out, ""No!"""
"Next day the man went out again, but no one would stand if they had to pay the fees; and though he begged and prayed, he could get no help."
"And again as he went home, towards evening the same lovely lady met him, who looked so sweet and good, and she made him the same offer. So he told his wife again how he had fared, and this time she said, if he couldn't get any one to stand for his babe next day, they must just let the lady have her way, since she seemed so kind and good."
"The third day, the man went about, but he couldn't get any one to stand; and so when, towards evening, he met the kind lady again, he gave his word she should have the babe if she would only get it christened at the font. So next morning she came to the place where the man lived, followed by two men to stand godfathers, took the babe and carried it to church, and there it was christened. After that she took it to her own house, and there the little girl lived with her several years, and her Foster-mother was always kind and friendly to her."
"Now, when the Lassie had grown to be big enough to know right and wrong, her Foster-mother got ready to go on a journey."
"""You have my leave,"" she said, ""to go all over the house, except those rooms which I shew you;"" and when she had said that, away she went."
"But the Lassie could not forbear just to open one of the doors a little bit, when POP! out flew a Star."
"When her Foster-mother came back, she was very vexed to find that the star had flown out, and she got very angry with her Foster-daughter, and threatened to send her away; but the child cried and begged so hard that she got leave to stay."
"Now, after a while, the Foster-mother had to go on another journey; and, before she went, she forbade the Lassie to go into those two rooms into which she had never been. She promised to beware; but when she was left alone, she began to think and to wonder what there could be in the second room, and at last she could not help setting the door a little ajar, just to peep in, when POP! out flew the Moon."
"When her Foster-mother came home and found the moon let out, she was very downcast, and said to the Lassie she must go away, she could not stay with her any longer. But the Lassie wept so bitterly, and prayed so heartily for forgiveness, that this time, too, she got leave to stay."
"Some time after, the Foster-mother had to go away again, and she charged the Lassie, who by this time was half grown up, most earnestly that she mustn't try to go into, or to peep into, the third room. But when her Foster-mother had been gone some time, and the Lassie was weary of walking about alone, all at once she thought, ""Dear me, what fun it would be just to peep a little into that third room."" Then she thought she mustn't do it for her Foster-mother's sake; but when the bad thought came the second time she could hold out no longer; come what might, she must and would look into the room; so she just opened the door a tiny bit, when POP! out flew the Sun."
"But when her Foster-mother came back and saw that the sun had flown away, she was cut to the heart, and said, ""Now, there was no help for it, the Lassie must and should go away; she couldn't hear of her staying any longer."" Now the Lassie cried her eyes out, and begged and prayed so prettily; but it was all no good."
"""Nay! but I must punish you!"" said her Foster-mother; ""but you may have your choice, either to be the loveliest woman in the world, and not to be able to speak, or to keep your speech, and to be the ugliest of all women; but away from me you must go."""
"And the Lassie said, ""I would sooner be lovely."" So she became all at once wondrous fair; but from that day forth she was dumb."
"So, when she went away from her Foster-mother, she walked and wandered through a great, great wood; but the farther she went, the farther off the end seemed to be. So, when the evening came on, she clomb up into a tall tree, which grew over a spring, and there she made herself up to sleep that night. Close by lay a castle, and from that castle came early every morning a maid to draw water to make the Prince's tea, from the spring over which the Lassie was sitting. So the maid looked down into the spring, saw the lovely face in the water, and thought it was her own; then she flung away the pitcher, and ran home; and, when she got there, she tossed up her head and said, ""If I'm so pretty, I'm far too good to go and fetch water."""
"So another maid had to go for the water, but the same thing happened to her; she went back and said she was far too pretty and too good to fetch water from the spring for the Prince. Then the Prince went himself, for he had a mind to see what all this could mean. So, when he reached the spring, he too saw the image in the water; but he looked up at once, and became aware of the lovely Lassie who sate there up in the tree. Then he coaxed her down and took her home; and at last made up his mind to have her for his queen, because she was so lovely; but his mother, who was still alive, was against it."
"""She can't speak,"" she said, ""and maybe she's a wicked witch."""
"But the Prince could not be content till he got her. So after they had lived together a while, the Lassie was to have a child, and when the child came to be born, the Prince set a strong watch about her; but at the birth one and all fell into a deep sleep, and her Foster-mother came, cut the babe on its little finger, and smeared the queen's mouth with the blood; and said:"
"But at teatime another thing happened. Effie's brother Harry fished something out of his tea, which he thought at first was an earwig. He was just getting ready to drop it on the floor, and end its life in the usual way, when it shook itself in the spoon spread two wet wings, and flopped onto the tablecloth. There it sat, stroking itself with its feet and stretching its wings, and Harry said: ""Why, it's a tiny newt!"""
"The professor leaned forward before the doctor could say a word. ""I'll give you half a crown for it, Harry, my lad,"" he said, speaking very fast; and then he picked it up carefully on his handkerchief."
"""It is a new specimen,"" he said, ""and finer than yours, Doctor."""
"It was a tiny lizard, about half an inch long with scales and wings."
"So now the doctor and the professor each had a specimen, and they were both very pleased. But before long these specimens began to seem less valuable. For the next morning, when the knife-boy was cleaning the doctor's boots, he suddenly dropped the brushes and the boot and the blacking, and screamed out that he was burnt."
"And from inside the boot came crawling a lizard as big as a kitten, with large, shiny wings."
"""Why,"" said Effie, ""I know what it is. It is a dragon like the one St."
"George killed."""
"And Effie was right. That afternoon Towser was bitten in the garden by a dragon about the size of a rabbit, which he had tried to chase, and the next morning all the papers were full of the wonderful ""winged lizards"""
"that were appearing all over the country. The papers would not call them dragons, because, of course, no one believes in dragons nowadays and at any rate the papers were not going to be so silly as to believe in fairy stories. At first there were only a few, but in a week or two the country was simply running alive with dragons of all sizes, and in the air you could sometimes see them as thick as a swarm of bees. They all looked alike except as to size. They were green with scales, and they had four legs and a long tail and great wings like bats' wings, only the wings were a pale, half-transparent yellow, like the gear-boxes on bicycles."
"They breathed fire and smoke, as all proper dragons must, but still the newspapers went on pretending they were lizards, until the editor of the Standard was picked up and carried away by a very large one, and then the other newspaper people had not anyone left to tell them what they ought not to believe. So when the largest elephant in the Zoo was carried off by a dragon, the papers gave up pretending and put ALARMING PLAGUE OF DRAGONS at the top of the paper."
"You have no idea how alarming it was, and at the same time how aggravating. The large-size dragons were terrible certainly, but when once you had found out that the dragons always went to bed early because they were afraid of the chill night air, you had only to stay indoors all day, and you were pretty safe from the big ones. But the smaller sizes were a perfect nuisance. The ones as big as earwigs got in the soap, and they got in the butter. The ones as big as dogs got in the bath, and the fire and smoke inside them made them steam like anything when the cold water tap was turned on, so that careless people were often scalded quite severely. The ones that were as large as pigeons would get into workbaskets or corner drawers and bite you when you were in a hurry to get a needle or a handkerchief. The ones as big as sheep were easier to avoid, because you could see them coming; but when they flew in at the windows and curled up under your eiderdown, and you did not find them till you went to bed, it was always a shock. The ones this size did not eat people, only lettuce, but they always scorched the sheets and pillowcases dreadfully."
"Of course, the County Council and the police did everything that could be done: It was no use offering the hand of the Princess to anyone who killed a dragon. This way was all very well in olden times when there was only one dragon and one Princess; but now there were far more dragons than Princesses although the Royal Family was a large one. And besides, it would have been a mere waste of Princesses to offer rewards for killing dragons, because everybody killed as many dragons as they could quite out of their own heads and without rewards at all, just to get the nasty things out of the way. The County Council undertook to cremate all dragons delivered at their offices between the hours of ten and two, and whole wagonloads and cartloads and truckloads of dead dragons could be seen any day of the week standing in a long line in the street where the County Council had their offices. Boys brought barrowloads of dead dragons, and children on their way home from morning school would call in to leave the handful or two of little dragons they had brought in their satchels, or carried in their knotted pocket handkerchiefs. And yet there seemed to be as many dragons as ever. Then the police stuck up great wood and canvas towers covered with patent glue. When the dragons flew against these towers, they stuck fast, as flies and wasps do on the sticky papers in the kitchen; and when the towers were covered all over with dragons, the police inspector used to set fire to the towers, and burnt them and dragons and all."
"And yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever. The shops were full of patent dragon poison and anti-dragon soap, and dragonproof curtains for the windows; and indeed, everything that could be done was done."
And yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever.
"It was not very easy to know what would poison a dragon, because, you see, they ate such different things. The largest kind ate elephants as long as there were any, and then went on with horses and cows. Another size ate nothing but lilies of the valley, and a third size ate only Prime Ministers if they were to be had, and, if not, would feed freely on servants in livery. Another size lived on bricks, and three of them ate two thirds of the South Lambeth Infirmary in one afternoon."
"But the size Effie was most afraid of was about as big as your dining room, and that size ate little girls and boys."
"At first Effie and her brother were quite pleased with the change in their lives. It was so amusing to sit up all night instead of going to sleep, and to play in the garden lighted by electric lamps. And it sounded so funny to hear Mother say, when they were going to bed: ""Good night, my darlings, sleep sound all day, and don't get up too soon. You must not get up before it's quite dark. You wouldn't like the nasty dragons to catch you."""
"But after a time they got very tired of it all: They wanted to see the flowers and trees growing in the fields, and to see the pretty sunshine out of doors, and not just through glass windows and patent dragonproof curtains. And they wanted to play on the grass, which they were not allowed to do in the electric lamp-lighted garden because of the night-dew."
"And they wanted so much to get out, just for once, in the beautiful, bright, dangerous daylight, that they began to try and think of some reason why they ought to go out. Only they did not like to disobey their mother."
"But one morning their mother was busy preparing some new dragon poison to lay down in the cellars, and their father was bandaging the hand of the boot boy, which had been scratched by one of the dragons who liked to eat Prime Ministers when they were to be had, so nobody remembered to say to the children: ""Don't get up till it is quite dark!"""
"""Go now,"" said Harry. ""It would not be disobedient to go. And I know exactly what we ought to do, but I don't know how we ought to do it."""
"""What ought we to do?"" said Effie."
"""We ought to wake St. George, of course,"" said Harry. ""He was the only person in his town who knew how to manage dragons; the people in the fairy tales don't count. But St. George is a real person, and he is only asleep, and he is waiting to be waked up. Only nobody believes in St."
"George now. I heard father say so."""
"""We do,"" said Effie."
"""Of course we do. And don't you see, Ef, that's the very reason why we could wake him? You can't wake people if you don't believe in them, can you?"""
"Effie said no, but where could they find St. George?"
"""We must go and look,"" said Harry boldly. ""You shall wear a dragonproof frock, made of stuff like the curtains. And I will smear myself all over with the best dragon poison, and """
"Effie clasped her hands and skipped with joy and cried: ""Oh, Harry! I know where we can find St. George! In St. George's Church, of course."""
"""Um,"" said Harry, wishing he had thought of it for himself, ""you have a little sense sometimes, for a girl."""
"The following spring Washington was sent under General Fry to drive out the French, who had started farming at Pittsburg. Fry died, and Washington took command. He liked it very much. After that Washington took command whenever he could, and soon rose to be a great man."
"The first expedition against Fort Duquesne (pronounced du-kane) was commanded by General Braddock, whose portrait we are able to give, showing him at the time he did not take Washington's advice in the Duquesne matter. Later we show him as he appeared after he had abandoned his original plans and immediately after not taking Washington's advice."
"""The Indians,"" said Braddock, ""may frighten Colonial troops, but they can make no impression on the king's regulars. We are alike impervious to fun or fear."""
"Braddock thought of fighting the Indians by man[oe]uvring in large bodies, but the first body to be man[oe]uvred was that of General Braddock, who perished in about a minute."
"We give the reader, above, an idea of Braddock's soldierly bearing after he had been man[oe]uvring a few times."
"It was then that Washington took command, as was his custom, and began to fight the Indians and French as one would hunt varmints in Virginia."
"Braddock's men fired by platoons into the trees and tore a few holes in the State line, but when most of the Colonial troops were dead the regulars presented their tournures to the foe and fled as far as Philadelphia, where they each took a bath and had some laundry-work done."
General Forbes took command of the second expedition. He spent most of his time building roads.
"Time passed on, and Forbes built viaducts, conduits, culverts, and rustic bridges, till it was November, and they were yet fifty miles from the fort. He then decided to abandon the expedition, on account of the cold, and also fearing that he had not made all of his bridges wide enough so that he could take the captured fort home with him."
"Washington, however, though only an aidy kong of General Forbes, decided to take command. His mother had said to him over and over, ""George, in an emergency always take command."" He done so, as General Rusk would say. As he approached, the French set fire to the fort, and retreated, together with the Indians and Molly Maguires."
"Pittsburg now stands on this historic ground, and is one of the most delightful cities of America."
Many other changes were going on at this time. The English got possession of Acadia and the French forts at the head of the Bay of Fundy.
"In 1757 General Loudon collected an army for an attack on Louisburg. He drilled his troops all summer, and then gave up the attack because he learned that the French had one more skiff than he had."
The Loudons of America at the time of this writing are more quiet and sensible regarding their ancestry than any of the doodle-bug aristocracy of our promoted peasantry and the crested Yahoos of our cowboy republic.
The Loudons or Lowdowns of America had a very large family. Some of them changed their names and moved.
"The next year after the fox pass of General Loudon, Amherst and Wolfe took possession of the entire island."
"About the time of Braddock's justly celebrated expedition another started out for Crown Point. The French, under Dieskau (pronounced dees-kow), met the army composed of Colonial troops in plain clothes, together with the regular troops led by officers with drawn swords and overdrawn salaries. The regular general, seeing that the battle was lost, excused himself and retired to his tent, owing to an ingrowing nail which had annoyed him all day. Lyman, the Colonial officer now took command, and wrung victory from the reluctant jaws of defeat. For this Johnson, the English general, received twenty-five thousand dollars and a baronetcy, while Lyman received a plated butter-dish and a bass-wood what-not. But Lyman was a married man, and had learned to take things as they came."
"Four months prior to the capture of Duquesne, one thousand boats loaded with soldiers, each with a neat little lunch-basket and a little flag to wave when they hurrahed for the good kind man at the head of the picnic, viz., General Abercrombie, sailed down Lake George to get a whiff of fresh air and take Ticonderoga."
"When they arrived, General Abercrombie took out a small book regarding tactics which he had bought on the boat, and, after refreshing his memory, ordered an assault. He then went back to see how his rear was, and, finding it all right, he went back still farther, to see if no one had been left behind."
Abercrombie never forgot or overlooked any one. He wanted all of his pleasure-party to be where they could see the fight.
In that way he missed it himself. I would hate to miss a fight that way.
The Abercrombies of America mostly trace their ancestry back by a cut-off avoiding the general's line.
"Niagara had an expedition sent against it at the time of Braddock's trip. The commander was General Shirley, but he ran out of money while at the Falls and decided to return. This post did not finally surrender till 1759."
"This gave the then West to the English. They had tried for one hundred and forty years to civilize it, but, alas, with only moderate success."
"Prosperous and happy even while sniping in their fox-hunting or canvas-back-duck clothes, these people feel somewhat soothed for their lack of culture because they are well-to-do."
"In 1759 General Wolfe anchored off Quebec with his fleet and sent a boy up town to ask if there were any letters for him at the post-office, also asking at what time it would be convenient to evacuate the place."
"The reply came back from General Montcalm, an able French general, that there was no mail for the general, but if Wolfe was dissatisfied with the report he might run up personally and look over the W's."
"Wolfe did so, taking his troops up by an unknown cow-path on the off side of the mountain during the night, and at daylight stood in battle-array on the Plains of Abraham. An attack was made by Montcalm as soon as he got over his wonder and surprise. At the third fire Wolfe was fatally wounded, and as he was carried back to the rear he heard some one exclaim,"
"""They run! They run!"""
"""Hurry up,"" he said. ""Come down and lie still, can't you?"""
"So the rock with the round piece of earth fell into the sea, and the point of the rock went into a hole that just fitted it in the stony sea bottom, and there it spun around the wrong way seven times and then lay still. And that round piece of land became, after millions of years, the Kingdom of Rotundia."
"This is the end of the geography lesson. And now for just a little natural history, so that we may not feel that we are quite wasting our time. Of course, the consequence of the island having spun around the wrong way was that when the animals began to grow on the island they all grew the wrong sizes. The guinea pig, as you know, was as big as our elephants, and the elephant dear little pet was the size of the silly, tiny, black-and-tan dogs that ladies carry sometimes in their muffs. The rabbits were about the size of our rhinoceroses, and all about the wild parts of the island they had made their burrows as big as railway tunnels. The dormouse, of course, was the biggest of all the creatures."
"I can't tell you how big he was. Even if you think of elephants it will not help you at all. Luckily there was only one of him, and he was always asleep. Otherwise I don't think the Rotundians could have borne with him. As it was, they made him a house, and it saved the expense of a brass band, because no band could possibly have been heard when the dormouse was talking in his sleep."
"The men and women and children in this wonderful island were quite the right size, because their ancestors had come over with the Conqueror long after the island had settled down and the animals grown on it."
"Now the natural history lesson is over, and if you have been attending, you know more about Rotundia than anyone there did, except three people:"
"the Lord Chief Schoolmaster, the Princess's uncle who was a magician, and knew everything without learning it and Tom, the gardener's son."
"Tom had learned more at school than anyone else, because he wished to take a prize. The prize offered by the Lord Chief Schoolmaster was a History of Rotundia, beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the back. But after that day when the Princess said she meant to marry Tom, the gardener's boy thought it over, and he decided that the best prize in the world would be the Princess, and this was the prize Tom meant to take; and when you are a gardener's son and have decided to marry a Princess, you will find that the more you learn at school the better."
"The Princess always played with Tom on the days when the little dukes and marquises did not come to tea and when he told her he was almost sure of the first prize, she clapped her hands and said: ""Dear Tom, dear good, clever Tom, you deserve all the prizes. And I will give you my pet elephant and you can keep him till we're married."""
"The pet elephant was called Fido, and the gardener's son took him away in his coat pocket. He was the dearest little elephant you ever saw about six inches long. But he was very, very wise he could not have been wiser if he had been a mile high. He lay down comfortably in Tom's pocket, and when Tom put in his hand, Fido curled his little trunk around Tom's fingers with an affectionate confidence that made the boy's heart warm to his new little pet. What with the elephant, and the Princess's affection, and the knowledge that the very next day he would receive the History of Rotundia, beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the cover, Tom could hardly sleep a wink. And, besides, the dog did bark so terribly. There was only one dog in Rotundia the kingdom could not afford to keep more than one: He was a Mexican lapdog of the kind that in most parts of the world only measures seven inches from the end of his dear nose to the tip of his darling tail but in Rotundia he was bigger than I can possibly expect you to believe. And when he barked, his bark was so large that it filled up all the night and left no room for sleep or dreams or polite conversation, or anything else at all. He never barked at things that went on in the island he was too large-minded for that; but when ships went blundering by in the dark, tumbling over the rocks at the end of the island, he would bark once or twice, just to let the ships know that they couldn't come playing about there just as they liked."
"But on this particular night he barked and barked and barked and the Princess said, ""Oh dear, oh dear, I wish he wouldn't, I am so sleepy."""
"And Tom said to himself, ""I wonder whatever is the matter. As soon as it's light I'll go and see."""
"So when it began to be pretty pink-and-yellow daylight, Tom got up and went out. And all the time the Mexican lapdog barked so that the houses shook, and the tiles on the roof of the palace rattled like milk cans in a cart whose horse is frisky."
"""I'll go to the pillar,"" thought Tom, as he went through the town. The pillar, of course, was the top of the piece of rock that had stuck itself through Rotundia millions of years before, and made it spin around the wrong way. It was quite in the middle of the island, and stuck up ever so far, and when you were at the top you could see a great deal farther than when you were not."
"As Tom went out from the town and across the downs, he thought what a pretty sight it was to see the rabbits in the bright, dewy morning, frisking with their young ones by the mouths of their burrows. He did not go very near the rabbits, of course, because when a rabbit of that size is at play it does not always look where it is going, and it might easily have crushed Tom with its foot, and then it would have been very sorry afterward. And Tom was a kind boy, and would not have liked to make even a rabbit unhappy. Earwigs in our country often get out of the way when they think you are going to walk on them. They too have kind hearts, and they would not like you to be sorry afterward."
"So Tom went on, looking at the rabbits and watching the morning grow more and more red and golden. And the Mexican lapdog barked all the time, till the church bells tinkled, and the chimney of the apple factory rocked again."
"But when Tom got to the pillar, he saw that he would not need to climb to the top to find out what the dog was barking at."
"For there, by the pillar, lay a very large purple dragon. His wings were like old purple umbrellas that have been very much rained on, and his head was large and bald, like the top of a purple toadstool, and his tail, which was purple too, was very, very, very long and thin and tight, like the lash of a carriage whip."
"It was licking one of its purple umbrella-y wings, and every now and then it moaned and leaned its head back against the rocky pillar as though it felt faint. Tom saw at once what had happened. A flight of purple dragons must have crossed the island in the night, and this poor one must have knocked its wing and broken it against the pillar."
"Everyone is kind to everyone in Rotundia, and Tom was not afraid of the dragon, although he had never spoken to one before. He had often watched them flying across the sea, but he had never expected to get to know one personally."
"So now he said: ""I am afraid you don't feel quite well."""
"The dragon shook his large purple head. He could not speak, but like all other animals, he could understand well enough when he liked."
"""Can I get you anything?"" asked Tom, politely."
The dragon opened his purple eyes with an inquiring smile.
"""A bun or two, now,"" said Tom, coaxingly. ""There's a beautiful bun tree quite close."""
"The dragon opened a great purple mouth and licked his purple lips, so Tom ran and shook the bun tree, and soon came back with an armful of fresh currant buns, and as he came he picked a few of the Bath kind, which grow on the low bushes near the pillar."
"Because, of course, another consequence of the island's having spun the wrong way is that all the things we have to make buns and cakes and shortbread grow on trees and bushes, but in Rotundia they have to make their cauliflowers and cabbages and carrots and apples and onions, just as our cooks make puddings and turnovers."
"Tom gave all the buns to the dragon, saying: ""Here, try to eat a little."
"You'll soon feel better then."""
"The dragon ate up the buns, nodded rather ungraciously, and began to lick his wing again. So Tom left him and went back to the town with the news, and everyone was so excited at a real live dragon's being on the island a thing that had never happened before that they all went out to look at it, instead of going to the prize-giving, and the Lord Chief Schoolmaster went with the rest. Now, he had Tom's prize, the History of Rotundia, in his pocket the one bound in calf, with the Royal arms on the cover and it happened to drop out, and the dragon ate it, so Tom never got the prize after all. But the dragon, when he had gotten it, did not like it."
"""Perhaps it's all for the best,"" said Tom. ""I might not have liked that prize either, if I had gotten it."""
"It happened to be a Wednesday, so when the Princess's friends were asked what they would like to do, all the little dukes and marquises and earls said, ""Let's go and see the dragon."" But the little duchesses and marchionesses and countesses said they were afraid."
"Things were very much unsettled. England had not sent a minister to this country, and had arranged no commercial treaty with us."
Washington's Cabinet consisted of three portfolios and a rack in which he kept his flute-music.
"The three ministers were the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary of the Treasury. There was no Attorney-General, or Postmaster-General, or Secretary of the Interior, or of the Navy, or Seed Catalogue Secretary."
"Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, advised that Congress at the earliest moment provide itself with a national debt, which was done, the war debt being assumed by the Congressional representatives of the thirteen Colonies."
"A tax was levied on spirits, and a mint started, combining the two, and making the mint encourage the consumption of spirits, and thus the increase of the tax, very likely."
"A Whiskey Rebellion broke out in 1794. Pennsylvania especially rebelled at the tax on this grocery, but it was put down. (Those wishing to know which was put down will find out by consulting the Appendix, which will be issued a year from this winter.)"
"A few Indian wars now kept the people interested, and a large number of the red brothers, under Little Turtle, soon found themselves in the soup, as Washington put it so tersely in his message the following year."
Twenty-five thousand square miles north of the Ohio were obtained by treaty from the Indians.
"England claimed that traffic with America was not desirable, as the Americans did not pay their debts. Possibly that was true, for muskrat pelts were low at that time, and England refused to take cord-wood and saw-logs piled on the New York landing as cash."
"Chief-Justice Jay was sent to London to confer with the king, which he did. He was not invited, however, to come to the house during his stay, and the queen did not call on Mrs. Jay. The Jays have never recovered from this snub, and are still gently guyed by the comic papers."
"But the treaty was negotiated, and now the Americans are said to pay their debts as well as the nobility who marry our American girls instead of going into bankruptcy, as some would do."
"The Mississippi and the Mediterranean Sea were opened for navigation to American vessels now, and things looked better, for we could by this means exchange our cranberries for sugar and barter our Indian relics for camel's-hair shawls, of which the pioneers were very much in need during the rigorous winters in the North."
"The French now had a difficulty with England, and Washington, who still remembered La Fayette and the generous aid of the French, wished that he was back at Mount Vernon, working out his poll-tax on the Virginia roads, for he was in a tight place."
"It was now thought best to have two political parties, in order to enliven editorial thought and expression. So the Republican party, headed by Jefferson, Madison, and Randolph, and the Federalist party, led by Hamilton and Adams, were organized, and public speakers were engaged from a distance."
"The latter party supported the administration, which was not so much of a job as it has been several times since."
"Washington declined to accept a third term, and wrote a first-rate farewell address. A lady, whose name is withheld, writing of those times, closes by saying that President Washington was one of the sweetest men she ever knew."
"John Adams succeeded Washington as President, and did not change his politics to amount to much."
"He made a good record as Congressman, but lost it as President largely because of his egotism. He seemed to think that if he neglected to oil the gearing of the solar system about so often, it would stop running."
We should learn from this to be humble even when we are in authority.
"Adams and Jefferson were good friends during the Revolution, but afterwards political differences estranged them till they returned to private life. Adams was a poor judge of men, and offended several members of the press who called on him to get his message in advance."
"Our country was on the eve of a war with France, when Napoleon I. was made Consul, and peace followed."
"Adams's administration made the Federalists unpopular, owing to the Alien and Sedition laws, and Jefferson was elected the successor of Adams, Burr running as Vice-President with him. The election was so close that it went to the House, however."
"Jefferson, or the Sage of Monticello, was a good President, noted for his simplicity. He married and brought his bride home to Monticello prior to this. She had to come on horseback about one hundred miles, and, as the house was unfinished and no servants there, they had to sleep on the work-bench and eat what was left of the carpenter's lunch."
"Jeffersonian simplicity was his strong point, and people who called at the White House often found him sprinkling the floor of his office, or trying to start a fire with kerosene."
"Burr was Vice-President, and, noticing at once that the office did not attract any attention to speak of, decided to challenge Mr. Alexander Hamilton to fight a duel with him."
"The affair took place at Weehawken, July 11, 1804. Hamilton fell at the first fire, on the same spot where his eldest son had been killed in the same way."
"The artist has shown us how Burr and Hamilton should have fought, but, alas! they were not progressive men and did not realize this till too late. Another method would have been to use the bloodless method of the French duel, or the newspaper customs adopted by the pugilists of 1893."
The time is approaching when mortal combat in America will be confined to belligerent people under the influence of liquor. A newspaper assault instead of a duel might have made Burr President and Hamilton Vice-President.
"Burr went West, and was afterwards accused of treason on the ground that he was trying to organize Mexico against the United States government."
"only fitting you should have an opportunity to see it first hand."""
"""Mind giving us a preview of the upcoming agenda?"" Vance leaned back."

Kennedy looked at Cæsar with curiosity.
“And how can it help you with your plans to stay here in Rome?” he
asked.
“It can help me. In Spain nobody knows me. This is the only place where
"I have a certain position, through being the nephew of a Cardinal. I am"

said Kennedy.
“Of course.”
“But you are not Clerical!”
“No; but it is necessary for me to climb. Afterwards there will be time
to change.”

With a gipsy for my dear!
We’d make our bed in the bracken
With the lark for a chambermaid;
The lark would sing us awake in the mornings
Singing above our head.
We’d drink the sunlight all day long
With never a house to bind us;
And we’d only flout in a merry song
The world we left behind us.
We would be free as birds are free
"The livelong day, the livelong day;"
And we would lie in the sunny bracken
With none to say us nay.

The gipsy girls are here;
And it’s O to be off and away from the town

"SHE has taken my heart, though she knows not, would care not."
It thrills at her voice like a reed in the wind;
"I would taste all her agonies, have her to spare not,"
"Sin deep as she sinned,"
"To be tossed by the storm of her love, as the ocean"
"Rocks vessels to wreck; to be hers, though the cost"
Were the loss of all else: for that moment’s emotion
Content to be lost!
"To be, for a moment, the man of all men to her,"
"All the world, for one measureless moment complete;"
"To possess, be possessed! To be mockery then to her,"
Then to die at her feet!

"I LIE on my pallet bed,"
And I hear the drip of the rain;
“Will you be seated?”
"“It is only human,” said he, “to call and see you, and ask after that"
unhappy child.”
"“She is getting on,” said the Sister superintendent, frostily, “as well"
as can be expected.”
“Which means? Please tell me. I am here to know.”
"“She will take some time to recover from her injuries, and of course her"
nerve is broken.”
"“I'm afraid,” said John, “your institution can't afford many invalid's"
luxuries.”
"“None at all,” replied the weary-faced woman. “She gets proper care and"
"attention, however.”"
John drew out a five-pound note. “Can you buy her any little things
"with this? When you have spent it, if you will tell me, I 'll send you"
another.”
"“It's against our rules,” said the Sister, eying the money. “If you like"
"to give it as a subscription to the general funds, I will accept it.”"
“Are you badly off?” asked John.
“We are very slenderly endowed.”
John pushed the note across the small table near which they were
sitting.
"""Yes."""
"""Much?"""
"Kilshaw leant forward and answered, almost in a whisper,"
"""Five hundred on Friday night,"" and in spite of himself he avoided the"
Superintendent's shrewd eye. But that officer's business was not to pass
"moral judgments. Law is one thing, morality another."
"""Then the thing's as plain as a pikestaff. This Gaspard got to know"
"about the money, and murdered him to get it. We needn't look further for"
"a motive."""
"""I suppose all this will have to come out? I wonder if Gaspard knew who"
"Benham was?"""
"""It's not necessary to suppose that, unless we believe all Evans says."

The Superintendent looked grave.
in restoring Monsieur to a normal temper.
"""We've simply got to make him laugh,"" I whispered to Tommy. ""It's a"
"matter of principle now!"""
"""Then wait till we have supper, and get him soused,"" my confederate"
"cautiously replied. ""That'll do it. But you'd better not drink much,"" he"
"added. ""How are the nerves this evening?"""
"""I've almost forgotten them,"" I answered."
But Tommy was persistent at times. Unknown to me he was now preparing a
report to wire the Mater.
"""Sleeping better?"" he asked."
"""Lots."""
"""Lying to me?"""
"""A little,"" I laughed outright. ""But honestly I'm in heaps better"
"shape!"""
"""Oh, I've seen you improving from day to day, but we want to put it over"
"right. So don't hit the asphalt too hard tonight."""
And in all justice to myself and my friendship to Tommy I really did not
intend to. What place was it that some one said is paved with good
intentions?
Leaving the Opera House we mixed with the laughing tide that flowed
"along the Prado, and by the merest chance--destinies of nations, much"
"before these, or will you see me alone?'"
"'Your spy, that cat there,' my lady answered, carried away by her"
"temper, 'may go! The women will stay.'"
"Fraulein Max, singled out by that merciless finger, sprang forward,"
her face mottled with surprise and terror. For a second she hesitated.
"Then she rushed towards her friend, as if she would embrace her."
'Countess!' she cried. 'Rotha! Surely you are mad! You cannot think
that I would----'
"My lady turned, and in a flash struck her fiercely on the cheek with"
"her open hand. 'Liar!' she cried; 'go to your master, you whipped"
hound!'
"The Dutch woman recoiled with a cry of pain, and sobbing wildly went"
back to her place. The general laughed harshly.
"'You hold with me, sweetheart,' he said. 'Discipline before"
everything. But you have not my patience.'
"She looked at him--angry with him, angry with herself, her hand to her"
bosom--but she did not answer.
"'For you must allow,' he continued--his tone and his eyes still"
bantered her--'that I have been patient. I have been like a man
"athirst in the desert; but I have waited day after day, until now I"
"can wait no longer, sweetheart.'"
'So you tamper with my--with that woman!' she said scornfully.
"daughter, I am pleased to tell you, will live; but she must be kept"
absolutely quiet.  I cannot allow you to approach her on any pretext
"whatsoever."""
"""She will not die, will she?"" the woman implored distractedly."
"""No,"" he replied, in a voice somewhat strained, I thought, ""she will not"
"die.  Of that you may rest assured."""
"Then turning to me, he beckoned, and I followed him out of the room."
CHAPTER EIGHT.
THE OLD LOVE.
"""I don't like that woman, old fellow,"" were the first words Dick uttered"
when we were alone in the room in which Yolande had been found.
"""Why not?""  I asked, rather surprised.  ""The Countess de Foville is"
"always charming."""
"He shrugged his shoulders, saying:"
"""One sometimes has strange and unaccountable prejudices, you know.  This"
"is one of mine."""
"""And Yolande,"" I asked, ""what of her?"""
"""She's better.  But it was fortunate I made the discovery just when I"
"did, or she would no doubt have passed away.  I never saw an appearance"
"so closely resembling death in all my experience; in fact, I'd have"
"staked my professional reputation that there was no spark of life."""
"""Would you go out in the grounds where we sat yesterday and fetch my"
"galoshes?"""
So he went out to do her this great favor. He sang a well-known popular
"song as he crossed the yard, cheerful in his own peculiar way."
She turned to me.
"""You seem silent."""
"""Do I?"""
"""Yes, you're very silent."""
"""Listen to this,"" I said, and began to read to her from the book I held in"
my hands. I read a longish bit.
"She tried to interrupt me several times, and at length said impatiently:"
"""What is this you want me to listen to?"""
"""The _Musketeers_. You must admit it's entertaining."""
"""I've read it,"" she said. And then she began to clasp her hands and drag"
them apart again.
"""Then you must hear something you haven't read before,"" I replied, and"
went across to my room to fetch a few pages I had written. They were only
"a few poems--nothing special, just a few small verses. Not that I am in"
"the habit of reading such things aloud, but I seized on this for the"
"moment because I wanted to prevent her from humbling herself, and telling"
me anything more.
"harm."""
"""No; nothing will do anybody harm if it gives you pleasure."""
"At that bitter retort, he kept silence a long time, now and then heaving"
"a long sigh.  His words kept sounding in her heart: ""The soul, not the"
"body, is faithful.""  Was he, after all, more faithful to her than she had"
"ever been, could ever be--who did not love, had never loved him?  What"
"right had she to talk, who had married him out of vanity, out of--what?"
And suddenly he said:
"""Gyp!  Forgive!"""
"She uttered a sigh, and turned away her face."
"He bent down against the eider-down.  She could hear him drawing long,"
"sobbing breaths, and, in the midst of her lassitude and hopelessness, a"
"sort of pity stirred her.  What did it matter?  She said, in a choked"
voice:
"""Very well, I forgive."""

The human creature has wonderful power of putting up with things. Gyp
never really believed that Daphne Wing was of the past.  Her sceptical
instinct told her that what Fiorsen might honestly mean to do was very
different from what he would do under stress of opportunity carefully put

"""Courage!"" said the duke."
"""My blood is as water, my heart as wax. Death and destiny are over my"
"head!"""
"""Speak not to me of destiny and look not to the skies! I have closed"
my account with Heaven! In himself is man's power! You have broken the
crucifix! Now trust your own soul. So long as you did serve a
"superstition had you lost your true heaven!"""
"""And yet--"""
"""You have played the god, and the Father in Heaven must love you for"

"""Strange words--"""
"""But true! Were I God, should I love the monk puling prayers in a den?"
Nay--that man should I choose who dared to follow the dictates of his

The horseman in the valley had swept at a gallop through a sea of
"sun-bronzed fern. His eyes were full of a restless glitter, as the"
"eyes of a man, whose heart is troubled. He sprang from the saddle,"
"and, leading his horse by the bridle, bent low before the twain."
"""Tidings, my lord!"""
every hut and tent was brilliantly illuminated. Multitudes of dazzling
stars appeared and disappeared.
We drew our breakfast and packed up our belongings. All was confusion in
the hut.
"We paraded, the roll was called, and as the day began to dawn we marched"
off.
"We passed down the main road in long, swaying columns of fours. We left"
the woodyard behind us and hoped it would be destroyed--how we hated the
place for the dreary months we had spent there! The westward stream of
"refugees had ceased, but an eastward stream of French infantry and field"
artillery thronged the roads. The artillerymen were mostly tall and
powerfully built. The infantry were nearly all elderly men of poor
physique. They looked desperately miserable. We exchanged greetings:
"""It's a good war!"""
"""C'est une bonne guerre!"""
And then we broke into song:
"""Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, _Oh_ it's a lovely war!"""
"The French did not sing, but we, who were escaping destruction, passed"
from one song to another:
"""I don't want to fight the Germans,"
"I don't want to go to war,"
"I'd sooner be in London,"
"Dear old dirty London."""
He was borne out of the room. The Rogan leader turned to Brand and
spoke.
"""He says that if your comrade does not tell him what he wants to know,"
"your turn will come next,"" sobbed Greca. ""Oh! Why does not The Great"
"White One strike these monsters to the dust!"""
She ran to Brand and pressed her satiny cheek to his. Then she was
dragged roughly away.
The great door clanged shut. The heavy outer fastenings clicked into
place. Dex had gone to experience whatever it was that Journeyman and
the rest had experienced in this red hell. And Brand was left behind
to reflect on what dread torments this might comprise; and to pray
desperately that no matter what might be done to his shrinking body he
would be strong enough to refuse to betray his planet.
CHAPTER V
_The Torture Chamber_
"Swiftly Dex was carried down the long ramp to the ground floor, the"
arms of his captors gripping him with painful tightness. Heading the
"procession was the immensely tall, gangling Rogan leader, clutching"
Greca by the wrist and dragging her indifferently along to be his
mouthpiece.
Rays of the afternoon sun in a glimmer across the trees;
"Glittering moist underfoot, the long alley. The firs, one by one,"

QUEST.
"I CHASE a shadow through the night,"
A shadow unavailing;
"Out of the dark, into the light,"
"I follow, follow: is it she?"
"Against the wall of sea outlined,"
"Outlined against the windows lit,"
"The shadow flickers, and behind"
"I follow, follow after it."
The shadow leads me through the night
To the grey margin of the sea;
"Out of the dark, into the light,"
I follow unavailingly.
TO A PORTRAIT.
"There was a brief, noisy interval, during which Emerson was too"
astounded to attempt an answer to the questions hurled broadcast by the
"new-comers; then Marsh levelled a trembling finger at him and cried,"
hysterically:
"""There he is, men. He tried to murder me. I--I'm hurt. I'll have him"
"arrested."""
The seriousness of the accusation struck the young man on the instant;
he turned upon the group.
"""I didn't do that. I heard a fight going on and ran in here--"""
"""He's a liar,"" the wounded man interrupted, shrilly. ""He stabbed me!"
"See?"" He tried to strip the shirt from his wounds, then fell to"
"chattering and shaking. ""Oh, God! I'm hurt."" He staggered to a"
packing-case and sank upon it weakly fumbling at his sodden shoulder.
"""I didn't do that,"" repeated Boyd. ""I don't know who stabbed him. I"
"didn't."""
"""Then who did?"" some one demanded."
"""What are you doing in here? You'd a killed him in a minute,"" said the"
man with the lantern.
"""We'll fix you for this,"" a third voice threatened."
"""Listen,"" Boyd said, in a tone to make them pause. ""There has been a"
"mistake here. I was passing the building when I heard a woman scream,"
"and I rushed in to prevent Marsh from choking her to death."""
his teeth.
"""Are you going with us?"" Boyd inquired."
"""Sure."""
"""See here. Is life one long succession of surprise parties with you?"""
"""Why, I've figgered on this right along."""
"""But the ship is jammed now. There is no room."""
"""Oh, I fixed that up long ago. I am going to bunk with the steward."""
"""Well, why in the world didn't you let us know you were coming?"""
"""Say, don't kid yourself. You knew I couldn't stay behind."" Fraser blew"
"a cloud of smoke airily. ""I never start anything I can't finish, I keep"
"telling you, and I'm going to put this deal through, now that I've got"
"it started."" With a half-embarrassed laugh and a complete change of"
"manner, he laid his hand upon Boyd's shoulder, saying: ""Pal, I ain't"
"much good to myself or anybody else, but I like you and I want to stick"
"around. Maybe I'll come in useful yet--you can't tell."""
"Emerson had never glimpsed this side of the man's nature, and it rather"
surprised him.
"""Of course you can come along, old man,"" he responded, heartily. ""We're"
"glad to have you."""
To one who has never witnessed the spring sailing of a Northern
"cannery-tender, the event is well worth seeing; it is one of the"
"""My lord,"" she said, kneeling at his feet, ""God save and comfort"
"you!""--"
The man's brow was twisted into furrows. His right hand clasped his
"left wrist. He looked over the woman's head into the woods, and"
breathed fast through clenched teeth.
"""Speak!"" he said."
"""My lord, the woman lives!"""
"""I can bear the truth!"""
The anchoress made the sign of the cross.
"""She came to us here in the valley, my lord, tall and white as a lily,"
"her hair loose upon her neck. Her feet were bare and bleeding, her"
"soles rent with thorns. And as she came, she sang wild snatches of a"
"song, such as tells of love, and of Proserpina, Goddess of Shades. We"
"took her, my lord, gave her meat and drink, bathed her torn feet, and"
"gave her raiment. She abode with us, ever gentle and lovely, yet"
"speaking like one who had suffered, even to the death. And yet,--even"
"as we slept, she stole away from us last night, and now is gone!""--"
The woman had never so much as raised her eyes to the man's face. Her
"hands held her crucifix, and she was ashen pale, even as new-hewn"
stone.
"""And is this all?"""
The man's voice trembled in his throat. His face was terrible to
"his coat. He stopped laughing then, by calculated degrees."
"""Sit down--sit down!"" said he wheezily. ""What's your hurry? You haven't"
told me yet what those few 'trifling formalities' are. And how am I to
"know whether--"""
"But Slyne was already beyond the doorway, fumbling with a last button."
"""If you believe I've come here to talk simply for the sake of talking,"""
"said he with sombre magnificence, ""I needn't waste any more breath on"
"you. Good-bye."""
"Captain Dove jumped out of his bunk. He was clearly impressed, in spite"
"of himself, by the other's indomitable assurance."
"""Come back, you fool!"" he called angrily. ""Come back. I want to know--"
"""I'll go ashore with you,"" he shouted, raising his voice, since Slyne"
was already on his way to the gangway. But Slyne did not seem to hear.
"""I'll take your offer--for Sallie,"" cried Captain Dove, in a slightly"
lower tone.
"Slyne hesitated in his stride, stopped, and turned back into the"
alleyway which led to the saloon.
"""What was that you said?"" he demanded of Captain Dove."
"""Come on inside,"" requested Captain Dove, more curtly."
"""I don't believe I will,"" Slyne declared, inwardly elated over the"
"winning of that somewhat risky move. ""You don't deserve another chance."
gilded by my father's abundant generosity.
We sat late after dinner. Somewhere in the hall Bilkins hovered with
glasses and tray to be on hand when the whistles began their screaming.
In twenty years he had not omitted this New Year's Eve ceremony.
"""Your wound never troubles you?"" my mother asked, her solicitation over"
a scratch I had received ten months before not disguising a light of
pride that charmed me.
"""I've forgotten it, Mater. Never amounted to anything."""
"""Still, you did leave some blood on French soil,"" Dad spoke up, for this"
conceit appealed to him.
"""Enough to grow an ugly rose, perhaps,"" I admitted."
"""I'll bet you grew pretty ones on the cheeks of those French girls,"" he"
chuckled.
"""Pretty ones don't grow any more, on cheeks or anywhere else,"" I"
"doggedly replied. ""Materialism's the keynote now--that's why I'm going"
"back to work, at once."""
"""Oh,"" the Mater laughed, ""don't think of your father's stupid office,"
"yet!"""
"""There's nothing left to think of,"" I grumbled."
"""Isn't there?"" he exclaimed. ""What'd you say if Gates has the yacht in"
"commission, and you take a run down to Miami----"""
spring. The illumination showed a moldy chamber with water dripping from
the walls in places.
At some distant day the chamber had evidently been occupied by human
"beings, for a great fire-place was cut in the rock at one end, and there"
were niches in the wall which had doubtless been used for storage. The
"floor was smooth, showing the work of human hands."
“Get onto the fire-place!” whispered Jimmie. “Where do you suppose the
smoke goes? There’s no chimney on the mountain.”
"“Probably it escapes through some opening in the rock,” Ned answered."
"“Do you suppose,” Jimmie asked, “that the smoke vent is large enough for"
us to hide in?”
"Before the words were out of the boy’s mouth, Ned was making toward the"
"fireplace. The light was out now, but Jimmie had no difficulty in"
following the boy in the darkness.
“Ned!” he called softly in a moment.
“Come on up!” whispered Ned.
"“Turn on the light, then,” Jimmie advised."
"Ned switched on the electric, but kept it inside the chimney into which"
he had climbed. Only a faint radiance reached the opening below.
"“Give me your hand,” whispered Ned, “and I’ll give you a lift.”"
The sound of voices and footsteps now echoed loudly through the cavern.
"comes after death!"""
"But he could not make his family laugh at this tale, either. His wife"
stood still; her face was beautiful.
"""So you're leaving now,"" was all she said."
Mr. Brede's porter came out with his luggage; he had stayed at the farm
for these three days in order to be at hand.
"Then the manufacturer walked down through the field, accompanied by his"
wife and children.
I don't know--this man with his good humor and kindliness and money and
"everything, fond of his children, all in all to his wife--"
Was he really everything to his wife?
"The first evening he wasted time on a party, and every night he wasted"
time in snoring. And so the three days and nights went by....

It is very pleasant here at harvest time. Scythes are being sharpened in
"the field, men and women are at work; they go thinly clad and bareheaded,"
and call to one another and laugh; sometimes they drink from a bucket of
"whey, then set to work again. There is the familiar fragrance of hay,"
"which penetrates my senses like a song of home, drawing me home, home,"
and then tell me how much probable space volume that so-called response
"represents."""
"The tech thought a minute. ""We've never run this gear anywhere"
"but at Radiation, right at Mojave labs, on Earth. Our spacial"
"coordinates--well, I'm afraid we--"" His voice trailed away unhappily."
Wilson picked up the interphone and barked a call.
"""Weston? Look, Hugh, can you get over here quick with a couple of your"
top astrogators? We've got a bunch of longhairs with a fancy infrawave
"detector and ranger, but the damned coordinates are set axially with"
"the ship."""
He listened to Hugh Weston's reply.
"""Yeah,"" he said then. ""We know where the target is with respect to the"
"ship, but we don't know the spacial attitude of the ship with respect"
"to the galactic check points. Right over? Good."""

"As Wilson hung up the dome flickered, then went into a regular"
_flash-flash-flash_ until something else came unglued and the dome
"went blank. There was shouting and rather heart-felt cussing, and some"
running around again before the dome light came back.
A tech--not the one that had come up before--moved into place alongside
the commodore.
"""Mr. Wilson, sir,"" he said, ""I wonder if--er--That is, sir--er--"""
"""But how'll we get ashore?"""
"""The tide'll be out towards morning."""
"""You mean _swim_?"" cried Pola. ""But I _can't_ swim! I--I--"""
"True, Pola's complex! Sidney hastened to reassure her."
"""When the tide's out it won't be over your head. And I'll help you."""
Lavender had already let the line of the dory slip out of his hand.
They saw the old boat become a shadowy outline as the tide carried it
"slowly away, then--nothing. Pola caught Sidney's hand and held it."
"""I'm not frightened--but it's so--_spooky_!"""
It had been decided that they should conceal themselves in the
"fo'castle cabin. They groped their way forward, Sidney guiding Pola in"
"the dark, for Lavender dared not light any of his matches. Stumbling,"
"scarcely breathing, they slipped down the companion ladder and crawled"
"into the small, ill-ventilated cabin. Sidney sat down upon some"
tarpaulins. Pola crouched close to Sidney's side. Lav and Mart stowed
themselves upon one of the bunks.
"""There--now we'll wait!"""
"""I--I wish I knew what _for_!"" whispered Pola. The smell of rank bilge"
"water, the lift and drop of the boat sickened her. The wind was whining"
and that and the swish of the water against the sides of the boat
terrified the girl.
In a few short words Lav vouchsafed Pola a little information. Like
measure of arbitrariness.

"“Keep still, you little dunce!” Ned said."
"“If he sticks his head up here, soak him!” advised Jimmie."
"“Don’t you think I won’t,” Ned returned."
But Huga did not enter the huge old fireplace at all. When he flashed
"his light into the chimney he saw only straight up, and the vertical"
passage from the fire-flue was too small for even a small cat to
negotiate.
The chamber into which the boys had found their way was directly at the
"back of the flue, and might have been seen by a more careful man. The"
boys chuckled as the half-breed turned away.
In a few minutes the sounds of pursuit ceased entirely. Lights no longer
"flashed about the room, creating a faint mist in the fireplace below."
Still the boys were not certain that the outlaws had abandoned the hunt.
"“Say, Ned,” Jimmie whispered, directly, poking Ned in the ribs, “you"
"didn’t bring one of those bear steaks with you, did you?”"
"“Why, Jimmie,” Ned said in pretended amazement, “you’re not getting"
"hungry, are you? I’m astonished at that!”"
“Hungry!” repeated the boy. “I feel as if I could eat my way through
this rock like a mouse eats through cheese! And I could drink a barrel
of water. There never was such a thirst.”
"""When do you propose to make the start, Colonel?"" Nicholson asked."
"""Within an hour. The night favors us. The women must be kept in the"
center as much as possible. I have given Geoffries special charge over
them. They will be told at the last moment. There is no use in
"spoiling what little rest they have had."" He drew out a pencil and"
"began to scribble a despatch on the back of an old letter. ""I advise"
"you gentlemen to do likewise,"" he said. ""Very often a piece of paper"
"gets through where a man can not, and it is our bounden duty to supply"
"the morning periodicals with as much news as possible."""
For some minutes there was no sound save that of the pencils scrawling
the last messages of men with the seal of death already stamped upon
"their foreheads. All three had forgotten Travers, and yet from the"
moment they had begun to speak he had been awake and listening. He sat
"up now, leaning upon his elbow."
"""Nicholson!"" he said faintly."
Nicholson turned and came to his side.
"""Hullo!"" he said. ""Awake, are you? How are you?"""
Travers made no immediate answer; he took Nicholson's hand in a
feverish clasp and drew him nearer.
"""I am in great pain,"" he said. ""You don't need to pretend. I know. The"
fear of death has been on me all day. Just now I am not afraid. Is
"there no hope?"""
"""You mean--for us? None."""
"As an anaesthetic, horses and cattle require from 4 to 16 ozs. Smaller"
animals from 4 drs. to 4 ozs. Chloroform is usually prescribed for
large animals and ether for smaller animals. Ether never paralyzes a

"She took from her handkerchief a beautiful little casket of blue onyx,"
"upon which reposed the Pendleton crest in diamonds, touched a spring,"
and revealed four rings sparkling about as many velvet cushions. The
four men stood speechless; not one dared protest his sincerity and see
ridicule in the eyes of his neighbour.
"Mrs. Pendleton dropped her judicial air, and taking the ruby between her"
"fingers, smiled like a teacher bestowing a prize."
"“Mr. Boswell,” she said, “I believe this belongs to you;” and she handed"
the ring to the stupefied author. He put it in his pocket with never a
word.
"She raised the emerald. “Mr. Trent, this is yours?—or is it the"
sapphire?”
"[Illustration: “‘WELL, WHY DON’T YOU GO?’”]"
"“The emerald,” snorted Trent."
"She dropped it in his nerveless palm with a gracious bend of the head,"
and turned to Teddy.
"“You gave me a solitaire, I remember,” she said sweetly. “A most"
"appropriate gift, for it is the ideal life.”"
"Teddy looked as if about to burst into tears, gave her one beseeching"
"glance, then took his ring and strode feebly over the cliffs. Trent and"

"""Why, you're wounded!"" exclaimed the sub-lieutenant, noticing a dark"
and increasing patch upon Aubyn's coat.
"""Am I?"" asked Terence incredulously."
"Turning his head to ascertain the nature of his injury, of which"
"hitherto he was unconscious, his shoulder slipped along the curved"
steel wall. Garboard was only just in time to save him from
collapsing inertly upon the deck of the ship he had brought safely
out of action.
"""Congratulations, old man. You'll have to get your tailor to make"
"some alteration in your uniform."""
"""What do you mean?"" asked Terence."
Two months had elapsed since the day on which Lieutenant Aubyn had
received a dangerous wound in his right side in the fight off Ostend.
"He was sitting in the grounds of the Royal Naval Hospital at Chatham,"
having made a fairly rapid recovery.
"The officer who offered his congratulations was Oswestry, the"
"torpedo-lieutenant of the ""Sunderland,"" who was also a convalescent,"
having managed to intercept a flying fragment of metal during the
momentous engagement.

*CHAPTER X.*
"*""THE OLD LION.""*"
"Grey Dumaresq, having settled matters with his servant, and adjusted the"
"disarray of his own dress and person, turned towards a group of men who"
"were standing round Lord Sandford, making believe to laugh and jest, but"
showing some vague symptoms of uneasiness as they cast sidelong glances
in the direction of their erstwhile comrade.
"Grey walked straight up to Lord Sandford, and looked him full in the"
eyes.  Did the glance of the other quail ever so little before his?  He
"thought so, but could scarce be certain."
Eva. Where was she?
"He popped erect and surveyed the room. It was traditional Jap anese,"
"the standard four-and-a-half tatami in size, bare and Spartan. A"
classic.
But the music. It seemed to be coming through the walls.
The walls. They all looked to be rice paper. He clambered up and headed
for the fusuma with the double-ax logo. He tested it and realized that
the paper was actually painted steel. And it was locked. The room was
secure as a vault.
"But across, opposite the _tokonoma_, was another set of sliding doors."
"As he turned to walk over, he noticed he was wearing _tabi_, light"
"cotton stockings split at the toe, and he was clad in a blue-patterned"
"_yukata_  robe, cinched at the waist. He'd been stripped and re-"
dressed.
"This door was real, and he shoved it open. A suite of rooms lay beyond,"
"and there on a second futon, still in a drugged sleep, lay Eva. He"
"moved across, bent down, and shook her. She jerked away, her dreaming"
"disrupted, and turned over, but she didn't come out of it."
"""Wake up."" He shook her again. ""The party just got moved. Wait'll you"
"get a load of the decor."""
"""What . . ."" She rolled back and cracked open her bloodshot eyes. Then"
she rose on one elbow and gazed around the room. It was appointed
"identically to his, with only the hanging scroll in the _tokonoma_"
"different, hers being an angular, three-level landscape. ""My God."""
not remember who gave me which.”
“Let us think. What sort of a stone would a politician be most likely to
choose?”
Mrs. Pendleton laughed. “A good idea. If couleur de rose be synonymous
"with conceit, then I think the ruby must have come from Mr. Trent.”"
"“I am sure of it. And as your author is always in the dumps, I am"
certain he takes naturally to the sapphire.”
“But the emerald—”
“Is emblematic of your deluded Teddy. The solitaire therefore falls
"naturally to Mr. Severance. Well, now that you have got through the"
"first interviews in safety, what are you going to do next?”"
"“Edith, I do not know. They are all so dreadfully in earnest that I"
"believe I shall finally take to my heels in down-right terror. But no, I"
won’t. I’ll come out of it with the upper hand and save my reputation as
"an actress. I will keep it up for two or three days more, but after that"
it will be impossible. They are bound to meet here sooner or later.
"Thank Heaven, we are rid of them for to-night, at least!”"
The manservant threw back the portière.
“Mr. Trent!”
"“Heavens!” cried Edith, under her breath; “I forgot to give orders that"
"we were not receiv—how do you do, Mr. Trent?”"
“And which is his ring?” Jessica made a frenzied dab at the jewels in
"""I'll do anything you say,"" promised Pola. ""I'm so curious that I'm"
"fairly bursting."""
"""I don't care, but you'll have to take off your shoes and stockings,"""
"muttered Lav, scarcely looking at Pola."
"""Oh, I'll do that! I'll do _anything_!"" Pola flopped upon the beach and"
"commenced removing her sport shoes. ""And I won't even ask any questions"
"until you're ready to tell me."" Rising, her small feet pink against the"
"sand, she saluted Lav with mock solemnity."
"""There, Captain Lavender Green, I'm at your command."""
Her pretty acquiescence won the girls at once. If any doubt assailed
"them as to the prudence of letting Pola go, their admiration for Pola's"
gameness stilled it. Sidney rolled Pola's shoes and stockings and her
own in her sweater and hid them behind some logs. Then the little party
waded out to the dory and embarked.
"""We're going to the _Arabella_,"" Sidney whispered to Pola. She felt"
"Pola shiver, but the girl made no protest. ""We have to go 'round this"
"way so's no one can see us from the harbor. Sh--h!"""
"Silently they boarded the old hull, Lavender last. With the line from"
the dory in his hand the boy considered.
"""If anyone comes up and sees the dory they'll know someone's aboard."""
"""That's true. What'll we do?"" whispered Sidney, anxiously."
"""We can set her adrift. It's an old tub anyway."""
"""Oh, that's all right,"" said Larsen, carelessly. ""Him and me used to"
"fish together."" And as if this were a sufficient explanation, he turned"
"back to his conversation, leaving Emerson to proceed on his way,"
"vaguely displeased at the episode, yet reflecting that heretofore he"
had never had occasion to doubt Larsen's loyalty.
"He found Cherry at home, and, flinging himself into one of her"
"easy-chairs, relieved his mind of the day's occurrences."
"""Marsh is building those traps purely out of spite,"" she declared,"
"indignantly, when he had finished. ""He doesn't need any more fish--he"
"has plenty of traps farther up the river."""
"""To be sure! It looks as if we might have to depend upon the"
"gill-netters."""
"""We will know before long. If the fish strike in where George expects,"
"Marsh will be out a pretty penny."""
"""And if they don't strike in where George expects, we will be out all"
"the expense of building that trap."""
"""Exactly! It's a fascinating business, isn't it? It's a business in"
which the unexpected is forever happening. But the stakes are high
"and--I know you will succeed."""
"Boyd smiled at her comforting assurance, her belief in him was always"
stimulating.
"""By-the-way,"" she continued, ""have you heard the historic story about"
"the pink salmon?"""
"""So! We know now what happened to Journeyman and the others!"" burst"
"out Dex. ""I'll see 'em in hell before I'll talk!"""
"""And me,"" nodded Brand. ""But that doesn't cure the situation. As long"
"as ships disappear in this red inferno, so long will the Old Man keep"
sending others to find out what's wrong. The Rogans will capture them
as easily as they captured us. And eventually someone will happen
"along who'll weaken under torture. Then--"""

He stopped. A dread vision filled his mind of Earth depopulated by the
"feebly ferocious Rogans, of rank on rank of Earth's vast armies"
falling in stricken rows at the shock of the Rogans' tubes.
"Greca caught the vision. She nodded. ""Yes, that is what would happen"
"if they found ways of reaching your globe."""
"""But, God, Brand, we can't allow that!"" cried Dex. ""We've got to find"
"a way to spike the guns of these walking gas-pipes, somehow!"""
"Brand sighed heavily. ""We are two against hundreds of thousands. We"
"are bare-handed, and the Rogans have those damned tubes. Anyway, we"
are on the verge of death at this very moment. What under heaven can
"we do to spike their guns?"""
He was silent a moment: and in the silence the steady hum from the
domed building outside came to his ears.
"""What's in that big, round topped building, Greca?"" he asked quietly."
"""I do not know, exactly,"" replied the girl. ""There is some sort of"

"And he went on, inveighing now against the pitifully human conventions"
"that restrained him from hurting the chit of a child, and now against"
the sorcery with which she contrived to invest the chamber wherein she
dwelt.
"“And at my age, too, when I 've run the whole gamut of human misery,"
the whole discordant thing--_toute la lyre_--when I've finished with the
"blighting illusion that men call life; when, confound it! I 'm thirty.”"
"Sir Oliver, unable to sleep, came into the room in dressing-gown and"
slippers. He looked very fragile and broken.
"“Here 's John,” laughed Herold, “saying that he 's thirty, and an old,"
"withered man, and he 's not thirty. He 's nine-and-twenty.”"
"Sir Oliver looked at John, as only age, with awful wistfulness, can"
"look at youth, and came and laid his hand upon the young man's broad"
shoulders.
"“My lad,” said he, “you've had a bad time; but you 're young. You've"

John threw a half-finished cigar angrily into the fire.

Inserts[42] are almost always printed upon coated paper.
"Laid[42] paper is used in more expensive books, as, from its nature,"
better and more costly stock is required in its making.
THE PRESSWORK
"Books are printed in forms[42] of 4 pages and multiples of 4 pages,"
"depending upon the size of the paper leaf. The usual form is 32 pages,"
so the publisher tries to plan his volume to make approximately even
forms. To print any number of pages over an even form is as expensive
as to print the complete 32 pages.[43]
THE BINDING
"In binding, the questions to be settled include the style of"
"back,--flat, half-round, or round; plain or gilt-top; headband[45]"
"or not; trimmed or uncut edges;[44] kind of cloth,--T pattern,[45]"
"silk,[45] vellum,[45] etc.; color and shade of cloth; location of dies;"
"stamping,--ink, foil, gold or Oriental tissue, etc.; jacket,--glassine,"
"manila, or printed."
THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BOOK

"She nodded, then stepped over and laid her weapon beside the bundles of"
securities. Vance took one last look at the Smith & Wesson in his own
hand and did the same. Even ex-archaeologists could do arithmetic.
All this time Vera Karanova had said nothing. She merely stood watching
"the proceedings with a detached smile. Finally she spoke. ""Now we can"
"proceed with the counting,"" she said calmly."
"""Maybe you don't fully grasp the situation here, comrade."" Vance stared"
"at her. ""Those gorillas aren't dropping in for tea. We've got to stand"
"together."""
"She burst out laughing. ""Mr. Vance, you are truly naive. No, you're"
worse. You actually thought you could sabotage the most powerful new
"global alliance of the twentieth century."" Her dark eyes were gradually"
"turning glacial. ""It will not be allowed to happen, believe me."""
"My God, he realized, that's why she wanted to get her hands on the"

figure out the switch. She's no longer working for T-Directorate; she's

them.

"""Maybe he dropped the knife,"" said the watchman, and began to search"
"about the floor, followed by the others."
"""It may have been the woman herself who stabbed Mr. Marsh,"" offered"
"Emerson. ""He was strangling her when I arrived."""
"Roused by this statement to a fresh denial, Marsh cried out:"
"""I tell you there wasn't any woman."""
"""And there isn't any knife either,"" Emerson sneered."
The men paused uncertainly. Seeing that they were undecided whether to
"believe him or his assailant, Marsh went on:"
"""If he hasn't a knife, then he must have had a friend with him--"""
"""Then tell your men what we were doing in here and how you came to be"
"alone with us in the dark."" Emerson stared at his accuser curiously,"
"but the Trust's manager seemed at a loss. ""See here, Marsh, if you will"
"tell us whom you were choking, maybe we can get at the truth of this"
"affair."""
"Without answering, Marsh rose, and, leaning upon the watchman's arm,"
said:
"""Help me up to the house. I'm hurt. Send the launch to the upper plant"
"for John; he knows something about medicine."" With no further word, he"
"made his way out of the building, followed by the mystified fishermen."
"No one undertook to detain Emerson, and he went his way, wondering what"
lay back of the night's adventure. He racked his brain for a hint as to
"hands and arms a long pair of motoring doeskin gloves. By George, she"
"was a winner—in general looks, though. Well, something about the clerk,"
"I suppose, must have aroused her suspicions. For, a moment later, she"
was gone in the crowd. Evidently she had thought of the danger and had
picked out a time when the lobby would be full and everybody busy. But
she did not leave by the front entrance through which she entered. I
concluded that she must have left by one of the side street carriage
doors.”
“And she got away?”
“Yes. I found that she asked one of the boys at the door to crank up a
"car standing at the curb. She slid into the seat, and was off in a"
minute.”
Kennedy said nothing. But I knew that he was making a mighty effort to
restrain comment on the bungling amateur detective work of the son of
our client.
"Reginald saw the look on his face. “Still,” he hastened, “I got the"
number of the car. It was 200859 New York.”
“You have looked it up?” queried Kennedy quickly.
“I didn’t need to do it. A few minutes later Dr. Rae Wilson herself
came out—storming like mad. Her car had been stolen at the very door of
the hotel by this woman with the innocent aid of the hotel employees.”
Kennedy was evidently keenly interested. The mention of the stolen car
had apparently at once suggested an idea to him.
"“Mrs. Blake,” he said, as he rose to go, “I shall take this letter with"
commoners unless raised in rank by marriage or merit.
(_f_) The title _Lady_ belongs to daughters of all noblemen not lower
than earl.
(_g_) The title _Hon._ belongs to daughters of viscounts and barons;

has the title _Lady_ becomes maid-of-honor she does not acquire the
title _Hon._
Index compound names according to the usage of the author's
"fatherland, though if it is known that his practice differs from"
"this usage, his preference should be followed. Compound names"
then go:
"(_a_) If English, under the last part of the name, when the first has"
"not been used alone by the author: e.g., _Gould, Sabine Baring-_;"
"but _Halliwell (afterwards Halliwell-Phillipps), J. O._, and _Locker"
"(afterwards Locker-Lampson)_, because they are well-known under the"
first names.
"(_b_) If foreign, under the first part."
Both such compound names as _Gentil-Bernard_ and such as _Gentil de
"Chavagnac_. There are various exceptions, when a name has been more"
"known under the last part, as _Fénelon_, not _Salignac de Lamothe"
"Fénelon_; _Voltaire_, not _Arouet de Voltaire_; _Sternberg_, not"
"_Ungern-Sternberg_. Moreover, it is not always easy to determine"
what is a compound surname in French. Cross-references are necessary
"whichever way one decides each case, especially when the second part"
"for herself, but with fear for me. No one can reassure her. In fact it"
was as much for her sake as anyone’s that I sent for you. Reginald has
"tried to trace the thing down himself, but has not succeeded.”"
She paused. The door opened and Reginald Blake entered. He was a young
"fellow, self confident and no doubt very efficient at the new dances,"
"though scarcely fitted to rub elbows with a cold world which, outside"
"of his own immediate circle, knew not the name of Blake. He stood for a"
moment regarding us through the smoke of his cigarette.
"“Tell me just what you have done,” asked Kennedy of him as his mother"
"introduced him, although he had done the talking for her over the"
telephone.
"“Done?” he drawled. “Why, as soon as mother told me of the letter, I"
"left an envelope up at the Prince Henry, as it directed.”"
“With the money?” put in Craig quickly.
"“Oh, no—just as a decoy.”"
“Yes. What happened?”
"“Well, I waited around a long time. It was far along in the day when a"
woman appeared at the desk. I had instructed the clerk to be on the
watch for anyone who asked for mail addressed to a Dr. Hopf. The clerk
slammed the register. That was the signal. I moved up closer.”
“What did she look like?” asked Kennedy keenly.
"“I couldn’t see her face. But she was beautifully dressed, with a long"
"light flowing linen duster, a veil that hid her features and on her"
obstinately.
"'Wait,' he said; 'I will ask.'"
But when the old housekeeper came she had only the same tale to tell.
She was alone. No young woman had crossed the threshold for a week
"past. There was no other woman there, young or old."
'You will have it that I have a young man in the house next!' she
"grumbled, shooting scorn at me."
"'I can assure you that there is no one here,' Herr Krapp said civilly."
"'Dorcas has been with me many years, and I can trust her. Still if you"
like you can walk through the rooms.'
"But I hesitated to do that. The man's manner evidenced his sincerity,"
"and in face of it my belief wavered. Fancy, I began to think, had"
played me a trick. It was no great wonder if the features which were
"often before me in my dreams, and sometimes painted themselves on the"
"darkness while I lay wakeful, had for once taken shape in the"
"daylight, and so vividly as to deceive me. I apologised. I said what"
"was proper, and, with a heavy sigh, went from the door."
"Ay, and with bent head. The passing crowd and the sunshine and the"
distant music of drum and trumpet grated on me. For there was yet
another explanation. And I feared that Marie was dead.
I was still brooding sadly over the matter when I reached home. Steve
"met me at the door, but, feeling in no mood for small talk just then,"
"I would have passed him by and gone in, if he had not stopped me."
"'I have a message for you, lieutenant,' he said."
"stood a pile of grips, stacked up, packed, and undisturbed."
Winters who had been studying the room while we got our bearings picked
up a queer-looking revolver from the floor. As he held it up I could
see that along the top of the barrel was a long cylinder with a ratchet
or catch at the butt end. He turned it over and over carefully.
"“By George,” he muttered, “it has been fired off.”"
Kennedy glanced more minutely at the body. There was not a mark on it.
I stared about vacantly at the place where Winters had picked the thing
up.
"“Look,” I cried, my eye catching a little hole in the baseboard of the"
woodwork near it.
"“It must have fallen and exploded on the floor,” remarked Kennedy. “Let"
"me see it, Winters.”"
Craig held it at arm’s length and pulled the catch. Instead of an
"explosion, there came a cone of light from the top of the gun. As"
"Kennedy moved it over the wall, I saw in the center of the circle of"
light a dark spot.
"“A new invention,” Craig explained. “All you need to do is to move it"
so that little dark spot falls directly on an object. Pull the
trigger—the bullet strikes the dark spot. Even a nervous and unskilled
marksman becomes a good shot in the dark. He can even shoot from behind
the protection of something—and hit accurately.”
It was too much for me. I could only stand and watch Kennedy as he
deftly bent over Schloss again and placed a piece of chemically
"“You’ve been under arrest for ten minutes, ‘Silky’ Bob. Chicago thinks"
you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat
"with you. Going quietly, are you? That’s sensible. Now, before we go on"
to the station here’s a note I was asked to hand you. You may read it
here at the window. It’s from Patrolman Wells.”
The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him.

the time he had finished. The note was rather short.

LOST ON DRESS PARADE
Mr. Towers Chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom.
One iron was heating on a small gas stove; the other was being pushed
vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be
seen later on extending in straight lines from Mr. Chandler’s patent
leather shoes to the edge of his low-cut vest. So much of the hero’s
toilet may be intrusted to our confidence. The remainder may be guessed
by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient. Our next
view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging-house
breakwater.
"The skipper, who had been lying flat when the others jumped for the"
"main deck, got up and crawled forward to the break of the poop.  He"
was half-paralysed with a mixture of funk and rage.  He addressed
"himself and his remarks to the sky, the sea, and the island, but"
above all to Lampert.
"""You man-drowning, slop-built caricature of a sailorman, what 'ave"
"you bin and done with my ship?"" he bellowed.  ""Oh, Lord, I'm a ruined"
"man; by gosh, I'll murder you!"""
"He tumbled down on the main deck and made for Lampert, who easily"
dodged him.
"""Shut up, you old idiot!"" said the mate contemptuously.  ""Who but me"
"told you that if you drove her in thick weather, and no sun seen for"
"a week, you'd pile her up?"""
Simcox caught Jones and held him.
"""Good lord, sir,"" said the second greaser, ""it's no time to fight."""
"""No, it ain't,"" said Jack Hart boldly."
"That a foremast hand should dare to shove his oar in, almost cowed"
the poor old Guffin.  It was something out of nature.
"""It ain't no time for jawbation,"" insisted Hart, about whom the"
"others had gathered.  ""It's time for thinkin' out the politics of the"
"situation, and if I'm not mistaken we shall be able to walk ashore by"
"the morning, and there won't be no ship for any one to command--so"
Her complacency irritated him. The canary never ceased his ear-splitting
"noise. The canary is a beautiful, gentle bird--stuffed; alive, he is"
pestilence made vocal. Risca lost his temper.
"“Surely you must know, Aunt Gladys. I 've been wandering through hell"
with a pack of little devils at my heels.”
"Startled, she lifted up her arms and dropped Dandy, who slithered down"
her dress and sought a morose shelter under the table.
“My dear John!” she exclaimed.
"“I'm very sorry; I did n't mean to use strong language,” said he,"
putting his hands to his ears. “It's all that infernal canary.”
"“Oh, poor Dickie! Don't you like to hear Dickie sing? He sings so"
"beautifully. The gas-man was here the other day and said that, if I"
"liked, he would enter him for a competition, and he was sure he would"
"get first prize. But if you don't like to hear him, dear--though I"
really can't understand why--I can easily make him stop.” She drew a
white napkin from the drawer of the table on which the cage was placed
and threw it over the top. The feathered steam-whistle swallowed his din
"in an angry gurgle or two and became silent “Poor Dickie, he thinks it"
"'s a snowstorm! What were we talking about, John? Do sit down.”"
"John resumed his seat on the slippery couch, and Miss Lindon, having"
"snatched Dandy from his lair, sat by his side, depositing the dog"
between them.
"“You asked me what I had been doing for the last few years,” said he."
"neither she nor I cared to go, we should take the letters to Dover, cross"
"to Calais, and post them in France."
"I sprang at the idea, but immediately sprang back, saying: ""But it is not"
"entirely proper for us to travel to Calais together, even though you are"
"my sister-cousin."""
"""We may take father,"" she suggested. ""Sarah wants to visit Lady St."
"Albans, and she can go if we take father with us. And, Baron Ned; I have"
"another suggestion to offer. Let us take Bettina."""
I sprang at that proposal and did not spring back. So we went first to my
"uncle, who said he would go with us, and then we went to see Bettina. She"
"had recovered from her sprains and bruises, although she was still pale"
and not quite strong.
"When Frances asked her to go with us, she answered, ""Ay, gladly, if"
"father consents."""
"Pickering, who was sitting with us at the time in Bettina's cozy parlor,"
"turned to me, laughing, and said:--"
"""You would suppose, from Betty's remark, that I am master here, but the"
"truth is my soul is not my own, and now her modest request for permission"
"is made for effect on the company."""
"Betty ran to her father, sat on his knee, twined her arm about his neck,"
and kissed him as a protest against the unjust insinuation.
"""You see how she does it,"" said Pickering. ""No hammer and tongs for"
"Betty; just oil and honey."""
"""All right,"" Slyne repeated. ""We'll lunch at two--after they're all"
"signed. So--off you go, and get busy."""
"The stout solicitor hurried away, cowed and obedient again, and Slyne,"
"very smart in an almost new flannel suit, rejoined Captain Dove."
"""I'm _too_ fashionable, that's what's the matter with me!"" declared"
"Captain Dove with sudden conviction at sight of him, and gazed very"
bitterly at his own image in an inconvenient mirror.
"""Never mind about that,"" Slyne advised soothingly. ""It's not as if you"
"were staying here, you know. You'll be back on board your ship by"
"supper-time. And now, I must tell you how we've got to handle this"
lawyer-fellow when he fetches in the raft of papers he'll want us all to
"sign."""
"Captain Dove listened gloomily while he went on to explain, at"
"considerable length, and in his most convincing manner, that they must"
match their combined wits against the lawyer's for their own profit.
"""It's not that I don't trust him,"" said Slyne, ""but--I'll feel more"
secure after everything's settled in writing and signed. He can't go
"back on us then."""
"""He'd better not!"" Captain Dove commented. ""I'll wring his neck for him"
"if he tries--"""
"""And, as for Sallie,"" Slyne cut him short, ""I've made things quite--"""
"""Sallie will do whatever I tell her,"" growled Captain Dove. ""And don't"
you attempt to interfere between me and her--till you've paid me my
"But Johnson was not in a laughing mood. Indeed, he looked very grave and"
serious when presently he said:
"""But people coming up here and finding me might--"""
The Girl looked up at him in blank amazement.
"""Might what?"" And then, while she waited for his answer, two shots in"
close succession rang out in the night with great distinctness.
There was no mistaking the nearness of the sound. Instantly scenting
"trouble and alert at the possibility of danger, Johnson inquired:"
"""What's that? What's that?"""
"""Wait! Wait!"" came back from the Girl, unconsciously in the same tone,"
while she strained her ears for other sounds. She did not have long to
"wait, however, before other shots followed, the last ones coming from"
"further away, so it seemed, and at greater intervals."
"""They've got a road agent--it's the posse--p'r'aps they've got Ramerrez"
"or one o' his band!"" suddenly declared the Girl, at the same time"
"rushing over to the window for some verification of her words. But, as"
"before, the wind was beating with great force against the frosted panes,"
and only a vast stretch of snow met her gaze. Turning away from the
"window she now came towards him with: ""You see, whoever it is, they're"
"snowed in--they can't get away."""
Johnson knitted his brows and muttered something under his breath which
the Girl did not catch.
Again a shot was fired.
"roof!"""
"""My God!  You gave a piece of your mind to the police inspector of this"
"district!"""
"""Wouldn't you accept some small hospitality from me?  When I lived with"
"you, you were ..."""
"""Gratitude must be encouraged because it is seldom met with.  You seem"
"to be a good man, and, though I don't remember you, still I will go"
with you into the public-house and drink to your success and future
"prospects with the greatest pleasure."""
"""You seem always the same ...  Are you always joking?"""
"""What else can one do, living among you unfortunate men?"""
"They went.  Sometimes the Captain's former customer, uplifted and"
"unsettled by the entertainment, returned to the dosshouse, and on the"
following morning they would again begin treating each other till the
Captain's companion would wake up to realise that he had spent all his
money in drink.
"""Your honour, do you see that I have again fallen into your hands?"
"What shall we do now?"""
"""The position, no doubt, is not a very good one, but still you need not"
"trouble about it,"" reasoned the Captain.  ""You must, my friend, treat"
"everything indifferently, without spoiling yourself by philosophy, and"
without asking yourself any question.  To philosophise is always
"foolish; to philosophise with a drunken headache, ineffably so."
Drunken headaches require vodki and not the remorse of conscience or
"twenty...."""
My own thoughts run away with me as I stand there wishing I were somewhere
"else. Perhaps she, too, in her room wishes me far away."
"""Good-bye,"" I say to the actor. ""Will you remember me to Miss Torsen? I"
"must go now."""
"""Good-bye,"" says he, shaking hands in some surprise. ""Can't you wait a few"
"minutes? Well, all right, I'll give her your greeting. Good-bye,"
"good-bye."""
"I take a short cut to get out of the way, and as I know every nook and"
"corner, I am soon outside the farm, and find a good shelter. From here I"
shall see when these two leave. She has only to say good-bye now to the
people of the farm.
It struck me that yesterday was the last time I spoke to her. We spoke
"only a few insignificant words that I have forgotten, and today I have not"
spoken to her....
Here they come.
Curious--they seemed somehow to have become welded together; though they
"walked separately up the mountain track, yet they belonged together. They"
did not speak; the essential things had probably already been said. Life
had grown ordinary for them; it still remained to them to be of use to
"each other. He walked first, while she followed many paces behind; it was"
lonely to look at against the rugged background of the mountain. Where had
her tall figure gone to? She seemed to have grown shorter because she had
hitched up her skirt and was carrying her knapsack on her back. They each
"carried one, but he carried hers and she his, probably because, owing to"
"sheer ecstatic bravado, emitted a Tarzan roar."
Instantly a weight hit the door from the outside. It shuddered but did
"not give. Dennis crouched, gripping his knife. Frank Corson staggered to"
his feet and hurled himself groggily at the android. Dennis roared
"again, pushed away and arced the knife at his throat."
"Rhoda screamed and lunged at Dennis' legs. ""No! No! Stop it! Please!"""
Dennis teetered under her weight and the knife slanted downward across
Frank's chest. It ripped a red gash as the door shuddered a third time.
Dennis turned in that direction and crouched. The door splintered and
"flew open. Dennis lunged, like a line-bucking football player. He hit"
"both Brent Taber and Captain Abrams simultaneously, sprawling them both"
and sending Abrams' gun spinning out of his hand.
He leaped over them and dashed down the hall where the elevator man
"waited uncertainly, not sure whether to dispute the right of way or not."
"His indecision was fatal. Dennis wrapped an arm around his neck, pulled"
his head back and cut his throat with one slash of the knife.
Captain Abrams' head had hit a doorjamb opposite the entrance to Rhoda's
apartment. He stirred and tried to come erect but he was unable to make
it.
Brent Taber clawed the gun off the floor and came to one knee. He got
off one shot as the elevator door was closing and saw the android spin
away from the controls as the impact of the slug smashed the bone of his
shoulder.
Taber lunged to his feet and went for the stairs.
rather know that George had gone to Canada than to fear his return to
England under the circumstances.
"""The dastardly king will take his life if he comes,"" she said."
"""I admit the danger,"" I answered, as hopefully as possible, ""but I"
"believe, if George comes, he will be able to take care of himself."""
"""Danger!"" she exclaimed. ""It is certain death! George will find no"
"mercy."""
"""If he is caught,"" I answered. ""But the letter from King Louis will"
convince King Charles that Hamilton is in Canada and will throw our
jealous monarch off his guard. Perhaps Hamilton will be safer than we
"suppose. He speaks French like a Parisian, but, above all, he is cool,"
"calm, and thoughtful in danger. The London merchants will be far more"
"dangerous than the king."""
"""It does seem that we are guilty of treason to our country in thus"
"helping France,"" she said. Then laughingly, ""But I'll go back to the"
"palace at once and begin my task of wheedling the king."" She paused for a"
"moment, then continued hesitatingly, ""Do you suppose it possible that"
"George would doubt me afterwards?"""
"""Impossible,"" I answered, with emphasis that seemed to reassure her."
"""I am doing it for him,"" she continued with a sigh. ""God knows I would"
"do almost anything in the same cause. But I do not know men, and I fear"
it is possible that he will doubt me after I have succeeded. Let us go
"to see Betty. She is restful to me, and always soothes my nerves. But"
"besides, I want to have her help. I'll introduce her to the king--"""
even good Frank Villiers has hazarded a reverent guess at his friend's
"great secret--but to the uninstructed, what does she seem?"
"Nothing but a WOMAN, MOST PURE WOMANLY; a woman whose influence on all"
"is strangely sweet and lasting,--whose spirit overflows with tenderest"
"sympathy for the many wants and sorrows of mankind,--whose voice charms"
"away care,--whose smile engenders peace,--whose eyes, lustrous and"
"thoughtful, are unclouded by any shadow of sin,--and on whose serene"
beauty the passing of years leaves no visible trace. That she is fair
"and wise, joyous, radiant, and holy is apparent to all,--but only the"
"Poet, her lover and lord, her subject and servant, can tell how truly"
his Edris is not so much sweet woman as most perfect Angel! A Dream of
Heaven made human! ... Let some of us hesitate ere we doubt the
"Miracle; for we are sleepers and dreamers all,--and the hour is close"
at hand when--we shall Wake.
THE END.
"suppose both of you will have to one of these days, when you get older;"
but I don't like to think of it.”
"“I don't believe I shall ever marry, Stellamaris,” said Herold."
“Why?”
Herold looked out to sea for a wistful instant. “Because one can't marry
"a dream, my dear.”"
"“I've married hundreds,” said Stella, softly."
"If they had been alone together, they would have talked dreams and"
"visions and starshine and moonshine, and their conversation would"
have been about as sensible and as satisfactory to each other and as
intelligible to a third party as that of a couple of elves sitting on
adjacent toadstools; but elves don't talk in the presence of a third
"party, even though he be John Risca and Great High Belovedest. And"
"Stellamaris, recognizing this instinctively, turned her eyes quickly to"
Risca.
"“And you, dear--will you ever marry?”"
"“Never, by Heaven!” cried John, with startling fervency."
Stella reached out both her hands to the two men who incorporated the
"all in all of her little life, and each man took a hand and kissed it."
"“I don't want to be horrid and selfish,” she said; “but if I lost either"
"of you, I think it would break my heart.”"
The men exchanged glances. John repeated his query: “Do you think it's
"No one spoke, and I looked from one to another. The men had returned"
"from the search, and stood in a dark group round the body, which they"
"had drawn to the side of the road. It wanted an hour of daylight yet,"
"and I could not see their faces, but I read in their silence the"
answer that no one liked to put into words.
"'Be a man!' Steve muttered, after a long pause. 'God help the girl."
But God help us too if we are found here!'
"Still my lady did not speak, and I knew her brave heart too well to"
"doubt her, though she had been the first to talk of going. 'Get to"
"horse,' I said roughly."
"'No, no,' my lady cried at last. 'We will all stay, Martin.'"
"'Ay, all stay or all go!' Steve muttered."
"'Then all go!' I said, choking down the sobs that would rise. And I"
turned first from the place.
I will not try to state what that cost me. I saw my girl's face
"everywhere--everywhere in the darkness, and the eyes reproached me."
"That she of all should suffer, who had never fainted, never faltered,"
whose patience and courage had been the women's stay from the
"first--that she should suffer! I thought of the tender, weak body, and"
"of all the things that might happen to her, and I seemed, as I went"
"away from her, the vilest thing that lived."
But reason was against me. If I stayed there and waited on the road
"by the old crone's body until morning, what could I do? Whither could"
I turn? Marie was gone and already might be half a dozen miles away.
"So the bonds of custom and duty held me. Dazed and bewildered, I"
"on his feet once more, pulling his clothes to rights, we looked at each"
"other. I had no wish to speak to him further, and left him. Besides, he"
was going away soon.
"After this, everything was dull and empty again. I went out alone, aping"
"myself and shouting: ""Bricks for the palace! The calf is much stronger"
"today!"" And when this was done, I did other nothings, and when my money"
"began to run out, I wrote to my publisher, pretending I would soon send"
"him an unbelievably remarkable manuscript. In short, I behaved like a man"
in love. These were the typical symptoms.
And to take the bull by the horns: no doubt you suspect me of dwelling on
the subject of Miss Torsen out of self-interest? In that case I must have
concealed well in these pages that I never think of her except as an
"object, as a theme; turn back the pages and you will see! At my age, one"
"does not fall in love without becoming grotesque, without making even the"
Pharaohs laugh.
*       *       *       *       *
_Finis._
"But there is one thing I cannot finish doing, and that is withdrawing to"
"my room, and sitting alone with the good darkness round me. This, after"
"all, is the last pleasure."
An interlude:
Miss Torsen and her actor are walking this way; I hear their footsteps and
"their voices; but since I am sitting in the dark of the evening, I cannot"
"see them. They stop outside my open window, leaning against it, and the"
"actor says something, asks her to do something she does not want to do,"
"At that hour before the theatres rose, a lull brooded in the London"
"streets; in this quiet narrow one, the town's hum was only broken by the"
clack of a half-drunken woman bickering at her man as they lurched along
"for home, and the strains of a street musician's fiddle, trying to make"
"up for a blank day.  The sound vaguely irritated Winton, reminding him of"
those two damnable foreigners by whom she had been so treated.  To have
them at the point of a sword or pistol--to teach them a lesson!  He heard
her say:
"""Dad, I should like to pay his debts.  Then things would be as they were"
"when I married him."""
He emitted an exasperated sound.  He did not believe in heaping coals of
fire.
"""I want to make sure, too, that the girl is all right till she's over her"
"trouble.  Perhaps I could use some of that--that other money, if mine is"
"all tied up?"""
"It was sheer anger, not disapproval of her impulse, that made him"
hesitate; money and revenge would never be associated in his mind. Gyp
went on:
"""I want to feel as if I'd never let him marry me.  Perhaps his debts are"
"all part of that--who knows?  Please!"""
"Winton looked at her.  How like--when she said that ""Please!""  How"
"like--her figure sunk back in the old chair, and the face lifted in"
shadow!  A sort of exultation came to him.  He had got her back--had got
her back!
a nice room. It ain’t often vacant. I had some most elegant people in
"it last summer—no trouble at all, and paid in advance to the minute."
The water’s at the end of the hall. Sprowls and Mooney kept it three
months. They done a vaudeville sketch. Miss B’retta Sprowls—you may
"have heard of her—Oh, that was just the stage names—right there over"
"the dresser is where the marriage certificate hung, framed. The gas is"
"here, and you see there is plenty of closet room. It’s a room everybody"
likes. It never stays idle long.”
“Do you have many theatrical people rooming here?” asked the young man.
“They comes and goes. A good proportion of my lodgers is connected with
"the theatres. Yes, sir, this is the theatrical district. Actor people"
"never stays long anywhere. I get my share. Yes, they comes and they"
goes.”
"He engaged the room, paying for a week in advance. He was tired, he"
"said, and would take possession at once. He counted out the money. The"
"room had been made ready, she said, even to towels and water. As the"
"housekeeper moved away he put, for the thousandth time, the question"
that he carried at the end of his tongue.
“A young girl—Miss Vashner—Miss Eloise Vashner—do you remember such a
"one among your lodgers? She would be singing on the stage, most likely."
"A fair girl, of medium height and slender, with reddish, gold hair and"
a dark mole near her left eyebrow.”
"“No, I don’t remember the name. Them stage people has names they change"
"as often as their rooms. They comes and they goes. No, I don’t call"
that one to mind.”
No. Always no. Five months of ceaseless interrogation and the
"""You do!"""
"""I admit that every circumstance points to--"""
"""Stop! Don't you give me any more o' that Webster Unabridged. You git to"
"cases. If you didn't come here to steal you came to The Polka to rob it,"
"didn't you?"""
"Johnson, his eyes lowered, was forced to admit that such were his"
"intentions, adding swiftly:"
"""But when I knew about you--"" He broke off and took a step towards her."
"""Wait! Wait! Wait where you are! Don't you take a step further or"
"I'll--"" She made a significant gesture towards her bosom, and then,"
"laughing harshly, went on denouncingly: ""A road agent! A road agent!"
"Well, ain't it my luck! Wouldn't anybody know to look at me that a"
"gentleman wouldn't fall my way! A road agent! A road agent!"" And again"
"she laughed bitterly before going on: ""But now you can git--git, you"
"thief, you imposer on a decent woman! I ought to have tol' 'em all, but"
I wa'n't goin' to be the joke o' the world with you behind the curtains
an' me eatin' charlotte rusks an' lemming turnovers an' a-polkyin' with
"a road agent! But now you can git--git, do you hear me?"""
Johnson heard her to the end with bowed head; and so scathing had been
her denunciations of his actions that the fact that pride alone kept her
from breaking down completely escaped his notice. With his eyes still
downcast be said in painful fragments:
"""One word only--only a word and I'm not going to say anything in defence"
of myself. For it's all true--everything is true except that I would
"“This is up-to-date gambling in cleaned-up New York,” he remarked as we"
waited for the elevator to return for us. “And the worst of it all is
that it gets the women as well as the men. Once they are caught in the
"net, they are the most powerful lure to men that the gamblers have yet"
devised.”
"We rode down in silence, and as we went down the steps to the street, I"
"noticed the man whom we had seen watching the place, lurking down at"
the lower corner. Kennedy quickened his pace and came up behind him.
"“Why, Winters!” exclaimed Craig. “You here?”"
"“I might say the same to you,” grinned the detective not displeased"
evidently that our trail had crossed his. “I suppose you are looking
"for Schloss, too. He’s up in the Recherche a great deal, playing poker."
I understand he owns an interest in the game up there.”
"Kennedy nodded, but said nothing."
“I just saw one of the cappers for the place go out before you went
in.”
“Capper?” repeated Kennedy surprised. “Antoinette Moulton a steerer for
a gambling joint? What can a rich society woman have to do with a place
like that or a man like Schloss?”
Winters smiled sardonically. “Society ladies to-day often get into
"scrapes of which their husbands know nothing,” he remarked. “You didn’t"
"know before that Antoinette Moulton, like many of her friends in the"
"smart set, was a gambler—and loser—did you?”"
Craig shook his head. He had more of human than scientific interest in
"""The Rajah has a charmed life,"" he said somberly. ""He is always in the"
front of his men--we can recognize him by his dress and figure--he is
"always within range, but we can't hit him. Not that I ought to wish"
"his death, though it's our only chance."" He put his hands distractedly"
"to his head. ""Heaven knows, it's too hard for a Christian man! Every"
"time I see an enemy fall, I rejoice--and then I remember that it is my"
"brother--"" He stopped, the expression on his face of profound trouble"
"giving way to active alarm. ""Hush! Some one is coming!"""
"A second time the door opened, and Travers rushed in. Lois saw his"
"face, and something in her recoiled in sick disgust. Fear, an almost"
"imbecilic fear, was written on the wide-open, staring eyes, and the"
hand that held the revolver trembled like that of an old man.
"""Quick--out by the back way!"" he stammered incoherently. ""I will lock"
the door--so. That will keep them off a minute. They are bound to look
for us here first. Nicholson is retiring with his men--they are going
to have a try to bring down the Rajah. It's our one chance. It may
"frighten the devils--they think he's a god. I believe he is, curse"
"him!"" All the time, he had been piling furniture against the door with"
"a mad and feverish energy. ""Help me! Help me!"" he screamed. ""Why don't"
"you help? Do you want to be killed like sheep?"""
Lois drew him back by the arm.
"""You are wasting time,"" she said firmly. ""Come with us! Why, you are"
"hurt!"""
He looked at the thin stream which trickled down the soiled white of
his coat. A silly smile flickered over his big face.
"""She may be able to do so,"" answered the Abbé, shrugging his shoulders."
"He spoke very bad English throughout the consultation. ""But the stars,"
"too, may be very persuasive with King Charles. To be plain, he will"
"probably consult you, and if--"""
"""I am to see him to-night. That is why your visit was postponed until"
"to-morrow,"" interrupted Lilly."
"""That is as I supposed,"" remarked the Abbé. ""Now, if I buy Dunkirk for"
"one hundred thousand pounds, you shall receive two thousand pounds within"
"ten days after signing the treaty, and Baron Clyde will be my surety."""
"""Two thousand pounds?"" mused Lilly. ""That is rather a small sum in so"
"great a transaction."""
"""I doubt not the purchase may be made without the help of the stars if"
"you feel that two thousand pounds is too small a sum to be considered,"""
returned the Abbé.
"""No, no,"" said Lilly. ""I understand that you wish me to set a figure and"
"work out the solution of this affair, and if I learn from the stars that"
it is to King Charles's interest to accept your offer of one hundred
"thousand pounds for the city of Dunkirk, I am to receive--"""
"""If King Charles accepts!"" interrupted the Abbé."
"""Ah, I see! Yes, yes, of course,"" returned Lilly. ""I shall go to work"
immediately and set my figure. Of course I do not know what I shall
"learn, but I shall be glad to learn from the stars that which will enable"
me to advise the king according to your wishes. Two thousand pounds are
"two thousand pounds, and the word of a king is but a breath."""

"quarter, of what he told me of the inner working of the Secret"
"Service, Scotland Yard, which admires and loves him, would cast him"
"out, lock him up securely in gaol, and prepare for me a safe"
"harbourage in a contiguous cell. So for both our sakes I must be very,"
very careful.
"""You have been most helpful to me,"" he said handsomely at parting,"
"""and if anything good turns up on the North-East coast, I will let you"
"know. Could you come if I sent for you?"""
"""I would contrive to manage it,"" said I."
"Dawson went away, and the pressure of daily work and interests thrust"
"him from my mind. For a month I heard nothing of him or of Cary, and"
then one morning came a letter and a telegram. The letter was from
"Richard Cary, and read as follows: ""A queer thing has happened here."
A cruiser which had come in for repair was due to go out this morning.
"She was ready for sea the night before, the officers and crew had all"
"come back from short leave, and the working parties had cleared out."
"Then in the middle watch, when the torpedo lieutenant was testing the"
"circuits, it was discovered that all the cables leading to the guns"
"had been cut. Dawson has been called in, and bids me say that, if you"
"can come down, now is the chance of your life. I will put you up."""
"The telegram was from Dawson himself. It ran: ""They say I'm beaten."
"But I'm not. Come and see."""
"""The deuce,"" said I. ""Sabotage! I am off."""
"Gyp nodded.  Anything--anything!  And when the maid was gone, she thought"
mechanically: 'A cup of hot tea!  How quaint!  What should it be but
hot?'
"The maid came back with the tea; she was an affectionate girl, full of"
"that admiring love servants and dogs always felt for Gyp, imbued, too,"
with the instinctive partisanship which stores itself one way or the
other in the hearts of those who live in houses where the atmosphere
"lacks unity.  To her mind, the mistress was much too good for him--a"
foreigner--and such 'abits!  Manners--he hadn't any!  And no good would
come of it.  Not if you took her opinion!
"""And I've turned the water in, m'm.  Will you have a little mustard in"
"it?"""
"Again Gyp nodded.  And the girl, going downstairs for the mustard, told"
"cook there was ""that about the mistress that makes you quite pathetic."""
"The cook, who was fingering her concertina, for which she had a passion,"
answered:
"""She 'ides up her feelin's, same as they all does.  Thank 'eaven she"
"haven't got that drawl, though, that 'er old aunt 'as--always makes me"
"feel to want to say, 'Buck up, old dear, you ain't 'alf so precious as"
"all that!'"""
"And when the maid Ellen had taken the mustard and gone, she drew out her"
"concertina to its full length and, with cautionary softness, began to"
"practise ""Home, Sweet Home!"""
"To Gyp, lying in her hot bath, those muffled strains just mounted, not"
"quite as a tune, rather as some far-away humming of large flies.  The"
"had no use. Yet, yet--my original guess stuck firmly in my mind,"
"improbable though it might be, and had just been nailed down"
tightly--I scorn to mystify the reader--by a few simple sentences
spoken in French.
CHAPTER VII
THE MARINE SENTRY
We had a whole day to fill in before we could get any news of Dawson's
"vigil in the _Malplaquet_, and I have never known a day as drearily"
"long. Cary and I were both restless as peas on a hot girdle, and could"
not settle down to talk or to read or to write. Cary sought vainly to
persuade me to read and pass judgment upon his Navy Book. In spite of
my interest in the subject my soul revolted at the forbidding pile of
manuscript. I promised to read the proofs and criticise them with
"severity, but as for the M.S.--no, thanks. Poor Cary needed all his"
sweet patience to put up with me. By eleven o'clock we had become
"unendurable to one another, and I gladly welcomed his suggestion to"
"adjourn to his club, have lunch there, and try to inveigle the"
"Commander of the _Malplaquet_ into our net. ""I know him,"" said Cary."
"""He is a fine fellow; and though he must be pretty busy, he will be"
glad to lunch somewhere away from the ship. If we have luck we will go
"back with him and look over the _Malplaquet_ ourselves."""
"""If you can manage that, Cary, you will have my blessing."""
He did manage to work the luncheon part by telephoning to the yard
XXIX
"Once more I was run into a party of English, the last for this year."
They arrived by steamer in the morning and stopped at the trading station
"for a few hours, meanwhile sending up a detachment through the valley to"
"order a car to meet them. Stordalen, Stordalen, they said. So they had"
apparently not yet seen Stordalen--an omission they must repair at once.
And what a sensation they made!
They came across by rowboat from the trading station; we could hear them a
"long way off, an old man's voice drowning out all the others. Eilert"
"dropped everything he had in hand, and ran down to the landing place in"
"order to be the first on the spot. From Olaus's house, too, a man and a"
"few half-grown boys went down, and from all the houses round swarmed"
curious and helpful crowds. There were so many spectators at the landing
place that the old man with the loud voice drew himself up to his full
"height in the boat and majestically shouted his English at us, as though"
his language must of course be ours as well:
"""Where's the car? Bring the car down!"""
"Olaus, who was sharp, guessed what he meant and at once sent his two boys"
"up the valley to meet the car and hurry it on, for the Englishmen had"
arrived.
"They disembarked, they were in a great hurry, they could not understand"
"why the car had not come to meet them: ""What was the meaning of this?"""
"There were four of them. ""Stordalen!"" they said. As they came up past"
unknown to her. She would go back to the old world and the old circle of
it. What would happen after that she was too listless to think. It was
"summed up in negations; and these again melted into one great want, the"
absence of the man to whom her imagination and her heart blindly and
obstinately clung.
"Lady Eynesford had left her newspaper, and Alicia found her hand upon"
"it. Taking it up, she read Medland's evidence at the inquest. A sudden"
revulsion of feeling seized her. Was this the man she was dreaming
"about, a man who calmly, coolly, as though caring nothing, told that"
story in the face of all the world? Was she never to get rid of the
spell he had cast on her before she knew what he really was? For a man
"like this she had sacrificed her self-respect, bandied insults with a"
"vulgar upstart, and brought on her head a reproach more fitting for an"
ill-mannered child. She threw the paper from her and rose to her feet.
She would think no more of him; he might be what he would; he was no fit
"subject for her thoughts, and he and the place where he lived and all"
"this wretched country deserved nothing better than to be forgotten,"
"resolutely, utterly, soon."
"""I am very sorry, Mary,"" she was saying, ten minutes later; ""I deserved"
"all you said. I don't know what foolishness possessed me. See, I have"
"written and apologised to Mr. Coxon."""
And Lady Eynesford kissed her and thanked heaven that they would soon
have done with Mr. Coxon and--all the rest.
CHAPTER XXVI.
"be prolonged, seeing that the glow of the sun-rising was already"
reddening the sky to the east.
Etienne was secretly fingering his beads. And El Sarria thought with
satisfaction of the safety of Dolóres; he had given up hope of Concha a
full hour ago. The ex-Miguelete had doubtless again played the traitor.
He took a cigarette from Rollo without speaking and followed him across
the uneven floor between the heaps of trodden grain.
"They were led down the stairway one by one, and as they passed through"
"the ground floor, with its thick woolly coating of grey flour dust, a"
"trumpet blew without, and they heard the trampling of horses in the"
courtyard.
"""Quick!"" said a voice at Rollo's elbow, ""here is your chocolate. Nothing"
like it for strengthening the knee-joints at a time like this. I've seen
"men die on wine and on rum and on brandy; but for me, give me a cup of"
"chocolate as good as that, when my time comes!"""
Rollo drank the thick sweet strength-giving stuff to the accompaniment
of clattering hoofs and jingling accoutrements.
"""Come!"" said a voice again, ""give me the cup. Do not keep the general"
"waiting. He is in no good temper this morning, and we are to march"
"immediately."""
The young man stepped out of the mill-door into the crisp chill of the
"dawn. All the east was a glory of blood-red cloud, and for the second"
time Rollo and his companions stood face to face with General Cabrera.
It was within a quarter of an hour of the sun-rising.

Creatures that once were Men.
PART I.
"In front of you is the main street, with two rows of miserable looking"
huts with shuttered windows and old walls pressing on each other and
leaning forward.  The roofs of these time-worn habitations are full of
"holes, and have been patched here and there with laths; from underneath"
"them project mildewed beams, which are shaded by the dusty-leaved"
elder-trees and crooked white willows--pitiable flora of those suburbs
inhabited by the poor.
"""Since nakedness has always existed ..."""
"""Yes, and it created Rome,"" said the teacher."
"""Yes, of course,"" says the Captain, beaming with joy. ""Romulus and"
"Remus, eh?  We also shall create when our time comes ..."""
"""Violation of public peace,"" interrupts Abyedok.  He laughs in a"
"self-satisfied way.  His laughter is impudent and insolent, and is"
"echoed by Simtsoff, the Deacon and Paltara Taras.  The naive eyes of"
"young Meteor light up, and his cheeks flush crimson."
"Kanets speaks, and it seems as if he were hammering their heads."
"""All these are foolish illusions ... fiddle-sticks!"""
"It was strange to see them reasoning in this manner, these outcasts"
"from life, tattered, drunken with vodki and wickedness, filthy and"
forlorn.  Such conversations rejoiced the Captain's heart.  They gave
"him an opportunity of speaking more, and therefore he thought himself"
"better than the rest.  However low he may fall, a man can never deny"
"himself the delight of feeling cleverer, more powerful, or even better"
"fed than his companions. Aristid Kuvalda abused this pleasure, and"
"never could have enough of it, much to the disgust of Abyedok, Kubar,"
"and others of these creatures that once were men, who were less"
interested in such things.
"Politics, however, were more to the popular taste.  The discussions as"
to the necessity of taking India or of subduing England were lengthy
and protracted.  Nor did they speak with less enthusiasm of the radical
measure of clearing Jews off the face of the earth.  On this subject
"son found examples the most worthy of imitation, and began to profit"
by them. This anecdote has become incorporated by the Chinese into a
"proverb, which they constantly quote: The Mother of Mentius seeks a"
neighbourhood.”
Another influence we have to counteract is that of newspaper headings
which catch the eye of children in the streets and appeal so powerfully
to their imagination.
Shakespeare has said:
"Tell me where is Fancy bred,"
"Or in the heart, or in the head?"
"How begot, how nourished?"
"Reply, reply."
It is engendered in the eyes
With gazing fed: and Fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies.
Let us all ring Fancy's knell.
"I'll begin it--ding, dong, bell."
“_Merchant of Venice._”
"If this be true, it is of importance to decide what our children shall"
"look upon as far as we can control the vision, so that we can form some"
idea of the effect upon their imagination.
"Having alluded to the dangerous influence of the street, I should"
hasten to say that this influence is very far from being altogether
bad. There are possibilities of romance in street life which may have
just the same kind of effect on children as the telling of exciting
stories. I am indebted to Mrs. Arnold Glover (Hon. Sec. of the National
"Organisation of Girls' Clubs), one of the most widely informed people"
"Risca than Risca saw into him. He did not answer the question, for he"
"penetrated, through the fuliginous vapours whence it proceeded, into the"
"crystal regions of the man's spirit. It was he, after a while, who held"
"Risca with his eyes, and it was all that was beautiful and spiritual"
in Risca that was held. And then Herold reached out his hand slowly and
touched him.
“We go down to Southcliff together.”
Risca drew a deep breath.
"“Let us go this evening,” said he."
A few hours afterward when the open cab taking them from the station
to the Channel House came by the sharp turn of the road abruptly to the
"foot of the cliff, and the gusty southwest wind brought the haunting"
"smell of the seaweed into his nostrils, and he saw the beacon-light in"
"the high west window shining like a star, a gossamer feather from the"
wings of Peace fell upon the man's tortured soul.
CHAPTER III
IT will be remembered that Stellamaris was a young person of bountiful
fortune. She had stocks and shares and mortgages and landed property
faithfully administered under a deed of trust. The Channel House and
"all that therein was, except Sir Oliver and Lady Blount's grievances,"
belonged to her. She knew it; she had known it almost since infancy.
The sense of ownership in which she had grown up had its effect on her
"character, giving her the equipoise of a young reigning princess, calm"
"""I am going up to try and see the Premier at the House to-day,"" he said."
"""I think we shall have to trouble him. You see, he knew Gaspard as well"
"as the deceased."""
"""I'll give you a lift. You can keep out of the way till he's at"
"leisure."""
"At this moment one of the police entered, and handed the Superintendent"
a copy of the _Evening Mail_.
"""It's as you feared, sir,"" he remarked as he went out."
"The Superintendent opened the paper, looked at it for an instant, and"
then indicated a passage with his forefinger.
"""It is rumoured,"" read Mr. Kilshaw, ""that certain very startling facts"
"have come to light regarding the identity of the deceased man Benham,"
"and that the name of a very prominent politician, now holding an exalted"
"office, is likely to be introduced into the case. As the matter will be"
"public property to-morrow, we may be allowed to state that trustworthy"
reports point to the fact of the Premier being in a position to give
some important information as to the past life of the deceased. It is
"said that a photograph of two persons, one of whom is Mr. Medland, has"
been discovered among the papers at Mr. Benham's (or we should say
Benyon's) lodgings. Further developments of this strange affair will be
"awaited with interest."""
"""I wish,"" commented the Superintendent grimly, ""that my men could keep a"
"secret as well as their man can sniff one out."""
But Mr. Kilshaw was too excited to listen.
"""A LADY! ... To see Mr. Alwyn!""--he repeated, his thoughts instantly"
"reverting to his friend's vaguely hinted love-affair,--""What name?"""
"""She gives no name, sir. She says it isn't needed,--Mr. Alwyn will know"
"who she is."""
"""Mr. Alwyn will know who she is, will he?"" murmured Villiers"
"dubiously.--""What is she like? Young and pretty?"""
"Over the man-servant's staid countenance came the glimmer of a demure,"
respectful smile.
"""Oh no, sir,--not young, sir! A person about fifty, I should say."""
This was mystifying. A person about fifty! Who could she be? Villiers
"hastily considered,--there must be some mistake, he thought,--at any"
"rate, he would see the unknown intruder himself first, and find out"
"what her business was, before breaking in upon Alwyn's peaceful studies"
upstairs.
"""Show the lady in here""--he said--""I can't disturb Mr. Alwyn just now."""
"The servant retired, and soon re-appeared, ushering in a tall, gaunt,"
"black-robed female, who walked with the stride of a dragoon and the"
"demeanor of a police-inspector, and who, merely nodding briskly in"
"response to Villiers's amazed bow, selected with one comprehensive"
"glance the most comfortable chair in the room, and seated herself at"
"ease therein. She then put up her veil, displaying a long, narrow face,"
"cold, pale, arrogant eyes, a nose inclined to redness at the tip, and a"
"thin, close-set mouth lined with little sarcastic wrinkles, which came"
"into prominent and unbecoming play as soon as she began to speak, which"
she did almost immediately.
"""Yes. He is coming up soon for instructions. It's his last chance, as"
it is mine. He sees that he must be held responsible for the wire
"cutting in the _Antinous_, and to some slight extent also in the"
"_Antigone_, and that if anything goes wrong with the _Malplaquet_ he"
"will be dismissed. I shall be sorry to lose him, for he is an"
"exceptionally good man, but we can't allow failures in petty officer"
"detectives any more than we can in chief inspectors."""
"""Where does Trehayne come from? His name sounds Cornish,"" I asked."
"""Falmouth, I believe. He is quite young, but he has had nearly three"
years in the _Vernon_ at Portsmouth and in the torpedo factory at
Greenock. A first-class engineer and electrician and a sound
detective. He has been with me for some twelve months. You will see
"him if he calls soon."""
I had been thinking hard over the details of Dawson's plans while the
"talk went on, and then ventured to offer some comments."
"""It is fortunate that you have grown a moustache since you were in the"
"north; you could not have been a Marine as a clean-shaven man."""
"""I often have to shave it,"" said Dawson, ""but I always grow it again"
between whiles. One can take it off quicker than one can put it on
again. False hair is the devil; I have never used it yet and never
will. So whenever I have a spell of leisure I grow a moustache against
"emergencies--like this one."""
"My next comment was rather difficult to make, for I did not wish"
"either Cary or Dawson to divine its purpose. ""If I may make a"
suggestion to a man of your experience it would be that none of your
"“It was only natural on my part,” she said amiably. “I shall never"
"forget when poor Flossie died. You remember Flossie, don't you? She used"
"to look so pretty, with her blue bow in her hair, and no one will ever"
persuade me that she was n't poisoned by the people next door; they were
dreadful people. I wish I could remember their name; it was something
"like Blunks. Anyhow, I was inconsolable, and Mrs. Tawley asked me to"
stay with her to get over it. I shall never forget how grateful I
"was. I'm sure you 're looking quite poorly, John,” she added in her"
inconsequent way. “Let me get you a cup of tea. It will do you good.”
"John declined. He wanted to accomplish his errand, but the longer he"
"remained in the company of this lady devoid of the sense of values, the"
more absurd did that errand seem. A less obstinate man than he would
"have abandoned it, but John had made up his mind to act on Herold's"
"suggestion, although he mentally bespattered the suggester with varied"
"malediction. He rose and, making his way between the flimsy chairs and"
"tables, stood on the hearth-rug, his hands in his pockets. Unconsciously"
"he scowled at his placid and smiling aunt, who remained seated on the"
"couch, her helpless hands loosely folded on her lap."
“Did you ever hear of a child called Unity Blake?”
“Was that the girl--”
“Yes.”
“What an outlandish name! I often wonder how people come to give such
names to children.”
"“Never mind her name, my dear aunt,” said John, gruffly. “I want to tell"
you about her.”
"“I see what you mean,” said he."
"“I should hope so,” said Herold."
"He looked at his watch and jumped to his feet. “Star of the Sea,” said"
"he, “to talk with you is the most fascinating occupation on earth; but"
"managers are desperate fellows, and I 'll get into boiling water if I"
miss my rehearsal.” He turned to John. “I don't see how you are going to
catch this train.”
"“Neither do I,” said John. “I shall go by the one after.”"
"Herold took his leave, promising to run down for the week-end. Constable"
"accompanied him to the door in a dignified way, and this ceremony of"
"politeness accomplished, stalked back to the hearth-rug, where he threw"
"himself down, his head on his paws, and his faithful eyes fixed on his"
mistress. John sat down again by the bedside. There was a short silence
during which Stellamaris smiled at him and he smiled at Stellamaris.
“Does n't the Great High Belovedest want to smoke?”
"“Badly,” said John."
She held out her hand for the pipe and tobacco-pouch. He gave them to
"her, and she filled the pipe. For a while he smoked peacefully. From"
where he sat all he could see of the outside world was the waste of
sun-kissed waters stretching away and melting into a band of pearly
cloud on the horizon. He might have been out at sea. Possibly this time
"next week he would be, and the salt air would be playing, as now, about"
his head. But on board that ship would be no spacious sea-chamber like
"this, so gracious in its appointments--its old oak and silver, its"
"bright chintzes, its quiet old engravings, its dainty dressing-table"
to the minute. In his earlier days he had frequently felt the same
"nervousness, the same intense mental activity, just prior to an"
"important race or game, and he was familiar with those disquieting,"
"panicky moments when, for no apparent reason, his heart thumped and a"
"physical sickness mastered him. He knew that the fever would leave him,"
"once the salmon began to run, just as it had always vanished at the"
crack of the starter's pistol or the shrill note of the referee's
"whistle. He was eager for action, eager to find himself possessed of"
"that gloating, gruelling fury that drives men through to the finish"
"line. Meanwhile, he was anxious to divert his mind into other channels."
Cherry's house was situated a short distance above the cannery which
"served as Willis Marsh's headquarters, and Boyd's path necessarily took"
him past his enemy's very stronghold. Finding the tide too high to
"permit of passing beneath the dock, he turned up among the buildings,"
"where, to his surprise, he encountered his own day-foreman talking"
earnestly with a stranger.
"The fisherman started guiltily as he saw him, and Boyd questioned him"
sharply.
"""What are you doing here, Larsen?"""
"""I just walked up after supper to have a talk with an old mate."""
"""Who is he?"" Boyd glanced suspiciously at Larsen's companion."
"""He's Mr. Marsh's foreman."""
"Emerson spoke out bluntly: ""See here. I don't like this. These people"
"have caused me a lot of trouble already, and I don't want my men"
"hanging around here."""
million dollars’ worth of high-priced cars every year. The police seem
"to be powerless to stop it. We appeal to them, but with no result. So,"
now we have taken things into our own hands.”
“What are you doing in this case?” asked Kennedy.
“What the insurance companies have to do to recover stolen
"automobiles,” Garwood replied. “For, with all deference to your friend,"
"Deputy O’Connor, it is the insurance companies rather than the police"
who get stolen cars back.”
"He had pulled out a postal card from a pigeon hole in his desk,"
selecting it from several apparently similar. We read:
$250.00 REWARD
"We will pay $100.00 for car, $150.00 additional for information which"
"will convict the thief. When last seen, driven by a woman, name not"
"known, who is described as dark-haired, well-dressed, slight,"
"apparently thirty years old. The car is a Dixon, 1912, seven-passenger,"
"touring, No. 193,222, license No. 200,859, New York; dark red body,"
"mohair top, brass lamps, has no wind shield; rear axle brake band"
device has extra nut on turnbuckle not painted. Car last seen near
"Prince Henry Hotel, New York City, Friday, the 10th."
"Communicate by telegraph or telephone, after notifying nearest police"
"department, with Douglas Garwood, New York City."
"“The secret of it is,” explained Garwood, as we finished reading, “that"
there are innumerable people who keep their eyes open and like to earn
money easily. Thus we have several hundreds of amateur and enthusiastic
"wood-louse!  You nose out every evil thing.  Yes, the face of that"
young swindler shows that he has got what he wanted...  I wonder how
much Egorka has got out of them.  He has evidently taken something...
He is just the same sort of rogue that they are ... they are all tarred
"with the same brush.  He has got some money, and I'm damned if I did"
not arrange the whole thing for him!  It is best to own my folly...
"Yes, life is against us all, brothers ... and even when you spit upon"
"those nearest to you, the spittle rebounds and hits your own face."""
"Having satisfied himself with this reflection, the worthy Captain"
"looked round upon his staff.  Every one of them was disappointed,"
because they all knew that something they did not expect had taken
"place between Petunikoff and Vaviloff, and they all felt that they had"
been insulted.  The feeling that one is unable to injure anyone is
"worse than the feeling that one is unable to do good, because to do"
harm is far easier and simpler.
"""Well, why are we loitering here?  We have nothing more to wait for ..."
"except the reward that I shall get out--out of Egorka,..."" said the"
"Captain, looking angrily at the eating-house. ""So our peaceful life"
under the roof of Judas has come to an end. Judas will now turn us
"out....  So do not say that I have not warned you."""
Kanets smiled sadly.
"""What are you laughing at, jailer?"" Kuvalda asked."
"""Where shall I go then?"""
"""That, my soul, is a question that fate will settle for you, so do not"
"worry,"" said the Captain, thoughtfully, entering the dosshouse.  ""The"
"creatures that once were men"" followed him."
"“If you can explain,” he began rather stiffly, “why you—”"
"“Dear,” she interrupted, “listen. It was an hour’s pain and trial to"
you. I did it for her—I mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach. I
"was so happy, Jim—so happy with you that I didn’t dare to refuse that"
"happiness to another. Jim, they were married only this morning—those"
two; and I wanted him to get away. While they were struggling with you
I saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park. That’s
"all of it, dear—I had to do it.”"
Thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in
the enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one. By
rice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings. But bride
knoweth bride at the glance of an eye. And between them swiftly passes
comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of.
THE ROMANCE OF A BUSY BROKER
"Pitcher, confidential clerk in the office of Harvey Maxwell, broker,"
allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually
expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half
past nine in company with his young lady stenographer. With a snappy
"“Good-morning, Pitcher,” Maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were"
"intending to leap over it, and then plunged into the great heap of"
letters and telegrams waiting there for him.
The young lady had been Maxwell’s stenographer for a year. She was
beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic. She forewent the
"heat of the water, the pungent smell of the mustard, and that droning hum"
slowly soothed and drowsed away the vehemence of feeling.  She looked at
"her body, silver-white in the yellowish water, with a dreamy sensation."
"Some day she, too, would love! Strange feeling she had never had before!"
"Strange, indeed, that it should come at such a moment, breaking through"
the old instinctive shrinking.  Yes; some day love would come to her.
"There floated before her brain the adoring look on Daphne Wing's face,"
"the shiver that had passed along her arm, and pitifulness crept into her"
"heart--a half-bitter, half-admiring pitifulness.  Why should she"
"grudge--she who did not love?  The sounds, like the humming of large"
"flies, grew deeper, more vibrating.  It was the cook, in her passion"
"swelling out her music on the phrase,"
"""Be it ne-e-ver so humble,"
"There's no-o place like home!"""

"That night, Gyp slept peacefully, as though nothing had happened, as"
though there were no future at all before her.  She woke into misery.
"Her pride would never let her show the world what she had discovered,"
would force her to keep an unmoved face and live an unmoved life.  But
the struggle between mother-instinct and revolt was still going on within
"her.  She was really afraid to see her baby, and she sent word to Betty"
that she thought it would be safer if she kept quite quiet till the
afternoon.
She got up at noon and stole downstairs.  She had not realized how
violent was her struggle over HIS child till she was passing the door of
"""I am going as one of the Marine sentries."""
"""It's no use, Dawson,"" protested I emphatically. ""You are a wonder at"
"disguise, and will look, I do not doubt, the very spit of a Marine."
But you can't pass among the men for half an hour without discovery.
"They are a class apart, they talk their own language, cherish their"
"own secret traditions, live in a world to which no stranger ever"
penetrates. You could pass as a naval officer more easily than you
"could as a Pongo. It is sheer madness, Dawson."""
"He gave a short laugh. ""Much you know about it. I have served in the"
"Red Corps myself. I was a recruit at Deal, passed two years at"
"Plymouth, and served afloat for three years. I was then drafted into"
the Naval Police. Afterwards I was recommended for detective work in
"the dockyards, and at the end of my Marine service joined the Yard. My"
"good man, I was a sergeant before I left the Corps."""
"""I give up, Dawson,"" said I. ""Nothing about you will ever surprise me"
"again. Not even if you claim to have been a Cabinet Minister."""
"A queer smile stole over his face. ""No, I have not been a minister,"
"but I have attended a meeting of the Cabinet."""
"Cary interposed at this point. ""Yours is a fine idea, Mr. Dawson. As a"
Marine sentry you can get yourself posted by the Major wherever you
"please, and the Guard will not talk even though they may wonder that"
any man should want to do twenty-four hours of duty per day. The
"Marines are the closest, faith-fullest, and best disciplined force in"
the wide world. Bluejackets will gossip; Marines never. You will be
"able to watch more closely than even Trehayne, who, I suppose, will"
"also be on board."""
"consolation we can find lies in the fact that we know it."""
"""Most fools lack that flattering unction,"" returned Frances, musingly."
"""Perhaps you will take more interest in this matter when I tell you"
"that it is not Betty I propose to see,"" I answered. ""I am deliberately"
"offering to take you to see some one else who is about to leave England."""
"She stood on tiptoe and kissed my lips for answer, then sank into a"
"chair, covering her face with her hands to hide the sudden tears."
I went to the window and waited till she was calm. I longed to comfort
her by telling of the faint prospect of good fortune that lay in Le
"Grand's letter, but I hesitated raising a hope which might never be"
realized.
"At the end of five minutes I went to her and said: ""Let me ask the"
"duchess to excuse you for to-night, and in the morning I'll meet you on"
"Bowling Green stairs, at, say, seven o'clock."""
"""I'll be there,"" she answered, smiling through her tears."
"The next morning we took boat, and the tide running out, made good speed"
"to the Bridge, hastened to the Old Swan, and found George in his printing"
"shop awaiting us. I remained in the old tapestried room, leaving Frances"
and George to say their farewells. In the course of a few minutes he
"called me in. He had donned his Quaker disguise, and on the floor near"
"him was a small bundle of linen. Frances was weeping, and George's voice"
was choked with emotion.
"""Well, at last, Baron Ned, you are to be rid of me,"" he said, glancing"
toward the bundle at his feet.
"everything close to the chest, but still. He would have felt better if"
"Michael Vance, Jr., had favored him with a little more trust."
"On the other hand, keeping the details of the operation under wraps as"
long as possible was probably wise. It minimized the chance for some
inadvertent slip-up.
"Yes, it was definitely best. Because he was staring across his desk at"
"four of Tanzan Mino's Tokyo _kobun_, all dressed in shiny black leather"
"jackets. They'd arrived at the Docklands office just after dawn,"
announcing they were there to hand-deliver the money to Tokyo. Jiro
Sato had directed them to Westminster Union.
"The four all carried black briefcases, which did not contain business"
papers. They intended to accomplish their mission by whatever means
"necessary. Jiro Sato, the London _oyabun_, had not been invited to send"
his people along with them this morning. He was now humiliated and dis-
"graced, officially removed from the operation, on Tokyo's orders. The"
"regional office had failed, so Tokyo had sent in a _Mino-gumi_ version"
of the Delta Force. They clearly had orders concerning what to do with
Michael Vance.
"He didn't like this new twist. For everything to go according to plan,"
violence had to be kept out of it. There was no way he and Michael
could go head to head with street enforcers. If Michael was thinking of
"doing that, the man was crazy."
"He glanced at his gold Omega, noting that it read ten- nineteen. In"
eleven more minutes he'd know how Michael intended to run the scenario.
"But whatever happened, he wasn't going to be intimidated by these"
"_kobun_ hoods, dark sunglasses and automatics notwithstanding. Those"
"myself who have no fixed residence, Sallie; and no powerful friends to"
whom to appeal against such infernal injustice. I can't tell you how
"thankful I'll be, on your account as well as my own, when we're married"
"and safely settled down, with a home of our own to feel safe in!"
"""Look, there's where we'll live when we're in London."""
Sallie looked out. They were whirling past one of the most imposing
"houses in Grosvenor Square. ""Is it an hotel?"" she asked, and observed"
that all but one or two of its topmost windows were dark.
"""It's the Earl of Jura's town house,"" said Slyne, apparently somewhat"
"piqued by her seeming indifference. ""It's yours now--or will be as soon"
"as the Chancery Court wakes up again."""
Sallie glanced back and caught another glimpse of it as the taxicab
slowed again to take the corner of the square. Slyne had picked up the
speaking-tube.
"""Get us to the station now, as fast as you can,"" he told the driver: and"
"then, having glanced at his watch, lighted a cigarette. He seemed to"
"have no more to say at the moment, and Sallie was busy with thoughts of"
her own. She was wondering whether Justin Carthew could be living in
that great house. She could not understand.... But she did not dare to
"ask Jasper Slyne for any information, since he had shown her more than"
once already that he did not intend to tell her any more than he thought
fit.
When they finally reached the station they found Mr. Jobling awaiting
them there and very anxious over their late arrival.
"""We drove round by Grosvenor Square,"" Slyne told the lawyer"
"""Hope to goodness you are,"" declared his lordship. ""Stay for a week or"
"two, anyhow: and,""--he lowered his voice to a husky whisper, leaning"
"toward her--""let _me_ trot you about a bit, eh? You'll maybe see more"
"than enough of _him_ by and by!"" He indicated Slyne with an eloquent"
"elbow, and further expressed his sentiments by means of an ardent sigh."
"Beyond the blossom-laden épergne, Mr. Jobling and Captain Dove, almost"
"cut off from other intercourse by that barrier, were exchanging coldly"
"critical glances. Neither seemed to be quite at his ease with the other,"
"and both had, of course, a great many urgent questions to put to Slyne"
as soon as the Marquis of Ingoldsby should be gone. So that the
"luncheon-party must have proved a very dull affair to them, and they"
were no doubt glad when it was over.
"Slyne signalled to Sallie as soon as coffee was served, and she rose to"
leave the room. She was quite accustomed to being promptly dispensed
with whenever her company might have been inconvenient.
"""Oh, I say!"" protested Lord Ingoldsby. ""You're not goin' yet, Lady J."
Half a mo'. Won't you come for a spin with me now that the car's mine?
Just say the word and I'll drop my other engagement. And then we could
"dine at--"""
"""Lady Josceline will be engaged with her lawyer all afternoon,"" Slyne"
"cut him short with the utmost coolness, ""and she's leaving Monte Carlo"
"again to-night."""
The Marquis of Ingoldsby glowered at him.
"""I'll see you in Paris, then, Lady J.,"" he went on, pointedly ignoring"
"Slyne, ""or in London, at least, later on. Well, good-bye--if you must be"
"“And then,” Frank went on, “Dad might take a notion to send an"
"expedition out here to round up these dirty greasers. If he does, I’m"
coming out just on purpose to see them hanged.”
“Cut it out!” advised Jack.
"“Of all the rotten, unwashed specimens of humanity I ever came across,”"
"Frank continued, speaking in a still louder tone, “this escort of ours"
takes the bun. They’re imitation bad-men all right.”
"“A little of that goes a long way, young man,” the leader of the party"
"said. “It makes no difference to me what you say, but several of these"
men understand the English language and can speak it fluently.”
"“I presume so,” returned Frank. “I’ve seen just such a collection as"
"that in jail in New York. Say, honest, Captain,” he went on, “if a bunch"
"like this should run up against the strong-arm squad in New York, they’d"
get their heads beaten off just because of their ugly mugs.”
"“Aw, what’s the use!” demanded Harry."
"By this time several of the guards were casting ugly glances at Frank,"
who seemed to regard their disfavor with great joy.
"“You’d better come on ahead and walk with me, young fellow,” the leader"
"said, taking Frank roughly by the arm and jerking him to a position in"
"front. “If you get back there where those ugly ones are, they’ll put a"
couple of bullets into your back and swear that you were trying to
escape.”
"On his way to the front of the party, Frank passed Jack and paused for a"
Laura found herself besieged by the Englishman; she couldn’t decide to
"discourage him entirely, and at critical moments she would take the"
"train, go off to Naples, and come back two or three days later,"
doubtless with more strength for withstanding the siege.
"“As a matter of reciprocal justice, since he makes love to my sister,"
"I ought to make love to his wife,” thought Cæsar, and he went several"
times to the Hotel Excelsior to call on Susanna.
The Yankee wife was full of complaints against her husband. Her father
"had advised her simply to get a divorce, but she didn’t want to."
"She found such a solution lacking in distinction, and no doubt she"
"considered the advice of an author in her own country very true, who had"
given this triple injunction to the students of a woman’s college: “Do
"not drink, that is, do not drink too much; do not smoke, that is, do not"
"smoke too much; and do not get married, that is, do not get married too"
much.”
It did not seem quite right to Susanna to get married too much. Besides
she had a desire to become a Catholic. One day she questioned Cæsar
about it:
"“You want to change your religion!” exclaimed Cæsar, “What for? I don’t"
believe you are going to find your lost faith by becoming a Catholic.”
"“And what do you think about it, Kennedy?” Susanna asked the young"
"Englishman, who was there too."
“To me a Catholic woman seems doubly enchanting.”
“You would not marry a woman who wasn’t a Catholic?”
"Lynn Moulton made no fight and Kennedy did not pursue the case, for,"
"with the rescue of Antoinette Moulton, his interest ceased."
"Blackmail takes various forms, and the Moulton affair was only one"
phase of it. It was not long before we had to meet a much stranger
attempt.
"“Read the letter, Professor Kennedy. Then I will tell you the sequel.”"
Mrs. Hunter Blake lay back in the cushions of her invalid chair in the
"sun parlor of the great Blake mansion on Riverside Drive, facing the"
Hudson with its continuous reel of maritime life framed against the
green-hilled background of the Jersey shore.
"Her nurse, Miss Dora Sears, gently smoothed out the pillows and"
adjusted them so that the invalid could more easily watch us. Mrs.
"Blake, wealthy, known as a philanthropist, was not an old woman, but"
had been for years a great sufferer from rheumatism.
"I watched Miss Sears eagerly. Full-bosomed, fine of face and figure,"
she was something more than a nurse; she was a companion. She had
"bright, sparkling black eyes and an expression about her well-cut mouth"
which made one want to laugh with her. It seemed to say that the world
was a huge joke and she invited you to enjoy the joke with her.
"Kennedy took the letter which Miss Sears proffered him, and as he did"
"so I could not help noticing her full, plump forearm on which gleamed a"
handsome plain gold bracelet. He spread the letter out on a dainty
wicker table in such a way that we both could see it.
of the people settled down to a lively _conversazione_. It is much
"nicest, on the whole, to travel third class on the railway. There is"
"space, there is air, and it is like being in a lively inn, everybody in"
good spirits.
At our end was plenty of room. Just across the gangway was an elderly
"couple, like two children, coming home very happily. He was fat, fat all"
"over, with a white moustache and a little not-unamiable frown. She was a"
"tall lean, brown woman, in a brown full-skirted dress and black apron,"
"with huge pocket. She wore no head covering, and her iron grey hair was"
parted smoothly. They were rather pleased and excited being in the
"train. She took all her money out of her big pocket, and counted it and"
"gave it to him: all the ten Lira notes, and the five Lira and the two"
"and the one, peering at the dirty scraps of pink-backed one-lira notes"
to see if they were good. Then she gave him her half-pennies. And he
"stowed them away in the trouser pocket, standing up to push them down"
"his fat leg. And then one saw, to one's amazement, that the whole of his"
"shirt-tail was left out behind, like a sort of apron worn backwards."
"Why--a mystery. He was one of those fat, good-natured, unheeding men"
"with a little masterful frown, such as usually have tall, lean,"
"hard-faced, obedient wives."
They were very happy. With amazement he watched us taking hot tea from
the Thermos flask. I think he too had suspected it might be a bomb. He
had blue eyes and standing-up white eyebrows.
"""Beautiful hot--!"" he said, seeing the tea steam. It is the inevitable"
"exclamation. ""Does it do you good?"""
"""Yes,"" said the q-b. ""Much good."" And they both nodded complacently."
They were going home.
"The sun is already setting. Far up the mountainside are the cattle, but"
they are moving homeward now; I can hear by their bells that they are
"moving. Tinkling bells and deep-mouthed bells, sometimes sounding together"
"as though there were a meaning in it, a pattern of tones, a rapture."
"And rapture, too, to see all the blades of grass and the tiny flowers and"
"plants. Beside me where I lie is a small pod plant, wonderfully meek, with"
"tiny seeds pushing out of the pod--God bless it, it's becoming a mother!"
It has got caught in a dry twig and I liberate it. Life quivers within it;
"the sun has warmed it today and called it to its destiny. A tiny, gigantic"
miracle.
"Now it is sunset, and the woods bend under a rustling that passes"
through them sweet and heavy; it is the evening.
"I lie for another hour or two; the birds have long since gone to rest, and"
"darkness falls thick and soft.... As I walk homeward, my feet feel their"
"way and I hold my hands before me till I reach the field, where it is a"
little lighter. I walk on the hay that has been left outdoors; it is tough
"and black, and I slip on it because it is already rotting. As I approach"
"the houses, bats fly noiselessly past me, as though on wings of foam. A"
slight shudder convulses me whenever they pass.
Suddenly I stop.
A man is walking here. I can see him against the wall of the new house. He
"has on a coat that looks like the actor's raincoat, but it is not the"
"little comedian himself. There he goes, into the house, right into the"
house. It is Solem.
"""Why, that's where she sleeps!"" I think. ""Ah, well. Alone in the building,"
"in the south wing, Miss Torsen alone--yes, quite alone. And Solem has just"
punishment for your impertinence in opening my friend Copplestone's
"private letters. You have had the lesson; profit by it."""
"Dawson flushed angrily. ""Punishment! Impertinence! This to me!"""
"""Yes,"" returned the Admiral stiffly, ""beastly impertinence."""
CHAPTER IV
SABOTAGE
Dawson showed no malice towards the Admiral or myself for our
treatment of him. I do not think that he felt any; he was too fully
occupied in collecting the spoils of victory to trouble his head about
what a Scribbler or a Salt Horse might think of him. He gathered to
himself every scrap of credit which the affair could be induced to
"yield, and received--I admit quite deservedly--the most handsome"
encomiums from his superiors in office. During the two weeks he passed
in my city after the capture--weeks occupied in tracing out the
threads connecting his wretch of a prisoner with the German agents
"upon what Dawson called his ""little list""--he paid several visits both"
to my house and my office. His happiness demanded that he should read
to me the many letters which poured in from high officials of the
"C.I.D., from the Chief Commissioner, and on one day--a day of days in"
the chronicles of Dawson--from the Home Secretary himself. To me it
seemed that all these astute potentates knew their Dawson very
"thoroughly, and lubricated, as it were, with judicious flattery the"
machinery of his energies. I could not but admire Dawson's truly royal
"""Everyman can WILL his own destiny,""--returned Alwyn firmly. ""That is"
"just it. But here we are getting into a serious discussion, and I had"
"determined to talk no more on such subjects till to-night."""
"""And to-night we are to go in for them thoroughly, I"
"suppose?""--inquired Villiers with a quick look. ""To-night, my dear boy,"
"you will have to decide whether you consider me mad or sane,"" said"
"Alwyn cheerfully--""I shall tell you truths that seem like romances--and"
"facts that sound like fables,--moreover, I shall have to assure you"
"that miracles DO happen whenever God chooses, in spite of all human"
denial of their possibility. Do you remember Whately's clever
skit--'Historical Doubts of Napoleon I'?--showing how easy it was to
logically prove that Napoleon never existed?--That ought to enlighten
"people as to the very precise and convincing manner in which we can, if"
"we choose, argue away what is nevertheless an incontestible FACT. Thus"
do skeptics deny miracles--yet we live surrounded by miracles! ... do
"you think me crazed for saying so?"""
"Villiers laughed. ""Crazed! No, indeed!--I wish every man in London were"
"as sane and sound as you are!"""
"""Ah, but wait till to-night!"" and Alwyn's eyes sparkled"
"mirthfully--""Perhaps you will alter your opinion then!""--Here,"
"collecting his scattered manuscripts, he put them by--""I've done work"
"for the present,""--he said--""Shall we go for a walk somewhere?"""
"Villiers assented, and they left the room together."
CHAPTER XXXV.
"""I want to go to Siberia ...  I have had enough of this vile life ..."
"one learns how to live there!"""
"""Yes, they have a particularly good way of teaching in Siberia,"" agreed"
"the Captain, sadly."
"They spoke no more of Petunikoff, or of the turning out of the"
inhabitants of the dosshouse.  They all knew that they would have to
"leave soon, therefore they did not think the matter worth discussion."
"It would do no good, and besides the weather was not very cold though"
the rains had begun ... and it would be possible to sleep on the ground
anywhere outside the town.  They sat in a circle on the grass and
"conversed about all sorts of things, discussing one subject after"
"another, and listening attentively even to the poor speakers in order"
to make the time pass; keeping quiet was as dull as listening.  This
"society of ""creatures that once were men"" had one fine"
characteristic--no one of them endeavoured to make out that he was
"better than the others, nor compelled the others to acknowledge his"
superiority.
The August sun seemed to set their tatters on fire as they sat with
their backs and uncovered heads exposed to it ... a chaotic mixture of
"the vegetable, mineral, and animal kingdoms. In the corners of the yard"
the tall steppe grass grew luxuriantly....  Nothing else grew there but
"some dingy vegetables, not even attractive to those who nearly always"
felt the pangs of hunger.
*      *      *      *      *
The following was the scene that took place in Vaviloff's eating-house.
"Young Petunikoff entered slowly, took off his hat, looked around him,"
"years. What then would be said if I----"""
"""Nay, then,"" cried Maria Cristina, ""stay where you are, Susana. For me,"
"I am none so nice. I will go myself. Do not follow me, Fernando!"" And"
"with that she ran to the door, and her feet were heard flitting up the"
stairway which led to the servants' wing of the palace. Muñoz made as if
"to accompany her, but remembering his wife's prohibition, he did not"
"proceed farther than the door, where, with a curious smile upon his"
"face, he stood listening to the voice of the Queen-Regent upraised in"
alternate appeal and rebuke.
"During the interval, while the Sergeant and El Sarria were looking to"
"their stores and munitions, Rollo approached the waiting-maid, Susana,"
"and inquired of her the way to the armoury, where he expected to find"
store of arms and powder.
"""If this young maid will go also, I will conduct you thither, young"
"man!"" said Susana, primly."
"And holding Concha firmly by the hand, she took up a candle and led the"
way.
But to Rollo's surprise they found the armoury wholly sacked. All the
valuable guns had been removed by the deserting guards. The gun racks
were torn down. The floor of beaten earth was strewed with flints of
ancient pieces of last century's manufacture. The barrels of
"bell-mouthed blunderbusses leaned against the wall, the stocks, knocked"
"off in mere wantonness, were piled in corners; and in all the chests and"
wall-presses there was not an ounce of powder to be found.
"While Rollo was searching, Señor Muñoz appeared at the door, languid and"
careless as ever. He watched the young Scot opening chests and rummaging
into the swifter current of the stream.
"“Jack wants to know can you spare him a few minutes, sir,” he explained."
“There’s a bit of trouble down below.”
"“What kind of trouble?” Bob asked swiftly, turning downstream without an"
instant’s delay; and walking by the side of the dynamite man.
"Calker scratched his head slowly. “I ain’t quite certain sure, Mr."
"Bainbridge,” he drawled, “but I got a idea there’s a fellow with a mill"
who’s run out a sortin’ boom that’s goin’ to hang up our drive if we
ain’t mighty keerful.”
"“A mill!” exclaimed Bob incredulously. “Why, there isn’t such a thing"
"within twenty miles--at least, there wasn’t three months ago.”"
Calker grinned. “Thought it looked kinda new. I couldn’t rightly say
"that it’s finished, but there ain’t no manner of a doubt about the boom."
"The jam had started before I come away, an’ I left Jack havin’ it hot"
an’ heavy with a red-headed son of a gun who sure looked as if scrap was
his middle name.”
"Bainbridge frowned, but asked no further questions. He scarcely spoke,"
"in fact, during all of the four miles, but it was evident to his"
observing companion that he was doing a lot of thinking.
Long before reaching the point of obstruction it became evident that
"another jam had formed. The current grew more and more sluggish, and the"
"progress of the logs downstream became slower and slower, until at"
length the entire surface of the water was covered with floating timber.
These in turn crowded upon one another with a rapidity which threatened
to equal that first jam unless something was swiftly done.
Before long the novelty of the Tore Peak resort wore off again. The
"newspapermen wrote and sent telegrams about other gratifying misfortunes,"
the death on the Blue Peak having lost its news value. It had been an
intoxication; now came the morning after.
The Danish mountaineer quite simply deserted. He strapped on his knapsack
"and walked across the field like one of the villagers, caring no more for"
the Blue Peak. The commotion he had witnessed in the last week had taught
him a lesson.
And the tourists swarmed on to other places.
"""What harm have I done them,"" Paul probably"
"thought, ""that they should be going again? Have I been"
too much in the fields and too little with them? But I
greeted them humbly and took my man out of the
"harvesting work to help them...."""
"Then two young men arrived, sprouts off the Norwegian tree, sportsmen to"
"their finger tips, who talked of nothing but sailing, cycling, and"
"football; they were going to be civil engineers--the young Norway. They,"
"too, wanted to see the Blue Peak to the best of their ability; after all,"
one must keep pace with modern life. But they were so young that when they
"looked up at the peak, they were afraid. Solem had learned more than one"
"trick in tourist company; craftily he led them on, and then extorted money"
from them in return for a promise not to expose their foolishness. So all
"was well; the young sprouts came down the mountain again, bragging and"
showing off their sportsmanship. One of them brought down a bloodstained
"rag which he flung on the ground, saying,"
"""There's what's left of your lawyer that fell off."""
"with an inefficient chauffeur, so naturally wanted to secure the best"
man that could be got.
"I must here explain that I possessed an English chauffeur, Allan"
"by name, and that General Kitson employed his brother in the same"
"capacity. Now, without any disparagement of _my_ Allan, I knew his"
brother to be a more practical and experienced man. General Kitson
generously gave his consent to an exchange of chauffeurs.
"I may as well say, at once, that it was a lucky day for me that saw"
"Allan of the 9th Middlesex Regiment enter my service, for, during"
"the months to come, he was as cheery and full of resource as he was"
"ready for any event, however untoward. His appetite stood forth as"
"the only thing that ever caused me uneasiness, and I must admit that"
I have never met a man with one of such colossal proportion. As an
"instance--on one occasion, when camped out in the desert, between"
"Nushki and Robat, and supplies were none too plentiful, we cooked"
twelve sausages for breakfast.
"I had one, and then was persuaded by Allan to attempt a second. I"
only succeeded in disposing of half of it. I then got up and left
"Allan to have his own breakfast. Allah-dad, being a Mahommedan, of"
course refused to touch sausage.
"At lunch-time Allah-dad asked what I would have to eat, and got the"
"answer, ""Oh, some of the cold sausages left from breakfast."""
"Allah-dad replied, ""But there are no sausages, Sahib. Allan has eaten"
"them all."""
"I expostulated, maintaining that it was impossible. No normal man"
could have eaten ten and a half large sausages. But Allah-dad was
station to catch their train.
"It was a cold, clear, frosty night, and the Strand was at its busiest as"
Sallie looked out at it from the taxi into which Slyne and Ambrizette
"had followed her at the hotel portico. Another, containing Captain Dove"
"and their legal adviser, still on the most amicable terms, although"
"Captain Dove as a rule could not stand anyone afflicted with hiccough,"
"crawled close behind them through the turmoil until, at the Gaiety"
"corner, a policeman delayed it to let the cross-traffic through."
A crowd had gathered there to gaze at the royalties who would presently
be coming out of the theatre. Slyne drew Sallie back from the open
"window at sight of two men, one of whom seemed all shirt-front, looking"
down at the congested street from the empty steps of the principal
entrance.
"""That ass Ingoldsby!"" he explained to Sallie, and was evidently a good"
"deal disturbed. ""And--Dubois, as well,"" he added. ""I thought I had"
"shaken him off in Paris. I'm sure he saw me, too."""
A little farther on he stopped the taxi and beckoned to one of those
street-arabs who make a living about the kerb.
"""Go to the gentleman with the beard, on the steps of the Gaiety,"" he"
"instructed that very alert messenger, ""and say to him that a friend"
"wants a word with him here."""
Sallie observed the suppressed grimace of surprise on the face of the
individual who almost at once arrived in the wake of his ragged Mercury:
"and Slyne, having tossed the latter a shilling, held out his hand to M."
Dubois.
"“Nothing, fortunately,” he said, then went on slowly. “You see, in my"
"later years, I have been something of a collector of precious stones"
"myself. I don’t wear them, but I have always taken the keenest pleasure"
in owning them and when I was married it gave me a great deal more
"pleasure to have them set in rings, pendants, tiaras, necklaces, and"
other forms for my wife.”
"He had risen, with the air of a busy man who had given the subject all"
the consideration he could afford and whose work proceeded almost by
"schedule. “This morning I found my safe tampered with, but, as I said,"
fortunately something must have scared off the burglars.”
"He bowed us out politely. What was the explanation, I wondered. It"
"seemed, on the face of things, that Antoinette Moulton feared her"
"husband. Did he know something else already, and did she know he knew?"
"To all appearances he took it very calmly, if he did know. Perhaps that"
"was what she feared, his very calmness."
"“I must see Mrs. Moulton again,” remarked Kennedy, as we left."
"The Moultons lived, we found, in one of the largest suites of a new"
"apartment hotel, the Deluxe, and in spite of the fact that our arrival"
"had been announced some minutes before we saw Mrs. Moulton, it was"
evident that she had been crying hysterically over the loss of the
paste jewels and what it implied.
"“I missed it this morning, after my return from seeing you,” she"
"replied in answer to Craig’s inquiry, then added, wide-eyed with alarm,"
“What shall I do? He must have opened the wall safe and found the
replica. I don’t dare ask him point-blank.”
of having the administration of all the Church’s property kept entirely
"at home, as in the time of Pius IX. Leo XIII had preferred to replace"
"this paternal method by a trained bureaucracy, but the Church had not"
"gained anything by it, and they had lost credit through unfortunate"
"negotiations, buying land and taking mortgages."
Cæsar realized that it was useless to attempt to convince a man of
"the intelligence and austerity of the Cardinal, and he listened to him"
respectfully.
"Monsignor Spada conversed amiably, he escorted them as far as the door,"
and shook hands when they said good-bye.
THE ABBÉ TARDIEU
Then they went to see the Abbé Tardieu. The abbé lived in the Piazza.
"Navona. His office, furnished in modern style, produced the effect of a"
"violent contrast with Cardinal Spada’s sumptuous study, and yet brought"
"it to mind. The Abbé Tardieu’s work-room was small, worldly, full of"
books and photographs.
"The abbé, a tall young man, thin, with a rosy face, a long nose, and a"
"mouth almost from ear to ear, had the air of an astute but jolly person,"
and laughed at everything said to him. He was liveliness personified.
When they entered his office he was writing and smoking.
"Cæsar explained about his financial knowledge, and how he had gone on"
"acquiring it, until he got to the point where he could discern a law, a"
"system, in things where others saw nothing more than chance. The Abbé"
"Tardieu promised that if he knew a way to utilize Cæsar’s knowledge, he"
"their hearts as water within them. Their pet Valiant, old Gaspar Perico,"
"too, had judiciously hidden himself. Esteban the supple had accompanied"
"him, and the venta of Sarria was in the hands of the silent,"
"swift-footed, but exceedingly capable maid-servant who had played the"
trick upon Etienne.
"The Sarrians therefore watched the mill-house blaze up, and thanked God"
that it stood some way from the other dwellings of the place.
Suddenly Cabrera turned upon them.
"""Hearken ye, villagers of Sarria,"" he cried, ""I have burned the home of"
a traitor. If I hear of any shelter being granted to Luis Fernandez or
"his brother within your bounds, I swear by the martyred honour of my"
mother that on my return I will burn every house within your walls and
shoot every man of you capable of bearing arms. You have heard of Ramon
"Cabrera. Let that be enough."""
"The villagers got apprehensively behind each other, and none answered,"
"each waiting for the other, till with mighty bass thunder the voice rang"
out again:
"""Have you no answer?"" he cried, ""no promise? Must I set a dozen of you"
"with your backs against the wall, as I did at Espluga in Francoli, to"
"stimulate those dull country wits of yours?"""
Then a young man gaily dressed was thrust to the front. Very unwilling
"he was to show himself, and at his appearance, with his knees knocking"
"together, a merry laugh rang out from behind Cabrera."
That chieftain turned quickly with wrath in his eye. For it was a sound
"of a woman's mirth that was heard, and all such were strictly forbidden"
"most amazing new life, had put the past with all its horrors resolutely"
"behind her, was too much interested in the entertaining present to"
trouble about the future at the moment.
"Captain Dove had seemingly forgotten, for the time being at any rate,"
"his grievance against Slyne, and was in his most lamb-like mood. While"
Slyne did not even demur against the quantities of expensive wine the
"old man consumed during dinner. Mr. Jobling, too, was displaying"
symptoms of convivial hilarity when they at length left the restaurant.
But most of the other tables were empty by then.
"Mr. Jobling and Captain Dove, arm in arm, affectionately maintained each"
"other as far as their sitting-room, while Slyne accompanied Sallie to"
"her own door. He had been making himself most agreeable to her, and had"
pointed out a number of the notorieties and one or two of the
celebrities present; although it had somewhat startled her to be told
that she would very soon be on familiar terms with them all.
"""Aren't you glad now that you agreed to the bargain we made on the"
"_Olive Branch_--and in Monte Carlo?"" he asked by the way. He was smiling"
gaily.
"She smiled back at him, and, ""I'm not sorry--so far, Jasper,"" she"
"answered, looking deep into his eyes."
"He nodded, as if quite satisfied, and turned away to escape that"
embarrassing scrutiny.
"""We'll be starting in half an hour or so,"" he informed her from a safe"
"distance, and, ""I'll be all ready,"" she called cheerfully after him."
A little before eleven he came in again and they all set out for the
"will reach our friend."""
"""Good, good! Come to my hotel. I will trust you."""
"We went to De Grammont's house, and after taking great precautions"
"against discovery, he gave me a small wooden box wound with yards of tape"
"and sealed with quantities of wax. I put the box in my pocket, saying:--"
"""I accept the trust on my honor, dear count, and though the package bears"
"no name nor address, I shall deliver it to the person for whom it is"
"intended."""
De Grammont said he knew nothing of the contents of the box except that
"it contained a message for a friend, and I believed him."
"When I left his house he came to the door with me, murmuring: ""My"
"gratitude! My gratitude! Also the gratitude of my king, which I hope may"
prove of far greater value to your friend than my poor offering of
"words."""
"I lost no time in seeking George, except to make sure that I was not"
followed. I trusted De Grammont and felt sure that the box he had given
me contained a personal communication from no less a person than Louis
"XIV of France, but I wanted to take no risk of betraying Hamilton by"
leading De Grammont or any one else to his hiding-place.
"Since Frances's providential escape, the king had suspected the right"
"persons of her rescue. At least he suspected Hamilton, and was seeking"
him more diligently than ever before. His Majesty had not shown me any
"mark of disfavor, but I feared he suspected me, and was sure he was not"
convinced that Frances's alibi had been proved by unsuborned testimony.
"If he was sure that she was the one who had been kidnapped, his"
"The time was barely 10 o’clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with"
a taste of rain in them had well nigh de-peopled the streets.
"Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and"
"artful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown"
"the pacific thoroughfare, the officer, with his stalwart form and"
"slight swagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The"
vicinity was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the
lights of a cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the
majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since
been closed.
When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his
"walk. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an"
unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man
spoke up quickly.
"“It’s all right, officer,” he said, reassuringly. “I’m just waiting for"
a friend. It’s an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little
"funny to you, doesn’t it? Well, I’ll explain if you’d like to make"
certain it’s all straight. About that long ago there used to be a
restaurant where this store stands—‘Big Joe’ Brady’s restaurant.”
"“Until five years ago,” said the policeman. “It was torn down then.”"
The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light
"showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white"
"scar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly"
set.
"“Twenty years ago to-night,” said the man, “I dined here at ‘Big Joe’"
"Brady’s with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the"
and serene in her undisputed position. In her childish days her material
kingdom was limited to the walls of her sea-chamber but as the child
"expanded into the young girl, so expanded her conception of the limits"
of her kingdom. And with this widening view came gradually and curiously
the consciousness that though her uncle and aunt were exquisitely
"honoured and beloved agents who looked to the welfare of her realm,"
yet they could not relieve her of certain gracious responsibilities.
"Instinctively, and with imperceptible gradations, she began to make"
her influence felt in the house itself. But it was an influence in the
spiritual and not material sense of the word; the hovering presence and
not the controlling hand.
"When, shortly after the arrival of the two men, Walter Herold went up to"
"his room, he found a great vase of daffodils on his dressing-table and"
"a pencilled note from Stella in her unformed handwriting, for one cannot"
learn to write copper-plate when one lies forever on the flat of one's
back.
"_Great High Favourite: Here are some daffodils, because they laugh and"
dance like you. Stellamaris._
And on his dressing-table John Risca found a mass of snowdrops and a
note:
_Great High Belovedest: A beautiful white silver cloud came to my window
"to-day, and I wished I could tear it in half and save you a bit for the"
palace. But snowdrops are the nearest things I could think of instead.
Your telegram was a joy. Love. S._
Beside the bowl of flowers was another note:
"_I heard the wheels of your chariot, but Her Serene High-and-Mightiness"
CHAPTER XXIX
A LITTLE QUEEN AT HOME
"Meanwhile, leaving the grave in the shaded corner of the farm garden, La"
Giralda went out with many strange things moving in her heart. More than
"once she had seen her own children laid in the dust, with far less of"
emotion than this nameless little girl clutching her wooden puppet and
"smiling, well-pleased, in the face of the Last Terror."
She found the donkey standing still and patient between his fagot
"bundles. The she-goats, on the other hand, had scattered a little this"
way or that as this blade of grass or that spray of _encina_ had allured
them. But a sharp cry or two called them together. For it was many hours
"since any of them had been milked, and the full teats standing out every"
way ached for the pressing fingers.
"The Sergeant had, of course, long since completely disappeared up the"
"hillside, so La Giralda, with one comprehensive look back at the"
"desolate farmhouse, drove her little flock before her towards the town"
"gates of San Ildefonso. Like a picture, the dustily red roofs lay"
"beneath in the sunshine, spire and roof-garden, pigeon-house and terrace"
"walk. Parts of the white palace of La Granja also were to be seen, but"
"indistinctly, since it lay amid a pleasant distraction of greenery, and"
the woods waved and the falling waters glimmered about it like the
landscape of a dream.
"From the _Colegiata_ came the tolling of a bell, slow and irregular. All"
"else was silent. Presently, with her little flock before her, La Giralda"
"assuring myself that there was no other body near, and peered into her"
"face, I saw that it was seamed and wrinkled. She was barefoot, and her"
clothes were foul and mean. She had the reek of one who slept in
ditches and washed seldom. Her toothless gums grinned at me. She was a
horrible mockery of all that men love in women.
"When I had marked so much, I stood up again, my head reeling. Where"
was the man I had seen scouting up and down? Where was Marie? For a
"moment the wild idea that she had become this thing, that death or"
"magic had transformed the fair young girl into this toothless hag, was"
"not too wild for me. An owl hooted in the distance, and I started and"
shivered and stood looking round me fearfully. Such things were; and
"Marie was gone. In her place this woman, grim and dead and unsightly,"
lay at my feet. What was I to think?
"I got no answer. I raised my voice and called, trembling, on Marie. I"
"ran to one side of the road and the other and called, and still got no"
"answer. I climbed the mound on which the ash-tree stood, and sent my"
voice thrilling through the darkness of the bottom. But only the owl
"answered. Then, knowing nothing else I could do, I went down wringing"
"my hands, and found my lady standing over the body in the road. She"
had come back with Steve and the others.
"I had to listen to their amazement, and a hundred guesses and fancies,"
"which, God help me! had nothing certain in them, and gave me no help."
"The men searched both sides of the road, and beat the moor for a"
"distance, and tried to track the horse--for that was missing too, and"
there lay my only hope--but to no purpose. At last my lady came to me
and said sorrowfully that nothing more could be done.
'In the morning!' I cried jealously.
"“If you go on in this way,” said Herold, “you 'll soon have as much idea"
of what's going on in London as a lonely dog tied up in a kennel.”
"“What does it matter,” growled John, “to any of the besotted fools who"
"read newspapers, provided I bark loud enough?”"
"There was one thing going on in London, however, in which he took a grim"
"interest, and that was the convalescence of the little maid-of-all-work"
"who had been taken back, a maimed lamb, to the cheerless fold where"
she had been reared. Thither he went to make inquiries as soon as he
returned from Southcliff-on-Sea. He found the Orphanage of St. Martha
"at Willesden, a poverty-stricken building, a hopeless parallelogram of"
"dingy, yellow brick, standing within a walled inclosure. There were no"
"trees or flowers, for the yard was paved. His ring at the front door was"
"answered by an orphan in a light print dress, her meagre hair clutched"
up tight in a knob at the back. He asked for the superintendent and
"handed his card. The orphan conducted him to a depressing parlour, and"
"vanished. Presently appeared a thin, weary woman, dressed in the black"
"robes of a Sister of Mercy, who, holding the card tight in nervous"
"fingers, regarded him with an air of mingled fright and defiance."
“Your business?” she asked.
"Despite the torture of it all, John could not help smiling. If he had"
"been armed with a knout, his reception could not have been more hostile."
"“I must beg of you to believe,” said he, “that I come as a friend and"
not as an enemy.”
She pointed to a straight-backed chair.
"this, and all will be well.'"
"So the woman went forth with a light heart. It was so simple, only a"
"pinch of mustard-seed, and mustard grew in every garden. She would get"
"the seed and be back very quickly, and then the Lord Buddha would give"
her back those she loved who had died. She clothed herself again and
"tied up her hair, and went cheerfully and asked at the first house,"
"'Give me a pinch of mustard-seed,' and it was given readily. So with her"
treasure in her hand she was going forth back to the Buddha full of
"delight, when she remembered."
"'Has ever anyone died in your household?' she asked, looking round"
wistfully.
"The man answered 'Yes,' that death had been with them but recently. Who"
"could this woman be, he thought, to ask such a question? And the woman"
"went forth, the seed dropping from her careless fingers, for it was of"
"no value. So she would try again and again, but it was always the same."
"Death had taken his tribute from all. Father or mother, son or brother,"
"daughter or wife, there was always a gap somewhere, a vacant place"
"beside the meal. From house to house throughout the city she went, till"
"at last the new hope faded away, and she learned from the world, what"
"she had not believed from the Buddha, that death and life are one."
"So she returned, and she became a nun, poor soul! taking on her the two"
"hundred and twenty-seven vows, which are so hard to keep that nowadays"
nuns keep but five of them.[1]
"This is the teaching of the Buddha, that death is inevitable; this is"
"the consolation he offers, that all men must know death; no one can"
escape death; no one can escape the sorrow of the death of those whom he
"from the side she had just left; and, looking round, she saw with terror"
"a great eagle sweep down upon the baby, and carry it off in its claws."
"She turned round and waved her arms and cried out to the eagle, 'He!"
he!' hoping it would be frightened and drop the baby. But it cared
"nothing for her cries or threats, and swept on with long curves over the"
"forest trees, away out of sight."
"Then the mother turned to gain the bank once more, and suddenly she"
missed her son who had been waiting for her. He had seen his mother wave
"her arms; he had heard her shout, and he thought she was calling him to"
"come to her. So the brave little man walked down into the water, and the"
"black current carried him off his feet at once. He was gone, drowned in"
"the deep water below the ford, tossing on the waves towards the sea."
No one can write of the despair of the girl when she threw herself under
a tree in the forest. The song says it was very terrible.
"At last she said to herself, 'I will get up now and return to my father"
in Thawatti; he is all I have left. Though I have forsaken him all these
"years, yet now that my husband and his children are dead, my father will"
"take me back again. Surely he will have pity on me, for I am much to be"
pitied.'
"So she went on, and at length, after many days, she came to the gates of"
the great city where her father lived.
"At the entering of the gates she met a large company of people,"
"mourners, returning from a funeral, and she spoke to them and asked"
them:
'Who is it that you have been burying to-day so grandly with so many
mourners?'
"food than the mists of his own dreaming. However, it was different"
"when,--pausing before each word after the manner of a child,--she came"
"to a passage of the poet's, and read:"
"""'In that moment I say most truly that the spirit of life, which hath"
"its dwelling in the most secret chambers of the heart, began to tremble"
"so violently that the least pulse of my body shook herewith, and in the"
"trembling it said these words: ""Here is a deity stronger than I who,"
"coming shall rule over me.""'"""
"At that the Girl let the book fall and, going down on her knees and"
"taking both his hands in hers, she raised to him a look so full of"
adoring worship that he felt himself awed before it.
"""That 'ere Dante ain't so far off after all. I know jest how he feels."
"Oh, I ain't fit to read to you, to talk to you, to kiss you."""
"Nevertheless, he saw to it that she did."
"After this he told her about the Inferno, and she listened eagerly to"
"his description of the unfortunate characters, though she declared, when"
"he explained some of the crimes that they had committed, that they ""Got"
"only what was rightly comin' to them."""
The patient could hardly suppress his amusement. Dante was discarded and
instead they told each other how much love there was in that little
cabin on Cloudy Mountain.
The days that followed were all much like this one. Food was brought up
"from The Polka and, by degrees, the patient's strength came back. And it"
was but natural that he became so absorbed in his newly-found happiness
"that he gradually was losing all sense of danger. Late one night,"
"enclosed like a lake by mountains and volcanic cones, all this must"
"also appear strange and beautiful to the Trobrianders. In the villages,"
"they are entertained by their male friends, the language spoken by both"
"parties being that of Dobu, which differs completely from Kiriwinian,"
but which the Sinaketans learn in early youth. It is remarkable that
no one in Dobu speaks Kiriwinian.
"As said above, no sexual relations of any description take place"
between the visitors and the women of Dobu. As one of the informants
told me:
"""We do not sleep with women of Dobu, for Dobu is the final mountain"
"(Koyaviguna Dobu); it is a taboo of the mwasila magic."""
"But when I enquired, whether the results of breaking this taboo would"
"be baneful to their success in Kula only, the reply was that they were"
"afraid of breaking it, and that it was ordained of old (tokunabogwo"
ayguri) that no man should interfere with the women of Dobu. As a
"matter of fact, the Sinaketans are altogether afraid of the Dobuans,"
and they would take good care not to offend them in any way.
"After some three or four days' sojourn in Dobu, the Sinaketan"
fleet starts on its return journey. There is no special ceremony of
"farewell. In the early morning, they receive their talo'i (farewell"
"gifts) of food, betel-nut, objects of use and sometimes also a Kula"
valuable is enclosed amongst the the talo'i. Heavily laden as they
"are, they lighten their canoes by means of a magic called kaylupa,"
and sail away northwards once more.
realised then exactly how the professional manhunter glares at the
"prey into whom, after many days, he has set his claws. My wife gasped"
"and clutched at my elbow, little Jane screamed, and for a few seconds"
even I thought that the game had been played and that serious business
"was about to begin. Dawson gave us a few seconds of apprehension, and"
"then laughed grimly. From his waistcoat pocket he drew a key, and the"
fetters were removed almost as quickly as they had been clapped on.
"""Tit for tat,"" said he. ""You have had your fun with me. Fair play is a"
"jewel."""
"Little Jane was the first to recover speech. ""I knew that dear Colonel"
"Dawson was only playing,"" she cried. ""He only did it to please me."
"Thank you, Colonel, though you did frighten me just a weeny bit at"
"first."" And pulling him down towards her she kissed him heartily upon"
his prickly cheek. It was a queer scene.
"The door bell rang loudly, and we were informed that a policeman stood"
"without who was inquiring for Chief Inspector Dawson. ""Show him in"
"here,"" said I. The constable entered, and his manner of addressing my"
guest--that of a raw second lieutenant towards a general of
division--shed a new light upon Dawson's pre-eminence in his Service.
"""A telegram for you, sir."" Dawson seized it, was about to tear it"
"open, remembered suddenly his hostess, and bowed towards her. ""Have I"
"your permission, madam?"" he asked. She smiled and nodded; I turned"
"away to conceal a laugh. ""Good,"" cried Dawson, poring over the"
"message. ""I think, Mr. Copplestone, that you had better telephone to"
"your office and say that you are unavoidably detained."""
"""What--what is it?"" cried my wife, who had again become white with"
sudden fear.
"""Something which will occupy the attention of your husband and myself"
Concha smiled a subtle smile and turned her eyes upon the ground.
"""If you will remember, I had other matters to communicate to your"
"Excellency,"" she said meekly--almost too meekly, Rollo thought. ""This"
"matter of Luis Fernandez slipped my memory, till it was my good fortune"
"to be reminded of it by Don Ramon!"""
"And all the while the long lean Sergeant Cardono, his elbows glued to"
"his sides, sat his horse as if spiked to the saddle, and chuckled with"
quiet glee at the scene.
"""He will do yet,"" he muttered; ""'twas ever thus that my father told me"
of the Gran' Lor' before Salamanca. Be he as stiff as a ramrod and as
"frigid as his own North Pole, the little one will thaw him--bend"
him--make a fool of him for his soul's good. She is not an Andaluse of
"the gipsy blood for nothing! He will make him a soldier yet, this young"
"man, by the especial grace of San Vicente de Paul, only I do not think"
that either of them will deserve readmission to the Convent of the Holy
"Innocents!"""
More than once Rollo endeavoured to extract from Concha to what place
"her self-assumed mission was taking her, and at what point she would"
leave them. It was in vain. The lady baffled all his endeavours with the
most consummate ease.
"""You have not communicated to me,"" she said, ""the purport of your own"
"adventures. How then can I tell at what place our ways divide?"""
"""I am forbidden to reveal to any save General Cabrera alone my secret"
"instructions!"" said Rollo, with such dignity as he could muster at short"
notice.
"He pointed to the four men who still stood by the wall, the firing party"
"at attention before them, and the eyes of all on the next wave of the"
general's hand which would mean life or death.
La Giralda drew a quick breath. Would the hold she had over him be
sufficient for what she was about to ask? He was a fierce man and a
"cruel, this Ramon Cabrera, who loved naught in the world except his"
"mother, and had gained his present ascendency in the councils of Don"
Carlos by the unbending and consistent ferocity of his conduct.
"""These are no traitors, General,"" she said; ""they are true men, and deep"
"in the councils of the cause."""
She bent and whispered in his ear words which others could not hear. The
"face of the Carlist general darkened from a dull pink to purple, and"
then his colour ebbed away to a ghastly ashen white as he listened.
"Twice he sprang up from the stone bench where he had seated himself,"
"ground his heel into the gravel brought from the river-bed beneath, and"
"muttered a characteristic imprecation, ""Ten for one of their women I"
"have slain already--by San Vicente after this it shall be a hundred!"""
For La Giralda was telling him the tale of his mother's shooting by
Nogueras.
"Then all suddenly he reseated himself, and beckoned to Concha."
"""Come hither,"" he said; ""let me see these fellows' papers, and tell me"
"how they came into your hands!"""
Concha was ready.
"the slightest; is it not so?  Have you met before, since that evening in"
"the water theatre when I did first present you to each other?"""
"""I have seen her but once between,"" answered Grey, still in the same"
"quiet, stunned fashion; and when they had entered the house, he made"
"excuse to go at once to his room, declining all proffer of refreshment"
or further converse.
"Lord Sandford looked after him with an intent look upon his face, which"
"slowly clouded over, till there was something almost malignant and"
ferocious in his aspect.
"""So it is as I thought.  He has been hit, and hard hit.  Where can he"
"have seen her in the interim?  They would not have been standing thus,"
"talking thus, if some bond had not been established between them.  Yet I"
thought I had kept an eye upon him.  I knew there might be danger.  I
saw it the first moment that they met.  There is something akin in their
natures.  They feel it themselves. Hr-r-r-rr! that must be put a stop
to.  I will have no rival in Geraldine’s heart.  She does not love me
"yet; but she fears me a little, and she thinks of me. That is no bad"
"basis to build upon.  I shall win her yet, if I have a fair field.  But"
"a rival—no, that must not be!  And yet I read somewhat in her eyes"
to-night which had not been there before.  The fiend take all false
"friends!  I must rid myself of this one, and that speedily.  I have"
"liked him; but he shall not stand in my way.  Well, ’tis I have made"
him: I can quickly unmake him.  Let me but think of the way and the
"means.  Grey Dumaresq, you are a pretty fellow and a pleasant comrade;"
but you shall never be suffered to stand in the light of Sandford’s
"hopes and plans and desires.  Look to yourself, my friend; for evil is"
"abroad for you!"""
Steve put it into words after his fashion. 'It must be a big place we
"are going to,' he said, about noon of the second day, 'or who is to"
"eat all this? And do you mark, Master Martin? We meet no one coming"
back. All go south. This place Nuremberg that they talk of must be
worth seeing.'
"'It should be,' I said."
And after that the excitement of the march began to take hold of me. I
"began to think and wonder, and look forward, with an eagerness I did"
"not understand, to the issues of this."
"We lay a night at Bamberg, where the crowd and confusion and the"
stress of people were so great that Steve would have it we had come to
"Nuremberg. And certainly I had never known such a hurly-burly, nor"
heard of it except at the great fair at Dantzic. The night after we
"lay at Erlangen, which we found fortified, trenched, and guarded, with"
"troops lying in the square, and the streets turned into stables. From"
that place to Nuremberg was a matter of ten miles only; but the press
was so great on the road that it took us a good part of the day to
ride from one to the other. In the open country on either side of the
way strong bodies of horse and foot were disposed. It seemed to me
that here was already an army and a camp.
"But when late in the afternoon we entered Nuremberg itself, and viewed"
"the traffic in the streets, and the endless lines of gabled houses,"
"the splendid mansions and bridges, the climbing roofs and turrets and"
"spires of this, the greatest city in Germany, then we thought little"
of all we had seen before. Here thousands upon thousands rubbed
shoulders in the streets; here continuous boats turned the river into
solid land. Here we were told were baked every day a hundred thousand
Books of the beginning of last century to realise the difference of
appeal. Everything offered then was either an appeal to fear or to
"priggishness, and one wonders how it is that our grandparents and their"
parents ever recovered from the effects of such stories as were offered
to them. But there is the consoling thought that no lasting impression
"was made upon them, such as I believe _may_ be possible by the right"
kind of story.
I offer a few examples of the old type of story:
Here is an encouraging address offered by a certain Mr. Janeway to
children about the year 1828:
"“Dare you do anything which your parents forbid you, and neglect to"
"do what they command? Dare you to run up and down on the Lord's Day,"
"or do you keep in to read your book, and learn what your good parents"
command?”
Such an address would have almost tempted children to envy the lot of
"orphans, except that the guardians and less close relations might have"
"been equally, if not more, severe."
"From “The Curious Girl,” published about 1809: “Oh! papa, I hope you"
"will have no reason to be dissatisfied with me, for I love my studies"
"very much, and I am never so happy at my play as when I have been"
assiduous at my lessons all day.”
"“Adolphus: How strange it is, papa, you should believe it possible for"
"me to act so like a child, now that I am twelve years old!”"
Here is a specimen taken from a Chap-book about 1825:
"The cooks served out the greasy stew as quickly as they could, but we"
were so tired and ill-tempered that we shouted abuse at them without
"reason and without being provoked, and banged our plates and tins. The"
"war, the advance, the slaughter were forgotten. We were conscious of"
"nothing but weariness, stiffness, and petty irritation."
The following day we marched to a ration dump. The wooden cases of
"rations were piled up in gigantic cubes, so that the entire dump looked"
"like a town of windowless, wooden buildings. We formed one long file"
"that circled slowly past the stacks, each man taking one case on to his"
shoulder or back and carrying it to the train. And so we circled round
and round throughout the monotonous day.
"In the evening I did not wait in the dinner queue, but went to the St."
Martin. It was kept by an old woman and her two daughters. They were
tortured by anxiety:
"""Les Allemands vont venir ici--de Shermans come heer?"" they asked. But I"
"knew no more than they did. I told them, against my own conviction, that"
"the German advance would be held up, but they remained anxious. The"
uproar of the cannonade was louder than ever. All the windows of the
"building shook and rattled. The old woman muttered: ""'Tis niet goet,"
"'tis niet goet,"" and the elder daughter echoed: ""Oh, 'tiss no bon, 'tiss"
"no bon."""
Two British officers entered. They looked round and saw that private
soldiers were sitting at the tables. But the St. Martin was the biggest
"estaminet in the village and provided the best wines and coffees, so"
"they stood in the doorway, undecided what to do. They asked one of the"
girls if there was a restaurant for officers in the neighbourhood. She
"answered: ""No--no restaurant for officeerss--you come heer--privates,"
"zey no hurt you--privates, officeerss, all same."""
thought; and he sent his light craft spinning rapidly up the stream as
the questions formed themselves.
It was an exquisite summer morning.  The bells in the many towers and
steeples of the city had chimed the hour of five.  The sun had long been
"up, yet the glamour and glory of the new-born day still lay upon the"
sleeping city and the dewy meadows of the opposite shore.  Grey rowed on
"rapidly, yet drinking in the beauty of all he saw.  He knew not how far"
he had rowed; he had lost count of his surroundings; he was absorbed in
"a deep reverie, when he was suddenly brought up breathless and wondering"
by the sound of a voice singing—a voice so clear and sweet and true that
"he asked himself whether it could be any creature of earth that sang, or"
whether it might be some nymph or mermaid such as sailors spoke of in
their wondrous tales.
"He gazed about him.  He saw that he was passing a garden, and that a"
group of weeping willows overhung the water at this spot.  The singing
"seemed to come from thence.  Burning curiosity possessed him, and he"
"very slowly and softly rowed himself onwards, till the prow of his boat"
met the drooping boughs with a soft rustle.  The song ceased suddenly.
"Grey turned in his seat, and drew himself within the sheltering shade;"
"as he did so, a quick exclamation broke from him.  He dropped his oars"
"as he exclaimed,—"
"""The Lady Geraldine!"""
*      *      *      *      *
How had it come about?  Grey never could have said.  But now it was all
told—the story of his chequered life.  She had been silent at the
"first—not exactly resentful of his intrusion, not unwilling to let him"
"have speech of her again, but quiet, with a maidenly reserve and dignity"
Madame Gilbert the stranger stared openly at her cheek and ear and the
"coils of bright copper hair. Madame knew that he was watching her, and"
"rather liked the scrutiny. She had recognized him at once, and would"
have been slightly humiliated if he had failed to be interested in her.
"It is true that she had met him but once before in her life, and that"
"some four years since, but as Madame had condescended to recollect"
him--I have said that her memory for faces was royal--a failure on his
part to remember her would have been an offence unpardonable.
"Madame continued to munch sweet stuff, and the man, his tea completed,"
"rose, paid his bill, and then passed slowly in front of her. He needed"
"encouragement before he would speak. So Madame gave it, a quick look and"
a smile of invitation. He bowed.
"""Have I not the honour to meet again the Signora Guilberti?"" said he."
"""The Signora Guilberti,"" assented Madame, ""or Madame Guilbert, or Madame"
"Gilbert, as rendered by the rough English tongue. I have stooped to"
"anglicise my name,"" she went on, ""though I hate the clipped English"
"version."" She indicated a chair, and the lawyer--he was a lawyer--sat"
down.
"""Is it possible that Madame honours me with remembrance?"""
"""Let me place you,"" said she, happy in the display of her"
"accomplishments, ""and don't seek to guide my memory. It was in the"
"Spring of 1915, at a reception in the garden of Devonshire House. You"
were in attendance upon Her Majesty the Queen-Mother of Portugal. There
"were present representatives of the Italian Red Cross, for Italy, the"
"land of my late husband, had ranged herself with the Allies. You are a"
"lawyer of the _haute noblesse_. Your clients are peers and princes, of"
old princes in exile and of new peers in possession. I recall you most
"""Yes; Miss Disey's in.  D'you want to see 'er?  What nyme?"""
"Gyp produced her card.  The maid looked at it, at Gyp, and at two"
"brown-painted doors, as much as to say, ""Where will you have it?"" Then,"
"opening the first of them, she said:"
"""Tyke a seat, please; I'll fetch her."""
"Gyp went in.  In the middle of what was clearly the dining-room, she"
tried to subdue the tremor of her limbs and a sense of nausea. The table
"against which her hand rested was covered with red baize, no doubt to"
keep the stains of mutton from penetrating to the wood. On the mahogany
sideboard reposed a cruet-stand and a green dish of very red apples.  A
bamboo-framed talc screen painted with white and yellow marguerites stood
before a fireplace filled with pampas-grass dyed red.  The chairs were of
"red morocco, the curtains a brownish-red, the walls green, and on them"
hung a set of Landseer prints.  The peculiar sensation which red and
green in juxtaposition produce on the sensitive was added to Gyp's
"distress. And, suddenly, her eyes lighted on a little deep-blue china"
"bowl. It stood on a black stand on the mantel-piece, with nothing in it."
"To Gyp, in this room of red and green, with the smell of mutton creeping"
"in, that bowl was like the crystallized whiff of another world.  Daphne"
"Wing--not Daisy Wagge--had surely put it there! And, somehow, it touched"
"her--emblem of stifled beauty, emblem of all that the girl had tried to"
pour out to her that August afternoon in her garden nearly a year ago.
"Thin Eastern china, good and really beautiful!  A wonder they allowed it"
to pollute this room!
"A sigh made her turn round.  With her back against the door and a white,"
"scared face, the girl was standing.  Gyp thought: 'She has suffered"
"horribly.'  And, going impulsively up to her, she held out her hand."
"for their boots were soaked through and their heavy buffalo overcoats,"
"caps and ear-muffs were covered with snow, which all, save Rance,"
proceeded to remove by shaking their shoulders and stamping their feet.
"The latter, however, calmly took off his gloves, pulled out a"
"beautifully-creased handkerchief from his pocket, and began slowly to"
flick off the snow from his elegant mink overcoat before hanging it
carefully upon a peg on the wall. After that he went over to the table
"and warmed his hands over the lighted candle there. Meanwhile, Sonora,"
"his nose, as well as his hands which with difficulty he removed from his"
"heavy fur mittens, showing red and swollen from the effects of the"
"biting cold, had gone over to the fire, where he ejaculated:"
"""Ouf, I'm cold! Glad you're safe, Girl!"""
"""Yes, Girl, The Polka's had a narrow squeak,"" observed Nick, stamping"
"his feet which, as well as his legs, were wrapped with pieces of"
blankets for added warmth.
"Unconsciously, at his words, the Girl's eyes travelled to the bed; then,"
"drawing her robe snugly about her, and seating herself, she asked with"
suppressed excitement:
"""Why, Nick, what's the matter? What's--"""
Rance took it upon himself to do the answering. Sauntering over to the
"Girl, he drawled out:"
"""It takes you a long time to get up, seems to me. You haven't so much"
"on, either,"" he went on, piercing her with his eyes."
"Smilingly and not in the least disconcerted by the Sheriff's remark, the"
Girl picked up a rug from the floor and wound it about her knees.
"of hesitation.  ""When we were lovers in the old days I was, as you know,"
"a pure, honest, upright woman, with thoughts only for my God and for"
"yourself.  But I am that no longer.  I am unworthy your love, Gerald.  I"
"am unfit to be your wife, and can never be--never!"" and she threw"
"herself upon the couch near by and burst into a flood of tears, while I"
stood there rigid as a statue.
CHAPTER ELEVEN.
DEANE SPEAKS HIS MIND.
An hour later I was seated in my room at the Embassy staring blankly at
"the blotting-pad before me, utterly perplexed and bewildered.  I loved"
"Yolande--nay, she was my idol; nevertheless she had firmly refused to"
allow me to resume my place at her side.  At one moment it seemed to me
as though she had actually made a sacrifice for my sake; yet at another
I could not help regarding both her and her mother with distinct
suspicion.  My love's strange words were in themselves a sufficient
self-condemnation.  Her service as a political agent had been secured by
"one or other of the Powers--France, I suspected; and, to put it plainly,"
she was a spy!
This knowledge had come upon me like a thunderbolt.  Of all the women I
had known and least suspected of endeavouring to learn the secrets of
"our diplomacy, Yolande was certainly the chief.  The events which had"
culminated in her accepting this odious office were veiled in mystery.
Why had she done this?  Who had tempted her or forced her to it?
"Those tears of hers, when she had made confession, were the tears of a"
"woman in the depths of despair and degradation, and I, loving her so"
"fondly, could not but allow my heart to go forth in sympathy.  There was"
an affinity between us that I knew might some day prove fatal.
much in all my life and I implored him not to report me. I don't
"remember what happened next, I was in such a state. But he did report"
me. I got a court martial and was sentenced to death for sleeping at my
post. They put me into the guard-room and I expected to be shot the next
"day. It was a rotten feeling, I can tell you. I didn't think about"
myself so much as about the wife and the little boy. I wouldn't go
through a night like that again for anything. But I went to sleep all
the same. I woke up the next morning when someone came into the
"guard-room. I didn't know where I was for a second or two, and then in a"
flash I realized I'd got to die. I don't mind admitting that I rested my
face against the wall and blubbered like a kid. Anyone would have done
"the same, I don't care what you say. But the man who'd just come in"
said:
"""'Pull yourself together, old chap--you're all right for to-day,"
anyhow.' I sat bolt upright and stared at him.
"""'They're not going to shoot me?'"
"""'Not to-day,' he answered. 'Cheer up, all sorts of things might happen"
before to-morrow.'
"""The joy I felt was so big that I can't tell you how big it was. But I"
soon felt miserable again. I couldn't understand what had happened. I
didn't know whether I was going to die or live. The uncertainty became
so terrible that I wished I'd been shot that morning--all would have
"been over then. They brought me a meal, but I couldn't eat. I asked"
"them what was going to happen, but they didn't know. Another night came,"
"but I didn't get any sleep at all. I lay tossing about on my bed, now"
"hoping, now despairing. I thought of home mostly, but once or twice I"
thought of the kids in the school where I taught--to die like this after
"the send-off they gave me! Still, they wouldn't know, they'd think I was"
LIKE A FALLING STAR
"Rollo judged aright. It was indeed no time for love-making, and, to do"
"the young man justice, he did not connect any idea so concrete with the"
impulsive kiss he had given to Concha.
She it was who had saved his life at Sarria. She was perilling her own
in order to accompany and assist his expedition. She had drawn up the
"ladder he had foolishly forgotten. Yet, in spite of the fact that he was"
"a young man and by no means averse from love, Rollo was so clean-minded"
"and so little given to think himself desirable in the eyes of women,"
that it never struck him that the presence of La Giralda and Concha
might be interpreted upon other and more personal principles than he had
modestly represented to himself.
"True, Rollo was vain as a peacock--but not of his love-conquests."
"Punctilious as any Spaniard upon the smallest point of honour, in a"
quarrel he was as ready as a Parisian _maître d'armes_ to pull out sword
or pistol. Nevertheless when a man boasted in his presence of the
"favours of a woman, he thought him a fool and a braggart--and was in"
general nowise backward in telling him so.
"Thus it happened that, though Concha had received no honester or better"
"intentioned kiss in her life, the giver of it went about his military"
"duties with a sense of having said his prayers, or generally, having"
performed some action raising himself in his own estimation.
"""God bless her,"" he said to himself, ""I will be a better man for her"
"sweet sake. And, by heavens, if I had had such a sister, I might have"
"been a better fellow long ere this! God bless her, I say!"""
"who, shortly before his death, declared her to be “the only"
"woman in contemporary literature who knew how to write a novel,”"
and that her future work would be her best. Another eminent
"English critic, Dr. Robertson Nicholl, spoke for some of the"
best students of modern literature in saying:—
“Gertrude Atherton is the ablest woman writer of fiction
now living.”
"In her most notable novel, “The Conqueror,” Gertrude Atherton"
has chosen in “the true and romantic story of Alexander
Hamilton” a subject which would have attracted few woman
"writers, and has handled those parts of it with which many men"
have busied their brains in such a way that _The New York Times
Saturday Review_ remarked that it
“Holds more romance than nine-tenths of the imaginative
fiction of the day and more veracity than ninety-nine
hundredths of the history. She is master of her
material.”
“Certainly this country has produced no writer who approaches
"Mrs. Atherton,” says one critic, while another adds that to have"
so “re-created a great man as Mrs. Atherton has done in this
novel is to have written one’s own title to greatness.” All
alike regard it as “a thing apart” (_The Critic_); “a remarkable
"production, full of force, vigour, brains, and insight” (_Boston"
Herald_); “an entrancing book . . . brilliantly written”
(_Glasgow Herald_). “It is hardly too much to say that she has
invented a new kind of historical novel” is the comment of the
"_Athenæum_ (London), with the addition that “the experiment is a"
remarkable success.”
"leave her lying in Genoa!"""
"""I'll attend to my own end of the business,"" said Captain Dove with"
"angry decision. ""If you're going to London by train to-night, so am I."
"If you like to come back on board with me, I'll sail you round. But I'm"
"not the only man on the _Olive Branch_ who can sail a ship. Why, I've"
half a dozen broken captains--and most of 'em with extra masters'
"certificates, too--among my crew."
"""I've left Brasse and Da Costa in charge, and they'll work her across"
the Bay if I tell them to. I've only to send them a wire. And all you
have to do now is to say which way you want to travel--with me; for I'm
"going to stick to you like a leech till the day you pay me off."""
"Slyne walked to the window, humming a tune. But it was obviously costing"
him all of his refreshed fortitude to refrain from expressing his real
"sentiments toward Captain Dove. His face, as he stood glaring blindly"
"out at the beautiful scene before him, was like that of a wild beast"
"balked of its fair prey. But from between his bared, set teeth the"
careless hum came unbroken.
"""I think you're foolish,"" was all he said when he turned again,"
convinced that it would be a waste of time to argue the matter with the
"old man, ""but--suit yourself. Jobling and I _must_ get to London with"
Sal--Lady Josceline at the earliest possible moment. If you insist on
travelling with us to-night--so be it. All I want you to understand is
"that there's to be no more drinking, and that you must be advised by me"
in every other particular. This isn't really the sort of game you're
liable to shine in. It would be far better for all of us if you'd stay
"on board your ship."""
Captain Dove's weather-beaten countenance was turning slowly purple. He
came to be known as the “Old Version.”
"d. _The Bay Psalm Book_, Boston, 1640. This was the first book printed"
in English-speaking America. It was made to obtain greater literalness
to the Hebrew original than was found in the versions then in use. The
book reigned supreme among the English churches in New England for over
"a century. Seventy editions of it were printed in America, the last in"
"1773. Eighteen editions appeared in England, and twenty-two in Scotland."
"There were no tunes given it until 1698, then only 13, with the air in"
the bass.
"e. _The Scottish Psalter_, completed 1650. Special mention is made of"
this version of the Psalms because it is the source of nearly all the
selections of metrical psalms which constitute Book Five of the
_Hymnary_. The number of versions and editions of psalms which appeared
"on the Continent and in England were numerous and confusing, each"
"claiming its own special merits. Finally, in the interests of better"
literary diction and greater unity in singing in the Scottish
"Presbyterian churches, the General Assembly authorized a new version."
"The result, after many years’ work, was the famous _Scottish Psalter_ of"
1650 which remains the standard work in Scotland today.
There is a certain “dignified crudeness” in some of the literary
expressions but the psalms have long been learned in this version and
have become an important part of the religious training and experience
"of millions of English speaking people, especially in Scotland."
The Scottish Psalter first appeared with words only. There were no notes
and no suggestions for melodies. The succeeding one hundred years were a
"time of confusion. The tunes used were few in number, such as the"
"leaders had learned from various sources, and passed on to succeeding"
generations by rote. The time came when better singing and better tunes
"Dharma turned, in the thoughts of the Burmese Buddhists, for no one can"
"believe the incomprehensible. A man has a soul, and it passes from life"
"to life, as a traveller from inn to inn, till at length it is ended in"
heaven. But not till he has attained heaven in his heart will he attain
heaven in reality.
"Many children, the Burmese will tell you, remember their former lives."
"As they grow older the memories die away and they forget, but to the"
young children they are very clear. I have seen many such.
About fifty years ago in a village named Okshitgon were born two
"children, a boy and a girl. They were born on the same day in"
"neighbouring houses, and they grew up together, and played together, and"
"loved each other. And in due course they married and started a family,"
"and maintained themselves by cultivating their dry, barren fields about"
"the village. They were always known as devoted to each other, and they"
died as they had lived--together. The same death took them on the same
day; so they were buried without the village and were forgotten; for the
times were serious.
"It was the year after the English army had taken Mandalay, and all Burma"
"was in a fury of insurrection. The country was full of armed men, the"
"roads were unsafe, and the nights were lighted with the flames of"
"burning villages. It was a bad time for peace-loving men, and many such,"
"fleeing from their villages, took refuge in larger places nearer the"
centres of administration.
Okshitgon was in the midst of one of the worst of all the distressed
"districts, and many of its people fled, and one of them, a man named"
"Maung Kan, with his young wife went to the village of Kabyu and lived"
there.
"ago, eyed his profile, without daring to ask questions. Before he reached"
"home, Winton stopped at a post-office, and sent this telegram:"
"""Gyp and the baby are with me letter follows.--WINTON."""
It salved a conscience on which that fellow's figure in the doorway
"weighed; besides, it was necessary, lest Fiorsen should go to the police."
The rest must wait till he had talked with Gyp.
"There was much to do, and it was late before they dined, and not till"
Markey had withdrawn could they begin their talk.
Close to the open windows where Markey had placed two hydrangea
"plants--just bought on his own responsibility, in token of silent"
"satisfaction--Gyp began.  She kept nothing back, recounting the whole"
miserable fiasco of her marriage.  When she came to Daphne Wing and her
"discovery in the music-room, she could see the glowing end of her"
father's cigar move convulsively.  That insult to his adored one seemed
"to Winton so inconceivable that, for a moment, he stopped her recital by"
getting up to pace the room.  In her own house--her own house!
"And--after that, she had gone on with him! He came back to his chair and"
"did not interrupt again, but his stillness almost frightened her."
"Coming to the incidents of the day itself, she hesitated.  Must she tell"
"him, too, of Rosek--was it wise, or necessary?  The all-or-nothing"
"candour that was part of her nature prevailed, and she went straight on,"
"and, save for the feverish jerking of his evening shoe, Winton made no"
"sign.  When she had finished, he got up and slowly extinguished the end"
of his cigar against the window-sill; then looking at her lying back in
"her chair as if exhausted, he said: ""By God!"" and turned his face away to"
the window.
very few cases where M. Léonce de Brotonne's still more recent edition
"is cited under his name. By ""F.O.,"" France, No.----, and ""F.O.,"""
"Prussia, No.----, are meant the volumes of _our_ Foreign Office"
despatches relating to France and Prussia. For the sake of brevity I
"have called Napoleon's Marshals and high officials by their names, not"
by their titles: but a list of these is given at the close of vol.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION
The demand for this work so far exceeded my expectations that I was
"unable to make any considerable changes in the second edition, issued"
"in March, 1902; and circumstances again make it impossible for me to"
"give the work that thorough recension which I should desire. I have,"
"however, carefully considered the suggestions offered by critics, and"
have adopted them in some cases. Professor Fournier of Vienna has most
kindly furnished me with details which seem to relegate to the domain
of legend the famous ice catastrophe at Austerlitz; and I have added a
"note to this effect on p. 50 of vol. ii. On the other hand, I may"
justly claim that the publication of Count Balmain's reports relating
"to St. Helena has served to corroborate, in all important details, my"
account of Napoleon's captivity.
It only remains to add that I much regret the omission of Mr. Oman's
"name from II. 12-13 of page viii of the Preface, an omission rendered"
all the more conspicuous by the appearance of the first volume of his
"""History of the Peninsular War"" in the spring of this year."
inhuman as a fiend.
"The Girl clenched her hands, heedless of the nails cutting into her"
"palms: ""Won't you wait a moment,--please, wait, Jack!"""
"""Wait? What for?"" the Sheriff flung at her brutally, his finger"
twitching on the trigger.
"The Girl's lips parted to answer, then closed again dumbly,--for it was"
"then that she saw the boots, then the legs of the road agent slide"
"uncertainly through the open trap, fumble clumsily for the rungs of the"
"ladder, then slip and stumble as the weight of the following body came"
upon them while the weak fingers strained desperately for a hold. The
whole heart and soul and mind of the Girl seemed to be reaching out
"impotently to give her lover strength, to hurry him down fast enough to"
forestall a shot from the Sheriff. It seemed hours until the road agent
"reached the bottom of the ladder, then lurched with unseeing eyes to a"
"chair and, finally, fell forward limply, with his arms and head resting"
"on the table. Still dumb with dread, the Girl watched Rance slowly"
circle round the wounded man; it was not until the Sheriff returned his
pistol to its holster that she breathed freely again.
"""So, you dropped into The Polka to-night to play a little game of poker?"
"Funny how things change about in an hour or two!"" Rance chuckled"
mirthlessly; it seemed to suit his sardonic humour to taunt his helpless
"rival. ""You think you can play poker,--that's your conviction, is it?"
"Well, you can play freeze-out as to your chances, Mr. Johnson of"
"Sacramento. Come, speak up,--it's shooting or the tree,--which shall it"
"be?"""
"Goaded beyond endurance by Rance's taunting of the unconscious man, the"
"Girl, fumbling in her bosom for her pistol, turned upon him in a sudden,"
Eilert and I followed to my room.
*       *       *       *       *
"As a matter of fact, I went out again with Eilert at once. He had a great"
"deal to tell me and explain to me, and I was not unwilling to listen to"
"him then. Really, Eilert was not too bad, a fine fellow with four ragged,"
"magnificent youngsters by his first wife, who had died two years before,"
"and another child by his second wife. He must have forgotten, as he told"
"me this, the yarn about the sick wife and the ailing children that he had"
spun for me last winter. The girl who had come down the stairs with the
"message from the ""missis"" was no servant, but Eilert's young wife. And"
"she, too, was all right--strong and good, handy about the stables, and"
pregnant again.
"It all looks good to me, Eilert: your wife and everything you tell me"
about your family.
"No one will understand my strange contentment, then; I had been full of an"
obscure happiness from the moment I came to this house. Probably a mere
"coincidence, but that did not detract from my satisfactory state of mind;"
"I was pleased with everything, and all things added to my cheerful frame"
"of mind. There were some pigs by the barn, very affectionate pigs, because"
they were used to the children playing with them and kissing them and
"riding on their backs. And there was one of the goats, up on the roof of"
"course, standing so far out along the edge that it was a wonder he didn't"
"grow dizzy. Seagulls flew criss-cross over the fields, screaming their"
"own language to one another, and being friends or enemies to the best of"
"their ability. Down by the mouth of the river, just beneath the sunset,"
began the great road that winds up through the woods and the valley. There
is something of the friendliness of a living being about such a forest
"drunk complete their service by swinging their hammocks, sprinkling them"
with cold water and fanning them as they lie in a stupor. Smoking is
"another social custom, but the cigars are mere hollow rolls of tobacco"
and the lighted end is held in the mouth. Among some of the tribes in
"Comagre the bodies of the caciques, or chief men, were preserved after"
death by surrounding them with a ring of fire built at a sufficient
distance to gradually dry the body until skin and bone alone remained.
The Indians with whom the visitor to Panama most frequently comes into
contact are those of the San Blas or Manzanillo country. These Indians
"hover curiously about the bounds of civilization, and approach without"
"actually crossing them. They are fishermen and sailors, and many of"
"their young men ship on the vessels touching at Colon, and, after"
"visiting the chief seaports of the United States, and even of France and"
"England, are swallowed up again in their tribe without affecting its"
customs to any appreciable degree. If in their wanderings they gain new
ideas or new desires they are not apparent. The man who silently offers
"you fish, fruits or vegetables from his cayuca on the beach at Colon may"
"have trod the docks at Havre or Liverpool, the levee at New Orleans or"
wandered along South Street in New York. Not a word of that can you coax
from him. Even in proffering his wares he does so with the fewest
"possible words, and an air of lofty indifference. Uncas of the"
Leather-Stocking Tales was no more silent and self-possessed a red-skin
than he.

THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. The heavy near-shore formations of the
Silurian in the Appalachian region thin out toward the west. The
"Medina and the Clinton sandstones are not found west of Ohio,"
where the first passes into a shale and the second into a
"limestone. The Niagara limestone, however, spreads from the Hudson"
"River to beyond the Mississippi, a distance of more than a"
thousand miles. During the Silurian period the Mississippi valley
"region was covered with a quiet, shallow, limestone-making sea,"
which received little waste from the low lands which bordered it.
The probable distribution of land and sea in eastern North America
and western Europe is shown in Figure 287. The fauna of the
interior region and of eastern Canada are closely allied with that
"of western Europe, and several species are identical. We can"
hardly account for this except by a shallow-water connection
between the two ancient epicontinental seas. It was perhaps along
the coastal shelves of a northern land connecting America and
Europe by way of Greenland and Iceland that the migration took
"place, so that the same species came to live in Iowa and in"
Sweden.
THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. So little is found of the rocks of the
system west of the Missouri River that it is quite probable that
the western part of the United States had for the most part
emerged from the sea at the close of the Ordovician and remained
land during the Silurian. At the same time the western land was
perhaps connected with the eastern land of Appalachia across
Arkansas and Mississippi; for toward the south the Silurian
sediments indicate an approach to shore.
LIFE OF THE SILURIAN
"are characterized, the one by the dominance of fishes, and the"
other by the appearance of amphibians and reptiles.
"Each of these systems is world-wide in its distribution, and may"
be recognized on any continent by its own peculiar fauna. The
names first given them in Great Britain have therefore come into
"general use, while their subdivisions, which often cannot be"
"correlated in different countries and different regions, are"
usually given local names.
The first three systems were named from the fact that their strata
are well displayed in Wales. The Cambrian carries the Roman name
"of Wales, and the Ordovician and Silurian the names of tribes of"
ancient Britons which inhabited the same country. The Devonian is
"named from the English county Devon, where its rocks were early"
studied. The Carboniferous was so called from the large amount of
coal which it was found to contain in Great Britain and
continental Europe.
THE CAMBRIAN
DISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Cambrian rocks outcrop in narrow belts
about the pre-Cambrian areas of eastern Canada and the Lake
"Superior region, the Adirondacks and the Green Mountains. Strips"
of Cambrian formations occupy troughs in the pre-Cambrian rocks of
New England and the maritime provinces of Canada; a long belt
borders on the west the crystalline rocks of the Blue Ridge; and
on the opposite side of the continent the Cambrian reappears in
the mountains of the Great Basin and the Canadian Rockies. In the
Mississippi valley it is exposed in small districts where uplift
has permitted the stripping off of younger rocks. Although the
"areas of outcrop are small, we may infer that Cambrian rocks were"
DR. J. C. BOSE CALLED AND EXAMINED
"83,635. (Chairman). The witness favoured an arrangement by which Indians"
"would enter the higher ranks of the service, either through the"
Provincial Service or by direct recruitment in India. The latter class
"of officers, after completing their education in India, should"
ordinarily go to Europe with a view to widening their experience. By
this he did not wish to decry the training given in the Indian
"Universities, which produced some of the very best men, and he would not"
make the rule absolute. It was not necessary for men of exceptional
"ability to go to England in order to occupy a high chair. Unfortunately,"
on account of there being no openings for men of genius in the
"Educational Service, distinguished men were driven to the profession of"
Law. In the present condition of India a larger number of distinguished
men were needed to give their lives to the education of the people.
"83,636. The witness himself had spent part of his career in Europe, and"
"looking back he could say that this had been of great profit to him,"
"not so much on account of the training he got, as by being brought into"
personal contact with eminent men whose influence extorted his
"admiration, and create in him a feeling of emulation. In this way he"
"owed a great deal to Lord Rayleigh under whom he worked, but he did not"
see why that advantage should not eventually be secured by Indians in
India under an Indian Lord Rayleigh.
"83,637. There should be only one Educational Service, but men who were"
distinguished in any subject should not start from its very lowest rung
but should be placed somewhere in the middle of it.
"83,638. There were men in the Provincial Service who were very"
afterwards rejoined Wafer.
"SPRIGGS, CAPTAIN FRANCIS FARRINGTON."
An uninteresting and bloody pirate without one single redeeming character.
"He learnt his art with the pirate Captain Lowther, afterwards serving as"
quartermaster with Captain Low and taking an active part in all the
barbarities committed by the latter.
"About 1720 Low took a prize, a man-of-war called the _Squirrel_. This he"
"handed over to some of the crew, who elected Spriggs their captain. The"
"ship they renamed the _Delight_, and in the night altered their course and"
"left Low. They made a flag, bearing upon it a white skeleton, holding in"
"one hand a dart striking a bleeding heart, and in the other an hourglass."
"Sailing to the West Indies, Spriggs took several prizes, treating the"
crews with abominable cruelty. On one occasion the pirates chased what
"they believed to be a Spanish ship, and after a long while they came"
alongside and fired a broadside into her. The ship immediately
"surrendered, and turned out to be a vessel the pirate had plundered only a"
"few days previously. This infuriated Spriggs and his crew, who showed"
their disappointment by half murdering the captain. After a narrow escape
"from being captured by a French man-of-war near the Island of St. Kitts,"
"Spriggs sailed north to the Summer Isles, or Bermudas. Taking a ship"
"coming from Rhode Island, they found her cargo to consist of horses."
Several of the pirates mounted these and galloped up and down the deck
until they were thrown. While plundering several small vessels of their
"cargo of logwood in the Bay of Honduras, Spriggs was surprised and"
"attacked by an English man-of-war, and the pirates only escaped by using"
their sweeps. Spriggs now went for a cruise off the coast of South
"Carolina, returning again to Honduras. This was a rash proceeding on"
"followed Tilly were, beside these, gentle and kindly men."
'God help us!' my lady cried fervently. 'God help this great city! God
help the North! Never was such a battle fought as must be fought
here!'
"We went down very much sobered, filled with awe and wonder and"
"great thoughts, the dullest of us feeling the air heavy with portents,"
the more clerkly considering of Armageddon and the Last Fight.
Briefly--for thirteen years the Emperor and the Papists had hustled
"and harried the Protestants; had dragooned Donauwörth, and held down"
"Bohemia, and plundered the Palatinate, and crushed the King of"
"Denmark, and wherever there was a weak Protestant state had pressed"
sorely on it. Then one short year before I stood on the Burg above the
"Pegnitz, the Protestant king had come out of the North like a"
"thunderbolt, had shattered in a month the Papist armies, had run like"
"a devouring fire down the Priests' Lane, rushed over Bohemia, shaken"
the Emperor on his throne!
But could he maintain himself? That was now to be seen. To the
"Emperor's help had come all who loved the old system, and would have"
it that the south was Germany; all who wished to chain men's minds and
saw their profit in the shadow of the imperial throne; all who lived
"by license and plunder, and reckoned a mass to-day against a murder"
"to-morrow. All these had come, from the great Duke of Friedland"
"grasping at empire, to the meanest freebooter with peasant's blood on"
"his hands and in his veins; and there they lay opposite us,"
"impregnably placed on the Burgstall, waiting patiently until famine"
"and the sword should weaken the fair city, and enable them to plunge"
their vulture's talons into its vitals.
No wonder that in Nuremberg the citizens could be distinguished from
remembered then that before going out to look for rooms she had
transferred half the notes from their hiding-place to an inner
pocket. They were still there. But what about her luggage and her
"mother's, and the remainder of the money? In her distress she wrote"
to Gräfin von Stachelberg. Minna came over from her hospital at half
past six in the evening. By that time the doctor had given the
"necessary certificate of the cause of death, and an undertaker had"
come on the scene to make his preparations.
Minna went over to the Hotel Impérial with Vivie. Appearing in her
"Red Cross uniform, she was admitted, announced herself as the Gräfin"
"von Stachelberg, and demanded to know what justification the manager"
could offer for his extraordinary brutality towards these English
"ladies, the result of which had been the death of the elder lady."
The manager replied that inasmuch as the All Highest himself was to
"arrive that very evening to take up his abode at the Hotel Impérial,"
"the hotel premises had been requisitioned, etc., etc. He still"
refused absolutely to allow Vivie to proceed to her room and look
for her money. She might perhaps be allowed to do so when the
Emperor was gone. As to her luggage he would have it sent over to
"the tea-shop. (The money, it might be noted, she never recovered."
There were many things also missing from her mother's trunks and no
satisfaction was ever obtained.)
"So there was Vivie, one dismal, rainy November evening in 1915;"
"homeless, her mother lying dead in a room of this tea-shop, and in"
her own pocket only a matter of thirty thousand francs to provide
for her till the War was over. A thousand pounds in fluctuating
value was all that was left of a nominal twenty thousand of the year
before.
But the financial aspect of the case for the time being did not
"were hundreds of pounds owing, it seemed, and, in addition, much to Rosek"
himself.  The thought of these debts weighed unbearably on her.  Why did
"he, HOW did he get into debt like this?  What became of the money he"
"earned?  His fees, this summer, were good enough.  There was such a"
"feeling of degradation about debt.  It was, somehow, so underbred to owe"
"money to all sorts of people.  Was it on that girl, on other women, that"
he spent it all?  Or was it simply that his nature had holes in every
pocket?
"Watching Fiorsen closely, that spring and early summer, she was conscious"
"of a change, a sort of loosening, something in him had given way--as"
"when, in winding a watch, the key turns on and on, the ratchet being"
broken.  Yet he was certainly working hard--perhaps harder than ever.
"She would hear him, across the garden, going over and over a passage, as"
if he never would be satisfied. But his playing seemed to her to have
"lost its fire and sweep; to be stale, and as if disillusioned.  It was"
"all as though he had said to himself: ""What's the use?""  In his face,"
"too, there was a change.  She knew--she was certain that he was drinking"
secretly. Was it his failure with her?  Was it the girl?  Was it simply
heredity from a hard-drinking ancestry?
Gyp never faced these questions.  To face them would mean useless
"discussion, useless admission that she could not love him, useless"
"asseveration from him about the girl, which she would not believe,"
useless denials of all sorts.  Hopeless!
"He was very irritable, and seemed especially to resent her music lessons,"
alluding to them with a sort of sneering impatience.  She felt that he
"despised them as amateurish, and secretly resented it. He was often"
"impatient, too, of the time she gave to the baby.  His own conduct with"
the little creature was like all the rest of him. He would go to the
"nursery, much to Betty's alarm, and take up the baby; be charming with it"
"""Why? How can I tell? You said it was to make sure that the shore"
"party were all off the ship."""
"""I said! What does it matter what I say! What I do matters a heap, but"
what I say--pouf! I sent Trehayne to the _Antigone_ to test him. I
"sent him expecting that he would try to cut her wires, and he did."
"Then when I was sure, though I had no evidence for a law court, I sent"
"him to the _Malplaquet_, and I set my trap there for him to walk into."
How did I guess? I don't guess; I watch. The more valuable a man is to
"me, the more I watch him, for he might be even more valuable to"
"somebody else. Trehayne was an excellent man, but he had not been with"
me a month before I was watching him as closely as any cat. I hadn't
been a Marine and served ashore and afloat without knowing a born
"gentleman when I see one, and knowing, too, the naval stamp. Trehayne"
was too much of a gentleman to have become a workman in the _Vernon_
and at Greenock without some very good reason. He said that he was an
"orphan--yes; he said his parents left him penniless, and he had to"
"earn his living the best way he could--yes. Quite good reasons, but"
"they didn't convince me. I was certain sure that somewhere, some time,"
Trehayne had been a naval officer. I had seen too many during my
service to make any mistake about that. So when I stood there waiting
"in that damned cold corner behind that bulkhead, it was for Trehayne"
that I was waiting. I meant to take him or to kill him. When he killed
"himself, I was glad. As I watched his eyes fade out, it was as if my"
own son was dying on his feet in front of me. But it was better so
"than to die in front of a firing party. For I--I loved him, and I"
"wished him 'Good-bye,'"""
"Dawson pitched his cigar into the fire, got up, and walked away to the"
far side of the room. I had never till that moment completely
"reverenced the penetrative, infallible judgment of Little Jane."
will trade them with the Sinaketans. Thus the hosts from the Kula
community act as intermediaries in any trading relations between the
Sinaketans and the inhabitants of more remote districts.
"To sum up the sociology of these transactions, we may say that"
the visitor enters into a threefold relation with the Dobuan
"natives. First, there is his partner, with whom he exchanges general"
"gifts on the basis of free give and take, a type of transaction,"
running side by side with the Kula proper. Then there is the local
"resident, not his personal Kula partner, with whom he carries on"
gimwali. Finally there is the stranger with whom an indirect exchange
is carried on through the intermediation of the local men. With
"all this, it must not be imagined that the commercial aspect of"
the gathering is at all conspicuous. The concourse of the natives
"is great, mainly owing to their curiosity, to see the ceremonial"
reception of the uvalaku party. But if I say that every visitor from
"Boyowa, brings and carries away about half-a-dozen articles, I do"
not under-state the case. Some of these articles the Sinaketan has
acquired in the industrial districts of Boyowa during his preliminary
"trading expedition (see Chapter VI, Division III). On these he scores"
a definite gain. A few samples of the prices paid in Boyowa and those
received in Dobu will indicate the amount of this gain.

"no way out and therefore preferred to make himself blind, which gave him"
an excuse for not seeing. Seven of our permanent guests now left together:
"the telephone operators, Tradesman Batt, Schoolmistresses Johnsen and"
"Palm, and two men who were in some sort of business, I don't quite know"
what. This whole party went across the fjeld to Stordalen to be driven
about in cars.
Cases of various kinds of foodstuffs arrived for Paul; they were carried
up one evening by a man from the village. He had to make several journeys
"with the side of his cart let down, and bring the cases over the roughest"
spots one by one. That was the kind of road it was. Josephine received the
"consignment, and noticed that one of the cases gave forth the sound of a"
"liquid splashing inside. That had come to the wrong place, she said, and"
"writing another address on it, she told the man to take it back. It was"
"sirup that had come too late, she said; she had got sirup elsewhere in the"
meantime.
Later in the evening we heard them discussing it in the kitchen; the sirup
"had not come too late, Paul said angrily."
"""And I've told you to clear these newspapers away!"" he cried. We heard the"
sound of paper and glass being swept to the floor.
"Well, things were not too easy for Paul; the days went by dull and empty,"
nor had he any children to give him pleasant thoughts at times. Though he
"wanted to build still more houses, he could not use half those he had"
already. There was Mrs. Brede living alone with her children in one of
"them, and since seven of the guests had left, Miss Torsen was also alone"
in the south wing. Paul wanted at all costs to build roads and share in
the development of the tourist traffic; he even wanted to run a fleet of
motor cars. But since he had not the power to do this alone and could get
"no assistance, nothing was left him but to resign himself. And now to make"
"all the debate was important, and the hour of the division drew near;"
"and when the question was put and the bell rang, nearly half the House"
"trooped out with virtuous air to join the other half, persistently"
"gossiping in the lobby, and, with them, decide the fateful question."
One more strange thing was to happen at that sitting.
"It was not strange that the Government were beaten by three votes, that"
"only one of those wavering men voted with his old party at last, but it"
"was strange that when this result was announced, and Medland's followers"
settled sturdily in their seats to endure the celebration of the
"triumph, the celebration did not come. There was hardly a cheer, and"
"Medland himself, whom the result seemed hardly to have roused, woke with"
a start to the unwonted silence. It struck to his heart: it seemed like
a tribute of respect to a dead enemy. But he rose and briefly said that
on the next day an announcement of the Government's intentions would be
made by himself--he paused here a moment--or one of his colleagues. He
"sat down again. The sitting was at an end, and the House adjourned."
"Members began to go out, but, as the Premier rose, they drew back and"
"left a path for him down the middle of the House. As he went, one or two"
"thrust out their hands to him, and one honest fellow shouted in his"
"rough voice--he was a labouring-man member--""You're not done yet,"
"Jimmy!"""
"The shout touched him, he lifted his head, looked round with a smile,"
"and, just raising again the hat he had put on as he neared the door,"
took Norburn's arm and passed out of the House.
"When Sir Robert followed, he found the Chief Justice waiting for him,"
"and they walked off together. For a long while neither spoke, but at"
"last Sir Robert said peevishly,"
"Provincial Service, and they obtained fairly good men. It would not be"
right for a great Government to grant a minimum pay to Indian Professors
"and an extravagantly high pay to their European colleagues, for doing"
the same kind of work.
"83,669. At the Presidency College the facilities for scientific work"
were now greater than in many institutions in England. India was now
"becoming a great country for Biological research. Again, the Physical"
and Chemical Laboratories at the Presidency College were finer than many
in England. If young men of science in England thought they obtained
better opportunities in pursuing their subjects in New Zealand and
"Toronto than in India, the India office ought to remove that impression"
at once.
"83,670. (Lord Ronaldshay). When an Indian graduate under the witnesses'"
scheme was appointed direct to the higher service in India he would not
compel him to go to England for a period of training. The person who
would be appointed in India directly from the Indian Universities would
have to have previously served with distinction in subordinate
positions; a visit to Europe would be an advantage but not absolutely
necessary.
"83,671. (Mr. Biss). The cost of living in Calcutta to an Indian"
Professor or Lecturer would all depend as the style in which he lived.
In each service there is always a standard of living to which every
member is expected to conform. An Indian Professor had to go to Europe
from time to time to keep himself in touch with the developments of his
subject. An Indian officer had to support a large number of relations.
The question of a man's private expenses should not be raised in fixing
his pay. One might as well inquire whether the candidate for admission
"to the service was a bachelor or married, or as to how many children he"
"had. He had known Europeans who had led a simple life, and had been all"
"written against Luther. He will read him, he will soon take up something"
"to quiet the tumult. He succeeds in getting Aleander, who arrived at"
"Louvain in June, to prohibit preaching against him. The Pope still hopes"
"that Aleander will succeed in bringing back Erasmus, with whom he is"
"again on friendly terms, to the right track."
But Erasmus began to consider the only exit which was now left to him:
to leave Louvain and the Netherlands to regain his menaced independence.
The occasion to depart had long ago presented itself: the third edition
of his New Testament called him to Basle once more. It would not be a
"permanent departure, and he purposed to return to Louvain. On 28 October"
(his birthday) he left the town where he had spent four difficult years.
His chambers in the College of the Lily were reserved for him and he
left his books behind. On 15 November he reached Basle.
Soon the rumour spread that out of fear of Aleander he had saved himself
"by flight. But the idea, revived again in our days in spite of Erasmus's"
"own painstaking denial, that Aleander should have cunningly and"
"expressly driven him from the Netherlands, is inherently improbable. So"
"far as the Church was concerned, Erasmus would at almost any point be"
"more dangerous than at Louvain, in the headquarters of conservatism,"
"under immediate control of the strict Burgundian government, where, it"
"seemed, he could sooner or later be pressed into the service of the"
anti-Lutheran policy.
"It was this contingency, as Dr. Allen has correctly pointed out, which"
he feared and evaded. Not for his bodily safety did he emigrate; Erasmus
would not have been touched--he was far too valuable an asset for such
"measures. It was his mental independence, so dear to him above all else,"
"that he felt to be threatened; and, to safeguard that, he did not return"
to Louvain.
his feet during the past two days; I don't know what he has
discovered; but if he does not get to the bottom of the business in
"double-quick time we shall have the whole Board of Admiralty, Scotland"
"Yard, and possibly the War Cabinet down upon us. Think, too, of the"
"disgrace to this shipbuilding city of which we are all so proud."""
"""We shall know something soon,"" I said, ""for, if I mistake not, here"
"comes Dawson."" The electric bell at the front door had buzzed, and"
"Cary, slipping from the room, presently returned with a man who to me,"
"at the first glance, was a complete stranger. I sprang up, moved round"
"to a position whence I could see clearly the visitor's ears, and"
"gasped. It was Dawson beyond a doubt, but it was not the Dawson whom I"
had known in the north. So what I had vaguely surmised was
true--Cary's Dawson and Copplestone's Dawson were utterly unlike.
"Dawson winked at me, glanced towards Cary, and shook his head; from"
which I gathered that he did not desire his appearance to be the
"subject of comment. I therefore greeted him without remark, and, as he"
"sat down under the electric lights, examined him in detail. This"
Dawson was ten years older than the man whom I had known and fenced
"with. The hair of this one was lank and grey, while that of mine was"
"brown and curly; the face of this one was white and thin, while the"
face of mine was rather full and ruddy. The teeth were different--I
"found out afterwards that Dawson, who had few teeth of his own,"
possessed several artificial sets of varied patterns--the shape of the
"mouth was different, the nose was different. I could never have"
recognised the man before me had I not possessed that clue to identity
furnished by his unchanging ears.
"""So, Dawson,"" said I slowly, ""we meet again. Permit me to say that I"
"congratulate you. It is very well done."""
"He grinned and glanced at the unconscious Cary. ""You are learning."

Part VI.--OFFENCES.
"outline of the history of the Lake Superior region, the"
"deformations which it suffered, their relative severity, the times"
"when they occurred, and the erosion cycles marked by the"
successive unconformities.
OTHER PRE-CAMBRIAN AREAS IN NORTH AMERICA. Pre-Cambrian rocks are
"exposed in various parts of the continent, usually by the erosion"
of mountain ranges in which their strata were infolded. Large
areas occur in the maritime provinces of Canada. The core of the
"Green Mountains of Vermont is pre-Cambrian, and rocks of these"
systems occur in scattered patches in western Massachusetts. Here
belong also the oldest rocks of the Highlands of the Hudson and of
"New Jersey. The Adirondack region, an outlier of the Laurentian"
"region, exposes pre-Cambrian rocks, which have been metamorphosed"
and tilted by the intrusion of a great boss of igneous rock out of
which the central peaks are carved. The core of the Blue Ridge and
probably much of the Piedmont Belt are of this age. In the Black
Hills the irruption of an immense mass of granite has caused or
accompanied the upheaval of pre-Cambrian strata and metamorphosed
"them by heat and pressure into gneisses, schists, quartzites, and"
slates. In most of these mountainous regions the lowest strata are
"profoundly changed by metamorphism, and they can be assigned to"
the pre-Cambrian only where they are clearly overlain
unconformably by formations proved to be Cambrian by their
"fossils. In the Belt Mountains of Montana, however, the Cambrian"
"is underlain by Algonkian sediments twelve thousand feet thick,"
and but little altered.
MINERAL WEALTH OF THE PRE-CAMBRIAN ROCKS. The pre-Cambrian rocks
"are of very great economic importance, because of their extensive"
metamorphism and the enormous masses of igneous rock which they
involve. In many parts of the country they are the source of
"without me. With bad luck and bad weather, I might have had to wait"
"a few weeks, if not months in Nabwageta. I could perhaps have sailed"
"in a native canoe, but this could only be done without bedding, tent,"
"or even writing outfit and photographic apparatus, and so my travelling"
would have been quite useless. It was a piece of great good luck that
"a day or two afterwards, a motor launch, whose owner had heard about"
"my staying in the Amphletts, anchored in front of Nabwageta village,"
"and within an hour I was speeding towards the Trobriands again,"
following the tracks of the Kula fleet.
II
"On the next morning, as we slowly made our way along the channels"
"in the opalescent, green lagoon, and as I watched a fleet of small,"
"local canoes fishing in their muddy waters, and could recognise on"
"the surrounding flat shores a dozen well-known villages, my spirits"
"rose, and I felt well pleased to have left the picturesque, but"
"ethnographically barren Amphletts for the Trobriands, with their"
scores of excellent informants.
"Moreover, the Amphletts, in the persons of their male inhabitants"
"were soon to join me here. I went ashore in Sinaketa, where everybody"
was full of the great moment which was soon to arrive. For the Dobuan
"fleet was known to be coming, though on that morning, so far, no news"
"had reached them of its whereabouts. As a matter of fact, the Dobuans,"
"who had left Nabwageta forty-eight hours ahead of me, had made a slow"
"journey with light winds, and sailing a course to the East of mine,"
had arrived that morning only in Vakuta.
"she read very stiltedly, with a strange exotic accent for the love"
"passages or the death scenes. As Lady Victoria Freebooter said, she"
would have been _priceless_ at a music-hall matinée which was
"raising funds for war charities, if only she could have been induced"
to read passages from Miss Yonge in _that_ voice for a quarter of an
hour. Even the Queen would have had to laugh.
"But as that could not be brought off, it was decided that working"
parties at her house led to too much giddiness from suppressed
giggles or torpor from too much food. So she relapsed once more into
loneliness. Unfortunately air-raids were now becoming events of
"occasional fright and anxiety in London, and this deterred Cousin"
"Sophie from Darlington, Cousin Matty from Leeds, Joseph's wife from"
"Northallerton or old, married schoolfellows from other northern or"
"midland towns coming to partake of her fastuous hospitality. Also,"
"they all seemed to be busy, either over their absent husbands'"
"business, or their sons', or because they were plunged in war work"
"themselves. ""And really, in these times, I couldn't stand Linda for"
"more than five minutes,"" one of them said."
"As to the air-raids, she was not greatly alarmed at them. Of course"
"it was very uncomfortable having London so dark at night, but then"
"she only went out in the afternoon, and never in the evening. And"
the Germans seemed to be content and discriminating enough not to
"bomb what she called ""the resi_den_tial"" parts of London. The"
nearest to Portland Place of their attentions was Hampstead or
"Bloomsbury. ""We are protected, my dear, by the open spaces of"
"Regent's Park. They wouldn't like to waste their bombs on poor me!"""
However her maid didn't altogether like the off chance of the
Germans or our air-craft guns making a mistake and trespassing on
"the residential parts of London, so she persuaded her mistress to"

It was this syncretic religion that came to Rome after having enjoyed
popularity in the eastern Mediterranean. Sicily and the south of Italy were
"more than half Hellenized, and the Ptolemies had diplomatic relations with"
"these countries, just as the merchants of Alexandria had commercial"
relations with them. For this reason the worship of Isis spread as rapidly
in those regions as on the coasts of Ionia or in the Cyclades.[22] It was
introduced into Syracuse and Catana during the earliest years of the third
"century by {81} Agathocles. The Serapeum of Pozzuoli, at that time the"
"busiest seaport of Campania, was mentioned in a city ordinance of the year"
"105 B. C.[23] About the same time an Iseum was founded at Pompeii, where"
the decorative frescos attest to this day the power of expansion possessed
by the Alexandrian culture.
"After its adoption by the southern part of the Italian peninsula, this"
religion was bound to penetrate rapidly to Rome. Ever since the second
"century before our era, it could not help but find adepts in the chequered"
multitude of slaves and freedmen. Under the Antonines the college of the
_pastophori_ recalled that it had been founded in the time of Sulla.[24] In
vain did the authorities try to check the invasion of the Alexandrian gods.
"Five different times, in 59, 58, 53, and 48 B. C., the senate ordered their"
"altars and statues torn down,[25] but these violent measures did not stop"
the diffusion of the new beliefs. The Egyptian mysteries were the first
example at Rome of an essentially popular religious movement that was
triumphant over the continued resistance of the public authorities and the
official clergy.
Why was this Egyptian worship the only one of all Oriental religions to
"suffer repeated persecutions? There were two motives, one religious and one"
political.
CHAPTER XVII
THE GERMANS IN BRUSSELS: 1915-1916
"In the early spring of 1915, Vivie, anxious not to see her mother in"
"utter penury, and despairing of any effective assistance from the"
Americans (very much prejudiced against her for the reasons already
"mentioned), took her mother's German and Belgian securities of a"
"face value amounting to about £18,000 and sold them at her Belgian"
"bank for a hundred thousand francs (£4,000) in Belgian or German"
"bank notes. She consulted no one, except her mother. Who was there"
to consult? She did not like to confide too much to Colonel von
"Giesselin, a little too prone in any case to ""protect"" them. But as"
"she argued with Mrs. Warren, what else were they to do in their"
"cruel situation? If the Allies were eventually victorious, Mrs."
Warren could return to England. There at least she had in safe
"investments £40,000, ample for the remainder of their lives. If"
"Germany lost the War, the German securities nominally worth two"
hundred thousand marks might become simply waste paper; even now
they were only computed by the bank at a purchase value of about one
fifth what they had stood at before the War. If Germany were
"victorious or agreed to a compromise peace, her mother's shares in"
Belgian companies might be unsaleable. Better to secure now a lump
sum of four thousand pounds in bank notes that would be legal
"currency, at any rate as long as the German occupation lasted. And"
"as one never knew what might happen, it was safer still to have all"
"this money (equivalent to a hundred thousand francs), in their own"
"keeping. They could live even in war time, on such a sum as this"
"for four, perhaps five years, as they would be very economical and"
Vivie would try to earn all she could by teaching. It was useless to
hope they would be able to return to Villa Beau-séjour so long as
"he was, notwithstanding, a rather notable figure as he stood looking"
gravely and thoughtfully downwards; there was something very graceful in
"his attitude, and in the carriage of his head, and his features were so"
remarkably handsome that Lady Romaine turned her eyes upon him many
"times, and exerted all her artifices to draw him back to her immediate"
"neighbourhood.  But he was perfectly unconscious of this, not hearing"
"the chatter which went on about him, lost in some reverie of his own,"
which brought a peculiar dreamy softness into his eyes.
"Lord Sandford, following the direction of Geraldine’s glance, looked at"
"this motionless figure, then back at the girl, and laughed."
"""Lady Geraldine, pray permit me to present to you my newly-made friend"
"and comrade, Sir Grey Dumaresq, who, I doubt not, is dying to make his"
"bow to so fair a lady."""
"She flashed him a glance half merry, half reproachful, and he suddenly"
"laid his hand upon his lips, a laugh rolling from them hearty and full."
"""I’ faith I had forgot!  How shall I teach my rebel tongue a new"
"language?  But Sir Grey will atone for all my defects.—Here is a lady,"
"if you will believe it, O friend, who loves not the sugared and honeyed"
"phrase of adulation, but seeks in all things truth, virtue, and I know"
not what else beside.  It is whispered to me that she is a mistress of
"all the _belles lettres_, and perchance a poetess herself."""
"""Nay, my lord,"" answered Geraldine, with a blush and a smile—""only one"
"who loves the poesy of those who have lived before, and left their"
"treasures for us who come after, and would fain drink in all the beauty"
"of their thoughts and of their lives."""
"Lord Sandford good-naturedly yielded his seat to Grey, whose sensitive"
"the paved floor of the miniature kitchen. Having arrived in which place,"
"her anger completely vanished, for a tankardful of rich warm goat's milk"
"was handed to her by La Giralda, and in this flowing bowl she soon"
forgot her woes.
"""You must come down to the palace and be paid,"" said the little girl;"
"""we are most of us very hungry there, and those who are not hungry are"
"thirsty. The waggons from Madrid have been stopped on the way, and all"
"the guards have gone to bring them back!"""
At this Doña Susana looked quickly across to the old goatherdess and
signalled that the little Princess was not to be informed of anything
she might happen to know.
"""You have not been in the town, I trust!"" said Doña Susana."
Now La Giralda could conscientiously have declared that she had never
"been within the gates of San Ildefonso in her life, but thinking that in"
"the circumstances the statement might appear a suspicious one, she"
modified it to a solemn declaration that she had come directly down from
"her farm on the mountain-side, as, indeed, they themselves had seen."
"Satisfied of her veracity, Doña Susana took her very independent and"
difficult charge by the hand and led the way towards the palace of La
"Granja, glimpses of which could be obtained through the foliage which"
was still everywhere verdant and abundant with the first freshness of
"spring--so high did the castle lie on the hill-slopes, and so enlivening"
"were the waste waters downthrown from the rocky crests of Peñalara,"
"whose snows glimmered through the trees, as it seemed, but a bowshot"
above their heads.
"The goats, each expecting their turn of milking, followed at her heels"
"such-and-such solicitors, and to Lewis Maitland Praed A.R.A. in Hans"
Place.
She went to the Brussels bank a fortnight after her mother's death
whilst still availing herself of the hospitality of Madame
Trouessart: to withdraw the jewellery and plate which she had
deposited there on her mother's account. But there she found herself
"confronted with the red tape of the Latin which is more formidable,"
"even, than that of the land of Dora at the present day. These"
deposited articles were held on the order of Mrs. Warren; they could
not be given up till her will was proved and letters of
administration had been granted. So _that_ small resource in funds
"was withheld, at any rate till some time after peace had been"
declared. However she had a thousand pounds (in notes) between her
"and penury, and the friendship of Minna von Stachelberg. She would"
resume her evening lessons in English--Madame Trouessart had found
her several pupils--and she would lodge--as they kindly invited her
to do--with the Baptist pastor and his wife in the Rue Haute. And
"she would help Minna at the hospital, and hope to be rewarded with"
the opportunity of bringing comfort and consolation to the wounded
British prisoners.
"Thus, with no unbearable misery, she passed the year 1916. There"
"were short commons in the way of food, and the cold was sometimes"
cruel. But Madame Walcker was a wonderful cook and could make soup
"from a sausage skewer, and heaped _édredons_ on Vivie's bed. Vivie"
sighed a little over the Blue Placards which announced endless
German victories by land and sea; and she gasped over the dreadful
Red Placards with their lists of victims sentenced to death by the
military courts. She ground her teeth over the announcement of
"Gabrielle Petit's condemnation, and behind the shut door of Minna's"
small sitting-room--and she only shut the door not to compromise
The Pope is the torch of war.
Christ was meekness:
The Pope is pride personified.
Christ promulgated the laws that the Pope tramples under foot.
[Sidenote: What the Italians now Think about it.]
"""But,"" some one may say, ""the pasquinades were written long ago, and,"
"while they are doubtless true descriptions of the papacy of the past,"
"surely no one would take the same view now."" For answer I may quote"
"the statement of Dr. Raffaelle Mariano, Professor of Philosophy in the"
"University of Naples, who is not a Protestant, but, as he tells us, was"
"""born in the Roman Catholic Church,"" and was ""a fervent Catholic from"
"infancy."" Speaking of the vast difference which he found between the"
teachings of the church and those of the New Testament as to what is
"necessary to salvation, he says, ""Therefore, Roman Catholicism is not"
"only not Christianity, but it is the very antithesis of Christianity,"""
a statement every whit as strong as Pasquino's. Some American
"Protestants, especially those who have personal friends in the Roman"
Catholic Church whom they honor and love--and there are many people in
"that church who are richly worthy of honor and love, and who do not"
approve of the evils we have been describing any more than we do--are
sometimes disposed to think that Protestant writers are too severe in
"their condemnation of the Romish Church as a system. A visit to Italy,"
"the centre of Romanism, would quickly disabuse these overcharitable"
Protestants of that impression. We have all read of such things as
"are described above in connection with the relics and legends, but"
"they seem far away and unreal, and almost impossible, until we come"
to the home of Romanism and find them all around us. Then it ceases
to surprise us that so large a proportion of the most intelligent men
"rocks more than a mile in total thickness, which accumulated"
during the long ages of those periods in a gradually subsiding
trough between the Adirondacks and a pre-Cambrian range lying west
of the Connecticut River. But since their deposition these ancient
"sediments have been crumpled and crushed, broken with great"
"faults, and extensively metamorphosed. The limestones have"
"recrystallized into marbles, among them the famous marbles of"
"Vermont; the Cambrian sandstones have become quartzites, and the"
Hudson shale has been changed to a schist exposed on Manhattan
Island and northward.
"In part these changes occurred at the close of the Ordovician, for"
in several places beds of Silurian age rest unconformably on the
upturned Ordovician strata; but recent investigations have made it
"probable that the crustal movements recurred at later times, and"
it was perhaps in the Devonian and at the close of the
Carboniferous that the greater part of the deformation and
"metamorphism was accomplished. As a result of these movements,--"
"perhaps several times repeated,--a great mountain range was"
"upridged, which has been long since leveled by erosion, but whose"
roots are now visible in the Taconic Mountains of western New
England.
"THE CINCINNATI ANTICLINE. Over an oval area in Ohio, Indiana, and"
"Kentucky, whose longer axis extends from north to south through"
"Cincinnati, the Ordovician strata rise in a very low, broad swell,"
called the Cincinnati anticline. The Silurian and Devonian strata
thin out as they approach this area and seem never to have
"deposited upon it. We may regard it, therefore, as an island"
upwarped from the sea at the close of the Ordovician or shortly
after.
"dipped in a lock of his hair, and it came out like pure gold, and fairly"
shimmered.
"Then the king's son said: ""Better and better! But if he cooks gold here,"
"I wonder what he cooks inside, there?"" And he wanted to see, so he went"
into the fourth room. Here there was no kettle to be seen; but a maiden
sat on a bench who must have been a king's daughter; yet whatever she
"might be, the king's son had never seen any one so beautiful in all his"
"days. ""Now in heaven's name, what are you doing here?"" asked the maiden."
"""I hired myself out here yesterday,"" said the king's son. ""May God be"
"your aid, for it is a fine service you have chosen!"" said she. ""O, the"
"master is very friendly,"" said the king's son. ""He has given me no hard"
"work to do to-day. When I have cleaned out the stable, I need do nothing"
"more."" ""Yes, but how are you going to manage it?"" she went on. ""If you"
"do as the others have done, then for every shovelful you pitch out, ten"
fresh shovelfuls will fly in. But I'll tell you how to go about it. You
"must turn around the shovel, and work with the handle, then everything"
"will fly out by itself."""
"This he would do, said the king's son; and he sat there with her all day"
"long, for they had soon agreed that they would marry, he and the king's"
"daughter, and in this way his first day in the giant's service did not"
"weary him at all. When evening came on, she told him that now he must"
"clean out the stable before the giant came, and when he got there he"
"thought he would try out her advice, and began to use the shovel as he"
"had seen his father's grooms use it. And sure enough, he had to stop"
"quickly, for after he had worked a little while, he hardly had room in"
"which to stand. Then he did as the king's daughter had told him, turned"
the shovel around and used the handle. And in a wink the stable was as
clean as though it had been scrubbed. When he had finished he went
"to the room that the giant had assigned him, and walked up and down,"
"whistling and singing. Then the giant came home with his goats. ""Have"
not to be shaken. It may be well imagined that the feeding of my
chauffeur during the months to come loomed up as one of my minor
anxieties.
"From Pindi I went to Quetta by train, my car, with the native"
"chauffeur having gone direct to the then rail-head at Nushki, in the"
North of Indo-Baluchistan.
"At Quetta I laid in a store of petrol, spare tyres, a few personal"
"necessities, reported to General Grover for orders and information,"
"and then proceeded to Nushki; which place was reached, and the car"
"picked up, on, if I remember rightly, the 25th of February."
This day in Nushki was to prove the last in a civilised town for
many months to come. The look of the country lying before us so
"intimidated my native chauffeur that he came to me, a short time"
"before we were due to start, with a countenance torn with grief and,"
"with lamentations and protestations of sorrow, told me that both his"
"father and mother were ill, and that it was vital for him to return"
and succour them. As I had been in two minds as to the advisability
"of taking the rascal with me, this sign of the white feather at the"
"very outset at once decided the point, and I gave him to understand"
that he could go and bury as many of his relations as he pleased.
With a countenance swiftly transformed to cheerfulness he left me.
Just before starting a wire was handed in from a high political
official at Quetta informing me that the Baluch Raiders had already
"cut our lines of communication, were right across my path, and he"
"advised, if not ordered, me not to proceed."
"However, as explicit military instructions were to endeavour to reach"
"Robat (near the Koh-i-Maliksia), a hill at which the Baluch, Afghan"
"I knew then, if never before, that there could be no happiness in this"
world for her away from him. Whether she would find it with him was
"impossible for me to know, but I saw that she was in the grip of a mighty"
"passion, and I could only hope that a way would open to save her."
Hamilton's fortunes would need to mend a great deal before he could
"or would ask her to be his wife, for now he was at the bottom of the"
ladder. He lost no opportunity to impress this disagreeable truth upon
"her, but his honest efforts to hold himself aloof only increased her"
respect and love for him. It not only convinced her that notwithstanding
"his past life, he was a man of honor capable of resisting himself and of"
"protecting her, but it gave him the quality so irresistible to a"
woman--unattainability.
"Taking it all in all, my poor beautiful cousin was falling day by"
day deeper into an abyss of love from which she could in no way
"extricate herself. In short, level-headed Frances had got far out"
"of plumb, and, though she struggled desperately, she could not right"
"herself, nor could any one help her. I fully realized that the small"
amount of self-restraint and passivity she still retained would give
way to disastrous activity when the time should come for her to part
with George and lose him forever. But I could see no way to save her
"unless I could induce George to leave England at once, for good and"
all.
"At times the fates seem to fly to a man's help, and in this instance they"
"came to me most graciously that same day in Whitehall, in the person of"
my friend the Count de Grammont.
"Soon after leaving Frances in the maids' apartments, I met that most"
"interesting gentleman roué, his Grace de Grammont, coming from the king's"
"closet. As already stated, he had been banished from the French court by"
Franciscan monks were awakened by the most furious ringing of bells
"and by thundering knocks at the west door of the church, and hastening"
"thither, could see nothing but a wee naked pink foot peeping in from"
"under the door; but when they opened the door, without stood the little"
"naked figure of the true Bambino of Ara Coeli, shivering in the wind"
"and rain--so the false baby was sent back in disgrace, and the real"
"baby restored to its home, never to be trusted away alone any more."""
[Sidenote: The Communion Table Used by Christ.]
But if I dwell on all these interesting relics and images as I have
"done on the Holy Cradle and the miraculous Bambino, I shall never"
finish even the brief list of them which I had in mind when I began. I
"must hasten on, contenting myself with a bare mention of a few of the"
more notable relics at the other churches.
On the 8th of January we paid our first visit to the great Church of
"St. John Lateran,[9] and here also the relics interested us more than"
anything else. Under the canopy in the centre the skulls of St. Peter
and St. Paul are preserved. Beneath the altar we saw the wooden table
"on which the Apostle Peter is said to have ""celebrated mass"" in the"
"house of Pudens. The interest of this relic, however, is completely"
eclipsed by that of another relic over an altar at a little distance
"in the same church, viz: the cedar table used by our Lord and his"
disciples in the Last Supper. This table is concealed behind a bronze
relief representing that solemn scene in the Upper Room at Jerusalem.
[Sidenote: Other Relics at St. John Lateran.]
"""The Basilica claims to possess many valuable relics. Amongst these are"
"some portions of the manger in which Christ was cradled, the shirt and"
seamless coat made for him by the Virgin; some of the barley loaves
"there is a transposition of ""second"" and ""third"" groups, which the"
"context corrects.) Motley, an inveterate Celtophobe, is at pains to make"
"out that the Walloons rebelled first and were first reconciled to Rome,"
"""exactly like their Celtic ancestors, fifteen centuries earlier."" He"
omits to comment on the fact that it was only the French form of
"Protestantism, that of Calvin, that became viable in the Netherlands at"
"all, or on the fact that indecent Anabaptism flourished mainly in"
Friesland; though he admits that the Lutheran movement left all
"religious rights in the hands of the princes, the people having to"
"follow the creed of their rulers. The ""racial"" explanation is mere"
"obscurantism, here as always. The Walloons of South Flanders were first"
affected simply because they were first in touch with Huguenotism. That
they were never converted in large numbers to Protestantism is later
"admitted by Motley himself (p. 797), who thereupon speaks of the"
"""intense attachment to the Roman ceremonial which distinguished the"
"Walloon population."" Thus his earlier statement that they had rebelled"
"against ""papal Rome"" is admittedly false. They had rebelled simply"
against the Spanish tyranny. Yet the false statement is left
standing--one more illustration of the havoc that may be worked in a
"historian's intelligence by a prejudice. (For other instances see, in"
"the author's volume _The Saxon and the Celt_, the chapters dealing with"
Mommsen and Burton.)
It was the Teutonic-speaking city populations of North Flanders and
Brabant who became Protestants in mass after the troubles had begun
"(Motley, p. 798). When the Walloon provinces withdrew from the"
"combination against Spain, the cities of Ghent, Antwerp, Bruges, and"
Ypres joined the Dutch Union of Utrecht. They were one and all reduced
"by the skill and power of Alexander of Parma, who thereupon abolished"
the freedom of Protestant worship. The Protestants fled in thousands to
"England and the Dutch provinces, the remaining population, albeit mostly"
"Teutonic, becoming Catholic. At this moment one-and-a-half of the"
trees.  Her mind was a whirl of impressions--Daphne Wing's figure against
"the door, Mr. Wagge's puggy grey-bearded countenance, the red"
"pampas-grass, the blue bowl, Rosek's face swooping at her, her last"
glimpse of her baby asleep under the trees!
"She reached Kensington Gardens, turned into that walk renowned for the"
"beauty of its flowers and the plainness of the people who frequent it,"
"and sat down on a bench.  It was near the luncheon-hour; nursemaids,"
"dogs, perambulators, old gentlemen--all were hurrying a little toward"
their food.  They glanced with critical surprise at this pretty young
"woman, leisured and lonely at such an hour, trying to find out what was"
"wrong with her, as one naturally does with beauty--bow legs or something,"
"for sure, to balance a face like that!  But Gyp noticed none of them,"
except now and again a dog which sniffed her knees in passing.  For
"months she had resolutely cultivated insensibility, resolutely refused to"
"face reality; the barrier was forced now, and the flood had swept her"
"away.  ""Proceedings!"" Mr. Wagge had said.  To those who shrink from"
"letting their secret affairs be known even by their nearest friends, the"
"notion of a public exhibition of troubles simply never comes, and it had"
certainly never come to Gyp.  With a bitter smile she thought: 'I'm
"better off than she is, after all!  Suppose I loved him, too?  No, I"
never--never--want to love.  Women who love suffer too much.'
She sat on that bench a long time before it came into her mind that she
was due at Monsieur Harmost's for a music lesson at three o'clock.  It
was well past two already; and she set out across the grass.  The summer
"day was full of murmurings of bees and flies, cooings of blissful"
"pigeons, the soft swish and stir of leaves, and the scent of lime blossom"
"under a sky so blue, with few white clouds slow, and calm, and full.  Why"
"be unhappy?  And one of those spotty spaniel dogs, that have broad heads,"
"with frizzy topknots, and are always rascals, smelt at her frock and"
"moved round and round her, hoping that she would throw her sunshade on"
"itself it lies under a spell. It is slow and dark, and has a surface"
"like a mirror, and it flows uphill. There is no doubt about it; anyone"
"can see it. When they came here, my friend tells me, they made a halt,"
and the Burmese hunters with him unpacked his breakfast. He did not want
"to eat then, he said, but they explained that it was not for him, but"
"for the Nats. All his food was unpacked, cold chicken and tinned meats,"
"and jam and eggs and bread, and it was spread neatly on a cloth under a"
tree. Then the hunters called upon the Nats to come and take anything
"they desired, while my friend wondered what he should do if the Nats"
"took all his food and left him with nothing. But no Nats came, although"
"the Burmans called again and again. So they packed up the food, saying"
"that now the Nats would be pleased at the courtesy shown to them, and"
"that my friend would have good sport. Presently they went on, leaving,"
"however, an egg or two and a little salt, in case the Nats might be"
"hungry later, and true enough it was that they did have good luck. At"
"other times, my friend says, when he did not observe this ceremony, he"
"saw nothing to shoot at all, but on this day he did well."
The former history of all Nats is not known. Whether they have had a
"previous existence in another form, and if so, what, is a secret that"
"they usually keep carefully to themselves, but the history of the Popa"
Nats is well known. Everyone who lives near the great hill can tell you
"that, for it all happened not so long ago. How long exactly no one can"
"say, but not so long that the details of the story have become at all"
clouded by the mists of time.
"They were brother and sister, these Popa Nats, and they had lived away"
"up North. The brother was a blacksmith, and he was a very strong man. He"
was the strongest man in all the country; the blow of his hammer on the
"anvil made the earth tremble, and his forge was as the mouth of hell. No"
one was so much feared and so much sought after as he. And as he was
"strong, so his sister was beautiful beyond all the maidens of the time."
carefully and tenderly about her.
Concha raised her eyes once to his as he fastened its chain-catch
"beneath her chin, and Rollo, though the starlight dimmed the brilliance"
"of the glance, felt more than repaid. In the background Etienne smiled"
bitterly. The damsel of the green lattice being now left far behind at
"Sarria, he would have had no scruples about returning to his allegiance"
to Concha. But the chill indifference with which his advances were
"received, joined to something softer and more appealing in her eyes when"
"she looked at Rollo, warned the much-experienced youth that he had"
better for the future confine his gallantries to the most common and
ordinary offices of courtesy.
"Yet it was certainly a restraint upon the young Frenchman, who, almost"
"from the day he had been rid of his Jesuit tutor, had made it a maxim to"
make love to the prettiest girl of any company in which he happened to
find himself.
"When, therefore, he found himself reduced to a choice between an"
"inaccessible Concha and La Giralda, riding astride in her leathern"
"leg-gear and sack-like smock, the youth bethought himself of his"
"religious duties which he had latterly somewhat neglected; and, being"
debarred from earthly love by Concha's insensibility and La Giralda's
"ineligibility, it did not cost him a great effort to become for the"
nonce the same Brother Hilario who had left the monastery of Montblanch.
"So, much to the astonishment of John Mortimer, who moved a little"
"farther from him, as being a kind of second cousin of the scarlet woman"
"of the Seven Hills, Etienne pulled out his rosary and, falling on his"
"knees, betook him to his prayers with vigour and a single mind."
Sergeant Cardono had long ago abandoned all distinctive marks of his
"from Genoa, in 1846, Dickens says, ""If I were a Swiss, with a hundred"
"thousand pounds, I would be as steady against the Catholic canons and"
the propagation of Jesuitism as any Radical among them; believing the
dissemination of Catholicity to be the most horrible means of political
"and social degradation left in the world."""
"In connection with Dickens' remark about Ireland, we may quote the"
"remarkable statement of Mr. Michael McCarthy, himself a Roman Catholic,"
"in his book, _Five Years in Ireland_, pp. 65 and 66, where, after"
describing the welcome of the Belfast Corporation to Lord Cadogan on
"his first visit, in 1895, to the Protestant North of Ireland, and"
their glowing statements about the peaceful and prosperous condition
"of their city and district, he contrasts this happy condition with"
"the unhappy state of the ""rest of Ireland,"" meaning by that the"
"Roman Catholic parts. ""In the rest of Ireland there is no social or"
industrial progress to record. The man who would say of it that it
"was 'progressing and prospering,' or that 'its work people were fully"
"employed,' or that there existed 'a continued development of its"
"industries,' or that its towns 'had increased in value and population,'"
would be set down as a madman. It is in this seven-eighths of Ireland
that the growing and great organization of the Catholic Church has
"taken root."""
"Mr. Gladstone, in an article on ""Italy and her Church,"" in the _Church"
"Quarterly Review_ for October, 1875, says: ""Profligacy, corruption and"
"ambition, continued for ages, unitedly and severally, their destructive"
"work upon the country, through the Curia and the papal chair; and in"
doing it they of course have heavily tainted the faith of which that
"chair was the guardian."" Elsewhere he says, ""There has never been any"
"more cunning blade devised against the freedom, the virtue and the"
"happiness of a people than Romanism."""
Anglicans alike. Your Heaven will be a small place. From Southampton I
went to the torpedo training-ship _Vernon_. Again I had no difficulty.
I was a workman of skill and intelligence. I was there for more than
"two years, learning all your secrets, and storing them in my mind for"
the benefit of my own Service at home.
It was at Portsmouth that there came to me the great temptation of my
"life, for I fell in love, not as you colder people do, but as a"
"Latin of the warm South. She was an English girl of good, if"
"undistinguished, family. Though in my hours of duty I belonged to that"
"you call the 'working classes,' I was well off, and lived in private"
"the life of my own class. I had double the pay of my rank, an"
"allowance from my father, and my wages, which were not small. There"
were many English families in Portsmouth and Southsea who were
"graciously pleased to recognise that John Trehayne, trade unionist,"
"and weekly wage-earning workman, was a gentleman by birth and"
breeding. In any foreign port I should have been under police
supervision as a person eminently to be suspected; in Portsmouth I was
accepted without question for what I gave myself out to be--a
gentleman who wished to learn his business from the bottom upwards. I
will say nothing of the lady of my heart except that I loved her
"passionately, and should have married her--aye, and become an"
"Englishman in fact, casting off my own, country--if War had not blown"
"my ignoble plans to shatters. There was nothing ignoble in my love,"
"for she was a queen among women, but in myself for permitting the hot"
blood of youth to blind my eyes to the duty claimed of me by my
"country. When war became imminent, I was not recalled, as I had hoped"
"to be, since I wished to fight afloat as became my rank and family. I"
was ordered to take such steps as most effectively aided me to observe
"the English plans and preparations, and to report when possible to"
"Vienna. In other words, I was ordered to act in your midst as a"
special intelligence officer--what you would call a Spy. It was an
"When Winton had left him, an hour and a half later that afternoon,"
"Fiorsen continued to stand at the front door, swaying his body to and"
fro.  The brandy-nurtured burst of jealousy which had made him insult his
wife and old Monsieur Harmost had died suddenly when Gyp turned on him in
"the street and spoke in that icy voice; since then he had felt fear,"
increasing every minute.  Would she forgive?  To one who always acted on
"the impulse of the moment, so that he rarely knew afterward exactly what"
"he had done, or whom hurt, Gyp's self-control had ever been mysterious"
and a little frightening. Where had she gone?  Why did she not come in?
"Anxiety is like a ball that rolls down-hill, gathering momentum.  Suppose"
she did not come back!  But she must--there was the baby--their baby!
"For the first time, the thought of it gave him unalloyed satisfaction."
"He left the door, and, after drinking a glass to steady him, flung"
"himself down on the sofa in the drawing-room. And while he lay there, the"
"brandy warm within him, he thought: 'I will turn over a new leaf; give up"
"drink, give up everything, send the baby into the country, take Gyp to"
"Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Rome--anywhere out of this England, anywhere, away"
"from that father of hers and all these stiff, dull folk!  She will like"
"that--she loves travelling!'  Yes, they would be happy!  Delicious"
nights--delicious days--air that did not weigh you down and make you feel
that you must drink--real inspiration--real music!  The acrid wood-smoke
"scent of Paris streets, the glistening cleanness of the Thiergarten, a"
"serenading song in a Florence back street, fireflies in the summer dusk"
at Sorrento--he had intoxicating memories of them all!  Slowly the warmth
"of the brandy died away, and, despite the heat, he felt chill and"
"shuddery.  He shut his eyes, thinking to sleep till she came in.  But"
"very soon he opened them, because--a thing usual with him of late--he saw"
"such ugly things--faces, vivid, changing as he looked, growing ugly and"
"uglier, becoming all holes--holes--horrible holes--Corruption--matted,"
"twisted, dark human-tree-roots of faces!  Horrible!  He opened his eyes,"
"for when he did that, they always went.  It was very silent.  No sound"
CHAPTER XXX.
ROMAN CATHOLIC RELICS AT ROME.
"We reached Rome at a good time for seeing relics, as the special"
services of the Christmas season were just beginning. One of the most
splendid of these ceremonies is the procession in honor of the _Santa
"Culla_; that is, the cradle in which the priestly tradition says the"
infant Jesus was carried into Egypt. This is the great relic and chief
"distinction of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, though it contains"
"a number of others, such as the bodies of St. Matthew and St. Jerome,"
"and two little bags of the brains of Thomas á Becket, and ""one of the"
pictures attributed to St. Luke (and announced to be such in a papal
"bull attached to the walls!), much revered for the belief that it"
stayed the plague which decimated the city during the reign of Pelagius
"II., and that (after its intercession had been sought by a procession"
by order of Innocent VIII.) it brought about the overthrow of the
"Moorish dominion in Spain."""
[Sidenote: The Miraculous Snow in Summertime.]
"Moreover, this church of Santa Maria Maggiore is by no means lacking"
"in legendary and architectural interest. It was founded A. D. 352, by"
"Pope Liberius and John, a Roman patrician, to commemorate an alleged"
"miraculous fall of snow, which covered this spot of ground and no"
"other, on the 5th of August, and an alleged appearance of the Virgin"
"Mary, in a vision, at the same time, showing them that she had thus"
"appropriated the site of a new temple, all of which is duly represented"
"in a fine painting on the wall of the church, and in two of Murillo's"
"most beautiful pictures in the Academy at Madrid, and commemorated"
"every year on the 5th of August by a solemn high mass, and by showers"
"philosophy on the one hand, or to propound theories startling in their"
unorthodoxy on the other. And still we may claim for him a place--and
"an honourable place--amongst the other Famous Scots, for the simple"
reason that after a long century of wearisome reiteration of tiresome
platitudes--platitudes which had lost their original meaning even to
"the utterers of them, and which had become misleading to those who"
heard and thought they understood--Ferrier had the courage to strike
"out new lines for himself, to look abroad for new inspiration, and to"
hand on these inspirations to those who could work them into a truly
national philosophy.
"In Scotland, where, in spite of politics, traditions are honoured to a"
"degree unknown to most other countries, family and family associations"
count for much; and in these James Ferrier was rich. His father was a
"Writer to the Signet, John Ferrier by name, whose sister was the famous"
"Scottish novelist, Susan Ferrier, authoress of _The Inheritance_,"
"_Destiny_, and _Marriage_. Susan Ferrier did for high life in Scotland"
"what Gait achieved for the humbler ranks of society, and attained to"
considerable eminence in the line of fiction which she adopted. Her
"works are still largely read, have recently been republished, and in"
their day were greatly admired by no less an authority than Sir Walter
"Scott, himself a personal friend of the authoress.[1] Ferrier's"
"grandfather, James Ferrier, also a Writer to the Signet, was a man of"
great energy of character. He acted in a business capacity for many
years both to the Duke of Argyle of the time and to various branches of
"the Clan Campbell: it was, indeed, through the influence of the Duke"
that he obtained the appointment which he held of Principal Clerk of
"Session. James Ferrier, like his daughter, was on terms of intimate"
"friendship with Sir Walter Scott, with whom he likewise was a colleague"
"in office. Scott alludes to him in his Journal as 'Uncle Adam,' the"
"name of a character in Miss Ferrier's _Inheritance_, drawn, as she"
"herself acknowledges, from her father. He died in 1829, at which time"
"My arrival was a very untoward event to the natives, and complicated"
"matters, causing great annoyance to Tovasana, the main headman. I had"
"landed in his own little village, Nu'agasi, on the island of Gumasila,"
"for it was impossible to anchor near the big village, nor would there"
"have been room for pitching a tent. Now, in the Amphletts, a white"
"man is an exceedingly rare occurrence, and to my knowledge, only once"
"before, a white trader remained there for a few weeks. To leave me"
"alone with the women and one or two old men was impossible, according"
"to their ideas and fears, and none of the younger men wanted to forgo"
"the privilege and pleasure of taking part in the expedition. At last,"
"I promised them to move to the neighbouring island of Nabwageta,"
"as soon as the men were gone, and with this they were satisfied."
"As the date fixed for the arrival of the Dobuans approached, the"
"excitement grew. Little by little the news arrived, and was eagerly"
"received and conveyed to me: ""Some sixty canoes of the Dobuans are"
"coming,"" ""the fleet is anchored off Tewara,"" ""each canoe is heavily"
"laden with food and gifts,"" ""Kauyaporu sails in his canoe, he is"
"toli'uvalaku, and has a big pandanus streamer attached to the prow."" A"
"string of other names followed which had very little meaning for me,"
since I was not acquainted with the Dobuan natives. From another part
"of the world, from the Trobriands, the goal of the whole expedition,"
"news reached us again: ""To'uluwa, the chief of Kiriwina has gone"
"to Kitava--he will soon come back, bringing plenty of mwali."" ""The"
"Sinaketans are going there to fetch some of the mwali."" ""The Vakutans"
"have been in Kitava and brought back great numbers of mwali."" It"
"was astonishing to hear all this news, arriving at a small island,"
"apparently completely isolated with its tiny population, within"
"these savage and little navigated seas; news only a few days old,"
yet reporting events which had occurred at a travelling distance of
some hundred miles.
"the rapid diminution in the supply of real ivory, should be a growing"
one.
"Indeed, the more one studies Panama and its resources the more one is"
convinced that all that is necessary to make the country a rich and
"prosperous one, or at any rate to cause it to create riches and"
"prosperity for investors, is the application of capital, labor and"
systematic management to the resources it already possesses. In its 400
years of Spanish and mestizo control these three factors have been
"continuously lacking. There are men in Panama, of native birth and of"
"Spanish origin, who have undertaken to develop certain of the land’s"
resources and have moderately enriched themselves. But the most striking
evidence of the success to be obtained from attacking the industrial
problem in Panama systematically and in a big way is that furnished by
"the operations of the United Fruit Company, the biggest business fact in"
the tropics.
"Panama is, of course, only one link in the colossal chain of the"
operations of this company in the tropics. The rapidly increasing
prosperity of many of the Central Republics is due largely to the
"sweeping scope of the United Fruit Company, and its impress is in"
evidence all along the north coast of South America and throughout the
West Indies. Its interests in Jamaica are enormous. Cuba put Jamaica off
"the sugar map, but the United Fruit Company came to her rescue with an"
"offer to purchase all the bananas her planters could furnish, and"
"Jamaica now leads the American tropics with 17,000,000 bunches annually,"
"of which the United Fruit Company obtains nearly half, the balance being"
handled by its competitors. The company also owns the famous Titchfield
"Hotel of Port Antonio, and operates the Myrtle Bank Hotel of Kingston."
"In Cuba the company owns 60,000 acres of sugar plantations and its two"
great sugar mills will this year add to the world’s product an amount
"with a market value in excess of $10,000,000. Its scores of white"
Once upon a time there was a king who had several sons; I do not just
"know how many there were, but the youngest was not content at home,"
and insisted on going out into the world to seek his fortune. And in
the end the king had to give him permission to do so. After he had
"wandered for a few days, he came to a giant's castle, and took service"
with the giant. In the morning the giant wanted to go off to herd his
"goats, and when he started he told the king's son he was to clean the"
"stable in the meantime. ""And when you are through with that, you need"
"do nothing more for to-day, for you might as well know that you have"
"come to a kind master,"" said he. ""But you must do what you are told to"
"do conscientiously and, besides, you must not go into any of the rooms"
"that lie behind the one in which you slept last night, else your life"
"will pay the forfeit."""
"""He surely is a kind master,"" said the king's son to himself, walked up"
"and down the room, and whistled and sang; for, thought he, there would"
"be plenty of time to clean the stable. ""But it would be nice to take a"
"look at the other room, there surely must be something in it that he is"
"alarmed about, since I am not so much as to take a look,"" thought he,"
"and went into the first room. There hung a kettle, and it was boiling,"
"but the king's son could find no fire beneath it. ""What can there be in"
"it?"" thought he, and dipped in a lock of his hair, and at once the hair"
"grew just like copper. ""That's a fine soup, and whoever tastes it will"
"burn his mouth,"" said the youth, and went into the next room. There hung"
another kettle that bubbled and boiled; but there was no fire beneath
"it, either. ""I must try this one, too,"" said the king's son, and again"
"he dipped in a lock of his hair and it grew just like silver. ""We have"
"no such expensive soup at home,"" said the king's son, ""but the main"
"thing is, how does it taste?"" and with that he went into the third room."
"And there hung still another kettle, a-boiling just like those in the"
"two other rooms, and the king's son wanted to try this one, too. He"
"him. ""O, I suppose she has gone out for a little,"" thought the giant,"
and he dipped his spoon in the kettle to try the dinner; but there was
"nothing but leather soles and rags and like rubbish cooked together, and"
he did not know whether it were mush or porridge. When he noticed this
"he began to see a light, and realize how matters had come to pass, and"
"he grew so angry that he hardly knew what to do, and made after the"
king's son and the Master Girl in flying haste. In a short time he came
"to the sea, and could not cross. ""But I know how to help myself,"" said"
"he. ""I will fetch my sea-sucker."" So the sea-sucker came, and lay down"
"and took two or three swallows, and thus lowered the water so that the"
"giant could see the king's son and the Master Girl out on the ship. ""Now"
"you must throw the lick-stone overboard,"" said the Master Girl, and the"
king's son did so. It turned into a tremendous large rock square across
"the sea, and the giant could not get over, and the sea-sucker could"
"drink up no more of the sea. ""I know quite well what I must do,"" said"
"the giant. ""I must now fetch my hill-borer."" So the hill-borer came, and"
"bored a hole through the rock, so the sea-sucker could get through and"
keep on sucking. But no sooner were they thus far than the Master Girl
"told the king's son to pour a drop or so of the bottle overboard, and"
the sea grew so full that they had landed before the sea-sucker could so
much as take a single swallow.
Now they wanted to go home to the father of the king's son; but he would
"not hear of the Master Girl's going afoot, since he did not think this"
"fitting for either of them. ""Wait here a little while, until I fetch the"
"seven horses that stand in my father's stable,"" said the king's son. ""It"
"is not far, and I will soon be back; for I will not have my bride come"
"marching home afoot."" ""No, do not do so, for when you get home to the"
"castle you will forget me, I know that positively,"" said the Master"
"Girl. ""How could I forget you?"" said the king's son. ""We have passed"
"through so many hardships together, and we love each other so dearly,"""
"said he. He wanted to fetch the coach and seven horses at all costs, and"
"in the building. Nevertheless, its chief attraction, to the devout"
"Roman Catholic mind, is neither the bones of the Maccabees nor the"
"statue of Moses, but the chains referred to in the following familiar"
"passage of Scripture: ""Peter therefore was kept in prison; but prayer"
was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. And when Herod
"would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between"
two soldiers bound with two chains; and the keepers before the door
"kept the prison. And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a"
"light shined in the prison; and he smote Peter on the side, and raised"
"him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his"
"hands."" (Acts xii. 5-7.) These two chains were presented by Juvenal,"
"Bishop of Jerusalem, to the Empress Eudoxia, wife of Theodosius the"
"younger, who placed one of them in the Basilica of the apostles in"
"Constantinople and sent the other to Rome, where this church was"
erected as its special shrine. This was about the middle of the fifth
"century. ""But the Romans could not rest satisfied with the possession"
"of half the relic; and within the walls of this very basilica, Leo"
I. beheld in a vision the miraculous and mystical uniting of the two
"chains, since which they have both been exhibited here, and the day of"
"their being soldered together by invisible power, August 1st, has been"
"kept sacred in the Latin church!"" ""They are of unequal size, owing to"
"many fragments of one of them (first whole links, then only filings)"
having been removed in the course of centuries by various popes and
sent to Christian princes who have been esteemed worthy of the favor!
The longest is about five feet in length. At the end of one of them is
"a collar, which is said to have encircled the neck of St. Peter. They"
are exposed on the day of the 'station' (the first Monday in Lent) in a
"reliquary presented by Pius IX., adorned with statuettes of St. Peter"
"and the Angel--to whom he is represented as saying, '_Ecce nunc scio"
vere_' (Acts xii. II). On the following day a priest gives the chains
"to be kissed by the pilgrims, and touches their foreheads with them,"
"saying, 'By the intercession of the blessed Apostle Peter, may God"
No such commercial development had before been seen in Europe. About
"1560, according to Guicciardini,[800] 500 ships had been known to come"
and go in a day from Antwerp harbour in the island of Walcheren; but in
"the spring of 1599, it is recorded, 640 ships engaged solely in the"
"Baltic trade discharged cargoes at Amsterdam;[801] and in 1610,"
"according to Delacourt, there sailed from the ports of Holland in three"
"days, on the eastward trade alone, 800 or 900 ships and 1,500 herring"
boats.[802] At the date of the Peace of Münster these figures were left
"far behind, whence had arisen a reluctance to end the war, under which"
"commerce so notably flourished. Many Hollanders, further, had been"
averse to peace in the belief that it would restore Antwerp and injure
"their commerce, even as Prince Maurice of Orange, the republic's general"
"and stadthouder, had been averse to it as likely to lessen his power and"
revenue.[803] But between 1648 and 1669 the trade increased by fifty per
"cent.,[804] Holland taking most of the Spanish trade from the shipping"
"of England and the Hansa, and even carrying much of the trade between"
Spain and her colonies. When the Dutch had thus a mercantile marine of
"10,000 sail and 168,000 men, the English carried only 27,196 men; and"
the Dutch shipping was probably greater than that of all the rest of
Europe together.[805]
"This body of trade, as has been seen, was built up by a State which,"
"broadly speaking, had a surplus wealth-producing power in only one"
"direction, that of fishing; and even of its fishing, much was done on"
"the coasts of other nations. In that industry, about 1610, it employed"
"over 200,000 men; and the Greenland whale fishery, which was a monopoly"
"from 1614 to 1645, began to expand rapidly when set free,[806] till in"
"1670 it employed 120 ships.[807] For the rest, though the country"
"exported dairy produce, its total food product was not equal to its"
"consumption; and as it had no minerals and no vineyards, its surplus"
"wealth came from the four sources of fishing, freightage, extorted"
"colonial produce, and profits on the handling of goods bought and sold."
"It won't be so bad, believe me."
Good night.
The fish will be pleased.
That's the third in a week.
They'll get the texts down there.

Figures.
It's always complicated with them.
I say if they make you suffer.

We're not sure.
They're not coming.
"The signal was in and out, but, it still might have gone through."
"Look, Vivian, we need to find a way out."
I can't.
I can't.
"Do you know of anything, any way out?"
Are you sure he was behind you?
Yes.
I don't trust her.
We will see how she does in the office.
I am sure she is going to do well.

I was very busy with office work.
You always make excuses.
Your papa misses you a lot.
Okay.
Tell me.

"Very good, mom."
Even my boss is very friendly.
Gul.
"Okay, mom."
I got to go.
Pia is calling me.
I am very late for office.
Listen.
What is it?
Can you help us?
Yes.
What's it about?
( inaudible whisper )
- Are you the priest?
"- No, I'm the sexton."
Where's the priest?
He's not here.
( inaudible whisper )
- Can we call him?
- Yeah.
Sure you can.
Can you come inside the police station with us?
And talk to the policeman and explain it to him?
"Yeah, no problem."
( thunder rumbles )
( engine turns off)
( door opens )
( door closes )
[man] Hey!
( thunder rumbles )
Open up!
Come out of there!
Come out!
Thank you.
Would you like to explain?
It was all a bit much.
The accident.
The separation.
( thunder rumbles )
( locks door )
Me neither.
"Easy, now."
You went through the trouble to save my life.
It'd be a shame to kill me.
"You all right, Rodney?"
"Yeah, just peachy."
What the hell was that?
The retrovirus is having the opposite effect than we intended.
I guess so.
"Oh, god."
On the...
"Yeah, but..."
Ellia?
You poor girl.
You never deserved this.
I know part of you is still there.
"Ellia, please."
This isn't you.
Zaddik!
Are you all right?
Don't try to move.
It was Ellia... but it wasn't her fault.
Over here!
"Here, come on!"
"No, no, no!"
You people need to go back to the village!
It is not safe here.
Who is that?
Don't you remember me?
No... it can't be.
You were taken by the Daimos.
"No, father."
"Well, what do they say?"
That I should die.
"That I'm worthless, that I'm evil, stupid."
- I'm so sorry.
- That I'm...
"No, it's, um..."
"Yeah, it's terrifying."
Do they ever say good things?
"You know, like:"
"""Your hair smells like cupcakes."""
Or:
"""I don't wanna leave you."""
"No, they never say that."
"Well, then your voices are idiots."
- What is it?
- It's a labyrinth.
"You think of a question,"
- okay?
- A question.
Mm-hm.
Something in your life that needs an answer and then you just walk the path.
And maybe you'll get an answer.
Okay.
A question.
Lucy.
- He hates you.
- This is when you die.
I can't.
I can't do this.
You're disgusting.
- I can't.
- You're disgusting.
You have to come back to me!
"Do you hear me, Josie?"
Josie!
Josie?
!
Don't!
Don't!
Please don't lock me in here!
Don't!
Please!
No!
I just want to go home!
Please!
Lies.
Lies.
Lies!
I said her name.
I forgot.
It's all right.
"Garcia, were you able to trace it?"
No.
I was so close.
But I have the cell tower it pinged off of.
I just sent that to your phones.
"What's this area like, Sergeant?"
Mostly blue-collar residential.
What about that area?
It looks pretty secluded.
That's where the old railroad spur line used to come into town.
Mostly just abandoned structures out there now.
We're on it.
There.
You all right?
What do you mean?
You look a bit...
I'm fine.
"Loudest club in the west, mate."
You gonna be all right?
Yeah.
I'll be fine.
"Hey, Tony..."
"Hey, Cass."
Are we going somewhere?
"Oh, yes..."
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'm totally ready.
Isn't that sweet?
I'm sad about them.
Aren't you?
I'm fine and dandy.
Good.
We're just fine and dandy...
Come on.
You can buy me a drink.
"I think that since Sid and Michelle are together, we should do the same."
"What, go out?"
Yeah!
Get dressed up?
Go on a date?
Yeah!
"And we'd talk and eat dim sum,"
- and I'd take you home...
- And I'd walk you upstairs...
But I'd knock my head on the door frame and fall down.
Mmm.
Concealed weapon.
The gun's going to the lab ;
you're coming with us.
"Let's go, guys."
You shoot Julio ?
I didn't cap nobody.
That's all right.
We'll get the bullet from autopsy.
"Well, when you do, get back to me."
Are we done ?
"Not quite, Luis."
What's that ?
That is your confession for another murder.
What murder ?
Bob Keaton.
Muzzle stamp's identical.
"Bob's chest, your gun."
800 or deal is off.
Then it's off.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Five.
I'll give you five.
Now you negotiate ?
"Luis, show him my counteroffer."
- I'm out of here.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
You killed him.
Julio's the boss.
"Maybe you took care of that, too."
"No, I swear."
I didn't.
Your only friend is me.
"If I conk out, you're dead."
"Here's my direct line, so you can't forget it."
"Give me a lead, fast."
That gang...
I want their names first.
"Nobody knows them, I swear!"
I want news from you.
Stay in touch.
So I know you're OK.
Good seeing you again.
How'd you get that?
It's nothing.
At work.
Why not tell me what you do?
I don't want to lose you.
"You get home late, leave early."
Lots of cops live that way.
Many wind up all alone.
What are you after?
Nothing.
I just do my job.
"Get up, lazybones!"
"- Say: ""Morning, Dad""."
"- Morning, Dad."
And give him a kiss.
No school today?
Never on Wednesday.
You know that.
"Yeah, if I knew it's Wednesday."
Mom in?
Rushing as usual.
Did you say anything stupid?
"By ""anything stupid,"" I mean anything at all."
Look at you.
"Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter."
We'll talk about it later.
"Right now, you out."
Ten minutes ago.
Go on.
"There are laws, detective."
Have your kindergarten teacher read them to you.
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap.
Go on.
All right.
Who do we have?
Brandon Mayhew.
Brandon Mayhew.
All right.
Brandon Mayhew.
- Here we go.
Public masturbation.
- What?
I don't get it.
What's the kick?
"Why don't you do it at home with a big flat-screen TV, 50 channels of pay-per-view?"
In a Starbucks.
That's nice.
"That ain't me, man."
I...
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.
Okay.
I acted foolishly as well.
"No hard feelings, aye?"
I'll buy you a refreshment.
"Please, allow me."
I shall buy you a refreshment.
"No, no, I'll buy you one."
I insist.
"No, I must buy you one, to make amends."
It's all right.
I'll buy.
"- No, I will buy."
- I'll buy.
"- No, I will buy."
- I'll buy.
"- No, I will."
- I will.
- I will.
- Me!
Me!

A SUBURBAN TALE

My name is Ben Laine.
I will help you through the day.
I know that you're anxious.
You've had nightmares or didn't sleep at all.
Count with me from three to one.
"Three, two, one."
Good.
You can feel your entire body relax.
"Make some coffee, Viljanen."
"One time, we had a warning of an attack."
We had the entire village like this.
"When the raiders came, we jumped up and chased them back to the beach."
But there was one small problem.
You couldn't find the village again.
Have I told you the story before?
"Now, remember, just remove the leader."
Jacob moore.
"If we take him, we gain a significant advantage."
There!

What was?
A net!
- A net?
"- A net, aye!"
It caught me in a net!
It tried to capture me.
"""..."
"Even holy waher cannoh whihen you."""
How do you know that poem?
Our teacher recites poems to us from time to time.
For homework?
No.
He recites and I learn them.
You must be a good student.
Yes.
Well done!
What grade did you get in the third term?
We haven't finished our exams yet.
"In the second term, then?"
Twelve.
And the first term?
Ten.
When do the exams end?
They start today and go on for two weeks.
- Good luck.
- Come in.
How is she?
Who?
- You don't know who I mean?
- Mrs Malek?
She's so-so.
What does that mean?
She's still in bed.
"She doesn't eat, she doesn't speak."
"Wait, I'll fetch it."
Here.
Just a second.
I'm tying my shoelace.
Yeah.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
But I can't work like this.
"So, you're going to have to choose."
All right.
Then I guess I quit.
Thank God.
"Well, call the station manager, and tell him to find somebody else."
"No, I quit you."
I quit us.
"Monk, stop crying."
I don't know where she is.
It's going to be okay.
No.
"No, I can't, Monk."
I'm at the gym.
"No, you don't want to come down here."
Believe me.
There are naked people here.
Look.
I tell you what.
I've got to work late tonight.
Why don't you come by the office?
Good.
Okay.
See you then.
"Hello, everybody."
I'm Natalie Teeger.
Who's ready to make lotto history?
Our super jackpot is worth $212 million.
Why did I make her choose?
Of course she'd choose to leave.
Does Kim know about this?
Yeah.
From you?
I haven't had a chance to talk to her myself yet.
"You square this with her, Chase, you understand me?"
Just make that right.
And get back to me as soon as Nina gives you anything.
I will.
Are we up yet?
Yep.
"Video's piped in, voice analysis, vitals, transcription."
- We're all set.
"- Nick, do you copy?"
"- Yeah, I read you."
- We're ready to go.
"All right, recording to hard drive now."
"So, Tony's doing this?"
Yeah.
Is that going to be weird for you?
What do you mean?
Didn't-didn't he and Nina go out?
Yeah.
We set?
Yeah.
All right.
I want you to do a hi-res on her eyes.
She's tired.
We might be able to pick up a tell.
Okay.
"So, we all right?"
Yeah.
We're fine.
Now tell me his name.
- Are you interrogating him?
"- Yes, I am."
Don't you dare!
He's dying!
He's got blood in his lungs and they're filling up and there's fuck all in here that I can use to stop it.
I can still hear all this.
"Okay, Dad."
Just relax.
Just keep calm.
Fine.
"Clare, what do you need?"
Okay.
I need something sharp to stab into his chest to release the pressure.
- That's fine.
I have a knife.
- That's no good.
"- A valve, I need a valve."
- I've got a pen in my back pocket.
"- Yes, a pen."
A pen will work.
- Here.
Okay?
Yes.
Perfect.
"Take that bit out, then slice off the end."
"All right, Dad, just keep breathing for me."
That's right...
I've got you...
I've got you...
- Are you good?
- All right.
"Marcia's a very pretty girl, isn't she?"
Oui.
"Yes, sir."
"That's what frightens you, isn't it?"
"Why no, sir, I..."
You're afraid I'll become interested in Marcia.
"Why well, if you..."
If you want to...
What?
!
What?
!
You're not very clear.
"Well, sir, I..."
Oh.
"Oh, you poor child."
"I'm such a tease, aren't I?"
Such a tease.
"Yes, sir."
What a lucky man I am to be loved this way.
But supposing I did have to leave you for a while?
"Leave, sir?"
When?
"I'm not saying when, I said ""suppose."""
Well...
Supposing I had to take a trip from time to time?
You...
You mean... soon?
"Well, now, I don't know."
"Oh, you mustn't look so worried."
"It won't be for a long, long time."
"Oh, I see."
Put your hands up.
Would you mind?
Thank you.
How nice to hear from you.
Of course.
"Yes, that shouldn't be too difficult, sir."
You would prefer it in the morning?
By all means.
Yes.
Good night.
I want that in the diplomatic pouch to Lisbon this afternoon.
- And on to Berlin?
- As soon as possible.
Fine.
May I ask you...
It's insurance.
You don't come to us very often.
- Not very.
- You keep to yourself.
A cautious man.
A cautious life.
"But then, how else could one survive these days?"
One could stop.
But not you.
Training.
- Patriotism.
Good.
"- Here, please."
"Pull in here, cabby."
Thank you.
"Do you know what these are, Godliman?"
American aircraft.
- I feel weird.
- I can't breathe.
- Did you take something?
- Franz gave me a pill.
- Simon's with your sister.
In the VIP Lounge.
You can't allow that.
"- Go home, Luise."
- You can't make me.
Mum will freak if she hears you came here on a school night.
Go home.
- I hate you.
- Go home.
And you come with me.
Move over.
- Where are you going?
- For a wash.
- Will you be back?
- Maybe.
You bastard!
She's my little sister!
Why did you do that magazine?
- Can't you just forget it?
- It was so way out of line.
- I don't regret it.
- So you'd do it again?
- If I have to.
- I don't need shit like this.
Keep your hands off Luise.
"Simon, you mustn't go."
- Please don't be too rough.
- Haven't you done it before?
Shut up!
"It's my place, you have no say here!"
"Now, I swear in front of the lights!"
I will never care about Ho Foon.
"If I don't keep my words, I'll be punished by law."
Don't you care about me any more?
You mean it?
You are selfish!
You are merciless!
You are impotent!
Bastard!
You bastard!
You really mean it?
Bastard!
How dare you cheat my money?
"Brother Foon, hide up first."
Hide up?
"Yan, take care."
I am not impotent...
I am not!
"Hubby, what's wrong with you?"
It's only a dream.
Foon said that I am merciless and selfish.
Is that true?
"I feel lonely, how to say in English?"
I love you.
I love you.
Really?
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
We watched it for two weeks.
Oh God.
Oh God.
You're lying to me.
You have to be lying.
What?
"I don't know anything about robbing, but I do know that two weeks is not enough time."
"No, two weeks is the perfect amount of time."
It's not enough time.
That's more than enough time.
"Yeah, so much time."
Oh my God.
We can do a lot in two weeks.
Plenty of time.
An eternity.
"Hey, you know what?"
"My driver and our lookout, they're calling the cops right now, so you're gonna be okay."
Everything's over.
Now we just all need to sit tight.
What?
No.
"No, no no no."
"No, we can't do that."
He's gonna be back here.
He's gonna kill us.
You don't understand.
Who?
Him.
He's not right in the head.
He did things to me.
You want a tissue?
Never mind.
Get behind that screen and get fixed up.
Come on.
Ha ha.
Good evening!
How are you?
Good evening.
"Oh, lovely."
"Oh... you are looking more beautiful than ever, mademoiselle."
"Oh, monsieur."
How many men have told you you were beautiful?
"Oh, many, very many, but i pay no attention to them."
Did one ever tell you you were ugly?
No.
You're ugly.
What?
I dealt you a wrong card.
I'm not jim fisk jr.
I'm nick boyd.
I'm his partner.
I think i hate you!
Mmm.
Have you run down yet?
Down to the deuce.
"Mmm... say, there's some awful pretty gals at your show."
Yes.
I suppose you know them all.
Yes.
I don't know any.
No.
Well...
"it's your throw, nick."
There's jim fisk now.
"No, ma'am."
"My guys, they don't smoke on the job site."
They're good guys.
Are you sure your guys haven't been sneaking around here?
And smoking?
And lying to me?
And smoking?
I'm pretty sure.
"I need you to be honest with me, Javier."
Because I can't have someone lying to me.
"To my face, under my roof, on my time."
That's a lot of prepositions.
"I mean, there's no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there?"
"I mean, we made promises to each other."
"I mean, we have a contract."
That's like making promises.
Isn't it?
Maybe I should get back to work.
"Oh, yeah."
"Right, yeah."
"That's great, yeah."
- Javier?
- Yeah.
We're good.
Right?
You and me.
"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
We're good.
"- Oh, good."
"Okay, that's great."
"Yeah, he did great work."
Hey.
You made it.
"How about that, kiddo?"
Excuse me.
Are you the parents of the little boy in the tunnel?
How does it feel to know that Mercy was three minutes--?
Excuse me.
I think you'd better leave.
"Sorry, I'm talking with these people."
"No, you're not."
"Hey, how are you feeling?"
- You made it.
- Just like you promised.
- Thank you.
- It's all right.
You remember Wrigley Field.
We got a date.
Sit down.
Let me finish.
- That one was crooked.
- Yeah?
Next time you can do it yourself.
"- Hey, Mark, thanks."
- For what?
You did all the hard work.
I don't think I could've gone up in that helicopter.
I just got lucky.
No.
You know about kids.
As good as new.
- Where are you going?
- Check for reporters.
All clear.
"You're not embarrassed, are you?"
Of course not.
"I just thought you were working, that's all."
I took off.
For this?
Yeah.
Didn't your father ever teach you how to tie a tie?
"No, he didn't."
You know...
I didn't mean to make you do anything
You didn't want to do.
I'm chillin' yo.
"Oh shit, my dude..."
That's a nigga right there.
"No gas, no gas!"
Oh!
You just gonna stand there?
You're not gonna say anything?
"Yo, what you want me to say, yo?"
It ain't like they lying.
"You know, you're fucked up."
Yo.
"Yo, you ain't my girl."
"You need to chill the fuck out, a'ight?"
"Oh, so I'm good enough for you to fuck"
"And for me to suck your dick,"
But I'm not your girl?
"Well, then fuck you..."
fuck you!
"Yo, you good?"
"I'm good, yo."
"Wait, Chris."
–Damn it!
Open the door!
–Just let go of me!
"Well, maybe I should just let my dick do the talking."
"How about that, huh?"
–Huh?
–Open the goddamn door!
"–Shane, come on!"
–Where is he?
Where is he?
He told me to meet him at the stash house.
–Where?
–Open up!
Come on!
Near the bridge.
"You have no idea what you just missed, darlin'."
–Come on!
–Asshole!
"Couldn't split town before you picked up the merchandise, huh?"
"You were always such an idiot, Fleetwood."
Weren't you?
–You can't arrest me.
"–I'm not here to arrest you, asshole."
–Drop it!
Put that on the ground!
"–You heard him, asshole!"
Now!
Turn around!
Turn around!
"Your girlfriend gave you up, man."
She couldn't resist my charms.
–You found something?
"Hey, man, I don't want to put any kind of pressure on you, but..."
I bet every dime I got on you.
You what?
I guess I got carried away.
No pressure?
You call that no pressure?
Trainer coming through.
Excuse me.
Just take it easy.
Come on.
All right.
Has anyone given him a salt tablet?
No.
Okay.
"I've got your glucose, your dry socks, liniment, bandages."
Bandages?
Bandages?
"- Just relax, okay?"
Relax.
"- Come on, Magnum."
Warm up.
Warm up.
"Yeah, get them legs goin'."
- Get them legs in shape.
"- Two minutes, swimmers."
Two minutes.
"- Oh, no."
- Don't use them too much on the swim...
What?
What do you think you're doing.
I'm sorry.
No one informed me of the dress code.
It's too hard on my ego.
"Either way, it felt to get out and get some exercise."
"While you're in the shower, I'll scramble some eggs"
And make some of my special pancakes.
Pancakes for me?
And for me.
Something to restore that energy we've burned out.
JEFF:
Only if you got lots of honey.
My wallet.
I left it at the court.
I hooked it on the chain-link fence.
I'm so stupid.
No problem.
We'll just walk back.
"No, I'll go back."
You stay here with Greta.
It'll be faster.
JEFF:
"OK, Greta."
That's try to stay awake while she's gone.
[Greta whimpers]
"Yes, you're a good dog, Greta."
[Ambient growling]
[Choking]

No!

We're the earthquake gang.
Does that scare you?
- No.
- Aww.
Let's change our name again.
We gotta have a name that scares.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
How'd you do what you done?
"Well, I really didn't do anything."
Yeah.
You a magician or something?
No.
You want to join our gang?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
- Thanks anyway.
"- Aw, sure."
I guess you're like the rest of them.
You've heard we're a nothing gang.
"Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing."
Someday we're gonna be the toughest.
Take over the whole territory.
Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block.
All right.
"Don't say a word without a lawyer, even if they beat you."
- Stay strong.
- Not tonight.
Nobody's beating me.
You get out of here.
I don't want you mixed up in this.
"- If i go to jail, I'm goin' alone."
- Wait!
Your money's in your briefcase!
Don't do it!
Don't take that sled.
It's a piece of shit.
Take the 4-40!
Excellent power-to-weight ratio.

Fine!
This beauty is built for you!

I got it!
No!
Pull the choke.
The lines are dry.

Finesse.
Like getting a chick off.
We went over this!

It's the weed capital of the world!

Put the frickin' bong away.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Turb--
Terrorist!
Roldy?
- What the fuck is that thing in his hands?
"- No, ma'am, not a terrorist."
- He's just an idiot.
- This is just a bong.
He said he got a bomb!
"No, people, it's a water pipe for tobacco."
"No, no, no, it's not a bomb."
It's just a bong.
Poison gas!
It's marijuana!
Marijuana!
"You picked the wrong plane, you terrorist fuck!"
Hey!
"Hey, what are you doing?"
There are three air marshals on board.
Three!
We are not terrorists!
"Sir, that's a bong, not a bomb."
No Italians.
No Italians.

"Frank, it's not really our bag."
"Pot of VB, thanks, love."

Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Are you looking for a shooter?

I'm available.

We got our own guns.
"Oh, it doesn't have to be guns."
We got our own guns.
"Oh, it doesn't have to be guns."
We can use knives.
Anything.

Anything.
Bit of fuckin' four by two - anything you want.
Bit of fuckin' four by two - anything you want.
"It's your call, mate."
You're the boss.
"It's your call, mate."
You're the boss.
How much it worth?
How much it worth?
You ever offed a man before?
You ever offed a man before?
It's the bloody guerrilleros.
We can't hit them from here.
Call the helicopter.
Unit 47 to helicopter.
Please respond.
Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
- Those bastards are in control of the dam.
"Yes, we know."
They've taken out the guards.
We'll try to attack them from here.
Please support us.
We've got no heavy weapons.
We must try to get closer first.
Over.
- What are you waiting for?
Attack!
- Hurry up!
"- Hurry up, Jaime."
They're coming back.
- All right.
Why can't you throw hand grenades at them?
We'll be above them soon.
They're not going to enjoy this.
They'll be here in a minute.
"Hurry up, damn it!"
"Oh, my God!"
They've hit the helicopter!
Is it bad?
Can you get up?
I need help!
José is injured!
"–Hey, where is he?"
Where is he?
"–What are you gonna do, hit me?"
–I don't see any witnesses here.
–Yeah?
Let my bruises do the talking.
Don't make me do something that we both don't want me to do.
–Yeah?
Go ahead.
–Just tell me where he is!
Please.
Just tell me where he is.
"Go ahead and whack me, you cracker prick."
I'll make my own million.
–Is that what you want?
–Mm-hmm.
–Is that what you really want?
–Mmm.
"–All right, let's go."
Let's go.
–What?
What are you... –Come here!
–No!
Let go of me!
–Leave me alone!
–Open up!
"You and me, we're about to get real acquainted if you don't start remembering."
–Don't touch me!
–Where is he?
–Open up!
–Let go of me!
You don't wanna tell me?
Now it's done.
I'm callin' this in.
Thank you.
"Hey, guess what?"
"In case you didn't know, you have the right to remain silent, bitch."
Hello.
"No, no, no, no!"
Shit.
Hey.
"You, you're out."
Where you taking me?
Shut the fuck up.
We're almost there.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Blair, I'm so sorry."
"Okay, I'm, I'm a fucking idiot."
I just...
Please don't tell me those were Timmy Song's guys.
He's the only one powerful enough to get you out.
Okay.
"Blair, we have to go."
We have to get out of town right now.
"No, Ollie."
I gave him everything we had.
And I had to borrow on top of that.
"Look, you don't have to worry about that right now."
"No, I have to worry about it, okay?"
He calculates his late fees in body parts.
"All right, when's our first payment?"
Next week.
Fuck.
There are a lot here.
- What's after that?
- Nothing.
I know what there is.
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- There's a road near the tree.
I'll tell you what there is.
"""Near hhe hree is a wooded lane, greener hhan hhe dreams of God."""
What's after the tree?
Read the address.
"It says a tall, single tree."
There's a lot on this hillside.
is it very tall?
"Yes, it says it's very tall."
It must be different from the others then.
The single tree?
There are so many.
They're all on the hill.
That's what it says here.
I don't think this will get us anywhere.
There it is.
"There, look, a single tree!"
- Where?
- Up there.
I see it...
What a big tree!
Look at it.
He was right.
"Jahan, take a look."
Where?
"Too late now, you'll have to look up through the roof but you won't see it."
"Oh, Red, you missed a spot."
See it right there?
- No!
No!
- On the hood right there.
"Stop, stop!"
That's cold!
Help!
Please!
Stop!
"Thanks, Red."
What was that for?
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?
"If you do, you gotta be clean."
'Cause even in hillbilly hell we have standards.
"What, I...?"
I don't get it.
I thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job.
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
"I mean, not with me!"
But there.
"Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone."
"- And I'd be in my cone, and it's..."
- Wait.
"Wait, you're being nice to me."
"If you want to stay at the dirty impound, fine."
- I understand you criminal types.
"- No, no, no, no."
That's OK.
"- Yeah, the Cozy Cone."
- It's newly refurbished.
There's not even any fuckin' silverware in this place.
Oh no.
What?
What is it?
There's no beer.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Oh shit.
"Come on, come on."
Oh shit.
"Blair, Ollie."
Did you find it?
No.
The skylight is sealed shut.
How did you open it in the first place?
It was already wide open.
I just went through.
Us too.
He's back.
"Yeah, well we got a fuckin' gun."
Why don't we use it?
There's only one bullet.
"Riley, how many bullets did you bring?"
"Well, you only need one bullet to take 'em out, right?"
Technically that's true.
So here's the plan.
No way.
Guns and Riley don't mix.
Will you stop insulting my crew?
"You guys, no new plans."
"We stay together, and we find the jammer, okay."
Where?
We already checked everywhere.
Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?
What?
"You said you'd love to call me but then you said, ""Look forward to hearing from you,"" and..."
You see how that's kind of confusing?
"Yeah, look, we'll talk."
We'll get in touch.
You did it again.
Very vague.
You know what?
Let's just say that you'll call me and then we can skip all the nonsense.
"Goodbye, Gigi."
- He was cute.
"- Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him."
What are you doing?
I'm not calling him.
"If he wants to see me, he'll call."
Wow.
That guy Alex really made an impression on you.
Was he hot?
No.
He was just right.
Morning.
"Morning, Ryan."
A surprise mocha venti just because you're so awesome.
- Love you.
- Love you.
Good morning.
Okay.
So?
"Oh, hi."
- He asked me out.
NATHAN:
It gives me the right.
"If my fish accuse to fuck another,"
Then go to fuck another.
"If your daughter thinks I'm rapist, then being raped."
No one will get away with what you did to us.
Niko.
Niko.
Really?
Niko.
Niko.
Niko.
Then you just have to kill me.
Do not you?
You need to kill me.
You have no idea.
It's fun to kill people.
You of all people should be to try it sometime.
Fun?
It's fun to kill people?
Did you have fun while You killed my wife and daughter?
Get up.
Get up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
I remember your fucking wife.
I remember fucking your wife.
You're too weak.
Too fucking bad.
You're too weak to do something about it.
Son of a bitch!
I agree with you.
"You can taste the Silvaner grapes, the Muscat."
I can sense my old lady.
What's your old lady want?
She coming to the basement?
"You mean, if we stay too long?"
Really?
- She'll come?
"- Yeah, in a bikini."
In a bikini?
I'm gonna wait then.
I'll wait till she shows up.
Till she arrives in a bikini.
- This I want to see.
- Me too.
Will she dance for us?
"Sure, she'll dance."
She could get lost in such a big basement.
It's roomy enough.
- How long have you been married?
- An eternity.
- How long?
"- 25, 24 years."
What?
- 24 years.
- How much longer will she want you?
I can't say for sure.
We're heading down a long road.
She's built to last.
"So, I'll show you your future room."
Shut the door.
I'm a masochist.
- l gave all that to Missing Persons.
"Okay, mister."
Okay.
"I'll handle this, Willie."
"Thanks, Willie."
- Fished this one out of the Gulf.
- Pass.
- Hit and run.
"- No, he's too old."
- What'd he look like?
- Medium.
- Medium what?
"- Medium young, medium height."
- Medium weight.
- Very illuminating.
"You can call him medium, what's left of him."
Barracuda got the rest.
That's the lot.
- All the rest empty?
- Yeah.
Not much business f or the one cool spot in town.
"- One just came in, but he don't fit."
- How do you know?
- You said suicide.
- l was guessing.
This one came f rom a car smash.
You don't want to see him.
- l might as well blanket the field.
- He's as crisp as bacon.
- l can stand it if you can.
- Okay.
He was like a lump of charcoal.
No.
Bring her back!
Bring her back!
No!
Bring her back!
Come on!
Come on.
Come on.
Bring her back!
Test Subject Seven is no longer viable.
(PANTING)
I really thought you were the one.
We'll just...
We'll just have to resume our search.
"Find solace in your faction, Caleb."
We're your family now.
Jeanine wanted me to show you this.
(INHALES)
(GASPING)
"Hey, Four."
Maybe do that thing you do?
(ALL GRUNTING)
PETER:
"Hey, Four, come on, that was pretty good, right?"
"First, I swiped a paralytic from the infirmary."
Then I shot her up when she was all freakin' out about you.
"I mean, I told these guys I was pretty smart."
Guess they shoulda listened.
You're real.
"Yeah, I'm real."
What are you doing here?
"You die, I die."
Don't mention it.
Thank you very much.
Pay my mother.
Thank you very much.
Don't mention it.
Good-bye.
Good luck.
How much do I owe you?
Three hundred tomans.
- Here.
- You're welcome.
Thank you again.
Good-bye.
Why did you take the money?
Go and give it back to him.
He wanted to pay.
Sir...
You're our honoured guest.
No.
Keep it.
Thank you very much.
Really.
You honour us.
Thank you again.
Each of us has a commitment.
Each of us has a commitment.
"I have one too, to my family."
I've come here to work too.
"Listen, don't confuse work and family."
"We have to know, give or take a day, when we'll finally return to Tehran."
You said it would happen in the first three days.
"You said, ""Next week."" And then nothing happened."
You're one of those rich computer twins.
Otto recoded your white blood cells to fight the cancer in my blood.
You brought me back to save you.
Otto:
The donor grows much stronger than any of my models anticipated.
[Gunshot]
"You hang on, all right?"
You hang on!
I should have gone to your ball games.
I should have...
I should have been better to your mom.
Duval:
He's dying.
He said you could fix him.
I'll meet you at the gate.
"No, we're coming in together."
No more lies.
Why does he think he's my father?
Because he is.
No.
"No, no, no, no."
"No, it can't be."
It is.
It is not.
It's impossible.
This doesn't happen.
It...
it... it never happens.
"If by ""it"" you mean me, it's happened."
Look at me.
You know who I am.
- Shut up.
The one whose house burned down...
I knew I'd seen her before.
It's that naked woman from last night.
What?
The woman who was standing here last night.
Crazy fools.
They didn't burn to death.
They were stabbed.
All three of them?
Yeah.
"Freaked the hell out of me, too."
Prime suspect is the missus who hung herself.
What the heck happened?
Beats me.
Over here.
In here.
What?
Give us a hand.
A little more.
Found it.
Idiot!
Don't touch it with your bare hands!
What the...?
Are you a moron?
That's evidence.
"He should've wrapped it in cloth or something, right?"
Gokseong Police Station
"So, she killed everyone?"
That's what they said.
I'll be damned.
"So, that's what happened."
Why did you call me?
Don't worry.
I stuck a bloody Band-Aid in it before we left.
Holy crap.
Look at that!
Cool!
A diving board!
Oh... my...
God.
This is the greatest thing ever.
And someone just dumped it here for us to find.
We've got to take it home!
What are we gonna do with it?
I don't know.
But...
look at it!
It's... it's got the... and it's... up and... and bounce and... and bounce!
He's right.
We need it.
"One, two, three... go!"
"One, two, three... go!"
"One, two, three, go!"
"One, two, three, go!"
"Aah, Jamie, this is ridiculous!"
"You'll eat dead bugs out of the zapper, for God's sake, why won't you eat your peas?"
You love peas!
Come on.
This is name-brand stuff.
It's three times the price of the food I eat!
"If you want to breathe, you have to open your mouth."
See?
There's no reason for...
"Now you're just going to have to eat some eyebrow, too."
That's no question to ask a young girl!
What's Pepita the Elephant?
An elephant.
Right.
You're both nuts.
How old is she now?
Are you afraid she's yours?
-Is she?
She has no father.
Would you like some coffee?
-Yeah.
Give me your hand.
I'll read your palm.
You have a weird pulse.
It's like two parallel rhythms.
A steady Finnish hump.
And a fiery beat.
You're like Iceland:
"ice on the surface, fire inside."
You should show this fire to a red-haired woman.
She's been waiting for you for quite a while.
"Damn you, Jesse!"
Wrong hole.
The balcony will be out there!
Move it!
I'll come back tonight.
-It's a deal.
I'm no little girl although I like firefighters.
Fight fire with fire.
Ouch...
I don't think you're up to this.
I must fire you.
- Good.
I'll excuse myself.
"I'm gonna go to the ladies room and I'm going to remove my new, improved butt."
I would like you to order me a petite fillet and a wedge salad.
- And then we'll get to work.
- Will do.
Apology accepted.
- You must be Nora.
- Yes.
- Lawrence McGill.
- Very nice to meet you.
"Oh, my God, look at those earrings."
"Let me guess, a carat and a half?"
"Uh, yeah."
"Uh, are you a jeweler?"
No.
I make it my business to notice beautiful things.
Yes.
Please forgive me.
I'm a little nervous about all this.
- You're a virgin.
- Hardly.
I have five children.
I mean a dating service virgin.
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, yes."
I am.
Are you?
"Oh, no."
I'm an old whore at this point.
Lots of first dates.
"Seconds, not so much."
Do you wanna leave ?
I like this place.
It's been a long time since we came here.
Your mother is gonna wait.
It was at least a year and a half ago.
"I wanted to take a book with me, and I forgot."
It was quite sunny !
You had to insist to bring me here.
As usual I dithered.
Aferwards I was happy.
Things were never the same after that.
"Try to sleep now, sweet heart."
Was it Francois who's just called ?
"Yes, he is on the way."
You didn't tell him.
No.
I don't want him to worry.
It's bad enough with you being upset.
This should be him.
Mom ?
Yes sweet heart ?
How do I look ?
Great.
Hi François !
Everything's alright ?
Yes !
How is he ?
Did he sleep ?
No even if he's really quite exhausted.
"He can't sleep, can he ?"
And he keeps asking about you.
"I go see him, and then I will make us dinner."
- (HORN BLARES)
I am not having drinks with you.
You might be a pervert.
"I might be a pervert, but you're definitely a car thief."
I said I was sorry.
"- You didn't, actually."
- (SIREN WHOOPS)
- Oh.
- Damn it.
"That's why I said, ""Eyes on the road!"""
Screwdriver. (GRUNTS)
License and registration.
Hi!
"Terribly sorry, officer, but it's actually my car."
I'm trying to teach my girlfriend how to drive stick.
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know..."
Women.
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning...this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
What are you?
Some sort of misogynist?
You're welcome.
"Go, go, we got lucky."
We?
"- This isn't your car either, is it?"
- Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
What have you done?
"""The lovers moustache tickles"", doesn't it?"
I've shaved it!
I can see what you want.
"You misunderstand, sir!"
This is... a cross-connection!
What?
Let me put it plainly.
What you are dreaming of can never be true!
But what are you scared of?
Wouldn't you be scared if a man proposed to you?
It's wrong.
Cancel it!
I've had it with Hari once!
Who's Hari?
Hart's my husband.
"But he's Godbole, isn't he?"
True but I'm married!
Obviously.
But you never spoke of it.
I thought...
He went away on a pilgrimage ten years ago.
You never mentioned that.
You never asked either.
You just thrust a rose in my hand.
What could I do?
!
He's been away for 10 years.
He won't return!
What if he does?
In that case I'll get you a divorce.
Have you nothing else to do?
"- Tennison, are you hurt?"
- No.
No.
It's...
It's not my blood.
It's...
It's David Bentley's.
He's dead.
Let's get you to the station and get you cleaned up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
"We'll get you in the car, all right?"
"Take her to the station, OK?"
When are you coming back?
I don't think I am.
What?
"Do you know what my mum said to me, when I was joining the force?"
No doubt the same as mine.
That you were mad.
She said I'd end up dead.
And you think this has proved her right?
"Kath, you can't give up."
You've got a shot at joining CID.
I'd give my right arm to be in your shoes.
"It's not giving up, accepting your limitations."
I need someone to look up to.
I'm not much of a role model.
You're not if you quit.
Funeral's tomorrow.
So surreal.
He was standing right in front of me.
Somewhere east of here.
I've heard there may be children there.
Voilà!
How on earth did you manage that?
"Garden centre, piece of cake."
- Perfect!
- Thank you!
Look at Naj.
Never seen him so happy.
Maybe he'll move in with them!
"Come on, we're naming the chickens."
- Why?
- Cause no-one eats pets with names.
Got to be something that suits them.
- Nugget?
- Something nice.
Korma?
- What happened to you?
- Car crash.
Suits you.
Both.
Are you OK?
We're naming the chickens.
"You can have one, but you'll have to share."
- Otherwise Abby won't get one.
- She not back yet?
That one there.
Eagle Eye.
What do you reckon?
Look at him.
He knows exactly what's going on.
You couldn't get anything past him.
And then seafood.
Promise.
Seafood before we go home.
Get out!
Get out!
Go!
Go!
The man in the elevator!
Help!
Please help!
Help me!
Don't hurt me!
The adoption papers are here.
My boss made me hide them.
He would not give them to anybody.
Stay with me.
You'll be safe.
"Come on, let's go."
My God!
Let's go.
Come on.
They've checked the entire floor.
There's no one in there.
"No body, nothing."
"The secretary said a Russian guy showed up, asked her boss a lot of questions."
Got upset with him.
Locked her in her room.
"The next thing she knew, the place was on fire."
Have you gone through every place of debris in the office?
- We'll keep looking.
- Good.
He was adopted by a Russian family.
"If we ever have a daughter, we should do her hair like that."
"- Oh, like Jeannie's?"
- Yes.
"No, no."
You got to be born in a lamp.
"No, it's adorable!"
"I could do it one day, and then you could do it the next day."
- But no hat.
- I love the hat!
"Hel, that hat looks like it's for a monkey who should be clanging a symbol."
Austin.
Okay.
How does the other guy look?
"Oh, no."
You're not gonna be one of those exes that shows up when he's drunk?
Even though we're not exes.
Even though we only did it once.
They're gone.
What?
Who's gone?
My kids.
I lost custody of my kids.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Get in.
"Austin, I'm so sorry."
It's all right.
"The judge said, and I will quote him directly because he was such a complete and utter asshole..."
Sure.
"You know, get comfortable."
Nothing will happen to your aunty.
"Take care, Sheen."
Take care!
Shedab has got to know that you and Sheen are together.
He has got your mobile traced.
It's not safe for you to be there now.
Move out immediately!
"We have to move, Immediately!"
Come on!
Come!
Come!
"Come sir, vehicle is ready, sir!"
Move!
Movie inside!
"Be seated, sir."
"Sir, it seems you are new to this city."
- Yes.
- Where are you going?
We are just going on an outing.
Going to Nainital.
The vehicle has broken down.
And it will take 2 to 3 days.
"So, don't know about the train."
"So we thought of going by bus, from the highway."
Very good!
Enjoy yourselves.
It's your age.
Enjoy yourselves.
Live life.
What about us?
We are old now.
How much?
Where are you going?
is she your aunt?
Yes.
Why don't we go to your mother's?
She says that our house is too small and that you deserve better.
I think your mother's wrong.
Small things have their value too.
You're small but skilful.
I'm going to grow.
The house won't grow though.
You'll grow up and go to school.
- How far does your school go?
- Until 11.
You want to keep on studying after?
I'll go to Momenieh until I'm 15.
"For the final years, I'll go to Kermanshah."
Where is it?
"Over there, look."
It's over there.
Look.
The blue window.
- The blue window?
- And that's her son.
"I see, he's her son."
Yes.
Where's the cemetery?
Up on the hill.
I have to go.
I'll take the others to Hammad's.
Are you worried about them or your book?
My book. I have an exam tomorrow.
You'll come back?
I know we're late.
"We're on our way,"
"I don't know what's going on, I can't get a cab."
"Okay, we're on our way, I'm sorry."
Bye.
"In my wallet there's a secret number for a taxi,"
I always get one through them.
Don't forget the text.
And take my binder from the desk.
"Too tight, too tight."
You're pulling it too hard.
Do it yourself.
Goni.
Gonki.
Help me.
"It's my fault, I'm sorry."
Is everyone here?
Of course.
Shall we go in?
"- Yes, we're anxious to continue, sir."
Want to get together after rehearsal?
I don't think so.
How about this weekend?
"I can't, I'm working."
I'm busy with my father.
I'm sorry if I offended you yesterday.
Forget it.
Walk gracefully.
It's Europe.
"Not here, not Tel Aviv."
"Not coarse, not hot."
Graceful.
"I promise you, when I get my licence you can quit and go back."
I already quit.
"Yeah, OK, but you can dance"
- and go to school can't you?
- Not really.
"Alright, but it's kind of expensive for both of us to go to school, so, you know..."
It's not gonna happen.
"Drugs, med school."
Duh.
"OK, but I can, I..."
I got this.
I can control the drugs.
Duh!
"No, it's cool."
"Listen, you'll dance, you'll put us through school,"
- and then I'll...
- Decide you're too good for me?
"It's not gonna be forever, babe."
Stop talking to me and hope I get the idea?
How 'bout I be the doctor and you be the stripper.
- Where are you going?
- I have to pee.
Calm down.
"- Cool, yeah."
Right.
- OK.
"When you come back, we'll get a little more coke."
We'll get out of here.
- We'll figure all this out.
Promise.
- Yeah...
Yeah.
As you wish.
See you in three months.
Then.
Yes.
I'll call you.
Thank you.
Kevin.
Hello.
Hello.
I apologize for this morning.
You weren't so formal this morning.
I shouldn't have said all that.
What?
- Everything I said.
No.
It was...
A learning experience.
Do you always judge people like that.
from the start?
In five minutes.
You understand it all?
It's more complicated than that.
Sometimes.
I talk to someone.
and feel as if I were inside them.
watching them from inside.
As if there was a bond between us.
You didn't expect me to call?
No.
You said you were suspicious of me.
that you were afraid to call.
I had good reasons to be suspicious.
- Of course you will.
- Adam's a pro...
- Of course.
All adults.
"- And, uh, we're all adults here."
Let's play some video games.
I hate this stupid game.
Shoot!
The game hates you.
Next victim?
Who's up for it?
"I am, if that's cool."
"Yeah, it's, uh, it's cool."
"- Oh, just gonna--"
- I'm gonna go with you.
- I'm gonna get the potato salad.
- Would you go...
"Oh, I'll go with you."
I'll go someplace else.
I didn't know you could drift in this game.
It takes practice.
"You brake, accelerate, and then you move the wheel like this."
Watch it.
Sorry.
I didn't mean...
Bri--Brian.
"Adam, come on."
We cool?
"Everybody's cool now, right?"
Good morning.
"Yeah, but we definitely want something back before 10:00, okay, so would you..."
"Hey, everybody, look who's back, huh?"
- There is something decadent.
- Only in the entire universe ...
It is cool the actors Simon.
You will have you.
- It's great what he says.
I want the book.
- Leave me.
- She has had?
- Who was I?
- Who you had?
- Tu.
I love you.
"You know, I love you."
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Maybe you should remove trousers if you have the Holy Spirit.
You want to do?
Why?
Why are usually them that they do it to me.
I can also legarti feet.
"For the same reason, usually because ... to me that is doing this."
And this why?
Because usually Am I that are ridiculous.
So we can forget.
The return when I want.
Do not go!
"No, I must follow!"
You need to do evil to survive?
- Even a child?
"- Not a child, it's worse."
It was a bit rushed.
I could do better.
Ok.
That's good.
"Sarah, that's really good."
"And Debbie's actually one of my favorite models necause she's so flexible, and she moves in really interesting ways, you know?"
"So, what do you do with that now?"
Oh...nothing.
It's just an exercise.
You mind if I keep that?
Thanks.
Yeah.
"You know, you really should've gone to art school."
"What is this, a mid-life crisis or something?"
Do you have cancer?
"No, no."
"No, no."
"Well, then what?"
Art school?
That's what I should do?
I thought it was Commerce or...
"Pre-med or I'm ""on my own."""
I said that?
Ah.
"Well, I wish I hadn't."
"I mean, I know that doesn't really help."
It helps a little.
Well...
"I had a really nice time today, Sarah."
"Yeah, me, too."
Good.
Take care of yourself.
"No, but I'll leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you."
"Monica, come on."
You want to have kids.
I do.
But the stork is gonna bring mine.
"Seriously, you're not gonna make me watch this alone."
She's right.
Of course not.
"Honey, get the tape."
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.
"Oh, sure."
But if you leave a drumstick under there and you're a bad roommate.
Here we go.
Okay.
"Oh, my."
"Come on, come on."
Why is that baby torturing that woman?
Why have I seen this thing three times?
It's beautiful.
-It's horrible!
"-I know, I know!"
I'm so sorry for you!
What do I do?
I don't want to do this!
How do I get out of it?
-You guys!
"You guys, look!"
-What?
Did her ass explode?
"No, the baby's out."
Look.
Look at those little fingers and toes.
"Fido, come here!"
You guys are crazy!
What do you think you're doing?
- The swine!
- Are you all right?
You picked the wrong guy!
Here's your hat.
Did they hurt you?
They picked the wrong guy.
"What's going on, Officer?"
What's happening?
So you don't know either?
He's playing dumb.
What do you want?
Franz is ―
He's in there dancing with some fat cow.
Violets.
"Here, Cilly."
I shouldn't really accept these.
How much longer will it be?
You two gonna become trash pickers?
Break every bone in his body ― he won't change.
But you're a clever girl.
"Listen, I'll get you ten other guys."
"I need him, and he'll do as I say!"
Forget about Franz!
"You love him, huh?"
Won't help me out?
- No.
- Say that again!
Let me go!
You don't like me anymore anyway.
I simply don't know what to do!
Yeah.
You good in the garden?
I think so.
Yes.
Yes.
Have you thought about...
Carrots?
Right!
I'll get that recorded.
Thank you.
How's it been anyway?
What the scenario didn't make you feel welcome?
He can't see the point in me.
There's a dog in the script.
"We don't even employ Jack Russel to write woof woof, do we?"
Just been readin' your work.
Umm...them could be better.
We should get some lunch.
I don't accept charm.
It's official business.
I've a proposal for you.
"When I'm not busy special advising, I work for a man called Gabriel Baker."
Remember him?
The Hungarian.
He's a producer.
Desperate to me.
A film that will make a difference.
"Hello, Tom."
Hello.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
- 17.
- 17?
"okay, you need to loosen up."
i had my first baby at 15.
drink now.
- but there are rules.
- rules-schmools.
it's a flipping party. look.
"- * veiled in flesh, the godhead see *"
- [hiccups]
- [snorts]
- that wasn't so bad!
[giggles] i kind of liked it.
"- well, breaking the rules is always better than not breaking the rules."
- mmm.
- * hark the herald angels sing
- hey!
what?
come here.
- oh!
yeah!
yeah!
oh!
"- you know, i don't remember jake being so romantic, 'cause i love to be romanced."
- are you loving my loving?
mm.
- but wait.
but do you have a condom?
- that ain't gonna happen twice.
- [scoffs] randy.
i should have known.
"- what about jake -- the father of your son, the guy whose room you're in?"
"Glug, glug."""
"""is this the kind of teacher you want at your school..."
"""one who instead of nurturing our children,"
"""uses mind games and intimidation?"
"""she would've made a fine..."
Nazi.
Maybe she...
Was.
"What do we really know about her?"""
"Oh, my god!"
What was I thinking?
How did this happen?
!
Sounds like beer happened.
I only had four!
You once picked a fight with your reflection after two.
Is there more?
"No, that's it."
"""sincerely, Frankie and Mike Heck."""
What?
!
You signed my name?
!
Why would you sign my name?
!
'cause this is your fault!
You got me all pumped up by supporting me!
That's what husbands do!
"Wives say they're gonna do stuff,"
And we listen and nod.
Right.
That's being supportive.
I see a light.
- You're not dying.
It's just your ankle.
"Oh, God!"
- You're supposed to help me!
- Watch where you're going!
- You ran into me!
- Haleh?
Where's the trauma?
"Throw a rock, honey."
Blunt chest in 2.
"You look wonderful, by the way."
- Eighty-five pounds and counting.
- Good for you.
You cut your hair?
"- BP's falling, 70 systolic."
- Keep squeezing that bag.
- Where are we?
- Flail and crepitus.
Needs a tube.
- Who has an angio cath?
- Right here.
How can I help?
"Given there's only one, I don't see how you can."
- What is that?
What are you doing?
- It's a tube to help him breathe.
"He has a collapsed lung, this will re-inflate it."
I need a thoracostomy tray.
"All right, let's see how much air he's got in here."
"Oh, God!"
"That any better, Mr. Chambers?"
Cool.
That I'm on the list.
"Well, I can't say I'm surprised."
You made my top ten.
Just squeaked in there.
"Well, I don't even know if I'm going to do it."
Why wouldn't you?
I have my reasons.
"So don't do it, then."
"So, you don't think I should do it?"
"Alex, are you asking my permission?"
No.
Why would I need to do that?
It's not like we're...
It was one date.
One motorcycle ride.
'Cause I'm really not the possessive type.
Good.
'Cause I'm not really... a possession.
Can I see you tonight?
"Yeah, I'd like that."
"Oh, no, not tonight."
I've got to prepare for a deposition.
Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow's tough.
- Working at the tavern?
"No, I, uh..."
I've kind of got a date.
Really?
Not a date date.
It's a blind date.
It was set up a week ago.
"She wants to work for me, because she needs money."
What for?
She has all she needs here!
"Just sit down, Franz."
You want something to drink?
Coffee?
Quick!
Come in and shut the door!
"No sleep last night, Franz?"
You need money?
I don't need money!
- Put the gun down!
What's going to happen now?
"You'll slaughter your family, or what?"
I don't want to show up in the newspaper like that!
"I said, I don't need money!"
Franz doesn't need money.
Does it work with the suit?
"Yes, the suit looks good."
I look old.
No.
I would say mature.
I'd like to ask you something.
The tie looks good on you.
If you think so.
There is still a problem.
It'll be fine.
Are you coming with me?
I don't think I'd make it through an evening like this.
You don't have to.
I know.
Just tonight.
I remember something like that.
"I like to poke Michael, because..."
You're so cute when you flinch.
When you recoil with horror.
"Poke, poke, poke."
- Here's some hotness.
- These guys are good.
- Sexy.
- Great chemistry.
"I don't know why, but these guys..."
"They, like, auditioned together, right?"
Norah!
Norah!
Norah!
"Oh, my God, Pete."
This is that crazy shot where they had like...
"They put the wall back, remember?"
"When it goes all the way around, someone was putting the wall back."
- Really?
"- Yeah, it was like a 3-D shot."
"- Oh, my gosh."
- This one was...
This was cake icing on my hand.
- It was?
- Yup.
- It looked like paint.
- Have a sweet dessert.
"- After this, you licked your fingers?"
- I licked that wall.
Check out Mike's performance here.
"Oh, well, there's a..."
What?
"Most of all, friends."
You don't sum up a man's life in one moment.
"There are no cold answers, are there?"
There's no simple yes or no.
A man's life is not the bricks.
It's the mortar.
It's the stuff that lays between.
The stuff--
The stuff you can't see.
I've known Walter my whole life.
God!
He's a decent man.
-He's a good man.
-But this is tough stuff.
This is body-bag stuff.
Tell me if there's some other way.
There isn't.
Die's been cast.
It was cast a long time ago.
Go easy.
Give him a blindfold and have mercy.
"Walter Stern was a tough man, but he was fair."
We give back the same.
No?
And you be careful.
Keep George with you.
Let him drive.
I gotta go in here.
I knew James Wakeley would surface...
... justasIknew when that bullet hit that boy...
... itwouldkeeptraveling.
And find its way... ?
I will kill you honourably at dawn tomorrow.
With any weapon you prefer.
You wish to fight me?
You have stolen my lady's affections.
- I wish the chance to avenge myself.
- GEORGE:
Mallefille!
No!
"Very well, monsieur."
I will give you the opportunity.
But not the prize.
Let's go back.
This is ridiculous.
"What, run for my hole like a rabbit?"
I could never respect myself afterwards.
"Nor could you, Aurora."
I'm going to fight at dawn for the right to see another dawn.
- Eugene.
- It's too late.
He's in love.
Monsieur.
Madame.
Welcome.
The doctor is here.
These are my seconds.
The sun is rising.
Shall we go?
Please.
I wonder...
Is there by any chance a cleaner one?
- Don't hurt him.
Aim at the clouds.
- Right!
And I want to buy it.
But I dont want to sell it.
Think about it!
I will give you whatever you ask for!
But I still wont agree!
Not even for 50?
Not even for 55!
60?
You dont understand!
"Look, I have told you."
70?
Who are you?
80?
Whats so special about this mansion?
I mean to say that..
90!
Wait a minute!
Wait!
If you want it so badly then I wont disappoint you!
I want to ask you one thing.
"But I hope you are not kidding, right?"
I dont do that!
"Then come with the money, I will get ready the documents!"
I have already prepared the documents!
Very good.
-You wiIIjust have to sign them!
My man is waiting outside with 90 lakh.
Just go and open the door!
Okay.
Wait a minute!
Dont hang up!
Have fun...
What else?
Loosen up.
Put the pen down.
I'm not going to test you on this.
Come on.
Teach me something.
Anything.
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.
"If a ball is thrown up into the air, and its height, H, equals 100 T..."
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Talk to me.
"If T is time in seconds, at what limit is the speed..."
You lost me.
What does that mean?
You have to put it in context.
"- Jazz it up, find some humor in it."
- Humor in calculus?
"- Well, try telling a story."
- A story?
"Once upon a time, there was a ball."
It was thrown into the air.
And its height...
Maybe I should just write books.
"No one understands those, either."
Just kidding.
- Don't give up.
Try it again.
- Tell you another story?
"- Hi, Professor Larkin."
What are you doing in my office with your butt in the air?
I was hoping for an injection.
Go to the waiting room.
This isn't an outpatient surgery!
They told me to wait here.
See?
Another example.
"This is an affront to Professor Ciotti,   and shows lack of respect for a person of his stature."
I'll report you to the Academic Senate and have you expelled.
"Cicchirini, calm down!"
And you... get out of here.
Out!
What about my injection?
You expect me to give you an injection?
Get out!
Out!
Motherfuckers...
- Did you do it?
- Me?
No.
Was it you?
"- No, no!"
Maybe it was him.
- I didn't do... it was him.
It wasn't me.
Who is it?
"""Who is it?"" That's for me to say!"
Who is it?
Am I disturbing you?
"No, no, my dear."
Come in.
You're never disturbing.
Gin is good.
Gin is good.
So... what's wrong with ya?
"I mean, other than the whole ""psycho chopped the baby out of your belly and ran"" thing."
Other than that?
Is... is there something other than that?
You tell me.
I'm just a chick with a drink.
No judgments.
Oh.
I get it.
You don't want to open up to me.
I know.
I'm not the touchy-feely type.
I got fired for being heartless.
Cooper apparently agrees.
Maybe he's right.
It's the baby.
He have 11 toes or something?
He's perfect.
He's absolutely perfect.
"He's the baby in the commercial, he's so perfect."
And I...
"I look at him, and I feel... nothing."
I can't... feel anything... ever since the...
"I mean, there's this pressure to be all ""mommy,"""
and I'm just...
I'm not.
I'm not ready or something.
I just...
I don't...
I don't want to deal with him.
- Yeah.
I loved that old house.
"- Yeah, I loved that place, too."
- I had my first kiss there.
"- Me, too."
"So what's going on, Jimmy?"
"I've just had a really bad year with the market and, it's disastrous, and it's going to be a struggle just to remain solvent for the next..."
How much do you need?
No.
It's... it's a lot of money.
It's too much.
Jimmy.
It's a hundred thousand dollars.
I'll call the bank.
No.
I can't.
I can.
I'll pay you back.
But it's going to take me a couple of months.
I know where you live.
This place is going to be perfect.
I hope so.
New contractors come tomorrow.
Better get the job finished.
New contractors.
Mm-hmm.
Sounds like a nightmare.
Pretty much.
You okay?
So the contractors start tomorrow.
Guess that means I'm gone.
One bus ticket to Austin. 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
I...
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
Then...
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
"That Japanese man- he's a shaman, like me."
Was the woman... wearing white?
Did you see her?
A young woman?
That's her.
I escaped because I played dead.
Played dead?
Yeah.
That wasn't my fault.
Get me?
Yeah.
Where'd you come from?
I've known this guy for six months.
What is that?
It's a good plan.
"I'm his crew, we go way back."
What about you?
I'm his sister.
"Okay, everyone stop."
"This is my lead, my research, my job."
You're out.
"No, wait."
Connor listen.
"Look, I'm begging you, okay."
I'm begging you to let me go.
"Look, the only reason Blair is here, the reason why we're in this mess, it's because of me."
"I didn't put her first, and now we've lost everything."
And I can't risk losing her too.
"I don't care about the plans, I don't care about the score."
I'm begging you.
Please let me come.
If I let you come...
I have ground rules.
"First, the cut remains the same."
You're not gettin' any extra money for coming along.
Totally fair.
Yeah.
Hold it!
"Ah, Mr. MacGyver, we've been expecting you."
You should know your partner here tried to kill us.
Cleeve!
Is this true?
Don't be naive.
Did you really think I'd leave them to follow us or call the police?
Good thinking.
We didn't come alone.
"Oh, come on."
You don't think I'm gonna fall for an old trick like that?
No!
"Yeah, sure, now who's side are you on?"
Yours.
Can we discuss it later?
"He's got a point, MacGyver."
Come on.
Which way?
The plane.
"Oh, MacGyver..."
"Uh, MacGyver."
There's something I've got to tell you.
Later.
Get in.
Um...
The window!
There's no key for the magneto switch.
That was what I was trying to tell you.
I removed it so they couldn't take off with the artifacts.
That's a great idea.
Where is it?
Out there.
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my fucking head!
"Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, okay?"
I just need to connect.
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!
"Oh, my God."
Where am I?
Who are you?
I can't stop it.
I don't know who I am.
So I...
So I need to go home.
The interface has data tendrils like roots.
They've dug in deeper than they're meant to.
"Threaded through your brain, taken over whole areas, I can't stop it."
"I can't remove it, and I can't stop it."
But I...
But I don't know who I am.
I don't know...
I don't know who I am.
I don't know who I am.
I don't know.
"On behalf of Saito Game Team, I most humbly apologize."
Who are you?
What have you done to me?
- What have you done to me?
"- Put him with the others, please."
"No, no, no, no!"
"No, no, no!"
"Captain howdy, do you think my mom's pretty?"
Captain howdy?
"Captain howdy, that isn't very nice."
"Well, maybe he's sleeping."
You think?
What--Regan...
Why are you reading that stuff?
Because I like it.
It's not even a good picture of you.
You look so mature.
I wouldn't talk.
You wouldn't talk?
"Well, I didn't have my makeup man there."
Let me take an eyelash off your face.
"No, I didn't get it."
What are we going to do on your birthday?
Isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?
What can we do?
I don't know.
What would you like to do?
Got any ideas?
Mm-mmm.
No?
Let me think.
Let me think.
What can we do?
We never finished seeing all the sights in Washington.
"We didn't get to the Lee mansion, lots of stuff."
Shall we go sightseeing...
If it's a nice day?
"Yeah, let's do that."
"And tomorrow night,"
The usual way.
Somebody pointed a gun at her and pulled the trigger .
Who?
It's complicated.
"Well, it all kind of makes sense now."
Why ?
You talked about her in you sleep some times.
I do ?
Yea.
Dreaming Flowers
Vi ?
"Yeah, man"
I can't wait until we get the dresses.
Things are going to change for us after that.
Oh hell yeah !
Do we need to chain it up?
Nah.
This'll do .
If you touch you DIE
Cool?
Cool.
This really is the last time I'm going to say this to you...
Okay ?
Or anything else.
I don't want you to send me anything anymore.
I don't...
I threw out the flowers.
You can't fix it!
And I'm really done with you.
"I don't want to talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone.
Please .
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Let's go.
"You really don't believe that we have met before, right?"
Not at all.
But this bloody thing...
believes in everything you say.
This understands that just to save my life you agreed to marry a joker.
I don't know about your past life.
But in this life...
I love you so much that I can handle ten such villains for you.
Look!
Look!
Look!
There's another one!
Lovejoy's love rain.
What happened?
Full moon?
What...?
- Let's go.
- Where?
Hurry up!
Where are you taking me?
"""A girl completely drenched."""
"""Sleepless in a sleepy night."""
"""She met a stranger."""
"""I am the one in the past."
"I am the one in the present."""
"""Tell me...."""
"""This is a fact!"""
Good evening.
"If your adventure trip is over, shall we leave?"
I can't tell.
"-Hey, where's Lenny?"
"-Right here, Woody."
"Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again."
"Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl."
What's going on?
"Nothing that concerns you spacemen, just us toys."
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
"That's why, Sid."
Sure is a hairy fellow.
"No, no, that's Scud, you idiot."
That is Sid.
-You mean that happy child?
-That ain't no happy child.
"He tortures toys, just for fun!"
"Well, then we've got to do something."
What are you doing?
Get down from there!
-I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
"-Yeah, sure."
You go ahead.
Melt him with your scary laser.
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it!
Hit the dirt!
Look out!
Yes!
He's gone!
He's history!
Why not?
is it problematic?
"Come on, Christine, we're both adults."
Herman is so...savage.
He doesn't beat you?
"No, in bed I mean."
What does he do?
He just pounds away.
And he comes at once.
"No wonder, that boy is crazy about you."
"Yes, but there's nothing in it for me."
Zilch!
Doesn't he repeat the exercise?
Falls right asleep.
Tough.
Perhaps I can help you.
How?
I'm psychic as you've noticed.
Get that boy down here.
I'll apply my gifts to see why he comes so quickly.
- l could possibly cure him.
- That would be wonderful.
"- Oh, but he's in Germany."
- l'll go and get him...tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Good girl!
Up and at it!
"You're lying on something sharp, look!"
Didn't you feel it?
"No, there's a numb spot on my back."
Strange...
Clean sheets?
I didn't come back to the house ever again.
I haven't seen her or the kids since then.
Thing is I don't exactly remember how that fight begun.
But that's not important.
You've been married and you'll underst...
-Careful!
Hey!
I found a big fridge full of food!
I told you!
Ramón keeps the house ready for everything.
It's downstairs.
Do you want to see it?
No.
What are we eating?
-Are you hungry?
No.
Do you like the house?
-Yeah.
Have you seen the soccer goal?
What are we going to do?
Nothing.
Goal!
It's your turn now.
Now you.
I did know that Clara would talk about us.
About our relationship.
About how was everything.
But I didn't expect what she said.
Did she talk about me?
You weren't the point.
-The point was you two.
"Yeah, us..."
She can't be.
She never goes out.
KNOCKING
Hiya!
How are you?
"Yeah, good."
"It's Melissa, isn't it?"
Yeah.
I'm Peggy.
This is Elaine.
I know.
OK if we come in for a sec?
"Yeah, sure."
You have the most incredible skin!
Have people told you that before?
Not really.
So pretty it glows.
Let's open that other bottle.
Where do you keep the corkscrew?
The drawer nearest the fridge.
"(If you don't want to do it, just say no.)"
CORK POPS
"Did I mention, this woman is a genius with a lens?"
PEGGY CHUCKLES
"She will make you look better than you have ever looked,"
I guarantee it.
"And if she can't, hell, everything we do is airbrushed, anyway."
I don't think...
I don't really...
We have a deadline.
And there's literally no-one else we can ask.
As a neighbour?
- Yes.
- Listen.
- Yes.
See that boy sitting there.
Yes Big Boss.
- Give one to him too.
- Yes.
I don't have money.
I didn't ask for it.
I'm as old as your father.
Take it as my blessings.
Here.
Take it son.
Hey boy.
Won't you thank the Big Boss?
Offering water to the thirsty is a good deed.
And you've earned a merit because of me.
So should I be thanking him or will he thank me?
I must admit.
He's no ordinary boy.
Because he talks about common sense.
I forgot Lallan.
Even a bag of rice has pebbles.
And you Dushyant.
Why don't you setup a cracker-shop?
Maybe you'll do good business?
You made a big mistake... taking up enmity with Dushyant.
No guns.
I'll hack you to pieces with this axe...
And all of North India... won't be able to put you back.
Hey boy let's go.
Stop.
This was a dream come true.
I'd landed a custom '66 Mustang.
There you go.
All right.
Thank you.
[ Engine turns over ] There you go.
I knew I had to go easy on her if I wanted a good tip.
But I had to take a shot.
How drunk are you?
[ Laughs ]
"Had a few, I'd say, at least."
[ Engine revs ]
"Oh, I will have you home in no time, my friend."
Done.
[ Laughs ]
"I don't want you to baby this thing, all right?"
You have nothing to worry about.
Seriously.
[ Both laugh ]
"Oh, that's sweet."
This was great.
"If I could just keep him happy and not wreck his car, a healthy tip would be in my future."
Don't baby that clutch.
Come on.
Give it a little gas.
[ Engine revs ]
[ Tires screech ]
Perfect.
[ Laughs ]
There's no way Rutledge was having this much fun.
You're the best driver that I have had yet.
Wood:
"Larry, Kim."
- It is so nice to meet you.
- Hi.
I did sort of a half get-up there.
"- For my niece, fake niece..."
- I should've done a full stand.
I think a full get-up would've...
It's the thought that counts.
"Listen,"
I hope...
"it's kind of weird, but I'd really love for you to take a look at my reel if you wouldn't mind."
"You know, I mean, I could take a look at it."
I'm not really...
I'm not doing TV right now.
"- That's fine, it's fine."
- How you doing?
I'm doing really well.
Thank you.
How are you?
- You look fabulous by the way.
"- Oh, why thank you."
"So Anna Nicole Smith, she's got uh... some pair of knockers on her, huh?"
"They're not real though, are they?"
Huh?
- Whoa.
- Hey.
What's all... what's all that?
Look at all his gifts.
I thought you said we weren't supposed to bring a present.
He said no gifts.
I don't get it.
- Hello.
What do you mean?
I just...
"I have a bad feeling about it, I, we need to find some rope with her."
"Blair, she's been kidnapped..."
I know.
She's probably traumatized.
"I know that, but she's been here for weeks, right?"
I'm pretty sure that's a fresh pedicure on her feet.
You're basing all of this on nail polish?
Yeah.
Did you get a good look?
Yeah.
I know.
I think so.
Maybe she got a gel pedi before she got kidnapped.
How do you know it?
"It doesn't matter, I just..."
"I think, I think maybe we should tie her up."
Tie her up?
Are you listening to yourself?
She's been tortured.
"No, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it.
Are you guys robbers?
"Sorry, Vivian, we..."
Who told you we were robbers?
Your leader.
He wasn't very good.
Connor.
I think it's my fault.
I think I took a wrong turn.
I don't know.
And now I'm starting all over again
There'll be sweat and hard work
The new Biberkopf holds his own
The old Biberkopf no longer exists
"The old Biberkopf is dead, dead, dead"
What do you take us for?
Find some other bar...
Mr. Biberkopf.
What's the problem?
The gentleman needs a new bar.
We're not classy enough.
- Get off the table.
- Says who?
Says me!
I'll pay for the glasses.
"Fine, but stop driving my customers away."
"Come on, Cilly."
I know the score here.
- Rotten dump!
- Let's go this way.
"- No, this way."
- Come on ― this way!
Why?
We'll go this way.
Let's go.
I'm going this way.
"Get against the wall, Franz!"
Who'll pay for our window?
Go see what's happening.
Go yourself.
And he calls himself a man!
"Fido, come here!"
"Let's see your fingers, prune girl."
"Talk to the hand, 'cause the face ain't gonna listen."
"He asked me to come up with something new, something fresh."
You read it.
It was good.
- Yes.
- It was the funniest script we've had all year!
"Yes, it was."
So what was their problem?
"Hey, I want to hear."
"Oh, yeah?"
"I want to sing opera, but I can't, so I don't."
That downstairs is...
"Well, your dad has a high-pressure job."
What's a high-pressure job?
"It's when you don't get to do what you want and when you do, you don't have time to do it."
Do spies have high-pressure jobs?
Only when they're caught.
I'm never caught.
You're right.
You never are.
"Oh, look, a ugly water bug!"
Hey!
Caught ya.
Here she is.
Night.
Good night.
Good night.
You want me to tuck you in?
Golly can do it.
"""'The time has come,' the Walrus said."
"""To talk of many things."""
A dual role?
!
No.
You will play a cook!
A cook even in films?
!
"There are songs, I hope?"
"You're going to the in-laws' place, not for a role."
Why send me there?
Will you have me released?
Not the cop-house!
My in-laws!
They need a cook.
Wow!
My head on the block?
!
But they're Brahmins!
"You must play a Hindu cook, although you're a Muslim!"
And cook what?
Biryani?
And paya?
Remove the meat from the rice and the dish turns vegetarian.
Don't worry.
"There's a woman working there, Aunt Laxmi."
She'll take care if you tell her you're my friend.
Folks there must be highly educated.
If I speak...
"Only if you speak, that is."
What does that mean?
Is Babu your name?
"What was that ""Ba"" and ""Bu""?"
"Not numerology, is it?"
It broke.
I don't know what happened.
"Oh, it's ok."
I'll fix it.
Unless you forget where you put it.
"Don't you worry, I'll find a perfectly safe place for it."
We're out of juice.
Norman.
Come on.
When are we getting our house back?
"Jess, come on."
I'm serious.
"Look, I feel bad enough about what my Dad did already."
Everybody's always giving Roman a raw deal.
He's my brother.
I'm not gonna do that.
I didn't mean it like that.
It's just...
I know you don't see it but...
He scares me.
And I don't trust him.
"Remember, I'm the one that caught him snooping in our bedroom."
"Come on, Jess."
He's not a bad person.
I plead his case.
I know exactly how bad he is.
I can't do this for another 18 months.
We need to get him into a halfway house.
Alright.
"As soon as we find a place, he's out of here."
Hello.
Hey.
You're right.
Poor Dori.
Dori!
He's running faster.
Great!
Dori.
Did you kick me?
"No, I was just running."
What's wrong?
I don't know what's happened.
It's weird.
What's the matter?
Are you in pain?
I think it's a muscle cramp.
Can't move at all.
Really?
You can't move?
No.
"Dori, come here."
"Oh no, what shall I do?"
It's very swollen.
The doctor really said you don't need to be looked at?
"Yeah, he's my relative so he wouldn't lie."
He said an unused muscle snapped.
We have unused muscles in our body?
I don't know.
Maybe it's like an appendix.
He says it'll be very painful only for a week.
Lucky I don't have to go to the hospital.
But shouldn't you see a doctor at least once?
Is talking on the phone enough?
Don't worry.
"Right now, I'd like to see the chain the dog"
Was wearing in the park.
Greta's leash?
Why?
Mm.
"Grasping at straws, I guess..."
Nothing for you to worry about.
"Well, OK."
Sure.
OTIS:
"How is she, Greta?"
AUDREY:
"Oh, fine."
Maybe a little more restless than usual.
[Snarling]
Here it is.
What's important about the leash?
"Oh, nothing probably."
"You know, I'm just checking on anything."
Do you have a headache?
Yeah.
"It's an occupational hazard at my age, I guess."
Probably a lot of sinus too.
There's a lot of dust in the air today.
"Well, let me get you some aspirin."
Oh.
"If you would, uh, think this will be better."
"If it's a little seltzer, if you'd dump it in a small glass"
"Of water, please."
Sure How about some coffee?
"Uh, no, no."
No thanks.
"We're on an island, all alone."
"Look, we appreciate the imagery and all that, but this is no time for existential metaphors."
No.
Really.
The pier's been washed out.
"Summer, you're okay !"
I am so glad to see you.
"Hey, where's Ryan ?"
He's...
Hey.
"Hey, Atwood."
I got to look for Pancakes.
"Oh, my God !"
Pancakes !
I'm gonna go with you.
Great.
"While you guys do that, Ryan and I will, uh..."
Go.
"Yeah, we're gonna go."
Where are you gonna go ?
"Yeah, we just got here."
"Well, we need supplies."
I have supplies.
"No, I know, but, uh, who knows how long those will last."
"Yeah, and there'll probably be a run, especially when the zombies come out."
Seth.
Ryan.
"Look, guys, we'll be fine."
"Just stay here, lock the doors and don't open them."
"Summer,"
Pancakes needs you right now.
Be careful.
Wow!
Add one goldfish.
"Oh, no!"
"For him, time has stopped."
Is it dead?
No.
Watch carefully.
"Now, he's in the future."
He leapt through the time he was frozen.
"No, that's not right."
"On TV, time machines go zoom..."
"Yeah, up and back between past and present."
Correct.
And that's what I'm studying.
"Follow me, please."
I'll show you an amazing trick.
I'm going to make this Pikachu disappear.
Wow!
What did you do?
It's gone.
We created a mini black hole ...at the micro level.
It's called a worm home.
Where'd the paper go?
"First, it became incredibly small."
"Then, crossed dimensions, ...and came out of another hole."
Where's the other worm hole?
Wanna see it?
What if he kidnaps us?
You've got your cell phone.
No service.
Isn't he a weirdo?
That's only what my Dad said.
They said it was on the floor.
I didn't understand.
Really.
Please try to forgive me and understand.
I'm just new here.
It's my first day.
If I'd known it was down there...
You sure you'll be OK?
I'm really very sorry.
Please try to forgive me.
"If you need anything, just call me."
Anything you want...
I'll be outside.
"Phil, when you get a chance, take a look at this article."
It has been a day!
Dr. Jones is a piece of work.
Had me running back and forth.
I can't wait to get out of here.
No.
I'm talking about the one right there.
No.
"Look over there, girl."
Stop.
He's all right with me.
He's cute.
Of course he's cute.
That's why I'm telling you to look.
"You having a problem there, Jessica?"
Yes.
"I put my money in there, and it keeps eating my money."
I can see through their clothes.
This is weird.
That's hilarious.
Get me some soup.
Yep.
Uh-oh.
"Thequestionis ,willthe  House pass the bill as amended?"
This is a 15-minute vote.
"Oh, my God."
My ass is killing me from that shot.
But I feel pretty good.
Really?
- Ma'am.
- What?
"Oh, boy."
Here we go.
It's like I want my baby to live.
I don't want my baby to die.
"Maybe think of it more of as a bill, which in a very real way is what it is."
- Mm.
- There's Pierce.
He even walks dumb.
"Every time I see him, I hear circus music."
"Come on, Owen."
"It's your time to shine, you dim fucking bulb."
- He voted no.
We lost the vote.
- Oh!
We are victorious in defeat.
We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing.
"Okay, so I lost the vote."
I won by not winning.
"God, I don't know how I feel."
"Apart from, like, having a raccoon take a shit in my head."
I owe a lot of money.
I can't pay him.
Pay who?
A loan shark.
Why?
Because I wanted to get my family out of here.
I didn't want my daughters in this town anymore.
You borrowed money for your daughters?
Stop...
What's wrong with you?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Two months ago I found a brick.
At the Point.
A brick of what?
Tobacco?
Heroin.
You know what that is?
How much did it weigh?
One kilo.
What did you do with it?
I sold it.
What did you do with the money?
I spent it.
On what?
The car outside.
Do you think that's why they killed your daughters?
I don't know.
They came here for their money.
"They took the washing machine, the fridge, the television..."
"If I don't pay, they'll take the car and the boat."
We'll have to move away.
I totally forgot to order it without peppers.
Yeah.
Even though I told you seconds before that I hated green peppers.
- My head still must be a little fuzzy.
- Must be.
So what kind of food does Bo like?
- Nothing special.
She seems like someone who'd like a good steak.
- Maybe.
- What's Bo's favourite restaurant?
We don't really eat out much.
...We..?
- Yeah.
"""We"" this, ""we"" that."
"You're pretty much right in there with Bo, huh?"
"Right by her side, day in, day out."
Yeah.
"You know, we're kind of a team."
Is that healthy?
"I mean, don't you want to branch out on your own one day so that both of you can flourish?"
- Yeah.
"You know, you're totally right."
I'm actually planning on going back to school and getting my law degree.
"Oh, law."
- That's so great.
- Yeah. it's so great.
- Gotta pee.
- Okay.
"Oh, jeez."
"On, shit."
"Oh, my God."
"On, God."
"The thing is, you don't know."
You don't know.
So stop saying that you know.
- Okay.
- [Knuckles Cracking]
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish... cruel, nasty people."
[Sighs]
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension.
Maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha...
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha.
- Gaad is not your friend.
- [Click]
"[Gaad] Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
[Men Laughing]
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
[Agent] Eew. 10 scotches and a bag over her head.
[Click]
Bastards.
I know.
I know.
[Crying]
Still want to take Barry's place?
"- Get out of here, Barry."
- I'll go get a teacher.
You want to go?
"I'm not gonna fight you, Dirk."
Why not?
You chicken?
Come on!
No.
Get up!
Get up!
- Come on!
Get up!
"- Hey, get back!"
Get back.
That is enough.
"So long, Barry Cook."
You all right?
Barry was my friend.
I just burned his bones.
"Well, he's at peace now, Sam."
"I mean, if dad had let us stay just a little while longer, maybe I chould have helped the kid, you know?"
You read the coroner's report same as me.
Barry was on every anxiety drug and antidepressant known to man.
School was hell for that kid.
His parents had split up.
He just wanted out.
"It was tragic, but it's not your fault."
"To tell you the truth,"
I'm glad we got out of that town.
I hated that school.
It wasn't all bad.
It's...
L.A. You can wear whatever you want.
"Ok, I'll just grab my purse."
I'll get your heels.
"Well, hello to you, too."
Thought you said you had...
a meeting to go to.
What?
"You said you had... a meeting, remember when I texted you... earlier?"
"Oh, yeah."
"I did, but uh, but I'm done now."
"Oh, great."
"Hallie, what's up?"
What's going on?
What's going on?
I think I should be asking you that question.
Excuse me?
"What is going on, Dale?"
"Uh, nothing."
"Look, I'm just-"
"I'm, did I miss something here?"
Wait.
Do you like him now?
Is that it?
"Look, I'm just gonna leave."
All right?
Of course you are.
"Zach, you're a piece of crap you know that?"
You're just another famous asshole guy who thinks he can screw around with any girl he wants and then not call them.
Well... fuck you!
"We're not... even dating, Hallie."
I've told you that 10... times.
"If anyone asks, say we're looking for treasure."
Imagine I ask you:
"- ""What are they here for?"""
- Treasure.
It could mean trouble.
Not at all.
What a beautiful village!
"Yes, it's very beautiful."
You've hidden it well.
We haven't hidden it!
The ancestors built it here.
It was them then!
They built it like this so no one would steal it.
"Tell me, why do you think they built it here?"
Because I wasn't there.
You weren't here before then?
Did you arrive recently?
I think the car has a problem.
It's stalling.
It struggles on hills.
The gauge isn't working.
"Yes, it has a problem."
"Farzad, get out."
- ls there water here?
"- Yes, over there."
"Get out, guys, and check the car."
Try to find out what's wrong.
Has your car broken down?
Our car?
It's given up the ghost.
Meaning?
It can't go on.
I slipped on banana peel in alley way comin' back.
Let's go see about those dresses.
How are you girls holding up?
Fine.
Fine.
We're out of bullets again tho.
Why don't you use one of those guy's guns?
They seem to have plenty.
Why the hell didn't I think of that?
These guys got everything Daze!
Even a little Glock for your purse.
You know the blue one?
It's like Christmas!
I got you...
Sucker!
Take your pick mister.
Why don't you decide?
"Okay, let's see..."
"I'm gonna go with the .38, Daze."
"Alright, are you ready mister?"
Sure.
Okay.
Here goes nothin'.
Hardy har har.
What?
Are you done yet?
Come again?
"I said ""Are you done yet?"""
What are you talking about?
"You weren't serious you're gonna do it, were you?"
I most certainly was.
With that piece?
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling isn't mutual.
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.
- He's been causing me a lot oftrouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.
- Don't bother.
- No need.
- Please be careful.
"- Take care,Jenny."
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.
"Jeffrey, take care ofyour friend, meanwhile."
"Make yourselfat home, Dumbo."
"I am, Mickey Mouse."
"Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage?"
He paid me a thousand bucks to keep you talking.
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am I?
Lets wait and see.
You're always the loser.
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.
Let's put your preparations to the test.
- Are you always so determined?
"- Yes, that's my style."
Mine too.
So we have something in common.
New York City.
"Relatives, you know."
Yeah.
"Well, you have a good time, anyway."
- Yes.
Is that my cheque?
- That is your cheque.
- Good.
"- Thanks, Saul."
- Shalom.
- Have a good time.
- I wonder how long he's been planning that.
- I don't know.
You heard him.
"Lena's been planning, he's been postponing."
"Hey, my new tux is in here."
He didn't even mention it. it's not on the bill either.
She must've really been anxious to get on that vacation.
I'm goin' that way.
"Come with me, pay him and we'll say goodbye to Lena."
"OK, that's a good idea."
- Here.
This'll keep you honest.
- Mac.
Will they keep the shop open while they're on vacation?
They might have someone part time to take orders.
Out of business?
"Hey, brahda."
Bet you'd like a ride to Diamond Head.
Ten bucks round trip.
Ten bucks?
"No, thanks."
That hasn't changed.
You don't lose a steady hand.
"Except, back then it was control."
Now it's rheumatism.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're in the oldest part of Amsterdam."
We're driving past the oldest buildings.
We're now going to sex theatre Casa Rosso.
We wish you a very good time.
Can we help?
"-That's nice of you, thank you."
I'm killing myself dragging my husband around.
He insisted on going on a holiday.
And it had to be Holland.
Wanted to see the old mother country?
Niels!
-Ab!
Wout!
He recognizes us!
-Of course.
Thank you very much.
Does your husband still enjoy a sex club?
He thinks it's beautiful.
He can't move well anymore.
He's had a stroke.
"But his brain's still working, isn't it?"
My sweetheart.
"Miss, help me, please."
Miss!
Shoot.
Shoot me.
Kill me.
Please.

What are you thinking?
"You know, Gul."
Jaipur will be lonely without you.
And you?
I have become lonely.
It's very late.
I have to go home now.
Can't you cancel it?
What?
Going home?
Mumbai.
"- No way, Karan."
Mumbai is my dream city.
And you know Pia has found such a nice job for me.
I can't lose this opportunity.
And you can lose me.
"Karan, path is meant to take travellers to their destination."
And not to stop them.
Understood?
I am just a path for you?
You are not my destination too.
"Fine, Gul."
"You will meet me once before you leave, won't you?"
Of course.
Go to sleep.
Your daughter has returned.
Ask her where she was the whole night.
Her friends had thrown a bash.
Farewell party.
And so are we.
You are so explaining this to me.
"Hey, baby."
"If this bar were a meat market, you'd be the prime rib."
"Oh, god."
"You reek of cannabis, Bender."
Cannabis?
"Hey Maxine, you've got something on your chest - my eyes!"
Go away.
It's never going to happen.
"Hey, are you like a parking ticket or something?"
"Cuz you've got ""fine"" written all over you."
I have a headache.
You can stand here but don't talk to me.
"Look, you look a lot like my next girlfriend, you know what I'm saying?"
"Oh, my god."
How long does this go on before you actually quit?
I never quit.
That's one thing that you're gonna learn about me.
I never quit.
Never.
Fuck it.
[BENDER] Fuck what?
Fuck it - let's do it.
What?
Where we going?
We're gonna go to your place.
We're gonna go- we're gonna go to my place?
Mm-hmm.
Sweet.
- Now.
"- Oh, now."
"Oh, mate."
That'll be a little surprise package I've arranged for us this evening.
"Without wanting to give the game completely away, they're twins, from Macedonia and..."
.. they don't have keys.
You - out.
"Laters, bro."
- Mr Douglas.
- Calum.
"- Oh, no."
- John Mercer!
I'm not staying here.
Where was it you shared the cell?
"Pentonville, wasn't it?"
- I'm not staying here.
The lad's an idiot.
- That's a bit harsh.
"Granted, he's no Stephen Hawking."
"- John, mate, don't be like that."
"- Don't ""John, mate"" me, please."
- I'm not staying here.
- You don't want to live with him?
Fine.
Get rid of him.
- John!
- What are you doing?
This way you get the flat to yourself.
"John, mate, please, I've changed a lot since then."
"I'm sorry about that deodorant, mate."
"Just tell him you'll stay with me, please."
John!
Please!
Don't...
"What's this, then?"
It's not mine.
Isn't this your handwriting?
"I said, it's not mine."
You know anything about a Japanese man living in the village?
You're dripping water all over the place.
Answer me.
Do you know him or not?
Did you meet him?
Answer me.
You're scaring her.
Get out for a sec.
"Come on, this is serious."
It's you and me.
Daddy is a policeman.
I'll know if you lie.
Did you meet this man?
Tell me.
Tell you what?
Everything.
"Where you met, what you did."
Why should I tell you?
Because it's important.
What's so important?
"Answer me, girl!"
"I said, what's so important?"
What's so damn important?
What the hell is so damned important?
You don't even know what's important.
"Stop grilling me, goddamn it!"
Fuck!
What are you doing?
It's all yours.
Delicious.
It's so delicious...
So delicious.
It really is delicious.
Sorry.
Welcome.
"Please press the button to select your room, then receive your key at the front desk."
Resting or staying overnight?
Overnight.
"Overnight is 14,000 yen, plus day fee of 5,800 yen."
Really?
That's the rule.
So expensive.
200 yen is your change.
"The girl's no good, she's not sexy and she's loose down there."
"Seriously, and she mentioned her dad is a cop, too."
Don't tell me you fell for her sob stories.
Where are you?
The bathroom.
Bet she's already stolen your stuff and left.
What?
First time?
Never done this?
Not for this reason.
No one here.
"Oh, an employee."
"""What are you doing here?"""
Not throwing it?
"Well, I just bought this phone."
Tired?
Hey there.
He just got out of intensive care.
"We should probably go visit the man, considering it's kind of our fault that he's in there."
"Man, would you quit saying that?"
It is not our fault.
You know what?
You're right.
It's your fault.
Hike.
Go long!
Come on.
I got a cannon over here.
"Further, further!"
Oh.
Ooh.
"Usually, I'm a big fan of physical comedy."
Pratfalls and what not.
Yeah.
When I heard that crunch...
"- Actually, it was still kind of funny."
- Yeah.
"Look, you know what?"
"We'll go visit him, give him a balloon, draw penises all over his cast."
He'll smile.
We'll be in the clear.
"Hey, Aaron."
You okay?
I'm not really sure.
"Well, he should be more than okay because he had lunch with..."
Liza Blue.
Liza Blue?
The porn star?
"Okay, first of all, that's not her real name."
There is some problem.
Where are you going?
To have a smoke.
Pia.
"- Yes, sir."
Where is Gul?
- She must be around in the office.
Where is Adi?
He has gone for a smoke.
- Gone for a smoke.
Alright.
Thanks.
Adi.
- Hi.
What do you think?
By when will Umbrella Creations' designs be ready?
"It will take another three-four days, sir."
The workload is very heavy.
Gul is there to help you.
She must have also prepared some designs.
I have thrown her sketches in the dustbin.
She is new.
She will learn gradually.
We should close Flora Enterprises and start a fashion institute.
Along with Gul everybody else will also learn.
Hold it.
Hold it there.
Just stop kidding.
"If she is not talented, sack her."
Throw her out.
You know we are short of time.
It is better you do this job.
How's that working out for you?
"Yeah, what a shocker."
Right.
"Next, I need you to, uh, take your shirt off, please."
Open up there.
"Yeah, those."
Plug the jacks in there.
"Yeah, in there."
"So, your name's Henry and... okay, well, the good news is that you're gonna live a while."
"The bad news is that in this case, a while means 20, 30 minutes tops, Henry."
"Unless you're very, very lucky... which you are."
Uncle Jimmy is gonna take you to his lab.
Hang on.
"Ah, shit."
We got bacon on our tail.
Unplug yourself.
Put that away.
There's some clothes in there.
Put the hoodie on.
Shit.
There's not enough time.
Fuck it.
Just cover the blood up with your bag.
"Just stay calm and let me handle this, yeah?"
That's how it goes...
Bollocks.
"Fucking Akan, paying off the..."
"I'm gonna have to hurt you, Henry, but it's for your own good, mate."
Just give me your arm...
Hey!
Shit!
It's me!
Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
- No.
I am good.
"I know your speciality, Gul."
"You are handling Umbrella Creations' account, aren't you?"
"Yes, Mr. Bajaj."
There is one thing common between us.
A hunger for success.
I can sense that about you.
I see the same hunger in you.
"You want to be very, very successful."
Nothing wrong with that.
The only difference is you work too hard.
I have a philosophy.
Party hard.
And work smart.
For instance this waiter.
How many hours does he work?
10?
12?
14?
"I mean, I don't know."
How much money does he earn?
Look at me.
I work for three to four hours.
And both of us know how much money I earn.
That's why I have an offer for you.
Join my company.
Get my company Umbrella Creations' contract.
"Salary, whatever you want."
A dream house.
Right.
Right.

When's that?

"Um, yeah, that would be fine."
"Um, yeah, that would be fine."
OK.
"Hey, listen, can I give you a call back?"
OK.
"Hey, listen, can I give you a call back?"
"Alright, see ya."
Yes.
Just a little shaken.
"Well, that's understandable."
"Don't worry, I got all the ones in the mall."
You're safe for now.
Ugh.
Blue looking for someone?
"Well, someone's found you."
[grunts]
Yah!
Ugh! Hello?
Is anyone here?
Are those things gone?
I thought they were going to get us.
You're safe.
I took care of them.
But now I need you to help take care of the school.
Look for any other kids that might be hiding.
We've all got to look out for each other now.
Stay strong.
You guys can do this. [grunting and groaning]
"Oh boy, oh boy."
It's good to see you.
I was so worried.
Are you all right?
Ugh.
We're fine.
"We tried calling you, but the armada must have knocked out all communications."
[grunting] [both] Huh?
Oh.
It's so good to see you guys.
"Likewise, buddy."
Sure.
"- Hello, Ed."
How are you?
Why haven't you called me up?
Why...
Uh...
Our phone's out of order.
"- Well, you could have come to see me."
- No.
"No, I couldn't."
"You see, the girl I'm engaged to wouldn't like it."
So long.
"Say, was he trying to insult me?"
"Oh, no worry about that."
It's nothing.
You know the old saying:
"""Is just as many good fish in the ocean as there ever was. """
Fish in the ocean.
"There she is, boy."
Give her the gun.
"Yeah, what's the hurry?"
"Well, they told us to step on it."
You know what Joe says.
They got enough orders to paper this shop.
Oh.
Dombrowski said.
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
- That's the fourth drill you've burnt up.
"- Well, what's it to you?"
Dombrowski's trying to sweat a record out of us.
"Listen, Frank, get down to work and quit knocking Joe."
Let her down.
Let him go.
Husband...!
Who are you and what do you want?
"I'm a local salt cooker named Pan-dong, sir."
And?
I came to give you an important information.
Could I possibly get my tax reduced in return?
What?
Is this a joke?
!
"No, no!"
You'll have a big problem in your hands unless something is done!
A big problem?
"Sir, are you all right?"
Thanks.
Be careful.
Arrest this man!
What is the meaning of this!
Let go!
We know what you've been going around doing.
I have done nothing wrong!
We'll find out once we get to the government canter.
Take him away!
Let go!
Let go of me!
Chun-su!
Something terrible has happened!
They arrested Soon-shin!
Pardon?
They might hurt him if we don't do something!
It's all right.
He's a noble.
- Mwah!
Oh!
Mwah!
[Chuckles] Wait till I tell the ladies.
"- Okay, noon."
Noon.
"- Oh, ladies?"
Ladies!
What the hell?
What's that about?
I just wanna give them what we have.
What we have is 500 miles to drive.
"Yeah, but we came and we disrupted their lives, and I just feel like we owe them something."
"Yeah, we actually do..."
$230 for a night's stay.
Or how about you can support me on this?
I think it's disgusting.
Whoa!
What?
The two of them together is just gross!
It should be illegal!
"All right, I'm done with this."
- Come with me.
"- Dad, help me on this!"
"I'm not gonna help you, you little bigot."
Let me show you something.
See that crazy old man right there?
- He comes here every day...
- Hey!
To protest the love in this house.
"Yeah, and he's right."
Certain people just don't belong together.
Baber's story checked out.
You guys are free to go.
"Huh, technically, I'm supposed to say that."
Yeah.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
You can tell them about the fertilizer.
"Well, it turns out Baber, being the frugal shopper that he is, bought the cheap stuff,"
So what you have couldn't even blow up a dollhouse. [ They laugh. ]
Uh-huh!
"Could not blow up a dollhouse, could I?"
- Challenge accepted!
- No!
No!
No!
That's not what he meant!
Thanks for letting us go.
And for not waterboarding us or making us stare at the moon.
- O...
K.
- OK!
"Let's go, you guys"
I'll buy you an ice-cream sundae for your troubles.
"Oh, no!"
"Sweetie, I'm fine!"
"Yes, absolutely, I'm fine."
They dropped the charges.
"Well, there really were no charges, so I'm a free man!"
What?
"Oh, that's great!"
That's great news!
Amaar!
We got from now on to celebrate.
"- I'm not hungry, Mrs. Grogan."
- You've got to eat.
All you had for lunch was a can of tomatoes.
Go on and eat.
"- Oh, don't worry."
I'll be over this tomorrow.
- You will if you stay home tonight.
- Yeah.
"- Never mind, I'll get it."
Hello?
Oh.
"Just a moment, please."
"Ed, it's for you."
Mrs. Danvers.
"- Thanks, Betty."
"- You're welcome, I'm sure."
Hello?
"Hello, Eddie."
"Oh, I'm fine."
I just wanted to find out how you were.
Huh?
"Oh, gee, that's too bad."
"Say, it must have been the gin chasers."
It couldn't have been the beer.
"Oh, I just called up to tell you I'm not mad about what you said last night."
No.
"Well, you know, about our not having any more dates."
"No, I've forgiven you already."
Uh-huh.
I couldn't stay mad at a swell guy like you.
"Well, that's fine."
"Because I should feel terrible, and I don't."
"And you're right, it does feel good to say that."
Dam... broken!
Go-to guy!
"Hey, girls!"
I did it.
I broke this dude's dam.
"Hey, I'm going to bed."
"Okay, I love you."
You can sleep outside if it makes you feel more comfortable.
"Oh, and make sure to close the window so the alarm sets."
I got it.
See?
Go team!
"Uh, or you can just keep it open, in case there's a fire, so you can just throw me out of it."
I love you.
Ugh.
"Oh, balls."
"Oh, my God, a squirrel!"
Aah!
"Okay, calm down."
I...
I can't.
You know I hate rats.
"Okay, it's just a squirrel."
"No, no, squirrels are just sexy rats."
Everybody knows that.
"I think it touched my leg, ugh."
Where is it?
"I don't know, I don't know, all I feel is a squirrel touch, ugh."
"Okay, it's fine, all right?"
"It is much more scared of us than we are of it, all right?"
- Lucy...
- Yes?
"Lucy, I..."
"I don't know what you're expecting tonight, but I..."
I...
I think you should know that...
"Mama, I do know."
"Goodbye, Mother."
"Goodbye, Daddy."
Bye.
"Billy, you missed your tea."
"And you, Faber."
Have something at the pub.
- Thanks.
I'll just have a wash.
- See you there.
"- Freddy, can I come?"
- I don't know about that.
- You in the army yet?
- Tell him about that miracle cream.
"Oh, yeah."
Will you tell Mrs Garden I'll be late?
My mate Harry's got this cream that takes all the pimples off...
"Mr Faber, I've kept a nice piece of meat pie warm for you."
- We mustn't let that go to waste.
"- Not with this rationing, we mustn't."
I'll be down in a minute.
"24 hours isn't very long for a honeymoon, is it?"
We can start right now.
There's a bottle of bubbly down there.
So there is.
- There we are.
I meant the other Mario.
I've abandoned him to his fate.
- He behaved very badly.
Did you send him the bill?
- I don't think now's the time.
"Do you think, they'll condemn him, Sir?"
- It depends on who defends him.
If it gets into the hands of any old pettifogger..
- He's toast!
"Poor Mario, he was so nice!"
- Isolina!
"Noble Ophelia, get thee to a nunnery!"
"No thank you, Sir."
I don't smoke!
"- Oh, sorry."
"- Excuse me, sister."
These clients are serious.
- Yeah?
- They have a ton of money.
They have the fuel.
- Praise God..
May he always be praised.
- Always!
"Bye, Dad."
- We must go now.
"Yes, sister."
"Be strong, Isolina."
"Blessed sister, you don't know what it's like to have two husbands."
"Be brave, daughter."
You'll see that you too will find peace here.
I have great need of it.
PRISON
That's how I ended...
That's how I ended up here.
My God.
That's why I'm here.
He was right.
Who was right?
You saw Leek.
- He was part of the warning.
- What?
He was part of the warning.
"Stop, stop, stop."
I didn't want to scare you.
He said...
He said the messages are real.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
"Connie, please."
We have to leave here now.
I will not live my life like that.
I will not make decisions based on messages from Indrid Cold.
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.
"Okay, I'm going to Charleston."
I'll be at the Marriott.Get yourself reassigned.
I don't want you anywhere near the plant today.
What if nothing happens?
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?
- That's not the point.
"- Well, I think it is the point."
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!
I know.
Leave Ringo alone.
Who the hell are you?
Let her go.
"Wait, you're him?"
Ringo...
You really are beautiful.
Mister...
You're Casshern!
No doubt about it!
They say the Ruin will stop if we eat you.
"Well, that story's too dumb for me to believe."
"But, I understand why some would want to believe it."
I've never seen a body as brand new as yours.
"But I'll never get to see it again, once I smash you--"
What are you...?
!
Mister...
S-Stop!
Don't.
I don't... wanna... die...
Ohji...
Stay away.
I don't believe my eyes.
Crying in sadness as you bid farewell.
"I thought it, but now I've seen your true colors myself."
Your ability to kill like that is impressive.
Yours is the lowest form of existence!
It always has been.
Do you know my past?
Enough to know that I want to kill you.
Tell me.
What am I?
I need you to come to Emperor Land.
Bring as many of your kind as you can.
BRYAN:
Why?
- To dance.
You know...
[ALL SNICKERING]
"Now, why would I wanna do that?"
- To free the penguin nation.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- There's been a catastrophe.
- Right.
The entire population is trapped.
BRYAN:
Uh-huh.
MUMBLE:
By huge walls of ice and snow.
Hey!
Bryan!
"Look, I'd love to help you, sport, but you've come at the worst possible time."
"Maybe after winter or something, okay?"
"No, that's too late."
Way too late.
Bryan!
You gonna fight or what?
You said you owe me one.
"But right now, I got problems of me own."
"Everyone's cranky, looking for biff."
The multitudes need me to keep the peace.
"If you don't come now, multitudes will die."
Here we go.
You saying it's my fault now?
(HORSE WHINNYING)
PORTHOS:
What's wrong?
Wait.
- (WHINNYING)
- Look at the horses.
- I don't see anything.
- Me neither.
- Did you see that?
- No.
Opposite roof.
"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
- Shh!
PORTHOS:
"Not the wine, not the wine!"
(GUNSHOTS)
"Well, that answers that."
How many do you reckon we got?
I'm not sure but I think we can assume it's more than two.
PORTHOS:
Yeah.
- My ammunition's out there.
"- Yeah, mine too."
- How much have you got?
- Not enough.
(GRUNTS)
"When you were, uh, searching before, you didn't happen to..."
No.
"No other entrances or exits, and there's no way we're getting through these windows."
"Of course not, because that would be to our advantage."
Okay.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Thank you.
This is good stuff.
Real good stuff.
Why are you driving me nuts?
Know how much I cried waiting for you?
You did?
I'm sorry.
Know how hard it was for me?
I was crying on the porch because of you.
Let me ask you something.
Please be honest.
Please.
"That night, when I was outside, what were you doing in the room?"
I'm getting sick of this.
It's that again?
I don't know.
Don't know anything anymore.
"Joongrae, don't lie to me."
"Please, don't lie."
Do whatever you want.
What did I do so wrong to deserve this?
What did I do?
I'm sick of it all.
"What's wrong with you, Moonsook?"
That's not important.
Somebody walked over me.
"You two walked over me, huh?"
"When I was outside, you two walked over me."
"I thought I was dreaming, but it was real."
I don't believe this.
"Walk over me, did you?"
How dare you?
What?
What?
"Ah Eiji, sorry to keep you waiting."
That Echizen sure is slow.
Get someone to bring him here.
Why don't you go?
Why me?
"Damn late, Echizen!"
"Ah, my apologies."
You see we are not open for business today.
"Ah, dozo."
Sorry about it.
- Come back tomorrow.
- But they're eating...
But they're eating...
"No, no, no."
That is just a minor incident.
Don't worry about it.
Carry on.
It is okay.
It's okay.
- Taka-san.
- Yes?
Good accuracy.
What about Higaki?
Don't worry.
There's a reason to make Higaki lose.
To control him better.
If this carries on it might lead to the damage of your whole body.
Rest for a year without playing tennis.
Concentrate on your therapy.

No.
You're not wearing pantyhose.
It's hot.
Take them off.
No.
Ridiculous.
I'm so sorry.
"Oh, my god."
Where have you been?
"We just wanted to make sure everything was set up, you know, perfectly at the reception and the dinner, and it's great."
Wow.
You look amazing.
You look like a princess.
What's wrong?
Don't cry.
"It's just, I've dreamed about this day my whole life."
Since my first communion.
Is that weird?
"No, hon."
We've all been dreaming about our own weddings.
Now that I'm here this doesn't feel right.
Everything will work out as it... should.
The future kind of has a funny way of doing that.
You just have to wait and see how it all unfolds.
Deep breath.
Yeah.
Take a deep breath.
Hey.
Wait.
Picture.
No.
No pictures.
Shit.
All the cameras are down.
Audio's on a separate file.
- Yeah.
- Pull it up.
Here.
Nothing.
What time was that?
- One hour ago.
- Earlier.
Fuck you!
Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
Go back further.
We just gotta hold out a couple of hours till Emerson gets here and then I hope...
- Quiet!
- Get off of me!
- Where is she?
- Fuck you!
You go get her.
Tell her to come out.
Tell her to come out right now!
Take a fucking seat!
We know you have to open the door from the inside.
Can you get her to do that for us?
It'll be a lot easier.
Fuck you.
I need to get inside the broadcast room.
I need the girl to open the door.
I need her to take care of some numbers for me.
Now this is something only she can do.
And I'm kinda on a tight schedule.
They didn't know about the change in schedule.
"Yeah, true."
Might as well.
How'd it go with the sponsors?
Not well.
They love you.
They just don't think it's a great fit.
What did they say?
They weren't impressed with your last fight.
"I told them you were sick, but the real issue is the stuff with your dad."
Ryan.
"What the fuck am I supposed to do about that, Lisa?"
I already went to fucking prison.
I know.
I think it's just getting people to understand what you've been through.
It's none of their fucking business.
That's personal.
I don't want to talk about that.
Maybe there's a way to do it that doesn't suck.
Let me think about it.
All right.
[Indistinct chatter]
Alvey:
Yes?
[Door opens]
Mario Goldsmith's here.
"Oh, yeah, send him in."
- The poison pen.
"- How are you, Alvey?"
I'm great.
I'm great.
Have a seat.

We're just going in there to pick up some documents.
Fine.
- And make out a little.
- Works for me.
Surprise!
"Scott, this is everybody."
"Everybody, you all know Scott-- the enemy."
Molly... you did all this for me?
We're cleared here.
Surveillance had them all going inside 45 minutes ago.
- Did anyone bail out on the perimeter?
"- No, ma'am."
All secure out here.
"Boss, this isn't a meth lab."
So why an escape tunnel?
Need to take a look at this.
Hotchner.
When?
Did they raise the terror alert?
"No, that's probably best."
"All right, get everybody in now."
I'll be there in a minute.
What's going on?
Nothing.
I just have to go to the office.
"It's 6:15, and you're talking about a terror alert?"
"It's bad, isn't it?"
I don't know yet.
Please don't lie to me.
It might be.
I may not be home tonight.
"I mean,"
- I might be home late.
- I know.
Shoot.
I forgot.
Tomorrow is the day we... scheduled to take Jack
- to have his pictures taken.
- Don't worry about it.
- I'll reschedule.
It was a brand-new cigar.
You stay here.
"If you notice something odd, whistle."
Whistle?
Don't you get it?
I gotta get out of here!
- Shut up!
- I gotta get out!
- Who is that?
That isn't one of our cars!
- Another car!
Someone ratted us out!
- Seems to be the police.
- Police?
"Get out, rat!"
He's not gonna rat us out again.
- He has learned his lesson.
- I told you he's gonna cause trouble!
"What was that, Karl?"
"A big bump, even for such a bad road."
I can't see anything.
- Who is there?
- Just open up!
Took longer than usual.
Where is Franz?
- What is she doing here?
- She even wanted to call the cops.
You caused us a lot of trouble with your man Biberkopf.
- What happened to Franz?
- They snatched him.
Who?
That can't be true!
Higaki!
Careful not to get hurt.
The match will start in a short while.
We are currently preparing the court lightings.
"Everyone, please be patient."

You still don't know how I play?
Stand up!
Is he trying to break his leg?
Ku'so.
Echizen.
Echizen!
Fight!
Oi!
You guys are noisy.
You alright?
Show some respect!
Oi!
Shut up!
Let's go.
What is it?
Don't be too bothered about what the doctor said.
Don't force yourself to talk.
"Those words will come naturally, okay."
Our dead parents will want that.
If it's about money you don't have to worry.
Ku'so!
There are many better players in the country.
Try playing with them.
Experience it yourself.
You'll... be the pillar of Seigaku.
Father?
I don't understand.
you're...
You're his son?
"If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old."

There's another one of those things out there.
Look what it did to Zaddik.
I say we go after it now!
No one's going anywhere.
We'll handle this.
Stay calm.
How is he?
"I've given him something for the pain, but his injuries are too severe."
He's not going to make it.
This can't be happening.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame Ellia.
It was my idea.
"You... have to understand... that when I found her,"
I'd just lost my own wife and son to a fever.
"She was just lying there, helpless."
"When I saw her, I knew what I had to do."
"As I told you, in the beginning, she survived on food and water like any young girl."
xxx
No.
No!
It's all right.
Take what you need.
I can't.
"Yes, you can."
"Oh, thank you, dear."
"Yes, I'll be right over."
Of course.
Goodbye.
What did you find out?
Cause of death?
Drowning.
Her lungs contained water.
But it's hard to tell.
"Cardiac risk occurred about the same time,"
Caused by electrocution.
Signs of struggle?
None.
"She was burned somewhat, but that's"
Consistent with electrocution.
Was it an accident?
"Well, I don't know yet."
"Just, uh, let me know if you find anything, Doc."
Anything at all.
"Well, there was something else."
Maybe not much.
There were a couple of hair in her hand.
Looked like animal hair.
Get those to the lab.
"And, Cliff, I want that report fast."
I'll do my best.
Thanks.
"Come on, Greta."
[Door creaks]
[Ominous voices echoing]

"How you doing back there, Sam?"
"Not good, Mike."
We think he was out too long.
"Okay, clear."
Yeah.
"Come on, buddy."
"Come on, buddy!"
Clear.
"Come on, Schmidt!"
"Come on, man!"
Wake up!
Wake up!
Oh!
There we go!
There we go!
"He's back, Mike!"
We got it!
"J-j-Jabbar -- Jabbar, is he --"
Don't you worry about him.
We're wrapping his sorry ass up right now.
Was I -- was I dead?
!
You really want to know?
No.
"No, I'm good."
I'm good.
"But...just a little -- yeah, you were a little dead."
You were dead.

You know anything about a Japanese man living in the village?
You're dripping water all over the place.
Answer me.
Do you know him or not?
Did you meet him?
Answer me.
You're scaring her.
Get out for a sec.
"Come on, this is serious."
It's you and me.
Daddy is a policeman.
I'll know if you lie.
Did you meet this man?
Tell me.
Tell you what?
Everything.
"Where you met, what you did."
Why should I tell you?
Because it's important.
What's so important?
"Answer me, girl!"
"I said, what's so important?"
What's so damn important?
What the hell... is so damned important?
You don't even know what's important.
"Stop grilling me, goddamn it!"
Fuck!

I thought you were sleeping.

Yanking up your daughter's skirt in the middle of the night?

"Here, sit."
Sit down.
"When did, uh -- when did Dirk pass?"
He was 18.
What happened to him?
"Well, there was, first, drinking, then drugs, and then too many drugs."
And then he just slipped through my fingers.
It was my fault.
"I should have seen it coming, you know?"
"Dirk, he, uh -- well, he had his troubles."
What kind of troubles?
And I'll get you away from here.
"No, no, francis."
There's something else that you must do.
"Everything I did, I did for you."
You needn't remind me.
I need you to forget all of it.
What?
Everything I warned you of.
The warnings I gave mary.
"Go to her, tell her that I believe"
The two of you can be wed.
I don't understand.
Your fate has changed.
"Oh, what does it matter?"
You never believed
That nostradamus had the power
To see the future anyway.
What matters is that you love mary.
I did love mary.
You destroyed that.
Nonsense.
"She's with bash now, but she loves you."
You don't know that.
I don't know that.
What matters is what you want.
Is it mary?
Is it to save my life?
Is it the throne of France?
Is it the safety of your brothers?
"Say it, say it!"
I know it's true!
Yes.
About sebastian?
He awaits you in your throne room.
Brother?
Francis.
I'm going to tell you something.
And it will hurt.
I know you're here to elope with mary.
You don't need to.
"All that nonsense about the prophecy,"
It's gone now.
My mother's let it go
For reasons she can explain.
I'm going to tell mary.
"She'll talk to my mother, to nostradamus."
She'll be convinced.
She won't trust catherine.
I don't trust catherine.
"You don't want things to change, to revert."
You're going to play on mary's fear.
She came to me willingly.
And she will stay with me.
She turned to you because she had to.
It was only a marriage of convenience.
And what was yours?
It went beyond that.
You know it.
And now you know
"Ours did, too."
You're lying.
You entitled son of a bitch.
You.
You're nothing.
Nothing!
Be careful who you get your information from.
- That guy is out for blood.
- Let me go.
It was an accident.
And it wasn't me.
It was my partner.
I didn't even draw my weapon.
"If you killed someone, I'd cover for you too."
Is that wrong?
Let's go to Marina's house.
"No, how could he be the father?"
He's 87 years old!
"Tell them I'll do anything, I don't care."
- Hello?
- It's me.
"Hi, Marina."
I wanted to know what's happening with Malaga.
When will they call me?
"Look, there was a problem with your contract."
They're not hiring anyone until next year.
Talk to them.
"Tell them I'll do anything, I don't care."
I have to get out of here.
I can't take it anymore.
Let's meet.
At the usual spot in half an hour.
She called this number.
It's the hunting lodge.
It's okay.
Coming!
Who is it?
"Carter, there's no way I can get my hands"
On that much cash in an hour.
Not as a private citizen.
There's nobody in the government you can ask?
No one who'd even entertain it.
"And in any case, the request would go into the system and alert the leak."
"Okay, okay."
I have an idea.
I'll get back to you.
Carter?
Hey.
So you can change.
Or I could get you something else if you want.
"- No, thanks."
- All right.
"Isaac, um... is everything all right?"
You seem...
I don't know.
It's been a rough year.

"You can always get out, you know."
Yeah.
"Look, I got a deal about to go down with some Dominicans."
Right?
They're gonna move my product on the north side.
That'll put me back on top.
I'll be a'ight.
Yeah.

"She's fine, like I said she'd be."
"What, you called to talk to her?"

# I want to be the man you hoped I'd be
# To find my place amongst the crowd
# To see your face
# And know
# You're proud of me. #

Was Baker not on your tram?
"No, sir."
That'll do it.
Here they come.
"Purcell, boys."
Too early for Humperdinck.
"Sorry, I'm not sure where I should stand for the microphone."
Probably best if I conduct.
"Get a chair for Miss Riall out of the way, Lionel."
Right you are.
Should I just warm them up?
"Oh, I don't think we need bother with that."
"Round about this tempo, boys."
Once through for luck.
"I didn't get the chance to ask, are we all here?"
Apart from Baker.
Baker?
But he was so excited about it.
Did he send a message?
No.
Just didn't turn up.
So he's out.
"Well, I'm very disappointed."
I had great hopes of Baker.
Aren't you disappointed?
Claire's...
Claire's dead.
"Now, will you take that soup and get out of here."
I can't take anymore today.
"Look, all I meant was you..."
Will you just get out of here!
Sir...
And stay out!
"Sir, he didn't mean any harm, if you'll forgive me for saying so, sir."
"I sometimes have a silly effect on people, you know what I mean?"
"Just being a police lieutenant, you know."
"At least, I hope that's why."
"Yes, I'm sure it is."
"Your friend, sir."
He was just trying to be nice.
(SIGHS)
What?
Oh.
Him.
"No, no."
He wasrt trying to be nice.
He was trying to fix me up with an alibi.
Then it wasrt true?
"What, Lieutenant?"
I...
Excuse me.
I keep swimming in and out of myself.
"Well, you know, that's what happens, sir."
It's kind of like being in shock.
"Maybe you ought to sit down for a minute, sir."
I am not in shock.
I don't need to sit down.
Teaching me.
Here it is madam 42 it'll be perfectly fit.
"Dad, listen to me."
Brother.
"Not 42, give size 40."
42 will be perfectly fine.
"Brother I said not 42, give size 40."
What are you saying?
How do you know?
It's my size.
Do you know better or me?
I can tell the size of bra by looking at the blouse.
You know my nature.
Her husband even ask me for her size.
150 please.
Here.
Give me a bag.
What's the bag for?
You're going to wear it anyway.
"Dad, You'll have to leave for Pondi."
There you'll have to meet our designer who's worked on our valentines collection.
Actually I've seen the designs on the internet.
You just need to go and make an agreement with her.
Okay I'll go.
Don't you worry.
And if you like the design give her 100000.
She need it.
Okay.
What her name?
"Shut up, Not yours."
Leave the bra.
Speak.
- Cat?
- Mm-mm.
- Bird?
- Mm-mm.
- Wolf?
- Mm.
"Guinea pig, sidewinder, what?"
Just a cat.
Just a cat?
You never talk about your patients that way.
"What, you have to put one down?"
No.
I wasn't going to tell you.
- Tell me what?
- You promise you won't get mad?
About a cat?
Why would I get mad about a cat?
"It was Adalind's cat, and I know that you don't like her, and she knows that too."
She didn't even want me to tell you.
Let me see that.
"Nick, what's the matter with you?"
Take it easy.
How long ago did this happen?
"Today, just before lunch."
"Baby, I get scratches all the time."
Not like this you don't.
- You don't understand.
"- Yeah, I don't understand."
You're getting all worked up about nothing.
You don't know her like I do.
Okay?
"You know, you said that once before."
- lt's okay.
"But look, I landed it right?"
That's all that matters.
I don't think so.
- l don't think that's all that matters.
- Say what you mean.
I'm proud of you.
I'm glad you landed the account...
- and you're fired.
- What?
You're fired because I love you... because I don't want to lose you.
"No, no, Patty, it's okay, I can fix my responsibilities."
"I know, but you're not happy, you're not."
You're...
Something has to change.
- What will we do?
I mean...
- l don't know.
- What will I do?
I don't even...
- l don't know what you're going to do.
I guess you're finally going to figure it out.
"- You know that girl, Angela Chase?"
- That redheaded girl?
Yes.
Some redhead.
It's out of a bottle.
- Anyway. is she avoiding us?
- l think she is.
I think we make her physically ill or something.
I thinks so because...
Angela.
Don't you notice the smell?
I can't stand it.
What a terrible experience!
It smells like something died!
"Haven't you noticed it, too?"
"Yes, but there are several tanneries around here."
- Tanneries?
- Tanneries.
"If they're tanning hides, it's the skin from the ass."
- A tough one!
"- Stop, I can't stand this stench."
Stop!
I think it's coming from that guy in the back!
- Are you going to leave me like this?
- Wimp!
"Dear God, it's not fair."
A dog!
"Quiet, I'm Dr. Cicchirini!"
See that?
I'm getting better.
You look like a fisherman at a taco stand.
"- Now, watch this."
- Not bad for a beginner.
In the corner pocket.
"It's up to you, Benito."
"Come on, cheer up!"
"Come on, play."
- Let's see what he can do.
- Now you'll find out.
"- What are you doing, Benito?"
-What's wrong?
Guys...
Maybe later.
"What do we got, McGee?"
"How about you, Agent Gibbs?"
When was the last time you made a good snow angel?
'Cause it's... it's snowing.
McGee.
NTAS just issued an alert:
possible terrorist chatter.
They pick up chatter all the time.
Subject is northeast U.S. airports.
"Attention, passengers-- due to extreme weather conditions..."
Oop.
Sorry.
Uh...
"Oh, hey."
You again.
"Look, about before, uh, my husband has quite the chivalrous streak."
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, now that I've run into you again... do we know each other?"
I feel like we've met before.
Yeah.
I don't think so.
Has that ever happened to you?
"You see a face, you just can't place it?"
"Not really, no."
Oh.
"Delays are a drag, huh?"
Where you headed?
Home to see family?
Paris.
Business.
"Ah, Paris."
"Yeah, I missed you in sixth period."
"Yeah, I kind of skipped."
You can get your jaw off the floor now.
He's got you skipping school?
"Lucas, talk to me when you get your tattoo removed."
Alright.
Lucas!
What are you doing?
I'm taking care of my little girl.
You are such a trouble maker.
"Daddy stop it, come on."
Don't.
Stop.
"Hey, sit down, Rake Boy."
Hey.
I'm never gonna live that one down.
Probably not.
"It's okay, he can be way worse."
What have you got there?
- You're reading Faulkner in school now?
"- No, I just love his stuff."
So what did you do last night?
I saw you with Peyton.
What are you talking about?
You two just looked pretty friendly.
"Well, that's because we're friends."
And what are we?
"Well, I thought that we were dating."
"Well, it looked more like you were dating Peyton."
How messed up is that?
Brooke!
What was that about?
"No, we're not!"
This is totally legit.
"For all this guy knows, we could be mega-minted poshos in disguise."
It would be a superb disguise.
Cheers.
"Take us to the bed section, my good man."
I want to try one of them.
Mm-hm.
Security!
Agh.
This chair is like a torture device.
I've asked Flavia for one with back support so many times.
At least you get a chair.
I have to stand still all day.
Think you could stand a bit stiller?
Hard to score if you're jiggling.
I don't want you to score!
Come on!
Getting balls in your jug is the only fun part of my day.
Stop it!
Calm down.
I don't want them in my jug.
"Open your mouth, then."
Give him something to aim at.
I don't want your balls in my mouth!
"It might shut you up for once, water boy."
Sorry.
He's been trying to get balls in my jug all day.
I don't care.
Paper balls.
Stop talking.
Water man.
By your command.
Master.
"What is it, lord Tyranus?"
I have done as you've asked.
Asajj Ventress is dead.
"Once again, you've proven your loyalty to me."
You took quite a beating there.
"Didn't you, missy?"
Which side of the battle was you on?
"Not too talkative, are you?"
Take me to Dathomir.
"Now, why would anyone want to go there?"
Ain't nothing there but fog and witches.
Exactly.
We don't like strangers.
I'm not a stranger.
Prepare to die.
Stop.
She is one of us.
Take her to the village.
- Who is she?
- What is she doing here?
Mother...
Talzin.
Bring the water of life.
"At last, you have returned, and you are safe again."
I remember the day we were forced to give you up... to protect the clan.
Your sacrifice has never been forgotten.
Master.
"Master, where are you?"
Master.
They've killed you.
- Me?
- And then he literally zipped his lips and threw away the key.
What's he gonna tell you?
"What, am I a fortune teller?"
You gonna put him in a room with me?
"Stripped, bound, and shackled."
"I told him nobody would be listening, but I was lying."
Man of the hour.
Who's speaking?
You have zero idea what he wants to tell you?
Invite me to Ruby's talent show?
Where are you?
"Market, crossing Geary."
DeBray's in the car ahead of me with Sarneau.
"All right, I'll see you in 30 seconds."
I'm headed out the door.
"If you want to shoot me in the back, my spinal column starts right here."
Get an ambulance!
"Stand back, sir."
"Hey, hey!"
What did you have to tell me?
They stopped looking for... ffor me.
Who did?
Who?
They didn't keep looking...
Who didn't keep looking?
The whole world's looking for you.
Who?
Hey!
Hey!
He...
"He took mine, so I..."
"Well, yeah."
"Okay, don't start doodling my name on your binder, okay?"
I just mean...
"I mean, I like you the way I like basset hounds."
Something pathetic about them.
You just wanna cheer them up.
Again with the sensitivity.
To sensitivity.
[HAMMERING]
It looks good.
JAVIER:
Yeah.
JANINE:
Yeah.
- He does good work.
"- Yeah, he does."
JANINE:
Very nice.
Very nice.
- Javier?
- Yeah.
Javier if I asked you an honest question do you think you could give me an honest answer?
- I think so.
"- Good, good."
Because I think some of your guys might be smoking.
Javier?
- Is that the question?
- Yes.
- Seemed like a statement.
- The question part's implied.
I really didn't hear it in the inflection.
Javier have you guys been smoking or not?
Private.

How many wars have you been through?
- My share.
- It should be me.
You?
You haven't fought in a battle.
This is about us getting home to our loved ones.
Why would you...
I have no loved ones.
"If I fail, you can still go on."
It's me.
I'm going and I'm not going to fail.
You're new here.
It's about getting back to Henry.
I don't care what I have to face.
You're not gonna argue with me?
Would it do any good?
No.
You got anything in that bag that's gonna help me with a giant?

Powder made from poppies.
He has to inhale it.

How strong is it?
The most powerful blade in all the realms.
Is it strong enough to cut through that beanstalk?
Indeed.
I set the thing up already for tomorrow.
"What do you mean, tomorrow?"
Connor offered.
It's a vacation home-
- Connor?
The reason why I have two strikes is because your brother is incompetent.
He's reckless.
"All right, he can't read."
Hey.
I looked over the plans and they look good.
Okay?
Easy.
All right.
"Okay, after this, it's our last one."
This time for real.
Our last one.
I should have listened to you.
"We should have stopped a long time ago, but I kept..."
Ollie!
What?
He won't work with you again.
We're doing this job without you.
Shit.
"All right, let's go over this again."
All right.
7:00 AM we leave from here.
8:30 we arrive at the house.
I back the van all the way up to the front.
"8:35, you pick the lock, and open the side door."
Okay.
"Blair keeps the van running', and you and me load up."
Good job.
"Jenny, can't talk now."
I'm in trouble with your dad and it is a lot worse than all of the other times.
I'm going to have to be off the grid for a little while.

"He's not done something stupid, has he?"
"Oh, god!"

"Jenny, that's brilliant!"
I'm so pleased for you!

"Yeah, of course."

"I want to go straight, but it's too hard."
Guys like me never get a break.
I'm going for a drive in the country with Karl.
I'm tired of doing nothing.
We've got some accounts to settle in Weissensee.
Ede and Biberkopf have to go along.
- You're taking Franz?
- Yeah.
When will you be back?
Tonight at the earliest.
All right.
"Hello, young lady."
My friend Biberkopf sent me with a message.
He'll be home late tonight.
He asked you to come by?
Not exactly.
I just thought I'd come over and patch things up from last night.
- What do you really want?
- I told you!
"And there's nothing wrong with calling on a pretty girl, is there?"
"I thought, ""It's a beautiful day."
"Let's drive out into the country."""
Of course I am.
I'm fine.
"Hey, Mom."
Mom.
"Hey, Mom."
What?
I'm trying to sleep.
"Uh, I was just making sure you're alive."
"I'm sorry, sweetie, it was a late night."
My head is throbbing.
"Yeah, um, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home."
I'm sure the neighbors would appreciate it.
It wasn't a party.
It was one guy.
Don't be so judgy.
"Yeah, well, I talked to Roberta at the Grill."
And there's still a bartending position open if you wanted to get a job.
"Well, I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I worked there."
I think she's desperate.
I'll check it out.
- Yeah?
- Don't act so surprised.
I just...
I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around.
"- Well, there is back rent due."
"- There's back everything, Mom."
"Like I said, I'll check it out."
- Who's that?
- It's Caroline.
Easy.
Yeah.
Come in.
I'm only asking you to do it so that you can have the success you deserve.
Every bit of it.
Blake Carrington's a very smart man.
He'd know the difference.
Not if you control yourself.
Just joking.
"Now, don't be upset."
I thought you loved me.
"I'm sorry, it was-"
It was only an idea.
Bad idea.
You're right.
Sleeping with him is too risky.
"Anyway, I want you for myself."
Believe that.
Oh.
L.B.
What are you doing here?
"It's the man's birthday today, and that kiss was his present."
That damned kid.
He follows me everywhere.
What if he tells somebody about what he just saw?
"That is a problem, isn't it?"
"Well, why don't you just see to it that he doesn't?"
Mother.
Welcome home.
Adam.
Mm.
I can't tell you how proud I am of you.
And happy to be working together again?
Yes.
"Oh, what have we here?"
- What's she want?
"- She wants to see me, Damon."
Alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting.
We don't know why or what she wants.
You don't have to see her if you don't want to.
- I don't really have a choice.
- She's threatening to go on a killing spree.
Oh.
I take it that's not okay with you guys?
ELENA:
I wanna do it.
I wanna meet her.
"If I don't, I know I'll regret it."
Thanks.
Can you hear me?
Thanks for coming.
I'm nervous.
But I'm happy that you're here.
I love you.
[MOUTHS] I love you.
"Hello, Elena."
You look just like her.
It's eerie.
- You've met Katherine?
ISOBEL:
She found me after I turned.
"Genetic curiosity, I suppose."
She would be fascinated by you.
Is that how you can walk in the day?
Katherine helped me obtain it.
- Who's my father?
- Not important.
Couldn't you put your foot down?
Forbid the banns?
Something like that?
"When the parson says, ""Speak now or forever hold your peace""... couldn't you give him a roar, sir?"
You know what I mean?
Higginbotham will replace him.
Dismissed.
"- Tommy, I've got you back again."
- And I've got you.
"I'm here to stay, forever and ever."
Forever and ever.
That's horrible.
- She's charmed him like a snake.
- The siren.
Wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes.
"Me, neither."
I can't stand it.
"Me, too."
Left!
Right!
Center!
As you were!
"Company, attention!"
Right turn!
Two paces forward.
March!
"Head up, chin in."
Get those thumbs behind the seams of your trousers...
Get them back.
Lower that left shoulder an eighth of an inch.
That's much better.
"Otherwise you're looking very regimental, Din."
"Hell, that's some vocabulary you got, kid."
Spite.
"Ill will, vengeance."
"Vengeance means revenge, Miller."
"I'm sure you know what revenge means, don't you?"
I'm onto you Miller.
"Despite your stupid jokes, you secretly blame me for the accident."
"New car, or not, you despise me for it."
How did you get into my place?
Duplicate keys?
Credit card?
What?
"Fuck you, Miller!"
This shit's gonna stop!
"Get off my property, punk!"

Shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
7-4... 3-C-R-N.

What?
Shit.
Fuck!
"I'm sorry sir, but we don't provide... motorist information to the general public."
I'm not just a member of the general public.
This guy is a friend of mine.
But you don't know your friend's address?
"We just met, I don't know him that well."
"Sir, this is the DMV, not the dating service."
I just want talk to him.
So you come along for her friend.
See?
I knew it.
I knew it.
What the fuck is wrong with that?
When is it?
Tomorrow night.
I'm meeting Tuddy.
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.
Why do you always do this?
Don't give me that shit.
What did I ask you for?
A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.
I'm trying to bang this broad.
Help me out.
I don't understand you.
She's beautiful!
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.
You with your fucking mouth!
I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00 and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.
Did you have enough to eat?
It was delicious.
I'm just watching my diet.
Let me watch your figure.
I couldn't wait to go.
I was ordering dessert when they were eating dinner.
I was asking for the check.
What time is it?
It's almost fucking 10 o'clock.
How's it going?
"Well, we haven't got a shot off yet."
This is exciting.
The script is exciting.
I loved it.
"-Oh, I'm glad you liked it."
I loved it.
I thought it was so funny.
It's so funny.
So you liked the script?
"You think it's as good as ""Shakespeare in Love""?"
"Oh, much better."
"When you're not busy, could me and him talk to you?"
Sure.
Because he has something pretty big going on.
"-Oh, yeah?"
-Yeah.
Pretty big?
"Well, I ought to hear about it right now."
He wants to make a movie?
Yeah?
He's making a book right now.
Uh-huh.
And he has his own characters and everything.
And he wanted to know if he could make a movie out of it.
Why not?
"Just keep-- you have to have, like, a script or something."
You got to get some money.
You have to raise money.
You need money to make a movie.
"Yeah, yeah, my heart breaks for you."
Hey.
I'm Barry.
Sam.
...of your most memorable family experience.
A reminder though.
This is gonna be worth half of your final grade.
Leave him alone.
I'm going for a record.
"I said, ""leave him alone."""
You want to take his place midget?
Yeah.
Sure.
"Ok, everybody, got any questions?"
"All right, let's get started."
"Today, you will have the honor of playing one of the greatest games ever invented."
"A game of skill, agility, cunning."
A game with one simple rule.
Dodge.
Sorry.
"Uh, substitute coach Roth."
Yes?
Ms. Boudreaux never let us play dodge ball.
"Well, Ms. B's in Massachusetts getting married, so we're playing."
She says it's dangerous.
Take a lap!
But...
Go nuts.
Having fun?
The whistle makes me their god.
Right.
Nice shorts.
Really?
I don't know.
I think the truth kind of gets you in trouble.
You know what you should do?
Find your dad one of those nice women that we saw in town.
Nice women don't understand him.
I don't even understand him.
"He spends all of his time wading around in mud, cataloging plants."
Good night.
Use the can if you need anything.
Can?
Looks like a boob.
"Hello, V?"
V.
"V, this is Frank."
From the can.
This is V.
My dad thinks you look like Grace Kelly.
Good night.
"Good night, Frank."
"I'm telling you, she slept in the tree house last night."
You're so full of shit.
"Oh, my God-- a ""C."""
My dad is going to kill me.
"What's wrong with a ""C""?"
Her car broke down in front of my house.
She had to stay.
She's there right now.
"She's going to tell on us, I know."
She's not there.
I bet you a zillion billion dollars that you are full of shit.
You're on.
"I don't know about you, but I'm starved."
"I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse."
"This place, it's probably on the menu."
[woman laughs]
Come on.
"Hey, what's the joke here?"
Are you hungry enough to eat a horse?
"Uh, you bet."
"This place, it's probably on the menu."
"Well, we'll work on it."
"I'll tell you, Billy, the red chili's the best thing they have here."
When you eat it you feel like you're out on the range eating' off a chuck wagon.
"I want a hamburger, fries, and a Coke."
"Howdy, folks."
Hi.
- Having a good trip?
- Yep.
"I'm Hal, I'll be your waiter."
Yeah.
"And, uh, have you decided what you'd like?"
"Uh, not quite."
"Well, take your time."
We got nothing but time in the off-season.
Billy?
"Billy, bet I know what you'd like."
[coughs]
"You'd like a burger, French fries, and a Coke."
Yeah.
[whispers] Yeah.
That's right.
- And I guess we'll have the chili?
- Yep.
You can do anything you put your mind to.
What would you have done if I wasn't here?
"- You don't like to talk much, do you?"
"- You don't have that problem, do you?"
No.
"No, I talk all the time."
I'm a flibbertigibbet.
"That's what my English teacher, Mrs Wilson, calls me."
"""Tillie Hansen, you are a flibbertigibbet."""
Sounds like a noise a chicken would make.
Mrs Wilson kinda looks like a chicken.
- How come you ain't screaming?
- I am.
You just can't hear me.
"- All right, that's enough."
- One more stitch.
- Don't argue with me.
- One more stitch.
Just tie that off.
Pull it through.
Tie it right there.
Jeez!
All right.
"Here, get..."
Just put that on.
- Here.
- All right.
That's it.
"Come on, easy!"
Do it tight.
"What was that you were saying before to yourself, ""You're one of a kind""?"
I sometimes hear my mother talking to me.
Please accept... to pay them all this morning.
Good!
And so it shall be.
"Get behind me, sons of Fakoli."
You deserve a tribute...
O worthy son of your father.
What about the house?
"The sand's been delivered, the other materials are on their way."
Noumouké has promised it by the end of the month.
"Hurry up,"
German and French experts are coming.
Don't worry.
Hurry up!
Where's Diarra?
He's been arrested.
For lack of papers.
And where is he now?
I don't know.
What's the problem?
One of my workers has been arrested.
And I don't know why.
What's his name?
1000 FM to set him free.
I need him free.
You'll get an ID card.
"Thank you, brother."
"Come on, Diarraké."
Nobody's taking my son away!
I am!
"Then, I'll pursue you forever!"
What's going on?
"This witch is after me every day, we're going home to solve the problem."
Did you hear me?
- Einar?
- Yes.
- Second row.
- Thanks.
Here you go.
"Come, let's go inside."
"Sunday, February 20th 1944"
Thanks for last night.
Thank you.
"Remember, you can come visit me as often as you like."
"It's not that far, and I can come get you."
No choice?
We could sink the ship out on the sea!
- Not according to the British.
- I don't believe them.
"- Well, tell them."
- That's what you should do!
"I did, but it turned out this way."
Taking the lives of 50 innocent people.
You have to stop it.
The bomb is already onboard.
The ferry departed several minutes ago.
- You went for the ferry all along.
- That's not true.
Of course...
Then you'll be done with all this shit  and you can finally go back to Norway.
- Two coffees.
What do you want?
- Juice.
- Good morning.
- 39 barrels down.
Where are the shovels?
It's Karen Hill. I want to talk to you.
Hello?
Don't hang up on me!
I want to talk to you!
"You keep away from my husband, you hear me?"
Open the door!
Answer me!
"I'm gonna tell everyone who walks in this building that in 2R, Rossi, you are nothing but a whore!"
Is this the superintendent?
"Yes, I want you to know sir, that you have a whore living in 2R!"
"Rossi, Janice Rossi."
Do you hear me?
He's my husband!
Get your own goddamn man!
"Wake up, Henry."
What are you doing?
"Karen, what are you, crazy?"
"Yeah, I""m crazy."
And I'm crazy enough to kill the both of you.
"Karen, take it easy."
Do you love her?
Do you?
I love you.
You know I love you.
You don't.
"No, you don't."
"Be careful, baby."
Don't.
How could I hurt him?
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.
The truth was that no matter how bad I felt I was still very attracted to him.
How many Tiles belong?
112.
"You got it, sweetheart."
- Just tell me when.
- Fantastic!
You'll come for dinner before?
- I'll make a brisket.
- I love brisket.
Get home safe.
"Well, I'm taking a cab anyway."
Thanks again.
"Hello, Larry."
"- I got to see you, Frank."
"- Well, here I am."
How about a cup of coffee?
"No, thanks."
We got to talk.
Are you finished here?
"Well, the business of government is never finished."
"Come on, let's take a walk."
Mister A!
"How are you, Milton?"
I'm as corny as Kansas in August
I'm as normal as blueberry pie
No more a smart little girl With no heart
I have found me a wonderful guy
"Speaking of blueberry pies bring us a couple, Milton."
"You, à la mode?"
"No, thank you."
I don't want any pie.
Apple for him.
"And coffee, Milt."
"Wait, don't!"
"Please, don't!"
"Are you gonna talk, Joe?"
"Ok, start giving the kid a workout."
Oww!
"Please, don't!"
Shut up!
Cut it out!
Ok!
Will you talk now?
Ok.
I'll tell you.
Anybody still live in my old Westchester home?
"No, it's closed up."
"Well, out by the swimming pool is a great big..."
"This is the last stop, Joe."
What?
Come on!
"We're saying good-bye, papa."
"The kid, too?"
"Sure, with our love and kisses."
"He must be hotter than a firecracker now,"
And we got enough hot stuff as it is.
"Yeah, you can get to know the kid better!"
Then maybe all 4 of you can live together!
"How are you ducking bullets, Joe?"
"Yeah, the feds will be shooting at you from all sides!"
Thanks for the bus fare!
They ain't getting away with a thing.
That dough ain't going to be theirs for long.
Was there much?
The box looked real full.
Maybe because of this.
"Oh, my God."
Do you think -- I do.
What are we going to do?
Relax.
I'll take care of it.
Just get rid of the evidence.
[ Sighs ]
"Okay, I'm no health nut, but that... is just wrong."
"All right, talk."
This isn't what you think.
I'm not a killer.
"Well, then, what are you?"
I'm a Pishtaco.
A fish taco?
A Pishtaco.
"It means ""Peruvian fat sucker""."
Never heard of it.
"So, what, you're like vamps with a sweet tooth for cellulite?"
Vampires kill.
We're just...
Parasites.
"Oh, well, in that case --"
"Look, I would never hurt anybody!"
"Okay, this -- this is why Larry and I started Canyon Valley."
"We could help people lose weight, and I could feed."
It was a win-win.
"Yeah, except for the two you dysoned to death."
That wasn't me.
"Well, then who was it?"
Alonso.
The dude from the cafeteria?
I know you told Serena you love me.
Serena heard wrong.
Last year you told Nate.
This year you told Serena.
You tell everyone but me.
Why can't you tell me?
Is gossip girl right about you being a coward?
That's not true and you know it.
Gossip girl can be right about you all she wants
But I won't let her be right about me.
I will not be weak anymore.
You can't run.
You have to stay here and hear it this time.
Chuck Bass...
I love you.
I love you so much...
It consumes me.
I love you...
And I know you love me too.
Tell me you love me
Then everything we've done--
All the gossip and the lies
And the hurt
Will have been for something.
Tell me it was for something.
Maybe it was.
But it's not anymore.
Oh my gosh.
Do you remember the casbah?
That concert?
Barely...
In the best way.
Ha ha!
Captain Kirk.
"You must try harder, Captain."
This is too easy.
Enterprise...
"Enterprise, can you hear me?"
"Touche, Captain."
Touche.
"I must confess you scored first, but after all, I never played this game before."
And now let's have at it again!
Ha ha ha!
Enterprise...
Enterprise...
Aha!
Tallyho!
Aha...
"You made a noble fight of it, Captain."
"Remember, you promised to let my ship go."
But this is such sport.
I must fetch all the others back to play.
So this is victory.
It has a sweet taste.
"Down, Captain-- on your knees!"
"You haven't won, Trelane."
I could run you through!
But you haven't won anything.
"On your knees, Captain!"
No!
Does it still taste as sweet?
I order you.
You've been beaten!
But I'm not defeated.
Come on.
I wanna have a talk with you.
Doesn't that make you feel proud and dignified?
"Oh, boy."
"Hey, that's a honey of a dashboard too."
"Strictly airplane type, Mr. Taylor."
"- Yeah, airplane, huh?"
- Mm-hm.
- Good-looking cigarette lighter.
- Yes.
- Does it work?
"- Sure, it works."
Try it.
You get 18 miles on a gallon with this car.
That ought to mean a lot to a man in your circumstances.
- Oh!
"Yeah, heh, it works all right."
- Sure it works.
You get more for your dollar than in any car in this country.
- You'll want delivery.
- I won't know till tonight.
- I'm getting a new job and a raise.
- Congratulations.
I wouldn't wanna sign till they tell me.
I'd hate to see you wait too long.
This is the only light-colored phaeton.
Tell you what.
You got my number.
Give me a buzz.
- Be glad to.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
That's why I wanted to retire.
Sorry.
"No, I'm sorry."
"I'm so sorry, Blair."
"Look, I shouldn't a..."
I shouldn't have pushed us to do all those jobs.
I shouldn't have gone back into that fucking house.
I should have put you first.
Hello friends!
Are we having fun yet?
"Listen, this is what's gonna happen, all right."
"They're gonna come in, I'm gonna lure them away, you find a safe place to hide until somebody gets here."
I'm not leaving you.
"No, they're gonna come for the sheriff, so you gotta stay alive until then."
We have to stay together.
Please.
Please.
"You have to swear to me that you'll run and hide, okay?"
Swear to me.
"It's the only way, Blair."
"Blair, come on, you know it's the only way."
Okay.
Okay.
"I love you, okay."
Get ready to run and hide.
Oh Jesus!
Get back.
"Oh my God, Connor."
Ow.
Sorry.
"Come on, hurry."
"Go downstairs, go downstairs."
"Where, sir?"
Behind that vision in white.
You ready?
I'm frightened to death.
You're in the circle now.
"You've got the prettiest feathers in the room, now spread them."
"Right this way, mr."
Fisk.
Look at our jim fisk.
"Oh, that is mr."
"Jim fisk, eh?"
There she is.
Where?
"Right over there, behind that railing."
With my maid!
And my dress!
Here she comes.
"Don't worry, i got ammunition."
"You make a fool of fleurique, eh?"
"You steal my clothing, eh?"
"Here, throw these."
"Well, if you don't want to throw them, eat some of them."
They'll cool you off wonderful.
Look at the food mr.
Fisk buy.
Mm-hmm.
I think i'll let her wear the dress for tonight.
That's very considerate of you.
"Well, now that we're all friends, let's get together."
"They made a mistake about your table, jim."
We waited for you over there.
You want to know how that lucky piece landed?
- What's wrong?
- What?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?
Hanging out with that... grunge poser.
He's beneath you!
- Why do you care who I hang out with?
- He's beneath you.
Let's not get started people hanging out with people... who is beneath them.
Are you talking about my cover girl?
"My sexy, gorgeous cover girl?"
Just look at her!
Everyone else wants to sleep with her or bathe her.
- Everyone except me.
- And what is that about you?
How you can see through her?
"- Hey, man you like this music?"
"- Yeah, I think that's great choose."
"Terrific choose, man!"
Yeah!
Take it easy!
You should go for Resin.
She's looking for you.
"- So, Resin was coming..."
"- Oh, hi!"
I assume this is finally my iced cappucino.
- Yes.
And your change.
- Thank you.
Geez!
You really sucked that puppy back.
Are you sure this was skimmed milk?
Would you rather I'd lied?
Maybe.
"Well, I'm sorry."
I didn't think you'd want to sleep in the same bed...
"Oh, believe me... we are not sleeping in this bed."
Yaah!
Ugh!
So where are we gonna sleep?
Don't know.
Maybe I should just go home.
No.
You are home.
And we're not spending our first night back together apart.
"Look, I'm hating this as much as you are..."
Uh-huh.
...but we've got to move forward.
What's done is done.
You slept with morning.
I slept with rob.
And Matt.
We're still counting that?
"Oh, it counts."
You were with two people.
I was only with one.
"True, but I slept with two people only once."
"You were with one person twice, so, in effect..."
apples to apples...
I think we're even.
And I think your maths only works if you're fucking the apples.
"Look, I'm just trying to help us get through this."
How?
How can I get through this?
"- ""stupid record's"" uncalled for."
"- okay, i cannot do this anymore."
i cannot do this anymore.
- what?
!
honey!
what?
!
- i've had it.
- what are you doing?
!
"- look, we need you."
but we need 100 % of you.
- you've got it!
"- no, we don't."
"- baby, please, don't -- - come on."
- don't go.
i'm -- i'm begging you.
- looks like he loves her to me.
"- [sighs] that is pathetic, bob!"
- we're gonna go stay with my parents for a while.
- it's christmas.
- that is so wrong.
she knows how bad bobby felt when our daddy left us on christmas.
- i don't want to leave!
i want a christmas here with everybody!
"- honey, it's okay."
just come.
- i don't want to go!
[sniffles]
- we're just gonna go with grandma and grandpa for a little while and have christmas over there.
you got to make a choice -- it's either her or me.
"So, when did you get back from the States?"
2 years ago.
2 years?
"I know, I know."
I should've contacted you all.
"But you know how it is, it's just work and"
I married an American.
Stuart's a workaholic.
"And, well, I've got a little girl now, Nico, she's nearly 6."
"Ah, she's cute."
I have 3 myself.
Which is at least one too many.
"I kept meaning to, I kept putting it off."
And then one month turned into 6.
"I don't know, I don't know..."
You don't have to explain anything to us.
"We're big boys, aren't we?"
Here we are.
It's happened.
The 4 of us.
Grown up.
And Slade running a shelter.
How did that happen?
Says the doctor...
"Private doctor, actually, so..."
My socialism has gone out the window.
Blame the Americans.
"Well, assuage your conscience."
Come and visit.
See how we do things.
I might enlist your services.
I'd like that.
"Hey, asshole !"
Come!
Get it!
You created the wrong gangster!
I love the taste of black blood in the morning!
The thermal camera did not recognize its pattern.
I thought he was dead.
The turns of electronics.
We are approaching the death zone.
You're good?
Motherfucker!
"The electronics are fine, Commander."
"Well, Kix!"
What a sight you have so extreme.
I've never seen a noid with hair.
"Because they do not grow hair, asshole."
Mutated Humanoids.
True.
- This is a Sammy 69-7-H.
- A Sammy 69-7-H?
"This is an old model of pleasure, is not it?"
"They probably lost their virginity, did not they, Hatta?"
- Are you cold?
- No sir.
Pack it in the tank!
Can you walk on that leg?
Yes.
"You're going to make it, brother."
Ice teaches all humility.
It shows us our limits.
Our weaknesses.
Our humanity.
"Everything is fine, Franz."
The bar clown next door wants you to sing for him  for his ridiculous event.
Toni wants me to sing?
You can sing?
Can she sing?
I just want to let you know that I've cancelled it.
But why?
I could just sing for him once.
I would gladly do it.
I don't want her to sing for Toni.
Toni is a slave driver.
"You said it yourself, Franz."
They work all night long.
She's not working for Toni.
"If you have to, you can sing for him once."
Sing him the Internationale.
He'd enjoy that.
What?
The international workers anthem!
There were workers here once.
Screw it.
"I'm sorry, Franz."
I'm singing.
I'm singing!
I don't want to go to Toni's.
I won't go in there.
I've never been in there and I never will.
Once again....
You've sold the doors and the door frames?
Why?
I mean what could you get for a door plus the frame.
"Excuse me, but I have no idea."
He's the birthday boy.
He's just like his father.
Nice kid.
I'm so hungry.
Dump your rubbish here.
Dump your rubbish here.
You can go.
We'll make a short tour through the Efteling Park.
"Finally, we can sit."
We'll get that bloody fascist.
No matter how.
"That's only for laughs, mom."
What's this?
What does Queen Beatrix want with that comedian?
"One moment, sir."
"-It's from last week, mom."
"No, last week's one was about Martine Bijl and that tall man."
What's his name?
From that comic duo.
"No, that's Prince Pieter, who can't play the piano because of his hands."
Terrible... cancer in your hands.
"-Yes, terrible."
Money can't buy happiness.
"-No, but it's nice to have."
We'll buy this one.
"Look, Marco Bakker will never sing again!"
With a record!
-We'll play it on the stereo!
Fantastic!
-We'll get this one too.
Anything else?
"-No, that's enough."
I see it.
And I make every effort to prepare them for what's coming.
"Well, I think I've heard enough for today."
What exactly are you trying to tell me?
Are you trying to tell me I'm going to die soon?
Is that it?
I told you everything.
You know everything.
Go fuck yourself.
Hurry up.
Sam.
"Sam, hurry up."
Bring that over.
Hurry up.
"Breathe, breathe, breathe."
We need a neck brace and a splint.
Get that here.
Look straight into the light.
Don't move.
The smell of the ghosts.
Follow the smell of the ghosts and you'll find the flower.
"What did you say, sweetheart?"
It's a cactus.
"It makes a flower once a year, at midnight."
Only once.
"At 12:00 noon, the flower dies, and it smells like ghosts."
The flower smells like ghosts?
"Yeah, but it's real nice."
Mommy says ghosts smell good.
The Night Blooming Cereus.
"Yes, I remember."
Mommy told me about it too.
-Swimming?
Can not know what we become.
"Beauty, eat plankton the rest of your life."
"But that's what we are, are herbivores."
-We are vegetarians.
What?
For everyone devour us.
I am no longer so to be on the menu.
-Where you going?
-Go up the food chain.
Food chain?
"I chew something that has ""Face."""
I do not remember that.
It always seems that everything different in the back.
So I think we should go the other way.
The land of emperors is opposite.
Why not go there.
"No, no, this is better."
-But shortcuts are shorter.
Not always.
"What is, is not that far."
"Guys, stop."
"Erik, I had to stop."
Okay.
Okay.
"Continue, but pay attention and go slowly."
"It is best not to look down, okay."
"Atticus, what I said."
"Good day, a champion!"
Where to go?
In-house.
-It is.
Sir...
I'm a blind man.
How would I know such details about the car?
Am I the one driving the car?
Who drives it?
My driver.
Until a couple of months ago.
After that?
He didn't maintain.
the car properly
"Also, I didn't use it much."
So I had to relieve him from his job.
No one used the car after that.
I take an auto or cab if necessary.
So...
No one has used the car for 2 months now?
Yes.
Anything else?
We will contact if anything else needed.
I have some work now.
So... 2 thugs came home...
Your sight?
"Greetings, Sir."
"- You are Moorthy, right?"
Sculptor Manoj's Driver?
I was working as his driver 2 months ago.
Didn't you continue after that?
"No, Sir."
Don't lie.
You have driven his car and got it into an accident on the 18th.
I'm working here for the past 2 months.
It has been while since I last saw Mr.Manoj.
- Mr. Charles.
- Charles: goodbye.
We've got to do something about your...
- Your issue.
- Your narcolepsy.
What?
- You're going running again?
- yeah.
"That seems like that's all you do, regina."
You need to be out looking for a job.
Stop trying to run away from your problems.
What?
!
"Come on, mom."
What are you talking about?
- Oh.
- Excuse me.
"Well, if you can't hear me,"
Maybe i need to write it down
So you can read it.
"you need a job, regina."
Tell me something i don't know!
Don't you ever raise your voice
And use that tone to me again.
i am your mother
"And i will be until the day i die,"
And you will not disrespect me.
"Yes, ma'am."
"I'm gonna go run now, ma'am."
Do i have your permission?
"Go on, regina."
"Lord, i ain't slapped nobody in 20 years."
Mrs Andrews?
Hi.
Probably don't remember me.
I live next door to Bob.
My name's Gil Raymond.
"Just thought I'd pop by, see how you were."
Gil?
"Oh, Gil."
You picked up my spoon.
Excuse me?
In the garden.
You picked up my spoon.
Erm....
"Oh, so I did."
"Oh, God, listen, what a day that was."
She never wanted me there in that house in the first place.
"Oh, I'm sure that's not true."
You don't know her.
She's a nasty piece of work.
The way she used to treat me sometimes.
And the things she used to say.
And he was no better.
Wouldn't lift a finger for me unless he had to.
And then....
Then he started mucking about with prostitutes.
"He was a pervert and... she was a mean, spiteful bitch."
And I tell you now... they deserved each other.
"Oh, well, my gosh."
How about I pour you another cup of tea because....
What do you think?
This one looks like it's getting a bit...cold.
Darling.
* What I know of it has me up a tree *
* Love is crazy
* After full of it what's come over me *
* We both said goodbye and parted *
* We agreed that it was there *

You're fired!
You're fired.
He beat you to it.
Shh.
Get those people out of here.
[mark tree jingling]
"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir."
Young man..
I'm looking for the Patio Bar.
- Good idea.
"- Yes, indeed."
"- Hi, Doug."
- Hi.
"Let me see, just-just where are we now?"
"Hello, pop."
I thought you were going to Patio Bar.
"Well, bless me, so did I."
- What place is this?
"- Well, sir.."
You're now in the locker rooms of one of the largest enterprises in the world.
Complete with...
They were tied with bows.
"I tried to grab on to them, but they kept popping away."
And then I started to sink... like a stone.
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.
But it felt good.
I was letting go.
I was letting myself go and... all I could see...
was black... and all I could feel.
was the darkness above me and the lights... coming from below.
I knew I was dying.
And then
I heard this voice.
like somebody whispering in my ear.
"""Wake up, number 37""."
"""Wake up"""
And then I woke up.
What do you think that means?
Number 37?
I have absolutely no idea.
I met him.
The guy who told me about the plane crash.
You met him?
Yeah.
I met him.
"Last night, coming home from work about midnight."
I'm driving past the cement plant... out bythe chemical factory.
Right.
Something happened.
Bright...
Lightning.
Something encircles me.
But we're not supposed to leave.
Miss Pearl made that very clear.
You gonna stop me?
I didn't think so.
- Anna.
- Surprised?
I thought you and your mom were leaving town.
Change of plans.
"I'm sorry, I thought you'd be psyched."
"No, no, no."
"I mean, I am."
Of course I am.
"All right, then."
Step aside.
Heh.
Don't be grumpy.
It can't be that bad.
You'd be surprised.
"My primary reason for existence has abandoned me and after today's events, the remains of the shaky ground that I walk on are about to go kaboom."
Let's get hammered.
Let's.
- Whoo!
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.
At least they're having fun.
They're drunk.
Remember when Elena's parents busted us here after homecoming?
"- Oh, my God, yes."
- We were wasted.
It was the first time I got drunk.
I blame Matt.
Her parents got seated at the next booth.
We're doing this my way.
"Ah, yeah, 'cause it's your way or the highway."
"Oh, God."
Not the highway.
You always want me to be his dad.
"Well, I'm being his dad."
"Oh, uh, I-I'm really scared, Jay."
This is what we're fixing.
"Look, when I was a kid,"
"I lived by a big, scary black lake."
I always thought there monsters in there and whatnot.
"One night, my dad dragged me out of bed and tossed me right in that cold water."
I was never scared of that lake again.
"Now, give it some gas."
- Mama!
- Aah!
"That's another habit I wouldn't mind breaking, but, you know, right now we... have to..."
"Oh, what am I doing?"
I hated my dad for that.
"I ended up scared of him, not the lake."
"Manny, it's okay."
Over there!
On the bike!
The white guy that stole my phone!
I don't see anyone.
Yes!
He just turned the corner!
The phone burglar!
He's getting away!
Not this time.
Up there to the left!
I don't see anyone!
Take look.
This uniform transforms a common man into a hero.
- I see.
This uniform can turn an out-of-form guy...
- into a macho-man.
- Idea.
What?
Idea.
Only you can save me from suspension now.
- What?
- You take my place.
Go posing as inspector Zoravar.
- Zoravar can...
- Hold on uncle.
This is impossible I cannot do it.
Why do you think the ACP chose me?
Because he knows it's just a formality.
And I assure you... she will believe you're Zoravar.
Because she has never seen me.
It's headfirst to Delhi.
It's just fo rthree days.
Here's her photograph.
What's the problem?
- Ankita!
- Yes she's...
You know her?
Yes I know her very well.
We met last year during the Jaipur lnter-college festival.
Her voice.
Her eyes.
That mind-blowing attitude.
Different.
"No, look!"
He's breathing.
He's so beautiful.

She...
She was singing.
She had the most beautiful voice.
"Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed a bit too much seawater."
Off we go.
"Come along, Max."
We just gonna forget this whole thing ever happened.
The sea king will never know.

I promise.
Can I ride on the rig with you guys?
"Hey, chief, can the kid ride in the rig?"
"Sure, go ahead."
"Bobby, you ride with me."
Why do I got to ride in the suburban?
'Cause I said so.
"Come on, you big mutant."
I thought you were going over in that thing.
"No, I'm riding in the rig."
The chief said it's ok.
"Ok.Well, keep your hands to yourself, don't touch anything hot."
"If your kid's in trouble, I'm not looking out for him."
"He gets in trouble, mike's gonna watch after him."
"Oh, really?"
I guess he's in trouble already.
"Oh, whoa."
What the hell is this?
"Did you ok this, chief?"
It's ok.
Don't worry about it.
- I love you.
"- Love you, too."
"Hey, check out salt and pepper over there."
Wouldn't mind those two on a sandwich.
Freddie's got a brother from Oxford.
They want another girl to make it a quartet.
He's a bit of all right too.
And we're going to the Empire.
- The Empire?
- Yes.
"Oh, it's ever so gay there, lvy and the show is grand."
It's just where all the toffs go.
"- No, I don't think so, Marcia."
- Why not?
I just don't feel like it.
That's all.
"You ain't afraid to go, are you?"
Afraid?
- Why should I be afraid?
"- Oh, I don't know."
I just thought...
"Well, I ain't afraid of nobody."
"But you ain't been out for ever so long, have you?"
"- No, but..."
"- He ain't your lord and master, is he?"
I should say he ain't.
Or is it because you ain't got a nice enough dress?
Of course I have.
"What are you standing there for, then?"
Go and put it on.
All right.
What's that across your back?
What?
There's nothing.
Did he do that to you?
- Let me see.
"- Boys, boys."
"Boys, stop."
It's the truth.
I swear Patsy's telling you the truth.
"I'm willing to take my chances, see this thing through."
We're in the same boat.
I'm not leaving here until they come and take me.
"If there's quitting to be done, you're gonna do it."
Don't be chumps.
Don't let them pin anymore on you.
We've got a rap to beat.
The way to start beating it is by putting out that fire.
"Now, what do you say?"
Do we do it?
"Jim, Butch, Mac, do we do it?"
"Casey, what do you say?"
"- Okay, come on."
- Come on.
Come on--
"- So that's it, eh, Charlie?"
"- Yes, sir."
"All right, boys, you can go."
There's no doubt that this tragedy was Thompson's own fault.
"- You agree, coroner?"
- The sheriff and I both agree.
"Mr. Gargan, I owe you a sincere apology."
"Oh, forget it."
"Hey, wait a minute."
They can't do nothing to him.
The guy's gonna be okay.
"Besides, he pulled a gun on Patsy."
- Shut up.
Hey...
"I'll pay these guys back, I'll be back here"
"- in an hour, tops."
- Griffin...
"I'll come back here Sandy, we'll call Dad."
We will work this out as a family OK?
I promise you.
"Hey, it's Griff."
You know the drill.
"Hey, Griffin."
"It's me, your father."
I just want you to know that I love you.
And that we all make mistakes.
"You're responsible for your actions, I'm not saying you're not, but"
I want you to know that you're not alone; you have me and your sisters and even your mom.
I got you your job back.
I know it's not...
"It's not the best, but you know, maybe you're doing some good there and we're there for you, and... um, you can..."
"So just call me OK, just call me please."
"Would you do that, please?"
"And you're not alone, Griffin."
You're not alone.
- Long night?
- Yup.
- We should sleep.
Talk later.
- No.
Talk now.
OK.
Jerry kissed me.
It was a Hail Mary and it failed.
Total fail.
It looks firm enough if we walk on the edge there.
"- Uh, sod that, you're carrying me."
- What?
"Shoes, 300 quid, come on."
Down you go.
Spoken like a true lady.
"Paul, be careful!"
"Luke, my shoes!"
"Quickly, before they fall in the mud!"
"- Oh, my goodness!"
- Ugh... elegance.
Elegance!
Hop on.
"Right, here we go."
So...
How've you been?
Good.
"Great, actually."
- You?
- Okay.
Course has definitely been an eye-opener
Really?
"Yeah, you meet all these different kinds of people."
"I mean, most of 'em work their arses off to get what we just take for granted."
Makes you realise you're not quite as special as you once thought.
"Bloody hell, Chris, that was bordering on self-deprecation."
Is it working?
"You haven't changed at all, have you?"
- What's the matter?
- Not funny...
Great.
Hi.
Um...
We think... we think... that you were shipwrecked.
[Imitates wind]
Oh!
And you managed to swim to shore.
"And somehow, you, um, broke your ankle."
You broke your ankle.
"Dr. Mead, um, the doctor, he thinks you need much rest."
[Speaking Polish]
[Kisses]
[Speaking Polish]
But you don't think he's German?
"- Oh, no."
- Just as well.
"[Mouth full, indecipherable]"
"- Oh, Ursula."
Please.
Sorry.
He seems to understand the language.
"- Oh, really?"
Since when did you speak German?
"Well, I..."
How is he?
"If he drinks any more tea, he's gonna need a chamber pot 'cause he ain't fit to walk to the bathroom."
You finished with this lot?
"Yes, I think so."
What's he gonna do without his clothes?
His own are ruined.
I thought perhaps some of father's might fit him.
"I doubt it, but you could try."
You want me to get the chest then?
"If you wouldn't mind, Dorcas."
Your father and your uncle and your grandfather are fools.
"Thank you, Leena."
- You're welcome.
"Thank you, Grandma."
"Enjoy your food, my darling."
"Why are you hitting me, fatso?"
"Liyova, take another meatball."
"I'd love another one, thank you."
Daddy.
What?
They're waiting for you to finish.
- What?
They're waiting for you to finish.
How long can one eat?
What did you say?
- Never mind.
I take it he doesn't want any dessert.
I'd love some dessert.
The Rustaveli Theater is coming to do Richard III.
"Can you get tickets, Yitzhak?"
No chance.
It's not some little operetta.
Does he have to do it now?
He'll just kick up dust.
"Yitzhak, why now?"
Why now?
Ask your mother why now.
It'll kick up dust.
"Tell her that if it kicks up dust, I'll clean up."
Why does he always have to ruin Fridays for us?
"Yes, every Friday."
Would you prefer another day?
Who visits him?
Nobody.
He is all alone.
"Earlier his daughter would write to him, every week."
- That doesn't happen anymore.
- Why not?
"She died, poor thing."
"It was a car accident, January 2006."
Since then he hasn't spoken with anyone.
"Poor man, all broken down."
I understand.
What was his daughter's name?
Natasha.
Natasha Malhotra.
Can I get a copy of Mr. Malhotra's admission form and medical reports?
Why not.
But it could take some time.
"I'll have to go through some of the old files, you see."
Sure.
I will have someone call you later.
Is that okay?
- No problem.
- Thank you.
"We're done, let's go."
- Thank you so much.
- Welcome.
One thing is certain.
The murder wasn't committed by Iqbal Chand Malhotra.
Right.
But he was the reason for it.
Being cryptic suits you... not this case.
Okay.
I say we go after it now!
No-one's going anywhere.
We'll handle this!
Stay calm.
How is he?
"I've given him something for the pain, but his injuries are too severe."
He's not gonna make it.
This can't be happening.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame Ellia.
It was my idea.
You have to understand.
"When I found her, I'd just lost my own wife and son to a fever."
She was just lying there helpless.
"When I saw her, I knew what I had to do."
"As I told you, in the beginning she survived on food and water, like any young girl."
Then the hunger came.
It's alright.
Take what you need.
I can't!
Yes you can.
"She took what she needed from me to survive, until I perfected the serum."
Father?
Father?
I'm so sorry!
"She never fed on anyone, after that?"
No!
Alright!
"Teyla, Ronon, you're with me."
"The rest of you, stay here!"
Colonel!
Is it?
It was right about then that a question started nagging at me.
Is Phil sexy?
Hey.
You feel like doing something a little crazy with me?
What?
No.
What?
No.
"Hey, honey."
"Phil, honey, how you holding up?"
Good.
I'm at the beach...
Long story.
I was hoping you wouldn't mind waiting at the house for Luke's tutor.
"Actually, I would mind."
I'd mind quite a bit.
- I'm kind of busy.
- Okay.
"Cam, there's something that Claire would never approve of that I've always wanted to do."
Always?
We're gonna want to put a blanket down on that backseat.
This was a huge mistake.
I am jammed in the backseat with a hairy Peruvian biter.
It's spring break '92 all over again!
"Well, speed bump coming up."
Hold the leash taut.
It's supposed to keep her calm.
I got lucky.
I don't think this one's a spitter.
Ohh.
"Uh, I spoke too soon."
You see?
Okay bring the pry bars in.
Push!
Get them in there!
Get them under.
"Good, good."
That's it.
Watch your clothes.
"Carefully, carefully!"
Weahh!
Sorry Indy.
"Indy, why does the floor move?"
Give me your torch.
Snakes.
Why did it have to be snakes?
Asps.
Very dangerous.
You go first.
"If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction."
So please eat something.
I must apologize for the treatment of you.
Yeah?
Who's idea was it?
"No food, no water."
What kind of people are these friends of yours?
This particular time and place and for my work they are necessary evils.
Not my friends.
"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world we are not entirely uncivilized."
Beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
Ha!
I bet you would.
He really is a coward.
Fortunately I can run very fast.
Biggie!
Biggie!
"Mr. Chiu, what's the matter?"
Ask her to help me get dressed.
Biggie!
You only read the script in this moment.
Why are you still hesitating?
Hurry...
"You see me as nothing, hurry..."
How dare you.
Collect the laundry fee again?
Came back here.
"I'm not pushing you, you can paid me few days later."
Clean my wife's underwear too.
Well...
You clean it or not?
"Yes, but my sister will scold me."
I will bit you.
"Huang, you'll meet your match!"
"Master Tam, you've got a visitor."
A visitor?
Our school's famous in Canton.
You're a wanted man.
"True, we're partners in the past."
But I don't want to be investigated now.
I think you better lay low.
I still treasure our friendship.
I've got friends in the opera troupe.
Why don't you join them?
And we'll find a way for you.
I gotta go.
Now...
Where were we?
Myka did name the ferret.
She's just not telling Pete the name.
- Why not?
- Because she named it Pete.
"Yeah, it's cute, but so annoying."
- That's good.
I like that.
"- You think that's funny, huh?"
"Because if she thinks we know, she'll kill him."
Name's Pete.
"Look, you're in trouble and I'm here to help."
"That chip that you have, the one that's changed your luck..."
- Let go or I'll scream.
"- Jillian, it's hurting you."
"Okay, that is a contact wound."
Wishing objects do that.
"This one seems to be a bit addictive and we both know that that's bad, right?"
"So you keep the money, but you give me the chip."
"Gary's sick too, isn't he?"
"You gotta stop while you're ahead, Jillian."
Trust me.
Don't make me use this.
"The Jubilee Grand, right?"
The fire?
What are you gonna do with it?
I am gonna put this on a shelf and ignore it forever.
I know.
Now watch.
Watch what?
"You know, haiukon."
Just...
- How was your journey?
- Great.
Thanks.
- The car pick you up okay?
- Yeah.
Wow.
This way.
Are they... seeing?
It's cool.
Very cool.
Wow.
Come on.
Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.
Hope I get Gryffindor.
I'm gonna need your phone and anything else you might use to send and receive.
"- A little paranoid, don't you think?"
- Can't be too careful.
"Okay, there you go."
"Wow, you really are paranoid."
Whoa!
It's white.
Um...
"Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like, I agree to have my kidneys harvested?"
"Actually, it's a pretty standard NDA-disclaimer thing."
Okay.
It's important that you realize there is a small medical procedure involved.
"Sorry, for a game?"
"Nothing permanent and we don't harvest your kidneys,"
- I promise.
- Okay.
"- Yea, I mind."
Actually...
Do what you like.
It doesn't matter anyway.
I'll take it out to the stairs.
"Oh Violet, you might wanna wipe your prints off those pieces."
Put them back on the fellas.
"Sounds good, Daze."
Come on sit down!
I wanna show you something.
You know you'd probably a millionaire if you clean your ears out more often.
No uh!
Here.
Now what were you going to tell me?
"Yea, the secret."
You were going to tell me.
Can I ask you somethin'?
Why is she so mad at you?
"- She's your friend, you tell me."
- I'm not talking about Violet!
- She blames me for something.
- For what?
- Her mother's death.
"- Why, did you kill her?"
"No, no."
She died after she left me.
- Why did she leave you?
- She didn't love me.
- Why didn't she love you?
"- I don't know, Daisy."
I don't think people have a lot of control over that sort of thing.
"As a husband, I wasn't much a prize anyway."
"""Our love is just a mirage."""
"""Stay behind and don't go away!"""
"""Till death do us part!"""
"""But lt's only a fond dream for you have to leave."""
"""Our love is just a mirage."""
Bye-bye!
"Damn, Hiroshima escaped!"
Bye-bye!
I'll go to Japan to stop him!
"No need, it's only a small matter."
Small matter?
You traitor!
- What?
- l beat you.
Why did you hit me?
Why not!
The whole world's destroyed by you.
You're the sinner of all mankind.
- l'm sorry!
- Why hit her?
And me too?
Why did you give the Formula to the Japanese?
What are you laughing at?
"Don't worry, Hiroshima never got the real 'Beast'!"
Then where's the real one?
The real one's right here!
"Well done, Yoyo!"
I can see the money already.
We can go on a trip tomorrow!
Shush...someone's about!
Come out or I'll shoot!
Come out quickly!
What was wrong with the last one?
Nothing.
And the people who bought it quite liked it too.
Really?
Really.
"Oh, for God's sake."
"Yeah, it's down again."
I called Ike.
"You call, I come running!"
"Ooh, OK."
Up and running again.
"Let me guess, he turned it off and turned it back on again."
"(LAUGHS) No, he replaced the router."
Apparently it was shot.
He swears it wasn't an excuse to come and see you.
Uh-huh.
Although I do think it got him here a lot quicker.
Would it be alright if I use the space?
To paint?
Yeah.
Or to hide from Ike?
To paint.
Yeah.
You go for your life.
Maybe I'll put one of yours on the wall and see how you like that.
Maybe.
"You know that Ike is a really lovely guy, don't you?"
And he really has a thing for you which means he's not going away anytime soon.
That's his problem.
Yep.
"But you'll still have to deal with it, right?"
"It's great out here, eh?"
Make him shut up!
I can't make him talk and shut up at the same time.
I've had enough of this!
Enough!
I was giving him a truth serum.
We've given it to him three times... and all he admitted was that he was a homosexual.
Thirty cc's of Pentothal to have him say he's homosexual.
"It's a deginning, no?"
We've already wasted a lot of time.
Mougeotte.
Dear Mougeotte.
Tell us where the microfilm is... or I'll put a dullet in your head!
I don't know where it is!
I don't even know what microfilm is.
I don't know!
Telephone.
What?
No need to look further.
They have it.
They've arrested Martin and Dupré.
Bastards!
They've infiltrated our ring.
You sold it to the other side.
Excuse me?
You chose the wrong camp.
Too dad.
No!
Don't kill me!
I didn't do anything!
The house is surrounded.
You haven't got a chance.
Give yourselves up.
And you damaged our cargo.
CALEB:
These are Abnegation fabric bolts.
"And you're Factionless, right?"
- Caleb.
-I used to be Abnegation.
We used to use those same bolts to make clothes for you.
You're saying that we're stealing from you?
No.
"No, no, no."
I'm no longer Abnegation.
"So technically you're not stealing from me, but... (STAMMERS) No, you're not stealing at all."
"I mean, maybe."
"It's a question of semantics, I suppose, whether it's stealing or charity."
(STAMMERING) But it's all really the same.
TRIS:
That's enough!
Get off!
"Everybody, relax."
"All right, you made your point."
"We'll get off your train, all right?"
Got you.
"Will just everybody relax, okay?"
"Why don't we, uh, take a seat!"
(GRUNTS)
- TRIS:
Caleb!
-(ALL CLAMORING)
- FOUR:
Stop!
"-I'm sorry,"
- I was just trying to help.
Then we go to a used car lot and get another car.
"Then we're gonna pass the motherfuckers, don't you understand that?"
Yeah.
"Shut up, Ray."
We're gonna pass the cops.
They're gonna see us.
"Ray, we got no fucking choice!"
"We head out of town, they gonna catch us."
Just shut the fuck up.
Morning.
BOTH:
Morning.
How are you boys?
DUD:
I got a hangover...
JOHN:
What do we got?
Nothing.
Quiet as a Sunday morning.
What time did you get here?
"Oh, hell, I came in and relieved Charlie around 4:00."
Y'all want some coffee?
No thanks.
No.
"Hey, Dud."
"Listen, I was thinking about what you was talking about last night."
"And, well, I can understand now why you're pissed off."
"I wasn't pissed off, exactly."
"No, no, no, it's okay, you're right, I mean, hell."
"If that old man hadn't been as deaf as a post,"
I could have blown the whole case.
"Well, I don't know."
"That was the frontier, sire."
Yes I know.
I'm sorry about last night.
No problem.
"I can ask her a question, Mr. Lloyd?"
Sure.
Why did not you ever show anyone the movie Typer chosen?
Dragan asked me not to do it.
And why?
He thinks the dark side of the moon should never see the light.
And do you believe it?
No.
But if I had to distribute the movie...
It would have destroyed it.
"Another question, Mr. Lloyd."
- Sure.
Did you pick up your finger?
Goodbye.
"This boat is a scrap, it's impossible."
For centuries it is not in the water.
What a scam.
I already have sea sickness.
"They did not have passports or money, so I bought a boat."
Not a very good one.
Are not there any ferries?
Are you sure?
He asked?
"- Yes, there is nothing else."
Look at it wet it.
- It's better than it looks.
Wood is rotten.
Look at how the wood is reduced.
"Listen, Herr Mac..."
"I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place."
"Fraulein Ravenwood, let me show you what I am used to."
Take your hands off me!
Take your lousy hands off!
Wait a minute.
"Wait, I..."
I can be reasonable.
That time is passed.
You don't need that.
Wait...
I'll tell you everything.
"Yes, I know you will."
Let her go.
Whiskey.
Shoot them.
Shoot them both.
My medallion!
"Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time!"
"Boy, you're something!"
"Yeah, I'll tell you what."
"Until I get back my $5,000, you're going to get more than you bargained for."
I'm your goddamn partner!
"Cairo, city of the living."
A paradise on earth.
Silence!
Why do you forget yourselves?
What is this?
Where did this animal come from?
"Oh... oh, no."
Cute.
What an adorable creature.
-Fill me in here.
What's...
"Okay, so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna go down there,"
"- have a 360 around, just doing a chair check... - ...before I get the hard hat on and suited up."
"Checking out to see if there's any foreign objects, debris that might come down on top of me."
"And then, once-once I've checked her out, top of the water level, um then I'll, come back up and get suited up."
-Okay.
Jump on.
-Fantastic.
Okay.
"-Cool, buddy."
Let's give it a go.
-Yeah.
"Okay, up."
Okay.
Lower down.
- Down slow.
"-That's good now, yeah."
Down four.
Slower four.
"What do you got there, Tony?"
Loose one?
"Yeah, I've got a loose rock here, mate."
"I want to take that out, um, before we go any further."
"It's...if that comes down, it's, it's bad news, man."
Got it.
That could make a good day go bad really fast.
"Okay, I'll take that hard hat back."
-Here you go.
"-Thanks, Mike."
"Take me down probably another two feet, Mike."
Roger.
-Want some brandy?
- Yeah.
-Who doesn't?
Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf-Astoria?
"Heh, okay."
It's on me.
You won't get off that cheap.
What are our chances of busting out of here?
We'll know in about 40 seconds.
Hold his leg up.
Just in case your kameraden are hard of hearing.
Thirty seconds.
Get him up.
"Stop shaking, Price."
There'll be no pardon from no governor.
"Funny, ain't it?"
In your own vaterland by your own soldaten.
This kid's got no sense of humor.
Twenty seconds.
Open the hatch.
"What's the matter with you, Security?"
You were always so calm.
Especially when you let Manfredi and Johnson go out there.
Eight seconds.
"Seven, six, five four, three two, one."
Go!
This is it.
"- Let's blow, Chauncey."
-Let's.
"All right, men, everybody back in their bunks like nothing happened."
What do you know?
The crud did it.
You want a cookie?
Of course not.
You can tell from a guy's face.
And especially from his crotch.
I've got a sixth sense.
"He's friendly with Benigno, isn't he?"
Yes.
"He isn't a faggot too, is he?"
No way.
Are you nuts?
Are you insinuating Benigno's a faggot?
I'm not.
"It's vox populi, honey."
You're very wrong.
Dr.Vega confirmed it for me.
How would he know?
Alicia's father told him.
"I don't approve of him being so intimate with the patient, but Dr.Vega told me not to worry."
"Benigno doesn't like women, he's into men."
My God!
I'll leave so you can carry on pulling him to bits.
The poor thing likes Benigno.
"Good choice, sweetie."
I'm free tonight.
I'm going to the Cinematheque.
- Want to come?
- I'm meeting my editor.
I'll have to go back to work soon.
This woman isn't well.
"- Benigno, please."
- You know what I mean.
Her skin's really dry.
But you want to know something?
- What?
- I think you're too young for me.
- That's the problem.
- I'm too young?
- You're too young for me.
- I'm not.
[Sobbing]
"[Ida] Claire, do you want to be alone?"
[Sobbing Continues]
"It's all right, Claire."
Just cry.
Perfectly all right.
"- Oh, God."
- I know.
I know.
"Claire, you know we all love you."
You know that.
And we want you to be well... and just think of all the wonderful times you had with Max.
Just think of those days.
You have known him a long time.
And now it was his time to leave.
[Ida] I'm getting fed up.
[Woman] What exactly is it that you're fed up with?
[Ida] I have to be with people.
I have to do something.
"See, I was a therapist."
And I had people on the table.
"And while I worked on them, they were telling me things."
And I learnt an awful lot from that job.
There are different peoples in the world.
That's for sure.
There isn't going to be a place to live.
There isn't gonna be a honeymoon...
... becausethereisn't gonna be a wedding.
Okay.
And one other thing.
No little girl of mine is gonna be named Eudora.
[WOMEN gasping AND giggling ]
vin:
I figure it's been a while since you boys were in Texas.
YATES:
That right?
Yeah.
Texas is thataway.
Just shut up and ride.
EZRA:
"Here we go, gentlemen."
Here you go.
"Hey, I need me another drink over here."
I was not made for honest labor.
Inez:
Then let me do it.
Do what?
Tend your bar.
And clean and make repairs.
Until you and I really get the place going.
By then you'll make me your partner.
"Listen, señorita."
"Uh, I am not looking for a partner."
And you certainly cannot tend bar here.
And you can?
You see that gentlemen at the end of the bar?
He'd eat you like half a sandwich.
She's smart.
I was a little protective of her when we first got here.
I just wasn't sure how she was gonna deal with your scene.
I think she's dealing just fine with my scene.
I think she likes it.
"Obviously, she's getting stoned with you..."
-...and she's reading Spin.
-I don't read Spin.
I've never read Spin.
She found her own way into the studio.
It had nothing to do with me.
Yeah.
"It's always like that with you, isn't it?"
They....
They always just happen to find their way in.
What's that supposed to mean?
"It means you're charmed, that's all."
Someone's looking out for you.
Nobody's looking out for you?
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Your life looks good from my perspective.
-I've worked for what I have.
-And I haven't?
-You are so stuck on the negative.
-I'm not.
"Yes, you are."
-You've blocked out all the fun we had.
-I haven't blocked it out.
It's all filed.
What about the trip to Veracruz?
Yeah.
Did you send Gallow for Dr. Mead?
[Ursula]:
"Yes, I suggested he came straight to the house."
Good.
Good heavens!
What's going on here?
"Dorcas, we have a visitor."
Is the spare room ready?
"- I'll do it, Miss Janet."
"- This way, Mr. Pendered."
We have to go straight up the stairs.
[Bird chirping]
You can get out for a start.
I was talking to the magpie.
- You should've been more polite.
"- Oh, get on with it."
He's decent.
You can come in now.
He's obviously exhausted.
That ankle's gonna take some time.
"Doesn't have much to say for himself, does he?"
Perhaps he doesn't understand.
He doesn't look English.
"Yes, well, leave him to sleep."
I'll take a look in the morning.
I'll see myself out.
"- Thank you, Doctor."
Don't keep building up that fire.
"If he doesn't have a fever now, he soon will have."
We'd better leave him.
There's nothing we can do for the moment.
[Door opening]
I'm going.
Dylan?
"Beka, tell me you are not onandromeda."
I am not onandromeda.
Except i am.
I'm looking for spare parts.
Am i missing anything?
We've been boarded.
Make your way to my quarters.
We'll take back the ship.
"So lock ourselves in and fly to where, exactly?"
"One step at a time, beka."
"Rhade, beka is on deck 41."
We're going to meet at my quarters.
"Beka's back on board, huh?"
"Well, not working out"
"As the greatest plan you ever devised, is it?"
"If you've got a better one, i'd like to hear it."
"See what i mean, rhade?"
Rhade?
They've kept us alive.
Merciful and incompetent.
Really?
Is now the time for insults?
I always wanted you two to bow down before me.
"Hey, guys, what's up?"
Take them away.
There's a class b asteroid
In the abbott belt.
It's hollow.
You don't say.
It is a tesseract generator.
Would you like some tea?
Thank you
"Oh, no thank you."
- Would you like some?
- No.
"Are you sure, it's very good!"
I said no.
Maybe some biscuits?
I baked them myself.
Gate away from me!
Ronon!
It's alright.
It's OK.
"They hate me, don't they father?"
No...
They just don't know you.
Was that really necessary?
"You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but it's not gonna change who she is."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Come in.
"Go ahead, Colonel."
Is Ellia still in the cave?
Yes.
Has she been there the whole time?
"Yes, why?"
I just found another victim.
"Apparently, he's only been missing a couple of hours, which means she couldn't have done it."
Looks as though Zaddik may have been telling the truth after all.
We must defend ourselves!
Colonel Sheppard.
Is there any progress with this hunt?
We're working on it.
Even afterworking hard all day..
"..even after starving, I collected only 900 rupees."
I cant understand what to do.
"Brother, this is Mumbai city."
"If you lose hope so soon, then.."
..you wont be able to do anything.
Then what else should I do?
"How can a man, who earns just 50 or 100 rupees.."
"..a day, pay back sirs Ioan worth lakhs of rupees?"
"If your intentions are good, then you can do anything."
No!
"To earn money, a man needs to be smart.."
..cunning and educated.
"And I am an illiterate, a duffer, foolish."
What can I do?
Everything will be alright.
God is there.
hell make everything alright.
Oh God!
Make me worth getting sirs old days back!
"65, 1, 1."
Take one..
-Action!
Yes.
I am a criminal.
And this dark world of crime..
Cut it.
- Im sorry.
"Make-up, come here."
Take two..
-Action!
Yes!
- You don't have to wonder anymore.
Stop.
- Shock him.
- Clear.
He's flat.
This city takes care of its own.
Set a press conference for 12:00.
Make sure the Post takes the first question.
"You know what the first question will be ""Whose bullet was it?"""
"Call Senator Marquand, be cool."
Tell him everything's under control.
I'm just staying ahead of the curve.
"Abe, get a copy of Tino Zapatti's probation report."
Which Zapatti is that?
A nephew.
"One conviction, off on probation."
A punk.
We're headed for Park Drive.
How's about we swing over to the FDR?
We'll make better time.
What's your pleasure?
Where did the boy live?
Give me a read on the boy's apartment.
515 South 5th Street.
5th Street.
Marcy and Broadway.
That's where we're going.
"We've got no advance, no protection."
That's where we're going.
I'm the mayor.
"Make room here, please."
We need some help around here.
Rose.
- Just tell Claire I had to run.
"- Rose, I'm sorry."
I really thought I was over him.
I hate this.
It's so stupid.
- I must sound so pathetic.
"- No, not at all."
"He asked if Claire was happy, and I lied."
- Isn't that awful?
- Nothing criminal.
- Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
- Are you feeling better now?
A little.
"- You know, Rose, it takes time."
"- Yeah, I know."
I want you to know that I really value our friendship.
It means a lot to me.
"I feel the same way, which is why tonight..."
"I better go home, I have to get dinner ready."
"I'll see you at 8:00, okay?"
Shall I bring anything for your mother?
"Yeah, a wooden stake and a crucifix."
Bye.
Rose loves to fold napkins.
It's one of her idiosyncrasies.
I came home late and threw this on.
God knows how I look.
- I hope you like it.
"- Oh, my God, Rose, it's art!"
It's not art.
An artist isn't only one who paints.
"""Take this, all of you, and eat it for this is my body."""
"When the supper was ended, he took the cup."
Again he gave you thanks and praise.
"He gave the cup to his disciples and said, ""Take this all of you, and drink from it."
This is the cup of my blood.
"The blood of the new and everlasting covenant, the mystery of faith."""
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
You'd like that?
Intensely.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
You and us.
-Did you do that?
-Uh-huh.
-Do it again.
-In time.
"No, now."
In time.
"Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?"
You speak Latin?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Until she rots and lies stinking in the earth.
What's that?
Holy water.
You keep it away.
It burns!
"Oh, it burns!"
Who are you?
"You know, I'm, like, in seclusion."
"No, I'm just exhausted from work."
Um....
- Lucky you.
Living with the Chase's.
- Yes.
Whoopty- do.
"If you guys are friends again, you don't have to conceal it."
I can take it.
You see that nurse right there?
She blames me.
She thinks that I brought the heart attack on... by my sexual demands.
"No, actually, my sexual commands."
What is it?
Good news?
What makes you think that?
"Actually, Andy is pretty much the same?"
But I thought that you... I was on my way to Allegheny Systems when I realized...
- l forgot the estimates.
- Here.
I can't believe I did this.
Anyway...
"Wait, here, here!"
- Graham!
This is beautiful!
- lt's a lemon- hazelnut tort.
- Thank you!
- When did you?
"I couldn't sleep, I was up waiting for you."
"Oh, my God, Patty."
- You waited up for me?
- Only until three.
I guess I'm going to be late for this meeting. I better phone him.
Your husband is an artist.
"Oh, God, I can't bear it."
- Just leave me alone!
You little shi...
"Are you okay, Felix?"
"I mean, fucking crying, the big fucking girl!"
"You fucking crybaby doll, get off my fucking fanny!"
That was intense.
- You are such a bastard.
- And your point is?
"Yeah, walk away like a little girl."
"Cheers, geeze."
Yeah.
So how was Christmas?
Pretty boring.
It's good to be out and about again.
- You didn't come to McGinty's.
"- No, I couldn't make it."
- Okay.
- How was it?
Gemma was there.
So?
- I'm just saying is all.
"- You know she chucked me, right?"
"Yeah, I heard."
I am kinda kicking myself.
She was one sweet shag.
And they said romance was dead.
But it was all that bloody Felix's fault
"Right, but that was months ago."
- You sure it's such a big deal?
"- Yeah, it was to her."
"Said she'd seen the real me, blah-fucking-blah."
"I tell you what, I wouldn't mind landing another couple of punches on that twitchy little face of his."
We need to talk to you.
Sit down.
- What's going on?
- Don't say anything.
- Just watch.
- (tender music plays)
Baby pictures of Luke?
More than baby pictures.
You're gonna watch Luke grow up to sappy music.
Why are you doing this?
To get all the crying out of your system so you don't melt down at the graduation.
It's like when you drink too much and your friends get you super-wasted so you never drink again for the rest of the week.
(voice breaking) It's the first time he saw snow.
"Oh, here, Dad."
Thank you.
(crying) His baby blanket?
!
Why?
!
(sobs)
"Hey, nice car, Grey Gardens!"
It was a gift from my son!
Ugh.
What the hell?
(sighs)
(tapping on glass)
(muffled) Rawrrr!
You call that a tiger?
R-a-a-a-awrrr!
_
And we're very proud of our state-of-the-art computer lab.
"It's so weird... every time I step into a middle school,"
Gettin' tougher.
"Too many people like your cousin here, gettin' sent back."
"Look man, I ain't tryin' to come back."
"So, you intend to cease your criminal activities then?"
(chuckles)
Right...
"Well, a passport, 25,000 US dollars."
"Yo, what happened to fifteen?"
That was years ago!
"Now, homeland security, makin' tings a lot tougher for the little man."
"The normal rate is 30,000 US dollars."
"So, guys..."
Take it or leave it.
Let's go.
Fuck you mean we got no money!
?
"Sorry, I tried a thing, I got jacked--"
"I told you stay off that shit, didn't I tell you?"
I told you!
"Money got tight, alright--"
What do you mean money got tight?
Huh?
!
"When I got pinched, we had enough cash!"
All you had to do was stay in school.
"I dropped out, okay?"
!
What do you mean you dropped out?
!
"No, man!"
"Alton, what are you talking about?"
!
Look at him.
"He's like a cage fighter, all wiry and feral."
"- And rich too, don't forget."
- Ah... he's perfect.
If only he wasn't talking to your boyfriend.
What boyfriend?
"You do actually love Paul, don't you?"
"Honey, right now, I can't even remember his name."
"So what do you do, Justin?"
- I'm an Army man.
"- Wow, respect."
- Seen any combat?
- Afghanistan.
Three tours.
Can't seem to get enough of the blood and dust.
"So you're with Eleanor, right?"
"For my sins, yes."
"Though, I'm not..."
I'm not convinced it's going anywhere.
- And we've done it but considering I...
- Are you and Gemma an item?
- got back...
- Why?
You interested?
No.
"No, she's not my type."
She's right up Felix's street though.
"Yeah, right."
What's the joke?
You think she's too good for him?
"Well, he made a move at the end of summer term."
Didn't work out too well.
- What do you need?
- Just general stuff.
- You guys go and be in love.
- See you back at the house.
What if you shoot the person who throws the pigeon in the air?
Would that count?
Sorry.
"No, I should have signaled or honked."
My fault.
"I guess it was inevitable, us running into each other."
- It's a very tiny community.
- I guess so.
- How's the diner?
- It's still there.
Yes.
I knew that.
"I'm able to empirically, with my eyes..."
"- Hey, Luke, do you think we could..."
- I got to get back.
Okay.
Right.
I'll get it.
"- Hi, Grandma."
"- Hello, Rory."
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
I'm thrilled to see you on no notice.
"So tell me, what's this about?"
You were so mysterious on the phone.
I wanted to talk to you about something in person.
"Well, come in."
It's an English tea service.
One of the advantages of our having an English maid.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I did."
"Yeah, it's kind of all been one long horror story."
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Sorry.
"So, what was this advice?"
I might need to plagiarize myself down the line.
You told me that I didn't have to go into the family business.
You said I should make my own choices.
"So you've managed to do your own thing, then, huh?"
"Yeah, for a while, yeah."
And I think I went to college because of you.
"But, you know, people grow up."
Yeah.
Responsibilities.
"But still, um... you took an interest in me when no one else did."
"That matters, so... thank you."
"Well, you know, the only thing that really matters is uh... that you're happy."
"Are you happy, Sam?"
"- (SIGHS) Well, got another one."
"- Oh, boy."
What's in the box?
(EX CLAIMING) What's in the box?
What's in the box?
What's in the box?
Right?
(LAUGHS)
Brad Pitt?
Se7 en?
Nothing?
- I doubt it.
- I'll give you $300 for him.
- Ha.!
- Five hundred.
Nope.
Not interested.
"I'll give you $1,000!"
That's a fabulous price to pay for a dog.
I could get a team of six for that.
What do you expect you'd do with him if I let you have him?
Give myself the exquisite pleasure of putting a bullet through his head.
"Yeah, that's what I thought."
"No, thanks."
"I'm sorry I can't contribute to your fun, mister."
Boo!
"What'll you have to drink, gentlemen?"
"Well, Jack, my boy, how is tricks?"
"Hello, Sam!"
How are you?
Glad to see you.
"Sam, this is Shorty."
- Hello.
"- Ah, yes!"
Just seen the argument you had with that fellow back there.
- He doesn't seem to like your dog.
"- No, no."
The dog doesn't like him either.
"Look, Sam, how you fixed?"
"Uh, pretty nearly flat."
"But anyhow, I got enough to ask you gentlemens to join me in a drink."
"- Bourbon, straight!"
- Ditto!
(tires screeching)
CAL:
What are they doing?
(tires screeching)
(Cal shouts)
(Cal grunts)
(Cal grunts)
Federal agents!
Hands up!
Get out the car!
LASALLE:
"You okay, Dana?"
"Yeah, I think so."
Nice driving.
"You, too."
(grunts)
"Can't guarantee Dana won't spend some time behind bars, Mr. Connors."
"I mean, after all, she was complicit until she wasn't."
"Yeah, I know."
"But I spoke to the federal prosecutors, told them everything she did to help us bring down the crew."
"Plus, she's cooperating, so I'm hopeful."
"At least one way or the other, she's out from underneath it... finally... and safe."
That's all I wanted.
That's all Jared would've wanted.
Take care.
Yeah.
(clears throat)
Poor dude.
He's been through a lot.
"Gonna go through a lot more, too."
"Losing a child, nothing harder."
Sort of know how he feels.
"""Then the discharge..."
"""becomes yellow and offensive."
"""Any infected discharge..."
"""may also result in soreness..."
"""or actual irritation..."
"""at the entrance of the vagina."""
"Jesus, me fanny!"
"""It's only the unfortunate few..."
"""who suffer severe nausea..."
"""or recurrent vomiting."""
"Sharon, it's not fair!"
You've been in there ages!
Get out of there.
You leave Sharon alone.
"You all right in there, Sharon?"
Yeah.
Coming.
"Ah, no, no."
There's no hurry.
"No, I've been in already."
Ohh...
"Jesus, what were you drinking last night?"
I'm going back to bed.
"Ah, yeah, go on."
Good girl.
"I'll go on without you, what?"
- What's up with her?
- You shut your mouth.
Get in there and get your clothes on.
"Go down to get your breakfast... and get a bleedin' job for yourself, right?"
"Sharon, we're going to have to tell them."
"Stop it, will yous?"
Get some sleep.
Then you'll feel better.
"- Asger, can't you stay a while?"
- It's Saturday.
"Business, you know."
Just for a while.
I never did anything right.
Never.
Nothing.
I never did anything right.
Never.
Nothing.
I never did anything right.
Never.
The burn goes from my forehead down across the cheek.
I had three operations in Holland.
"It won't get any better, they say."
They took skin from my leg and put it on my face.
But my looks are of no importance.
"They are to others, but not to me."
I don't care if people stare at me.
"I'm not the same anymore, and I never will be."
It happened in the Pacific.
There was an explosion and a fire.
Many were killed.
My best friend was a ship's cook.
He died.
The Filipinos couldn't swim.
They died.
I didn't die.
I don't like to talk about it.
"I dived for as long as I could, but finally I had to get some air."
Come on.
Come on.
Ten blade.
Retractor.
"Carter, start compressions while I cross-clamp the aorta."
"Yeah, I got it."
- She's clamped.
- What happened?
- Abdominal bleed.
She coded.
- Start an atrial line.
- I need two 15 French cannulas.
"- Mark, little girl's coding in 2."
"Hit-and-run, recent onset of abdominal pain."
Crashed and went into asystole.
We've infused four units of O-neg and epi and cross-clamped her.
- Mesenteric rupture?
- Probably.
Nothing you could've done.
"Peter, I'll take over."
Hypothermic kid in Trauma 1.
Needs femoral lines for a bypass.
Infuse another unit.
"- Peter, it's about damn time!"
- Cut down!
We're trying internal paddles.
- Charge to 10.
- Charging.
Clear.
- Charge 20.
- Charging.
Clear.
Just a thought.
I think it's time you take this to a higher power.
You got nothing to say?
Nope.
All good.
Father Bardini says he hasn't seen you in months.
So much for the seal of confession.
That's only inside the box.
Good to know.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
You had your reasons.
I didn't want you in the middle.
"Oh, honey, when it comes to you kids and your father,"
I'm always in the middle.
How bad is it gonna be?
Do you remember the time you and Stevie painted Richie purple?
"Oh, damn it!"
You didn't ask his advice.
You joined Internal Affairs.
And don't swear in the Lord's house.
I didn't think I had to ask his permission.
How long have you known your father?
It was my decision.
Do you want him to forgive you or not?
For becoming a detective?
For living my life?
Sorry.
What do I do?
Bake him a cake.
Chocolate.
A cake?
Seriously?
I wiIIjust come back.
Dont hang up.
Good morning!
Here are the papers and here are your90 Iakhs!
Come in!
"please, come in!"
Come in!
"please, come in!"
"Man, how did you know that I will.."
..definitely make a deal on 90 lakhs?
"Dhanraj, I know how much each man is worth!"
I know pressure points for everyone!
Take this.
You know there is a saying in our Gujrati.
Dont make a deal with a man to..
..whom you dont understand!
But I am making this deal because..
..I can get you guys!
Because its profitable for me!
Take this.
Just tell me one thing.
Does your boss want to start a price war?
"No, he is planning totally different!"
He wants to throw down those who are at the top!
Good day!
"And enjoy your self, please!"
The money has arrived!
The money has arrived!
Its tune is soothing!
Its tune is soothing!
The money has arrived!
Coming!
So you are.
Okay.
But I'm going to talk to her then.
"Danny, I could run away."
"After my party, I mean."
Maybe to San Francisco.
If you want to.
If I want to?
"Oh, little one, I'd run off to Anywhereland with you."
But I don't have any money.
That's easy.
I can't really have any of my money until they say I'm ready for it or something.
But I can get tickets on a plane.
I can charge them.
"After we're gone, she'll never know where to look for us."
"All right, Danny?"
"""All right, Danny?"""
"All right, Merle."
Who needs money?
"Anywhereland, here we come."
"No, silly."
I meant San Francisco.
I knew what you meant.
[chattering]
"Wait here for me, Corbett."
I'll only be a minute.
"Whatever you say, Miss."
[no audible dialogue]
Your conduct is absolutely disgraceful.
"If there is one thing I can't stand, it's a sneak."
Who told you?
"That's quite beside the point, Merle."
"Hi, sweetie."
"See, why did you just call me ""sweetie""?"
- We always call each other that.
- Why?
"All right, look, I wanna say something, okay?"
"We call each other ""sweetie"" all the time."
And we fall asleep on the phone after talking for hours.
I washed your hair for you after you had shoulder surgery and everything.
And it's like we're together.
- I know that I've been...
"- No, hold on a second."
Let me finish.
I think maybe this is my fault because maybe I wasn't clear about exactly what I want.
So let me...
Let me be clear.
I love hanging out.
But I'm so attracted to you.
I just...
I want both.
I don't know what happened or why we stopped.
I don't care.
Okay.
- What?
- Okay.
"No, I'm talking about really doing this."
Like a full-on relationship.
Right.
With me.
Yeah.
A bunch of gay people put you up to this?
Stop talking.
DEVON:
"It's okay, Pete."
"- I can't come, Abb."
He won't-- He won't let me leave here.
I can't just leave.
He doesn't let me do anything.
"Yeah, well, it's-"
"- That's easy for you to say, Abby, all right?"
I will come and see you tomorrow.
"And we'll talk about it, okay?"
Wha-
- Why?
"Becau-- Yeah, because he's my husband."
That is my fault and I can't do anything about that.
"No, do not come here, I'm telling you, that's gonna make things worse."
"Yeah, I know, I know."
"I know, I know."
I-
- I don't know what to do.
I don't know--
"I don't know what to do, can't do this anymore."
I just want to die every day.
I can't.
"No, do not-- I can't, I can't, Abby."
Don't do that.
"I'm telling you, don't come here."
Just tell me that--
That you love me and that it's gonna be okay.
"I know, but just say it anyway, will you, honey, please?"
"Iâm dying over here, I need you."
I don't need you like that.
Why can't I?
Why can't I?
Julie-Ann's bra.
She was moved in the van.
I thought dragging her all that way on crutches was unlikely.
We need to find the hole he's hiding in and visit the known associates in the area.
Right.
We're gonna start with addresses nearest the Pembridge and then fan out.
"Hudson, Edwards."
Your list.
"Harris, your list."
"Tennison, with me."
- Hello.
"Have you seen this man, David Bentley?"
- No.
Never seen him.
- Positive?
- Quite sure.
Sorry to... bother you.
My name's DC Edwards.
I'm from Hackney Police.
Do you recognise this man at all?
"Er... no, sorry."
No.
We'd have a better chance getting Clifford's mates to tap-dance than co-operate.
Here.
You can drive.
I nearly bust a stitch going down those stairs.
- I haven't done the job driving course yet.
- But you can drive.
"Well, thank you, sir."
It's a bloody wild-goose chase.
Where next?
Next one's on Fairview Avenue.
Where have I been?
I've been trying to get here!
"Look, we'll never be able to find her."
If...
"If I walk over there, she's gonna walk over here."
"If I'm on this side, she's probably gonna be on that side!"
"All right, panicking's not gonna help, Shane."
"Hey, want to dance, tough guy?"
"No, I'd step on your feet, I'd hurt you."
"Thank you, though."
"All right, now, everybody up, everybody up!"
This is Eden East!
This place is amazing!
I can't believe they kept this from us!
I knew you would love it.
This is why I brought you here.
Vitality!
"Oh, it is so nice to be out with lots of people!"
Everyone's smiling and laughing.
Don't you guys love this?
It's great.
"In a couple more minutes, I'll just roofie myself."
"I will go get my special Salvadore drink, yes?"
"Oh, yes."
"""Guess I am on my way."""
"""Mighty glad you stayed!"""
Yes!
Yes!
He is so much fun!
"Oh, God, don't even start."
I'm just having fun.
"No, it's just..."
That was amazing.
You think?
Yeah.
You know everyone right?
Yeah definitely lovely ladies of LA of course and Seven how are you?
Much better now that you're here how are you?
Good.
Hey...
How are you doing?
Ah I'm gonna go to the bar.
Anybody want a drink?
You guys want to join?
I'll stay.
So can you get me another Jack and Coke?
Yeah sure.
Ok.
Hey...
Hey where did Dale go?
Oh she went to the bar.
Oh well Cece this is Hallie.
- Hey.
I didn't get a chance to introduce you guys the other night.
"No you never did, nice to meet you."
Same.
Oh this is my girlfriend Dominique.
So um when are you practicing tomorrow I want to hear the new song.
Cece works in AR for our tour manager.
So everything's got the thumbs up from her.
I'm easy.
I mean not that kind of easy you know.
But with a voice like his you can't do much wrong.
"She's cute, I say go for it."
"You go to Sanchun with Jaesa, Mugol and Mukguh."
(Sanchun)
Do you know who Buwiyum is?
Do you know who Buwiyum is?
(Magok)
See what's going on.
"Yes, sir."
Commander.
Oi.
What's going on?
Okjuh soldiers are gathering young men to wipe out the pirates.
Then the pirates will be well-hidden.
We've got our work cut out.
Let's go into town for now.
OK.
Stop there!
Let's go.
Aren't they Sachooldo's Jega?
They wouldn't be here unless it's something important.
I heard Prince Daeso summoned them.
Prime Minister.
Do you have any idea what it's about?
How have you been?
I heard you're doing a good job in place of the late Maga.
Thank you.
I trust you will all help Puyo overcome this crisis.
We will serve you with all our heart.
Thank you.
I'll give you a chance to do just that.
I've summoned you all here to tell you to prepare for a war.
A war?
What war?
- Ah!
Treat this with care.
It's loaded with live crabs.
Shh.
I told 'em I was taking 'em to the circus.
Why'd you take your footlocker?
What's a beach party without beach?
[ Chuckling ]
- ?
[ Lively ] - [ All Chattering ]
What a terrific idea!
These crabs are delicious.
Sure are.
And the best part's right here... inside the little first baseman's mitt.
You two are lucky Klinger came through... or you'd be skinny-dipping in that kettle.
"Oh, you're right."
Underestimating Klinger's become a national pastime.
"Thank you, sirs."
Hate to eat and run.
But I've got to pack for three days... and a fun-filled trip in Seoul.
"Okay, I've had some fresh air."
Can we go back now?
"No, not quite yet."
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
"What are we doing here, Doctor?"
I don't want a drink.
Good.
Because you're not gonna get one.
What the hell is this all about?
"Please, David."
- I'm sure you've heard of these.
- I don't know Daze.
"Hey, girls."
There's stuff in the kitchen if you're hungry.
- Do you know why we're here?
"- Yes, I've been expecting you."
I think there's must be some sort of misunderstanding.
We're not here to clean your bathtub up.
Organize your closet or make you happy.
Really?
Yeah.
We're here to kill you.
Then there's no misunderstanding at all.
Do you mind if I have a word with my partner?
Wait a sec.
"Search him, Daze."
"He's clean, Vi."
Come on then.
"- This isn't go much like we pictured it, Vi."
"- Yeah, I know."
I just wish it more like a normal job.
Now it's weird.
I never really talked to a job before.
This might be some kind of test.
"Everything's a test, when you're a career woman."
Damn right.
And those dresses aren't gonna buy themselves.
- I got it!
- What?
- I know we could do!
- What?
Why don't we just go in there?
Blasting without thinking about it.
Let me give you your coat.
That's all right.
It's OK.
Thanks a lot.
Ralphie.
"Hello, boy."
How you been?
What a good boy.
Can I buy you breakfast?
I know this great little diner.
Sure.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
"Well, seeing as you caught the killer..."
I figured the least I could do... was write you some lyrics.
So...
There once was a dick from The Windy City
"Who met this great mick who was, oh, so pretty"
He told her goodbye...
But he had no reason why...
That's all I got so far.
"Well, I was soaked to the marrow"
I was chilled to the heart
I took shelter in her room
She called me from the corner
Of a song I never liked
For the occasion that was in there
If I let you inside me
Will you stay for long?
The one and only
While the gray wall crumbles
Whatever you are
"Now here I am, and here I'm gonna stay!"
So think it over.
What are you doing here?
"Franz, come home!"
Why that look?
What's wrong?
- It's not a woman's business.
Things will get better.
You think so?
"I've starved and frozen many a time, but things always turned out fine."
So you're Mieze.
I was Franz's girlfriend before.
I'm Cilly.
I don't know a thing about Franz.
"Oh, don't you look smart!"
- What do you want to know?
- Everything!
A guy with one arm ― out of the question!
Buy him a barrel organ or give him a couple marks.
We've got to watch out for him.
You know why.
What good's a guy with no arm?
- Or a guy with no brain!
- Huh?
You can't see he's come to his senses.
He just wants to spy on us!
Rubbish!
I know what he wants.
"I'll try him out, and I'll be responsible."
"Mieze, you've got to watch out for him."
They make him do anything they want.
"I'll get a job, if I have to be an organ grinder."
"Whatever you do, they will take him away."
"No, he won't go to the army."
He will go like the rest of us.
"No, he won't!"
Yourprecious son...
You're precious too.
How many letters in your name?
Five.
S
- E-V-G-I (LOVE)
"Come, rest now."
I thought I was getting a boy and he turned out to be a girl...
"Mom, pass me a beer."
Pick seven cards please.
"For you sweety, I'll pick 14."
What the hell are you doing here?
Ahhh!
I just came to have my fortune told.
Also to apologize forthat night...
Whatever.
Take your ass downstairs and get yourfortune told there.
"Once the cup is lifted, it has to be read."
"Yourfortune is dark, complicated."
Some guy is after you.
And also a foreign guy.
What's this constant money talk?
You end up dancing at a bar.
C'mon really?
I don't like dancing.
What exactly do you see?
"I see your mom's pussy, right here."
"Sorry, here is someone to see you."
- Where's Ted Carter?
Right here.
Let's stop that corny music and do some serious dancing.
- Those are good records.
- These are new ones.
- I brought some mistletoe.
- Mistletoe?
"- Hang it high, will you?"
- Only if I can kiss Betty.
"Tonight, nobody is safe from me."
"- Hey, Christmas is eight months away."
- I do my Christmas kissing early.
- Hey!
- Where's the punch?
- It's over there.
"- Oh, good."
- Add the old family formula.
"- Now you're talking, Rod."
My mother wouldn't want me to...
- Don't tell me she's here.
"- No, she's at the movies."
Put the booze in the bowl.
That's the one thing she made me promise.
You want to have a party or not?
- You can't fight city hall.
- Put the liquor in.
Forget it.
I know 10 other ways to make a party successful.
"Now, first, we gotta make the atmosphere a little more intimate."
"Rodney, aren't you the one."
- Evening.
- Good evening.
Let me know when it is.
"- Bye, Parfitt."
- Mrs. Cole.
Shall we find the lady who'll do our makeup?
I suppose so.
It's coming over.
Mind your heads.
Cigarette?
That's it.
"Okay, line it up, please."
Line it up and keep it straight.
That's it.
I've never much seen the point in men.
"Still, I do hate to see you pining."
"Oh, I'm not pining."
Ellis moved out weeks ago.
I'm already used to it.
It wasn't Ellis I was thinking of.
Forgive me.
It's just that...
"When we were shooting in Devon, you always seemed so... vivid."
Perhaps I'm just in a sentimental mood.
My landlady was killed yesterday.
I could hear her husband crying through the wall all night long.
"It seems to me when life is so very precarious, it's an awful shame to waste it."
I was wondering.
"On page 76, I say..."
They're getting worried.
About the ending.
Turned Ministry spy now?
Is that it?
Could I...
Thank you for calling.
Lieutenant Barnhill received his posting.
He leaves in a few days.
"He was the airman who took your daughter to the movies, right?"
"Gosh, yes."
How did you know?
I figured.
The fight.
I thought there might be a connection.
"Perhaps retribution by the men of the parish, so I asked him."
Men?
Four to one.
He asked me to give you this to pass on to Emma if you felt it was...
Appropriate.
I have read it.
"I find I am camp censor, for my sins."
"It is a simple, rather sweet goodbye."
- I don't want to.
- Read it?
Read it or give it.
What if he is killed in action?
She is too young to know that a young man went to his death thinking of her.
"You may tell him I took it, but I reserve the right not to pass it on to her."
It would cast a shadow over her life.
I understand.
Mrs. Coyne.
You knew.
What?
What was being planned.
I didn't.
I swear.
Barney did.
Okay.
"Here... you can hold me if you want, mama."
"Oh, hell, no."
Try not to move.
"Can you pass me that, please?"
This?
Thank you.
What the fuck?
It is the fastest way.
Does it look good?
"You gonna look hot, mamita."
"Yo, wait till you see this place, E."
It's like an amusement park.
They got like a butcher shop in there.
They got a club in there.
"Yo, they got these like plush brand new seats, kid."
I don't even know how they play baseball in there.
It's like a hangout.
"What's up, bro?"
"What the fuck are the chances, bro?"
You should see the way this nigga walks around
Waving his arms and shit.
"That's wild, B, but come on don't worry about it."
"When Angie was pregnant, right,"
She had this...
"Um, they did the thing, you know where..."
Sonogram.
"Yeah, sonogram."
"They told me it was a boy, I was like wow."
I gave that nigga my name.
Enrique Michael Rodriguez.
"That's my name, son."
Not too bad.
"It was like the Walt Disney version of the ho chi minh story, but other than that, it was terrific."
What have we got?
Anything exciting here?
"Also, you got an invitation."
What's this?
Dinner at the white house.
You're kidding me.
Is it a big party or something?
Just 5 or 6 people.
"Thursday, huh?"
Far out.
Girl:
"Hi, mom."
What did you do today?
Stuff.
"What's that mean, ""stuff""?"
"Well, me and Sharon played a game in the backyard, and we had a picnic down by the river."
That sounds fun.
You should have seen this man came along on this beautiful gray horse.
Really what kind?
"Was it a mare, a gelding, what?"
I think it was a gelding.
It was gray.
It was so beautiful.
The guy let me ride it all around.
"Oh, that's nice."
It was so nice.
"Oh, I loved it."
"Mom, can't we get a horse?"
Not while we're in Washington.
"We'll see when we get home, ok?"
We got a problem.
Why didn't you just radio me?
I wanted to radio but...
Looks like they decided to join the hunt.
"If they find Ellia, they'll kill her."
"Sheppard, this is McKay."
"What is it, Rodney?"
The villagers are on the move and it doesn't look like they're gonna a picnic.
Are they heading for the caves?
"Not at the moment, no."
"Alright, get back there and sit tight."
"We're losing time, guys."
Ellia?
Ellia?
She's not here.
Good Lord!
What?
She took the retrovirus.
- You said it wasn't ready.
- It's not!
Not by a long shot.
What'll it do?
"To be honest, I have no idea."
"Colonel Sheppard, come in."
Go ahead.
We'vegotanotherproblem.
Ellia's gone and she's injected herself with the retrovirus.
Why would she do that?
She must have overheard us talking about it.
I told Zaddik it might be the key to making her human.
Please.
You've got to find her before the villagers do.
Amy is a really nice girl and so are you.
I told her all about you.
"If you told her all about me,"
I doubt she'd want to meet me.
"No, she does, she does, promise."
All right.
What time?
She's usually home by seven.
Are you sure about this?
I don't feel like I can hang out in the coffee shop unless Amy's comfortable with our being friends.
She's my wife.
All right.
"But if it gets boring, I'm leaving."
It's not going to be boring.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Oh?
Why didn't you say so?
See you at seven.
You want another cup of coffee?
I'll get the waitress.
"Oh, I don't know."
I kind of like those scones.
I got it!
"So, you're not dating anyone?"
Kind of.
But you know what they say about relationships.
"""Sooner or later, they're all over."""
Even your relationship with Ricky.
And yours.
"Hey, Clementine,"
"Adrian needs another cup of coffee, do you mind?"
"No, I don't mind."
"- Yes, please."
"Er, forgive me. it's been a long time since I've seen anything like that."
"Oh, I wear this to hide it."
"It's so ugly, you know."
- And may I ask which camp?
"- Jadwiga, Poland."
It was long ago.
I am sorry.
Don't be sorry for me.
"Because Saul and I, we survived."
But it never ends.
Now they got Saul again.
"Now, Lena, we'll get him."
Don't worry.
When are your people coming in?
I'm not sure.
"Tonight, tomorrow."
They don't give you a schedule.
But they will try to contact us at my house.
Rick's working on that.
Calls to your number will be switched here.
- How does he do that?
"- Illegally, I'll wager."
He has connections.
"Tommy, you still have to take me to my home."
"Lena, we have been all through that."
I don't have any clothes.
"Nothing, not even a toothbrush."
- I'll get whatever you need.
- You don't know what to get.
I'll bring a little bit of everything.
"Tommy, my personal stuff."
Hallucination brought on by over-tiredness say what?
"Do not ""say what"" me."
I invented that.
Oh please that was so me.
Do you really want to have this argument?
No.
'Cause I know it was me.
Now my friends are not gonna hate me.
So just poof right back in my head where you belong.
They're gonna hate you they're gonna hate you.
-Oh real mature.
-Oh real mature.
[Both muttering]
[Mimicking Miley]
I cannot believe I'm having this argument with myself.
[Groans]
Let me ask you something son.
You ever thought about medical school?
Law school?
Any school?
[Clicks tongue]
Of course not.
Sorry I took so long.
Sometimes it takes a while to shake off Hannah.
It's cool.
No worries.
"Oh, I get it, I get it!"
Your stupid secret always comes first.
-What?
-I said no worries.
You ready to go?
"Yeah, right."
Mm.
"Well, you're on medical suspension, so if this shit's in California, it's shady as hell."
[Locker door closes]
[Sighs] Does Alvey know?
Doesn't matter.
I'm taking the fight.
"Okay, then."
See you out there.
[Knock on door]
How you feeling?
Lisa:
I'm so tired I can barely move.
What did the doctor say?
"Apparently, feeling like shit is perfectly normal."
[Door closes]
"You know, if I could carry this child for you, I would."
Really?
Yeah.
You're amazing.
How did I ever find you?
The universe fucking loves you.
[Laughs]
You see me work with your girl?
I did.
What do you think?
Honestly?
She doesn't know what the fuck she's doing.
She got some talent.
What's her story?
She's had a few fights.
She's got a shitty record.
"She's bounced around a bunch of gyms, and she had a falling out with Marco over at team elite."
And to remember that it's never too late to recapture who you were.
Or to aim for who you want to be.
Take a seat.
Where have you been?
I was just out looking at the stars.
You were stargazing...
every night this week.
How about the truth now.
I've been sneaking out.
Obviously.
Why?
To try things.
Such as?
Um...
I've been testing myself.
Getting stronger and faster.
"I know I shouldn't let people see me, and that's why I do it at night."
I
- I don't know what to say.
I expected that it would take you longer to get comfortable living here before we were ready.
We?
"I have big plans for you, Jessi."
And I need you to be as strong and as smart as you can possibly be.
How do we start?
"Well, first thing's first."
You need to get some sleep.
We'll talk about it further in the morning.
Okay.
LISTEN
WHO IS THIS
Amanda.
What happened?
Well the thing is I've been living a lie.
Just one?
"I'm living, like, 20."
What's yours?
"Well, I..."
I never actually had cancer.
I'll see you.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
Flat out refused.
"Yeah, isn't that just like him?"
"You know, he has to be the only one who has them."
"Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister."
"- Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi."
- What?
- You told Jake I said hi?
- Yeah.
I can't believe you did that.
Why did you tell him I said hi?
I never said hi.
When did I say hi?
- I never heard her say hi.
- It's common courtesy.
"No, no, Kramer."
You don't understand.
He made the last contact between us.
I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship.
"If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand."
It's like a game of tag.
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.
You're going to the bookstore to see Jake.
- So what if I do?
I don't know what the problem is.
"Okay, sweet, yes."
Best?
I don't think so.
It's 1 0 after 7. I have to go to work.
Just give me one good reason why we shouldn't.
"God, it's a hundred degrees in here, and I'm about to die."
You're trying to change the subject.
I can't breathe.
"Listen, you can be honest with me."
"No, I am being honest, I can't breathe."
Michael.
I'm not budging till you give me a good reason why we shouldn't.
-Because you've gone completely mad.
"-Come on, no muss, no fuss?"
No family... .
"Yeah, okay, they might be a little surprised."
"You think? "" Hi, Mom, hi, Dad, guess what I did today?"""
-They'd get over it.
"-No, actually, I don't think mine would."
"-Well, they'll have to, because I love you."
-Michael.
It's a great story for our grandchildren.
They'll think we're crazy.
-We would be crazy.
-Do you love me?
"Yes, I do."
"See, you already said, I do."
"That settles it, that settles it."
-We're getting hitched today.
"-Wait, wait, not so fast."
Will I have a bouquet?
Sounds good.
Wait.
That's it?
What do you want me to say?
I get it.
Man has a satellite.
Doesn't want anyone to know.
"Yeah, but..."
"I am about to go to war with New Bern, Kansas, the home of the nearest Costco."
Today is already just about as weird as I can handle.
I'm not asking any more questions.
"Mom, Dad, there's a chance we may have to leave here today,"
"and we might not be able to make it back, so I just wanted to..."
We just wanted to pay our respects.
Remember I told you about that witch from the IRS?
The one that wanted to take everything you've ever worked for?
"Mom, Dad, this is Mimi."
Hello.
It's nice to finally meet you.
I really love your son.
"And,of course, Bonnie is... she's just wonderful."
And I've really enjoyed living with them and...
"Oh, great."
What?
I didn't say we were living together.
We're not married.
Oh.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I certainly...
I...
Beautifully put.
"So, given your dad's age, I'm guessing your condition isn't a new thing?"
- Where's your mother?
- She's dead.
"Right, sorry."
"So, is somebody else looking after you?"
Just Dad.
He's not doing a top job.
- Great.
- Oh.
"Nina, no."
We are not getting involved.
We can't let a teenage vampire
- loose on the street.
- Er...
I'm 46.
"- There you go, he's 46..."
Really?
"Not emotionally, he isn't."
"Like he said, he's still effectively being breast-fed."
"Well, if you're offering."
"Oh, can you not ask my girlfriend to suckle you, please?"
"Look, you're just gonna have to pull a sickie and take him back to the house."
- Why?
"- Look, this is Mitchell's territory."
He'll know what to do.
This is not our problem.
But it's only till his dad recovers and then we can leave them both to it.
All right?
- Oh!
"- Right, you're going home with George."
"- What, to your kennel?"
- Hide me.
- What?
How?
Rick Castle.
"Oh, hi, Courtney."
Hey.
I'm Courtney.
Hayley.
"So, what's going on?"
You guys have a beef or something?
- Me and Rick?
- Yeah.
No.
No way.
We're buds.
- Oh.
- Buds?
"Last time I saw you, you tried to run me down with a golf cart 'cause I wouldn't let you get cast in the Nikki Heat movie."
"But what I didn't know then, which I do now, was that your movie was gonna be quite possibly the worst movie ever made."
Not being cast in your movie was the best thing that could have happened to my career.
[Sighs]
So thanks.
Let's do lunch some time.
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.
Say hi to Brandon.
Can you believe her?
Worst movie ever made?
"Yeah, I can believe her."
It was a terrible film.
"Well, that was all thanks to this really obtuse studio executive."
What the hell was his name?
They love him.
"Sorry, I have to go into the garden."
"We don't have anything important to discuss, do we?"
Why don't you come back tonight at 8.
They'll be asleep then.
Don't I get to wear a hat?
You look way too healthy for a 60 year old.
I bet you still exercise.
-Yes.
I think you're afraid of getting old.
-That's nonsense.
You still live in the past.
"-Not at all, I look ahead."
To tomorrow.
-Tomorrow doesn't exist.
"For you, tomorrow is a repetition of yesterday."
That's nonsense.
I take my responsibility.
Because I've not forgotten everything that's happened.
I'm prepared for what's coming.
What's that?
The next war?
It will always be different from the previous one.
Useless.
"We're simply getting old, you and I."
But I accept it and you don't.
The war was your heyday.
And you want that back.
I'm out.
Then I'll do it alone.
Your son?
-Yes.
Let's see what frightened you.
It's okay.
Come.
"Dr. Lemelle, allow me to introduce Miss Porter, our new patient."
Isabel is new to her medication and she had a bit of a fright watching you work.
- It was the noise.
- It was still alive.
"It's distasteful, yes, but it's the only way to procure a fresh specimen."
- Poor thing.
- Perhaps.
"But I cannot sally forth and saw at the skulls of dainty, melancholic humans for my research, can I?"
- No.
"- Come, Isabel."
Let's leave the good doctor to his work.
Here we are.
- Thank you.
- Safe and sound.
Do not wonder the halls in a place like this.
Yes?
- Yes.
"- Good night, Miss Porter."
Scream and I will slit your throat!
Please don't hurt me!
- Hurt?
"No, no."
I need you to help me.
I need to escape.
There's no leaving.
They will find me.
"The wolves, they will find me."
- Let me try to find Dr. Cairn for you.
- I have failed him!
Mineral water?
"-Yes, I'm trying to stay fit."
Sports and stuff.
You're quite comfortable here.
Yes.
"I'm not an ambulant patient, but a drinking patient."
Keep it that way.
Thank you.
-There's nothing wrong with me.
I came her on my own initiative.
I worked hard lately.
No holiday in three years.
That's how it goes when you own a big business.
Cheers.
-Cheers.
My wife and I were going to go on a cruise.
For our 25th wedding anniversary.
"I was at your wedding, remember?"
-Yes.
But I didn't feel well.
My wife told me to see a specialist before we went on the cruise.
A ship's doctor only knows about sailors' dicks.
"Yes, indeed."
I'll add something after all.
-Of course.
What did they say here?
All good.
A young God with pure blood in his jenever vessels.
I can go home in an hour if I want.
It was a false alarm.
They just told me.
My wife will be so happy.
We will film our return journey for people.
And that's that.
What do we do at Atomium?
Mr. Lloyd?
"Come on, let's go."
"To tell the truth, I did not expect the king to endorse my plan."
But we had to leave Turkey and return to the EU.
"Here we are, with a woman dressed as a king who reflected on the concept of freedom."
"Please, do you have to do it right now?"
"Yeah I have to, I'm itchy."
It's unbearable.
I'm almost done.
But what is it?
Maybe it's the shock of the news.
The secession of Wallonia.
Think about how it feels.
Do you know that we have many French words in Bulgarian?
Really?
"- Yes, how..."
Lift.
Bidet.
"I want to show her Mascia, Ivana and Pavlina."
My three daughters.
Three daddy.
"- Stay silent, Ana."
Do you have children?
No.
All right.
"He still has time, he's a man."
Made in Istanbul.
It's better than the Bulgarian ones.
I keep it.
"- hey, can we get out of here?"
this party blows.
"- you, cindy wegman, are a bad, bad person."
- what?
i didn't do nothing.
"- i was supposed to teach you something about yourself, and i failed!"
"- [scoffs] hey, everybody fails, okay?"

- mom?

[clears throat] whoa.
i need to slow my roll.
i was just dreaming up a storm last night.
- there's someone here from social services.
you got to talk to her and make her think you're a fit mother.
- a fit mother?
you don't think i'm a fit mother?
- well...
- come here.
"i know i might not always act right, but you know i'm always gonna be there for you no matter what, right?"
- right.
Drinks on the house.
"No, have the drink with me."
The drinks are on...the house.
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.
Fucking break up my party.
You been away for six years.
Everything is different now.
"I did my fucking time, Jimmy."
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got fuckin' mouths to feed.
-You're gonna get it.
-You understand?
Get the door!
"Let me shoot him in his big, fucking mouth!"
Let's shoot him.
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.
His whole crews gonna be looking for him.
This is fuckin' bad.
What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.
Don't worry. I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him.
"Come on, let's get some more tablecloths."
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.
"Henry, go open your trunk."
We'll pick up a shovel at my mother's house.
She keeps a shovel lying' around here somewhere.
"Just keep quiet though, I don't want to wake her up."
Look who's here.
What are you doing?
What happened?
- Lucy Coleson.
- I can't believe that you...
Me either.
"Look at our son over there, eh?"
- He's perfect.
"- Yeah, and then you come along"
- and you expose him to all this...
- Me?
I'm just...
"I mean, what gives him the right to‐‐to touch you like that?"
‐ Like what?
"‐ You know what I mean, like he owns you."
"‐ Hey, hey, I'm here with you, and this is where I want to be, okay?"
Please come back to bed.
‐ It is not okay.
‐ It is not okay.
It's never gonna be okay.
Ah.
"I got it, okay."
I just‐‐
I got it.
It's...
‐ For you.
‐ Last night... ‐ We all made mistakes.
Myself included.
"I got us into this financial mess, and when I had an opportunity to help get us out,"
"I, uh..."
I‐I handled it poorly.
I‐I handled it poorly.
But I've been thinking and making alternate plans.
There are people we can reach out to to call on before we let the counsel know.
"‐ I could turn you in, for Silas."
"Honestly, I think only about me and my work."
"Do you like stars, up in the sky?"
Stars?
I've never really thought about them.
What makes your life difficult?
My mom.
She makes things the hardest.
There's no end to it.
She's ruined everything for me.
And I hate her the most.
"I really hate her, but she's still my mother."
- Director Kim.
- Did you get some rest?
"Yes, a little."
I'm sitting on the stairs looking out at the sea.
There's a lovely tree in the garden.
I'm having sushi in the restaurant next to that grocery store.
I've ordered too much for myself.
Would you two ladies like to join me?
I love sushi.
Won't you feel uncomfortable with us there?
"No, come."
Come and enjoy the food.
"Okay, I'll be right down."
It'll take about ten minutes.
"Alright, I'll be waiting."
You haven't changed.
You're not going for a walk?
You're all ready.
But I don't want to go today.
Really?
"Then, take a rest."
This is Max and he isn't the groom.
"No, no, no."
He's single and gay.
Yes.
"So gay, he got kicked out of One Direction."
Why don't you two walk off somewhere and share poignant coming-out stories.
Go.
- But Max--
"- Oh, you heard the women, go."
Can do.
"Ladies, look around, we'll be back... in about a month."
Tahiti anyone?
I'm just Crazy Carl.
The ladies love it.
Bridesmaid's dresses should be called what they are.
Really expensive donations to Goodwill.
Is this one bad?
No.
That's a Vera Wang.
But this is a very wrong.
Hide it.
Ew.
And it's evil twin.
"Oh, I didn't know hazmat suits came with feathers."
Oh my God.
This the worst thing I've ever seen.
And I've seen a prostitute change her tampon on the sidewalk.
Who are you calling a prostitute?
"This, we've got to hide."
I can't get this dress off.
Just tell it you work at Google and you're thinking of settling down.
Lift it up.
Bullshit!
He can arrest you!
"I'm gonna tell you something, but you have to promise never to repeat it, especially to Shane."
- Tell me what?
"- Swear to me, never to Shane."
Fine.
Peter and I are technically...
We're...
What?
We're married.
I know it sounds crazy.
"It kind of is crazy, but sometimes you do crazy things when you have no choice, and I had no choice."
"It's a business arrangement, pure and simple."
I know what you're thinking.
I loved your father.
I still love him.
"This has nothing to do with Judah or marriage, really."
It's business.
You married him.
"Silas, I know how strange this all sounds."
- It's Dad's birthday!
- I know.
"But he's dead, so what difference does it make?"
Stop playing the dead-dad card!
The wrong parent died!
And you know what?
Tough shit.
Get your ass back there and watch Willy fucking Wonka!
"Go, go, go!"
- Clear.
- Clear.
DAN:
Ha-ha-ha.
I'm just kidding.
It was just her engagement ring.
So why all the long faces?
-We miss Bull.
HARRY:
Yeah.
Nobody to carry the heavy files.
Or walk us to our car at night.
Hey. wait a minute.
Listen to the way we're talking.
All we care about is how this affects us.
We're supposed to be his friends.
Let's back him up.
"I mean, maybe he's made the right decision."
That's a lot of buffalo chips.
"No, Selma, I think Harry's right."
We've gotta support Bull.
We can't let him know how we feel.
I will not participate in this charade.
The man is making a fool of himself.
Somebody should tell him.
"All you have to do is have the guts to stand up to him and say, ""Bu||...."""
I'm behind you all the way.
"you big Greco-Roman nut, you."
Heh-heh.
Thanks.
I knew you'd come crawling back here where you belong.
-I just came back to clean out my locker.
-You should clean out your head.
-You know--
They're forgotten in an hour.
Come on.
"Hey, Norman, you know what?"
"There's a place I know that I'd like to show you, that no one knows about."
Not even you.
It's my secret place.
I know every spot within three miles of Peyton Place.
Not this one.
Come on.
You were right.
I never knew this place was here.
I don't think anybody does but me.
And maybe God.
And now you.
It's beautiful.
I've just decided.
This is the last time I'm ever going to come here.
Why?
"Oh, I'm gonna leave it for somebody else to find."
Maybe your children will discover it.
I'm never going to marry.
I'm just going to have lovers.
"Oh, Allison."
What's wrong with that?
"No children to grow up unhappy, nobody gets hurt except maybe me."
That's the worst kind of emotional maladjustment.
Who said so?
- A book I read.
- What book?
I sent for a book.
"It was $ 1.98, in a plain wrapper."
- A plain wrapper?
There's three.
Four.
I love you.
GOSSIP GIRL:
"XOXO, Gossip Girl."
Gossip girl here--
Your one and only source
Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
Georgina?
where are you?
You can tell jesus that the bitch is back.
- Emma.
- Got a credit card fake i.d.
And i want bacardi and a boy.
That beautiful dinner you made--
You were gonna propose weren't you?
I just don't know where we stand right now.
Tell me if what you feel for me is real.
It's just a game.
- Chuck why did you just do that?
- Because i love her.
I can't believe blair won!
"Yeah, who even voted for her?"
- Me. about 150 times.
- That was really sweet.
I just wanted to make sure she had the perfect night.
- Where's the prom king?
- We broke up.
But everything was so perfect.
Turns out fairy tales end when they do for a reason.
Like everything on the upper east side
Come here.
Hey.
Don't worry about this.
Okay?
Everyone's gonna get over it eventually.
When?
"Nate, high school is over."
If I don't fix this tonight
Some of these people will never talk to me again.
And--and what happens next year?
What... she does this to the next
Serena and Nate and Dan and Blair?
Well.
What else can you do?
It is too easy for her to sit behind a computer
And not face the damage she's done.
No.
But she doesn't know that.
You didn't get to use your gossip.
Well here's something new--
I told chuck I loved him... again
And he didn't say it back... again.
Blair.
I'm not gonna tell people that.
Why not?
I'm giving you what you need to be queen.
I don't want to be queen.
I just wanted a chance to have a life in school
And look what it almost made me do.
That's the thing....
You need to be cold to be queen.
Anne Boleyn thought only with her heart
"- Oh, great, now I'm all nervous."
- Don't be.
No man would invite you on his motorcycle unless he's ready to make a commitment.
You expect me to believe that?
"No, but you made lying look like so much fun, I thought I'd give it a whack."
"So, um,"
I'm going upstairs to throw out all my booze and not eat these donuts.
"Yeah, it is fun."
Morning.
"Oh, my God, I got flowers."
They're on my desk and you assume they're for you?
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
They're for you.
Hmm...
I wonder who they're from.
I wasn't even going to ask.
I know how much you value your privacy.
It's not signed.
"It just says, ""Had a great time."""
- Molly.
- What?
Are you seeing someone?
Someone I don't know about?
How am I going to help you cover it up if I don't know what you're hiding?
I've got nothing to hide.
But let's not mention these to my father.
"Or anyone who might tell my father, like... him."
"- Hey, Alex."
"- Hey, Stephen."
Alex?
One second.
Um... oh.
And you were right.
The strudel was excellent.
"Damn, we should have grabbed a couple of those crescents to go."
Oh well.
"Jacob, what happened to me after my father died?"
"Honestly, I don't know."
You hated me.
You left Berlin and I left the business.
And we never spoke again?
"Oh, I'd phone, you wouldn't take my calls."
I have no idea where you went or what you did.
"Started a new life, thought I could leave the past behind."
"So much for that, huh?"
"We don't just ring the doorbell, right?"
"Look, why don't you, uh, stay here."
I'm gonna go look around.
(speaking German)
Marta.
Don't move.
Hi.
Hi.
How did you?
Dog seems to know you.
Maybe.
Do I live here?
It doesn't look familiar.
"Huh, no labels."
"Well, someone's got expensive taste."
"Men's clothing, no women's."
I must not live here.
Gotta be something to identify whoever does.
You definitely know whoever lives here.
That was a board decision about an entire department.
Griff is one person who slipped.
- We're calling it a slip?
- Work is structure.
"It's a support system, Frank."
"- Employees, when they stumble, desperately need..."
"- Oh, now it's a stumble?"
I'm not running a rehab program.
"Relapse is inevitable, if that's what happened."
"Oh, that's what happened."
"Griff had one, two bad weeks."
"Before then, a year where he wasn't a problem."
"Hey, I warned him, Allen!"
Think about the stress that he was under
"- the explosion, the suicide..."
- It's still no.
- He just needs another chance.
"- Allen, stop!"
It's no.
One for the road?
- You hungry?
- I could eat.
I heard you got fired.
Yeah?
"Whatever,"
"I couldn't stand it there, to be honest."
Yeah.
My whole family works there.
- Nightmare.
- Total nightmare.
To freedom.
"So you and Zoe, huh?"
- This thing is kinda peppy.
You got a turbo on this thing?
You fellas spread out.
What's going on?
I have no idea.
I want you guys to check down here.
I've noticed a lot of foot traffic down these stairs tonight.
Foot traffic?
There's been no foot traffic.
Let's go.
"""Involuntarily, I glanced seaward."
"""and distingued nothing,"
"""except the single green light."
"""Minute,"
"""ran my nute."""
"Probably ""my nute""."
"""My nute,"
"""and far away"
"""that might have been the end of the dock."
"""When I looked once more for Gatsby,"
"""he had vanished"
"""and I was alone again,"
"""in the unquiet darkness."""
What the hell is this?
It's like a... a literacy thing.
A literacy thing?
"Yes, many of these poor boys have trouble reading."
"Nice work, Beaver."
I can read.
You're doing a great job.
The ZBZ sisters have been helping them learn a little.
"Secret philantropy, if you will."
"- Well, that's..."
- l'll get my stuff.
Okay.
Should I?
Do we have...
You take a second.
You go ahead and eat.
I'm still trying to find where everything is in this house.
"Oh, congratulations, by the way."
Thank you.
"Have you guys set, or maybe you haven't..."
"- Oh, May 1 2th."
"- Well, that will be beautiful then."
Thank you.
"I need to get ready myself, actually."
"You don't need any more, do you, Jessie?"
"- Oh, no."
- Here you go.
"- Hey, you."
- l'll be down in a couple of minutes.
"Jess, you almost ready?"
"Yeah, I just have to get my things."
I can't get him to tell me what's going on.
- He's hiding something?
"- l think he's terrified, ashamed, and he doesn't want me to worry."
But he's not hiding something.
I don't know.
You're the one who thinks he's been a criminal the whole time.
- You said you didn't trust him.
- l didn't trust him emotionally.
You don't get sent to prison for that.
"Oh, God."
Vomit!
I am telling you to turn down the car.
Which one?
This one or that one?
"I am sick of his question answers,"
How are you?
"Give me two batteries, Which ones, Big, Medium or small?"
Remote batteries?
Which remote batteries?
"VCD, DVD or TV, To explode a bomb remote's battery."
Khade chand!
Yes!
Madam!
"Did you hear, what I hear?"
"I've seen it photo, today this diamond is mine, Papa"
"One, Two, Three."
"And say one, two, three."
"It exploded, papa?"
It didn't explode!
It didn't explode!
It didn't explode!
It didn't explode!
Since morning you have been humiliating me!
You humiliated me in the car!
You've humiliated me a lot.
You humiliated me in front of these girls!
I will..
Hey!
Rangeela's Jackie Shroff!
Quiet!
You are beating me in front of everybody.
What can I do if the battery is not functioning!
"You know, ever since I was 16, I crushed exams."
I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.
"Man, I gave up everything."
"You know, I gave up fun."
I gave up sex.
I don't think you gave up sex.
- Okay.
Maybe not sex.
"- Yeah, you didn't give up sex."
"All right, all right."
"Not sex, but..."
It just annoys me that the one thing that is stopping me from going to Harvard Med is money.
"You know, tuition fees and living expenses alone cost over $300,000."
"$300,000."
It's outrageous.
It's astronomically high.
I get that.
"You know, I just thought there was more to life than just money."
"Well, look at the bright side,"
I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance.
Thank you.
"- Happy birthday, honey."
"- Thanks, Mom."
"Thank you, love."
Kisses.
Make a wish.
- Make a wish.
- Okay.
Bravo.
"Congratulations, Benjamin."
I like her.
"I like her, too."
She likes me.
I guess you didn't have your eyes peeled.
It was me she was flipping her frills and furbelows at.
"Just a minute, jim- here, here... if the lady comes up, i go backstage."
"If the eagle shines, the pass-through's all yours."
All right.
Uh- let me flip it.
Where did it go?
"I don't know, but you better hurry and find it."
The show's over.
She'll be going out with someone else.
"Nick, you go back to her dressing room and ask her if she'll go to a lobster party."
"Soon as i find this lucky piece, i'll join you."
Luke?
Yeah.
You go over to the astor house and reserve the best table in the place.
Yeah.
And send somebody here with a lantern.
Idiot!
Imbecile!
"You want to be an actress, eh?"
"Well, here is good luck!"
I've had just about enough of this!
Someone is at the door!
See who it is!
Yes?
"Oh, good evening, mademoiselle."
I see my flowers have arrived.
"Oh, you are mr."
Fisk.
What?
No.
Don't ask that.
Please.
Henry.
Keeping our business alive...
..that will be... keeping us alive.
Thank you.
You are the best thing... that ever happened... ..in my life.
"Oh, Henry."
Edie.
"""The stream will cease to flow."
"""The wind will cease to blow."
"""The clouds will cease to fleet."
"""The heart will cease to beat."
"""For all things must die."""
Henry chose hemlock.
He wanted to say a proper goodbye to Edie.
"Come on, Sid, we've got a competition to win for Edie."
The flower show!
I forgot all about that.
Lady Felicia?
"Yes, Mrs M?"
I was wondering if you might like one or two suggestions from me as to which flowers might catch Father Brown's eye?
I thought you wanted to win the trophy for yourself?
"Yes, well, I've had a change of heart."
Thank you.
The winner!
For Edie Lee.
The grower of the best flowers in the whole of the Cotswolds!
"And next Monday,"
I will be hiring Edie as the florist for the Websters' wedding.
-Think so?
-What happened to Tino Zapatti?
"-He's dead, isn't he?"
I'm talking about two years ago.
He got probation.
What sentence did you recommend?
Ten to 20.
I saw the rap sheet.
Tino was pushing drugs to kids.
"Not doing it himself, but having kids deal for him."
Weapon from a previous homicide?
Disappeared in the second report.
Who ordered it?
That I don't know.
Why didn't you ask?
Sudden urge to move to the country.
I forgot about it.
Now if you'll excuse me...
... you'dbettergetout ofhere .
My lumbago tells me that snow is coming.
You better hurry.
Buffalo gets socked in pretty fast.
Thank you for your time.
Watch your step. lt's slippery.
Thank you.
-How long?
-About an hour.
You don't want to suffocate in a tunnel.
They got to dig one out ahead.
"Meanwhile, enjoy the snow."
We can't eat snow.
-Try that diner over there.
You didn't go.
-You did the right thing.
"-No, I didn't!"
He had no business there without a ghost.
That should have been me plus backups.
But Eddie was such a hothead... .
I mean...
... thekindthatnevercoolsoff.
What do you want to tell me?
There was another probation report.
This one...
"... itsetTinoupforthemax, 1 0 to 20."
What happened to it?
I don't know.
Who wrote it?
That's all I got.
The probation officer... .
Name?
James Wakeley.
You won't find him on Leonard Street.
Where is he?
"Upstate, working parole."
I told you not to come up here.
You made a long trip for nothing.
Do you want to tell me the truth now or under oath?
"You looking to grow brass balls, miss?"
I'm doing well without them.
"Do you want a subpoena, or may we continue?"
What brought you here from Leonard Street?
New York State parole officer.
Better pay and pension.
-Nicer surroundings.
You are dissatisfied because your life constrains you.
- You say it so plainly.
I'm ashamed to seem ungrateful for what I have.
But I just... want...
- You just want to be free.
- Exactly.
- Hmm.
- Thank you.
- Isabel!
- Roderick.
- My darling sister.
You are a sight for sore eyes.
How are you?
Have you settled in nicely?
- I have.
It's everything that we hoped it would be.
- And how is the famous doctor?
- The medication is helping already.
I...
I already feel much more at ease.
"- Uh, little bird?"
Where'd you go?
- I'm sorry.
"Dr. Cairn says it's a part of the healing process, the side effect as I adjust to the medication."
"- Well, perhaps some, uh, fresh air will help."
Would you like to take a walk?
Let's enjoy the beautiful gardens.
You lead the way.
Who are you?
I'm Edith.
The lady of the May.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm here to give a contract to a gangster.
This is...
This is the picture of my son.
His life's in danger.
You've to save me.
I am so unfortunate and helpless.
I had to see this day.
I had to request a goon to save my son.
But I didn't come empty-handed.
That's not all.
This is just the advance.
Satyakant Acharya Shashtri... will sell his home his land everything.
But he'll pay you your price.
Father.
Please come in.
I'm a simple decent and self-respecting man.
Visiting a gangster's house is... a sin for me.
"""What's the value of a father?"""
"""I could never know when I was close."""
"""Love your father."""
"""But could never say."""
"""Your father... means everything..."""

What's this?
Just one bundle.
Trilok.
That's worth millions for your Boss.
Boss.
"You're like me, it's all in front."
Be thankful you don't have to struggle into a roll-on.
I am!
Have you given up answering that intercom?
I didn't hear it.
It didn't buzz.
"My wife says can you get this stitched for Hilary, she says it's the band on the inside."
Who's this?
My name's Baker.
Blackfriars Assurance.
"We're insured, so sayonara."
"No, I just popped in to see Miss Sutcliffe."
"Well, you can pop out."
She's busy.
Goodbye.
"Bye, Pauline."
These need doing.
"Give me a knock in ten, and we'll make a move."
So...
What?
Mr Tubby Baker.
Very nice.
Very gentlemanly.
He's a gentleman caller
Like in that play where she had the gammy leg and the glass animals.
Why did you give him the brush-off?
We have our site visits on a Tuesday.
I've heard that something very exciting is happening the day after Tuesday.
What?
Wednesday.
Get a bit of a romance going.
I'd have him.
- Mom.
You know exactly what Daddy wants.
And you know how to make him happy and how to make him miserable.
Every woman does.
"If you're bored, Mom, you know, that's your fault, not his."
Bored.
"You've always been your father's daughter, and if you want to side with him this time, that's fine."
"- This is not about sides, Mom."
- Don't!
"Don't pretend that you know what goes into a 30-year marriage, because you don't have a clue."
You don't have a clue.
Are you all right?
I'm sorry.
I don't want to upset you.
"Can we have some chamomile tea, please?"
- Hello.
"- Hey, it's Michael."
"Hey, Michael!"
I've been thinking about you.
Really?
What kind of thoughts?
You know exactly what kind of thoughts.
- What are you doing?
- I'm at work.
"Yeah, I'm trying to picture it."
Where's your office?
It's Zander-Cohen.
It's a pretty big architecture firm.
Impressive.
Do you have a view?
Yeah.
It's a nice view.
B) Uluc's messenger will be on and I'll communicate with him through... a mobile device.
"Uluc will be like a telephone switchboard, giving me news about all of you."
C) Gamze and I don't have a phone with messenger.
How will we communicate?
By farting?
"Planning needs money, and we don't have that much."
What can we do?
"No, that can't be."
"If we're going to do this, let's do it right."
I'll take care of the phone business.
Super!
The operation will take 60 minutes.
Good luck everyone.
Everything is okay.
We can start.
"Guys, it's your turn."
What's going on?
- Hello?
Kaan?
"- Where are you, man?"
- I got cut off and can't connect.
"- Great, and I can't get in."
What happened?
What do you mean by what happened?
Yours is here.
I am talking about Professor Candan.
She is here.
What's she up to?
What's she doing?
I don't know.
She's playing the violin.
"Hold on, Mert is calling."
Ethel?
"Is that you, Ethel?"
I wondered what happened to you last night.
Can't talk.
Due in the lists in 10 minutes.
"I'm coming, Mother."
Watch where you're getting the blood!
Christ!
- How else can we choose a champion?
- We could call an election.
Election?
"Oh, no."
Nonsense.
It wouldn't be fair to the knights.
- They could draw lots.
- Draw lots?
Bless my soul.
"You might as well do it dip, dip, dip, my little ship or one potato, two potatoes."
Or even hide and seek.
"48, 49, 50!"
Coming!
"The cardinal said, ""I asked for 13 vergers."
"Why have you brought me 13 virgins?"""
"Now, we're in the garden and a thousand voices said as one man:"
"""Ave, ave, passed through this way."""
"Ave, ave, what?"
- Why do I need to say ave?
- Just sit back and let something nice happen to you for a change.
Looks like they've chosen a champion.
Can you see who it is?
It's my boss.
Christ.
"Huh, I'll write it again."
My hand... my hand shakes sometimes.
You write it so it looks nice.
"I'm very sorry, I have to go before the soldiers come."
The last one...
the last one was about...
My memory isn't very good.
"No, I remember."
I went walking in the morning.
It was...it was very cold.
Tell her I wore my sweater.
She worries about that sort of...thing.
"And...and, uh... and I, uh, and I what?"
And I saw they had torn down that old building where you and the other children used to...to play.
"And, uh...what...?"
Tell her that it rained for two and a half days.
I don't know if she can see the sky... where they're keeping her.
And...there was more.
There was something about a friend...
I...
Why can't I remember?
I wanted to tell her!
Is all right.
She'll understand.
"Yes, yes, you're right."
She will.
Please let me come with you.
"I'm sorry;, thas not possible."
Check this one here!
Is there another way out?
Open up or else!
There.
It's past 7:00.
"Thanks for trying, guys, but there's no point anymore."
"Sorry, Steven."
"Sorry, Steven."
It wasn't meant to be.
[ Grunts ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Crash!
]
It was too meant to be.
[ Sighs ]
"My first day back, and it's already ruined."
I wonder who'll get my donut instead of me?
Probably peedee.
He'll be up for his morning jog.
Mr. Smiley will have the second donut.
Lars will embezzle one.
Ronaldo will buy one that he thinks is a mutant.
Onion'll buy one and take it for granted.
"And then mayor Dewey will order a dozen, and then a dozen-dozen for the whole town!"
And then a dozen-dozen-dozen for all the starving children in the world!
[ Cheering ]
But not for Steven.
"They'll say, ""where's Steven?"
"We saved a donut for him."""
But they won't see me because I'm in the sky.
"And then, they'll feed my donut to a dog."
And then I'll die.
♪
"Alas, poor Steven!"
I knew him well.
Noooo!
"I believe this is yours, my friend."
Thank you for lending it to me.
"But I still came out ahead, which is more than Mace can say."
"I'm close, so close."
One more door.
Yes!
Just one more door.
(sobs) Just one more door and I'm home free!
Wow.
Just... tell me why.
Why did you keep me in the dark for so long?
It's not that I didn't trust you.
I guess...
I just didn't want to share them.
"As long as I was the only human they confided in, it made me feel... special."
I think I know what you mean.
That might be why I've chased the Illuminati for so long.
"People may have thought I was a nut case, but at least I stood out."
"So, you two finally found each other."
"Yeah, I guess you could say that."
"- See you tonight, Captain."
- Have a nice day.
Hacker!
What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
"Oh, passing through."
"Man, you look like you've been through the wringer."
- (laughs) You don't know the half of it.
- (laughs)
"I may know more than you think, partner."
A lot more.
An Illuminati pin?
You?
I always think of it as sleeping resting up from the pounding it takes during the day.
- Do you work at night?
"- Yes, quite often."
You don't realize the preparation it takes to be a teacher.
It's like... .
It's like all these kids were my own.
I love them.
I want so much for them.
"It's more than a job to you, isn't it?"
I didn't mean to sound like the dedicated idealist.
"Well, there's nothing wrong in that."
Connie.
- I did want to thank you for coming.
- You don't have to.
I enjoyed everything.
Including the dancing?
Including.
"You're wasting your time, Mike."
I had my love a long time ago.
"And when my husband died, I came back here."
And I've had no time for anything but Allison and the dress shop.
- You've got time now.
- It's too late.
"- Look, Connie."
If I were...
- I said it's too late.
I made my choice long ago.
Please take me home.
Sure.
"Selena, let's get married."
You mean now?
Sure.
"'Kay, come back soon."
Okay.
What's up ?
Don't you think the boys were acting weird ?
"The shifty looks, finishing each other's sentences like they're composing a lie on the spot ?"
Yes.
Totally normal for them.
"I don't know, I feel like they're hiding something."
"If it's not the location of Pancakes, I'm not interested."
"Oh, no."
He was in his cage.
He's gone !
"Oh, no."
Pancakes ?
Pancakes ?
"Okay, I didn't want to worry Taylor."
"She's pretty upset, and she's got this thing about blood."
Blood ?
Yeah.
"Don't freak, okay ?"
I-I-I need you to not freak.
Okay.
Why would I freak out ?
"It's not that bad, is it ?"
"Dude, it's bad."
"Seth, the hospital is, like, a mile away."
"I know, which is why I'm taking the secret back roads way that's only a half mile."
That was sarcasm.
I'm pretty sure my shortcut got us lost.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
"That was sarcasm, too."
Sorry.
Why can't you just accept that?
Shut up!
[Siren wailing]
[Garner] I'm calling backup.
"If anybody moves, we're in trouble."
We need a shooter.
We're here.
Your man wants everyone to hold their position.
We need a single rifle.
"I say again, all units, hold your position."
[Morgan] Copy that.
This is the street.
Hotch is going inside.
And he's on his own.
[Reid] Hotch won't do anything to spin him.
It's not Kaman I'm worried about.
This isn't his first time at the dance.
We gotta trust him on this.
"Kaman, why are you doing this?"
We never did anything to you.
You kept Tracy away from me.
"Look what you've done, what you're about to do now."
I wasn't always like this.
"People don't change, Kaman."
No.
This is all your fault.
"Baby, you can't keep blaming the world for what happened to you."
"[Gasps, whimpers]"
"Baby, look at me."
Look at me.
[Whimpering continues]
[Woman] Kaman.
Fitzgerald?
"Whoa, easy."
Where did he go?
Who?
Fitzgerald.
Where did he go?
I have no idea.
Tell me or I'll take your head off.
I swear to God-- (GROANS)
Tell me.
Tell me!
Texas!
He said he was going to Texas.
He said he was gonna reenlist.
Then he started talking about property.
"""A decent piece of land."""
One.
One of the same people.
"Oh, one."
So one's okay.
We just let off one nuke at the Super Bowl.
"Oh, so now you want to micromanage something that you didn't even want to be involved in."
"I don't want to manage it, but don't you think we could maybe find someone competent who could?"
"Okay, whatever it is, I don't need to know."
I'll tell you what's going on.
"Jonah saw Moyes earlier today and Dan and Amy have, too."
And now Moyes is onto us.
Why did you just tell me that?
This is so much worse for me.
I was the field agent who gave Dan and Amy the mission.
I was the messenger.
I could be shot.
Mwah.
"One of our classic forehead smooches, just like I planned."
This is weird.
- Should we have sex?
- What?
- Huh?
- Yeah.
"I mean, no."
"- No, things aren't weird, or no to the sex?"
- Maybe we should just--
- You're right.
"Just concentrate on Figgis, and we'll figure this out later."
"- No, I was gonna say maybe we should talk, but yeah, it can wait till after Figgis."
- Ah.
- We have the rest of our lives to talk.
"- Yeah, unless he kills us first."
What a weird joke.
Regret saying that one.
"Wow, things are clickin'."
- I'm gonna go make sure there's enough balls in-- in the ball pit.
- Yup.
Important to get on them balls.
What is wrong with me?
"- So then Trevor sends me a text, and he's like,"
"""At this point, I hate you."""
"I'm like, ""Oh, really?"
"'Cause you didn't hate me last week."""
- Trevor sounds like a dog.
- Right?
"God, I missed our daily dishes."
- Me too.
"I'm sorry I'm not reciprocating with ""hot goss"" of my own."
- I'm okay.
What a weirdo.
"You were scared, weren't you?"
The room's a bit cold.
Is it alright?
What about your friend?
Doesn't matter.
She likes me a lot.
And I don't like it too warm anyhow.
"Tomorrow, bean sprout soup."
Okay.
I'll make some delicious soup for you.
"Ah, what a day."
"Tired, huh?"
"Whenever you have time, you can stop by anytime."
Just come and rest in our room.
I'll play really nice songs for you.
"Oh, my!"
You've drunk so much all by yourself.
"I've come by myself, you see."
Why?
What about your companions?
I came alone.
That movie director came by today.
That man you came with last time.
Should I give him a ring?
He's probably too drunk.
"He came with another woman, you know."
"I began talking to him, and he said that woman resembled you very much."
- He said she looked like me?
"- Yes, that's what he said."
"I mean both of you are pretty tall, but you're far more beautiful."
"Like I said, an open book."
How would you know that?
"I spent many years in Neverland, home of the lost boys."
They all share the same look in their eyes... the look you get when you've been left alone.
"Yeah, well, my world ain't Neverland."
But an orphan's an orphan.
"Love has been all too rare in your life, hasn't it?"
You ever even been in love?
No.
I have never been in love.
I think this little guy is hungry.
(Laughs)
"Go ahead and get whatever you want, sweetie."
- I'm gonna get directions.
- I will.
"Hey, man."
How are you?
I've been better.
"Listen, my wife and I... are really lost."
"I'm trying to get to Eugene, and I think we've been going the wrong way."
Can you show me what's going on here?
"Where are we, first of all?"
"Okay, wait."
Do I look like a tour guide?
Why don't you buy the map?
Then I can help you.
Okay.
Okay.
Now your problem is... (Map rustles)
Is you're way up here.
You see that?
"(Door bell chimes) Oh, my God."
Good idea.
"May we search your room, sir?"
But of course.
I trust my map to the street you asked for was satisfactory?
It was.
Thank you.
- Did I get any messages?
"- Oh, yes."
A telephone message.
Alex Bohemia.
Did he leave a number?
Thank you.
You heard that woman.
This Suverov must have been looking for me.
"A stranger with your exact face... and according to the passport, your exact birth date... comes here and asks for directions to the very street where you live."
"A mystery, yes?"
An airline ticket from Nice to New York... and a New York driver's license.
Some U.S. cash.
He was born five minutes after you.
I kept both of you for three months.
But I was sick.
I couldn't nurse.
There wasn't even enough for one of you.
I needed the money.
I had to do It.
Tell me now.
Why did you choose me?
I didn't!
I didn't have the courage.
Somebody else did it for me.
- Somebody else?
- A lawyer from Paris.
For me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes
I think to myself
What a wonderful
"Yes, dude!"
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What are you doing?
"I'm taking the most incredible dump of all time, man."
You couldn't wait till I got out of the shower?
May I remind you that we both just ate 30 burgers... and four large orders of fries?
"Don't worry, in a little bit, I'm sure it'll hit you too."
It may be.
But I'm gonna wait till you get out of the shower.
"Well, don't wait too long."
We've got to leave for the airport in an hour.
"Ooh, that burns."
- An hour?
"- Hey, and, Roldy?"
Yeah?
Nice pubes.
Ooh wee
Ooh wee
When I step into the party all the ladies wanna know
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I have a restraining order!
"Trust me, I restrained myself."
"You can't tell Derek, okay?"
There's a lot more to this that you don't know about.
And just because you got the Alpha bite makeover doesn't give you a license to go around destroying people.
Why not?
That's all anybody ever used to do to me.
I used to have the worst crush in the world on you.
"Yeah, you, Stiles."
And you never once even noticed me.
Exactly how you're not noticing me right now.
Guys!
What the hell's going on?
Hey!
Enough!
Enough.
What do you idiots think you're doing?
Jackson!
Calm down!
"Mr. McCall, you wanna explain yourself?"
You dropped this.
You and you... actually... all of you...
Detention. 3:00.
"Hi, there."
"Oh, I'll make an announcement, have Scott brought to the office."
"Um, actually..."
I came here to talk to you.
Me?
Busy after school?
Always.
–Beauty.
You got the address?
"–Yeah, sure."
"–Oh, geez."
–Corrine...
Don't run away.
Just hear me out for two seconds.
"Look, this running has to stop."
How much time could you possibly need?
"This isn't about me, Vic."
"It's about our kids, about them being safe."
Do you honestly think I'd put my children in danger?
"Not intentionally, but the things going on in your life..."
Something told me to run.
School's back in session.
Matthew needs to be at Glenridge.
He needs his routine.
Cassidy needs to see her friends.
This isn't gonna change things between us.
Don't punish them because of me.
"I'll move out if I have to, if that's what it takes."
But I need to know that they're at home where they can be safe.
I don't...
"I don't know, okay?"
I'll think about it.
"Hey, how'd your meeting with I.A.D go last night?"
Good.
Good.
You ran out of here so quick.
They told me not to discuss it with anyone.
But it went fine.
Anything yet?
"Buy yourself some new sandals, and a round of mouthwash for the table."
"All right, place your bets."
I placed mine on a liberal arts degree.
That's why I'm here.
Let it ride.
"Max, maybe we should quit while we're ahead since we've never been before."
Aren't you worried that we might... 18 again!
Keep winning and never die!
Let's go with four.
The number of men who have flashed me since I've been on this riverboat.
Lucky four!
No more bets.
Whoa!
Who's driving this thing?
Gary Busey?
"Oh, four."
No winners.
"Yes, winners."
"We had four, but then the boat moved our chips."
"Yeah, and it also spilled my soda."
So like I said:
No winners.
"Sure, we lost all our money, but at least you got to see some dongs."
"Hey, Sophie, it's me Car... ah!"
I fall for her...
"""Hello, this is Sophie"""
outgoing message every time.
We need them to send that money.
"Oh, thank God."
"Hi, Sophie, it's..."
What's going on here?
Are you selling pony rides with Chestnut?
"It's, um, hip."
"Or whatever the word for ""hip"" is now."
Yeah.
"Yeah, no, it... it works."
"I, um..."
I work here.
"Or I used to, before..."
I am starting again next week.
I'm sorry.
"I wanted to come back, but I just..."
"I couldn't, uh, get it together."
That's my fault.
"And then, your mom said that you weren't ready to... see me, so..."
Mom told you not to come?
She has her reasons.
I missed a lot.
But when I saw on the news what happened with your... with Piper...
We don't...
We don't have to get into that.
Being a survivor is painful.
Having to remember all of your friends' faces...
This isn't...
"I'm fine, honestly."
I need to ask you this one thing.
Anything.
I understand that you and Mom couldn't make it work.
I get that.
"Sometimes, people just don't fit together."
"And, now, I know what you went through with Piper."
"The lies, all of it."
I understand why you ran away from this place... but...
(TAKES DEEP BREATH)
They looted the jewels...
- What?
!
I couldn't save Deepa either.
If you can't forget her.
If you are so attached to her.
Why am I even here?
Why is this wedding happening?
"Sadhana, please."
I did ask you.
"If you weren't able to forget her, I was ready to step away."
"You kept nodding your head and expressing interests in me, and now you are after her."
"You took the wedding chain as well, didn't you?"
"Had you saved her, Would you tied it around her neck and married her?"
"Mom, ask her to keep quiet."
Why should I stay quiet?
"Sadhana, be calm."
It's not necessary anymore.
I will leave.
I'm not ready to get mislead by him any further.
"I'm sorry, aunt."
I don't want this wedding.
- Sadhana!
"Mom, let's go."
'Who?
What?
When?
'
'Swathi was hanging out with her friends'.
'2 twilight thieves arrested.'
Sadhana.
Sadhana.
Ellis?
You look so pale in corduroy.
Your friends are they?
I got a letter...from the Commission document bombed down in the provinces.
"An exhibition in London, straight after."
And that's for gallery.
Ellis!
Would there be Sunday trains do you think?
"Only that I need to get back to London, Monday mornings."
What are you talking about?
Coming to see you.
"You will be with me, silly."
"Yes, of course!"
After the script is finished.
Umm..get out of that actually.
I don't want to get out of it.
I don't want to let them down.
No. of course not.
"Now, I leave on Monday."
"Umm, I'll be back in London for the exhibition."
I suppose it's not very far off.
No.
It's not so very far off.
And I'll come and visit as often as I can.
"Right, then."
Veal's off.
"I ordered cutlets, Millenezi."
And Cimbalino pudding.
So...so you are Mr.Ambrose Hilliard?
Ye..yes.
I...
I'm Sophie Smith.
I thought you didn't believe him.
You convinced me it was all baloney and now what are you saying?
That Morn went to Paris in order to get pregnant?
I'd better kill myself now.
Maybe
Dad and her jumped in bed every time she got back?
"That makes sense too, doesn't it?"
What did she do?
Vacation.
Just vacation?
She'd show up at my house once a year and rest.
- Did she have someone?
- What?
Did she see someone?
How dare you?
!
"Aunt Rosa, answer us."
We just want to know if Mom had someone.
Before or after Dad.
- Why?
- Because!
Why can't just you tell us?
!
- Why are you shouting?
- Because you annoy me!
"If she shouts I won't tell you anything, not about Algeria or anything."
Algeria?
What about Algeria?
Did she have someone in Algeria?
Did she go to Algeria?
How?
They wouldn't let an Israeli in.
Whatever it takes.
Okay.
"Do the job, Emerson."
I don't wanna look like an ass for sticking my neck out on this one.
"'Cause I've got nothing left, nothing to keep you from the wolves."
0-7-3.
4-5-5.
8-1 -7.
6-9-0-1 -0.
Sorry.
Little last-minute broadcast come through.
I'll inform the authorities.
You do that.
- Wanna hear my latest theory?
- Sure.
We're coordinating troop movements in Afghanistan.
- Long-term tactical formations.
- Yeah.
"Illegal missions unsanctioned by the UN, that's why it's all hush-hush."
Could be.
"- It's good, right?"
- Yeah.
Maybe it's all just some sort of awful experiment.
"Stuff two people in a box, see how long it takes for one of us to kill the other."
- That's nice.
- Give me something.
We're up two hours early next shift.
- You guys been waiting long?
"- No, you're good."
- Good shift?
- Yeah.
Got to catch up on sitting alone for 70 hours.
I was thinking a 99 Euro show.
Do you want something with style or do you want to be cheap?
Who'd pay me that?
Doesn't 99 sound better than 100?
In the supermarket sure...
"But for your event, 99 sounds as stupid as 100."
Sitting up there in his hotel suite and dreaming of the whole wide world...
How much do you think I earn in this place?
Definitely more than we do in our hotel.
"That's your fault, my dear Alfons."
"Just to settle it, Toni's 500 Euro show."
And that's exactly the amount I want for each night.
You've got to be kidding.
Yes Franz?
I just wanted to check up on you.
I'm doing fine.
Are you alone?
No.
How come?
What is all this here?
Who is that?
That's my brother Franz.
Franz this is Max.
Can we talk for a moment Babette?
No.
- Would you leave please?
Why?
Why should I?
Listen this isn't the right time.
Okay?
Who the hell are you?
I don't even know you.
Guys!
Guys!
I'm a fucking genius.
"I know, but look at that painting."
Holy shit!
I know.
"I mean, the camera sees my work before I do it."
It's just incredible.
I don't have to be blocked anymore!
(GROANS)
(GRUNTS) I'm in.
(CHUCKLES) Yes!
Yes.
(CHUCKLES)
(HOWLS)
(SIGHS)
(GLASS CLINKS)
You're up early.
What time is it?
How about we start with what year is it?
"Oh, so you can write in a dead man's journal, but I'm not allowed to wear his hat?"
"This isn't poetry, Jasper,"
I'm making our to-do list.
"If we're really going through with this, we need to start making it look like Mr. B's still around."
"I mean, this is actually happening?"
"What are you talking about, bro?"
It already happened.
It's done.
"Well, I mean, we could just not go through with it."
"Actually, I think we have to."
"If I understand this correctly, this is how it works."
The camera spits out a photo of us in the future.
I stopped at Krispy Kreme donuts.
That's it?
.
"No, that's not it."
The hot light was on.
Feel these things.
They're practically radioactive.
"Please, don't ask me for details about Scott."
"Oh, I'm not going to."
"He's totally wrong for me, he's unpredictable, and his neck smells better than that bag of donuts."
"Apparently your hot light is on, as well."
"But if you don't want to talk about it, I'm certainly not going to probe."
I know you're a very private person...
- Sit.
- You are so easy.
Would this be the same Scott you kissed the other day?
The one your dad detests?
"Hmm, yep, that's the one."
Sleeping with the enemy.
I'm not sleeping with anyone.
And such a shame.
Like a Maserati up on blocks.
"Oh, it's my dad."
"When I left work today to sneak out with Scott, I told him I was coming down with something."
"Hey, Dad."
Sorry my voice is all...
"Yeah, sure, I'll hold for him..."
"Hey, Dad..."
"Yeah, a little."
"Yeah, I know."
A lot of fluids.
Okay.
- No.
Someone has to look after the injured.
We can't take them with us.
- All right.
"- Thank you, Mariá."
I have a question.
"Do you love this country, your homeland?"
"Yes, señor."
Have you explained that we're fighting this war for them?
"Yes, I have, señor."
So why are they staring at me as if I was a venomous snake?
They're just watching you eat because they're not going to get any food today.
Commandante!
Commandante!
What's the matter?
I've intercepted a radio message.
It wasn't even encoded.
They're going north.
So are Silveira and his militia.
- And they've requested helicopters.
- We're leaving right now.
- Get ready.
We're leaving.
- Mariá will take you to San Juan.
Helicopters!
"Oh, my God!"
"Into the jungle, everybody!"
Hurry up!
Take cover!
The helicopters are coming!
Hurry up!
Get into the jungle!
- He hates you.
He hates you.
- Getaway from him.
Getaway.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
"Lucy, did you hear me?"
What?
I asked you if you were upset because Bruce left.
Am I ever gonna get out?
Are you getting sick of me?
What I'm getting sick of is Fish-Stick Fridays.
"You will be leaving at some point, yes."
But our sessions don't have to end.
I would like to be a regular part of your life.
What life?
- Lucy.
"- No, no, you don't understand."
I know what my life should look like.
I know that I should be in school and starting my career and going on dates and making out in inappropriate places but I'm never gonna be able to do that.
I have something for you.
Torts.
Funny.
"You know, that's what drove me crazy in the first place."
That book didn't cause your psychosis.
Law school didn't cause your psychosis.
Didn't help.
Why did you wanna be a lawyer?
You won't impress my showbiz friends.
I'd be impressed if you had any friends.
"Right, that's it."
Your invitation's withdrawn.
Go away.
"Oh, go on, daughter, do me a favour."
Where's your sense of humour?
- Only a bijou jokette.
"- Oh, joke, oh."
Of course I'll impress your friends.
We'll make a bona little team.
The financial artiste.
The theatrical artiste.
And the piss artist.
It's going to be a truly magical evening.
"Blimey, those candles burned down fast."
"Oh, keep it to yourself, Eddie."
Much time has passed.
I'm swathed in melancholic pathos.
- Oo-er.
"- Shut up, Eddie."
"I think you've been stood up, Richie."
Oo-er.
"Oh, shut up, Eddie."
After all I've done.
"A show in a peepshow, robbed a supermarket, been to prison and the rotters haven't even turned up."
Fate deals me blow after blow.
Oo-er.
"What time did you put on the invites, love?"
Eight o'clock.
"Look, I've got 'em here."
"Tarby's, Brucie's, Lynchy's and..."
- Stand still!
- Get out.
All right.
No one will come in here.
Stay on the door.
The Frenchman.
What'd he say?
It's about us being revolutionaries like him.
The captain wants to see me about him now.
Got the petition?
Take care of him.
"We are revolutionaries, but they do things properly."
The French with the guillotine!
"We've had this ship, and Scott-Padget's still alive!"
Wait.
You can go now.
Come in.
"You wish to see me, sir?"
- Mr. Crawford?
- Sit down.
Where are we heading?
"Oh, my committee aren't decided yet."
"Caribbean, South America..."
Anywhere but England.
It's of England I wish to speak to you.
Colonel Giraud has vital information about an intended invasion.
- That's the truth.
- Invasion?
We got the landing places and the approximate date out of him.
But he knows a great deal more.
He must be handed over for questioning at once.
Handed over?
This way.
"Now, I warn you, sir,"
- it's not a pretty sight.
- I'll prepare myself.
You may want to keep your distance as well.
(girl grunting)
"Stay back, sir."
"It may look harmless, but I've seen that thing kill and eat a live chicken with my own eyes."
Really?
"Look no further, sir."
It's your killer.
(grunting)
"How do you know about this, Henry?"
"Well, I paid to see it, sir."
"Ten cents, but it was worth it."
"From the shores of Borneo, sir."
"Could have been the mountains, I don't recall exactly, sir,"
- but someplace...
- Who cares for her?
!
"Well, a keeper."
He collects the money.
"- I don't know, she hardly seems to be..."
- What the hell are you two doing in here?
Show's not open for another hour.
"Detective Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary."
But you still have to pay.
- Ten cents each you owe me.
- I've paid once already.
He hasn't...
- Who are you?
- Mick Travis.
Don't run away.
Just hear me out for two seconds.
"Look, this running has to stop."
How much time could you possibly need?
"This isn't about me, Vic."
"It's about our kids, about them being safe."
Do you honestly think I'd put my children in danger?
"Not intentionally, but the things going on in your life..."
Something told me to run.
School's back in session.
Matthew needs to be at Glenridge.
He needs his routine.
Cassidy needs to see her friends.
This isn't gonna change things between us.
Don't punish them because of me.
"I'll move out if I have to, if that's what it takes."
But I need to know that they're at home where they can be safe.
I don't...
"I don't know, okay?"
I'll think about it.
"Hey, how'd your meeting with I.A.D. go last night?"
Good.
Good.
You ran out of here so quick.
They told me not to discuss it with anyone.
But it went fine.
Anything yet?
- Hi.
I'm Detective Wagenbach.
- All right.
Just a second.
"- Bob, the police are here."
It's worthwhile to die in your arms.
"Yan-ling, you..."
The arrows feel uncomfortable.
"Please pull them out for me, so I can die more peacefully."
Fung-wu!
Take care of yourself!
Bring him away!
Yan-ling!
Yan-ling!
Yan-ling!
"Brother, Wu-tang..."
Wu-tang?
Wu-tang?
We'll be enemies forever!
I!
"Chao Fung, this is a Wu-tang closet for meditation."
You better do your penance here!
Amida Buddha!
Sir!
Please wait.
Amida Buddha!
Shaolin stands high on a mountainous pinnacle and is the origin of all martial arts.
Please give me a chance.
We can't just accept students on their own behalf.
Please treat this as an exceptional circumstance.
I can't make that decision.
Who can?
The Chief Monk!
I'll look for him!
Please don't disturb him.
He's in the chamber resting.
I traveled here with hardship.
"Yes, Sir."
"Yes, it was an accident."
A coconut fell from the tree at full speed and shattered the glass.
Repair cost me 4000 rupees.
This car?
Did you replace a damaged windshield?
- Yes.
How did it get damaged?
Some kids broke it while playing cricket on the streets.
Mohan.
"- Welcome, Sir."
I want the details of those who have changed windshields.
"Here it is, Sir."
A car from Dindigul has been here for a windshield change.
Let's enquire.
This is the number.
"Siri, call..."
"I'm dead serious in the middle of this,"
You are always poking the phone in my face saying 'Siri...'
Can't you even dial a number?
"Sorry, Sir."
I'm used to it.
"Yes, a minor accident."
So I changed the windshield.
I had even filed an FIR to claim insurance.
Do you want the FIR number?
It's okay.
Not necessary.
Thanks.
Are we taking the right path?
Only some places are left.
Let's hope for the best.
I don't care!
Fine!
Do whatever you want!
Why did you come back?
Leave me alone!
Chun-su.
What do you want?
I looked into the tax collection in the village.
"In all, we've paid over 70% of our harvest in taxes."
I bet there is not another saltern city in the country that paid so much!
I'm going to...
Give it up!
Chun-su...
What's this going to change?
Will it bring my father back?
Don't make me in a difficult spot and give it a rest.
Chun-su...
"I don't want anything to do with this, so give it up."
Soon-shin.
Mother...
Where are you going so early?
What are you up to?
And what's that written in that book?
Mother...
A friend's father is dead.
"And if I don't do something, my friend may not be safe either."
But this isn't something you can resolve.
I know.
"I know what's scaring you, Mother."
But I have to do this.
"If I don't, I'll never forgive myself."
Soon-shin!
So we can write some handwritten letters to each other
While you're away.
That is so romantic.
"Maybe if we become famous writers one day,"
"They'll publish 'em after we die,"
Like Sartre and De Beauvoir.
"Maybe, but don't let that stop you"
From writing some of the dirty stuff.
Just a little bit.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
"Not, uh, not if you don't go."
You're gonna be late.
You don't want to be late to meet your new boss.
Get out of here.
Thank you.
"Oh, hey, Holland."
Hey.
Have you seen your mother?
No.
I think she left.
Oh.
Is everything okay?
If Dr. Van Der Woodsen loves your mother
"As much as he said he did in that speech,"
Then maybe there's something she should know about Rufus.
"Listen carefully, s."
Holland has a tale to tell.
"Apparently, her upstairs neighbor"
Has been coming downstairs.
Good night.
Good night.
Take care.
Introduce yourself!
Pleased to meet you.
We got off on the wrong feet.
I didn't know who you were.
"Brother, I have a little party going at the back gate."
Come wet your whistle.
I'm on duty.
I have to guard my prisoners.
Come on?
Are you afraid they'll break out of here when they're barely clinging to life?
Let the new kid watch your post and come with me.
I shouldn't be doing this...
"Oh, it's all right!"
"Kid, stay right here and watch the prisoners."
You got that?
"Chun-su, Chun-su!"
"Chun-su, wake up!"
Water...
Water...
Here.
Here's some water.
I'm sorry...
I caused to you and Chun-su...
"No, it's not your fault."
Baron Huh did this to us.
This is what I get for twenty years of loyalty.
Isn't this pathetic?
But I will not go down like this.
"Baron Huh, that bastard, I will kill him if it's the last thing I do!"
I hope I'm not asking too much of you.
Don't mention it.
Chun-su isn't just your friend.
No.
Because I've heard it all before.
"No, I can't do this any more, Richard."
"Just leave me alone, OK?"
- Sorry.
- Don't be.
"Well, other people's rows."
"Oh, they're great, they're very entertaining."
Especially ones where they're shouting in the street.
"Well, we're done with the shouting."
- Is that why you're here?
- Yeah.
I left him.
- Poor guy.
- He messed up.
- Stupid guy.
"- I like to think I'm the easy-going type but, well, there are some things that can never be forgiven."
Tell me about it.
"My name's John, by the way."
I'm Rose.
"Take her all my money, tell her buy some pretty clothes."
That's a song.
Don't Forget to Give My Love To Rose.
Be nice if somebody would.
Would you like another drink?
"- So, where are you heading?"
- Patagonia.
- Travelling light.
- Mm-hm.
"Well, you don't need much stuff out there, do you, so..."
Just a change of clothes and a bottle of whisky.
"- I don't have any whisky, actually."
- Thanks.
- Be right back.
"Uh, Ms. McCabe, I have to go."
Thank you for your time.
[Gasps]
"Damn it, Alexis."
You're just like your old man.
You can't leave things alone.
Are you going to kill me?
What?
Why would you say that?
"Oh, I don't know."
Maybe because you're connected to my dad's missing time and now you're hiding in the back of my rental car.
"Alexis, I would never hurt you."
This isn't what you think.
"What the hell is your game, Hayley?"
"Believe me, you don't want to know."
Neither does your father.
Why not?
It's complicated.
Jordan Keegan?
We need to talk.
About what?
"Well, your name came up in a homicide."
This is the murder weapon.
It's a prop from a movie that you wrote.
So?
"So, did you happen to keep one as a souvenir?"
Perhaps two?
"One for yourself, one for your partner out in Los Angeles?"
What are you guys talking about?
"We're talking about Pat Crews, your old writing teacher."
I had an affair.
And how did that make him feel?
"Sad, maybe?"
"The reason they're so powerful is because they got the resources, you know?"
"They got investigators and a shit load of money, 200 or 300 little creeps running around there that can search the internet or research whatever they need, you know."
Big operation.
They got everything on everybody.
- Well--
- Sorry I'm late.
Didn't you even know I was late?
We started the trial.
- I'm sorry--
- I know.
I was there for some of it.
It's not going so good for your team.
"I don't know where this came from or what it means, so don't ask."
That right there is the last favor I do for you.
Hi.
How's it going?
"Oh, no."
What happened to your hand?
Please go away.
- No?
- Mm-mm.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Um... what?
Oh.
"We got a couple of creeps, too."
Right.
Okay.
So... these are Stoltz' military records from the Marines.
"Hey, put that on the wall."
"If I can't have my lab, no one's having her."
"Now, don't lose this."
"Fuck you, Akan."
And don't change your channel.
We're coming right over.
"All right, I counted six vehicles."
That's at least 35 men.
We've gotta cut them down to half that before they enter the hotel to give us a fighting chance to get out alive.
"Also, there's a certain stigma attached to blokes who like musicals."
I just wanna get it out there right now that I'm straight as an arrow.
(VEHICLES APPROACHING) Got it?
Here they come.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
(GUN COCKS)
Now.
(GUNSHOT)
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
"Hey, cover me."
(PUNK MUSIC PLAYING)
(LAUGHING)
"Fuck, they're in the hotel."
We don't need the sniper anymore either.
Go inside.
See the colonel.
"Over here, laddie."
Arm yourself to the teeth.
Don't touch that.
Imogene's mine.
That's what my father used to say.
"""A grenade a day keeps the enemy at bay."""
- All right.
OK.
Spare me the lecture.
I already know what you're gonna say so I'm just going to fast forward through all the bull crap that you're about to...
You should be happy for Justin he's your...
Oh.
"I'm so disappointed in you,"
Danny.
Good night.
Let's get high and watch wrestling.
"To be fair, that is what I say first thing in the morning."
"- Danny, Justin's your best friend."
- So?
It's OK to be hurt that he's leaving.
Don't you understand that this is all a ruse on
Justin's behalf?
He's not even really moving out.
Look.
All these boxes are empty.
See?
Oh.
It's all of his khakis.
- I guess he really is moving out.
- Aw.
"Danny, I know how scary it can be to admit how you really feel."
"I mean look how long it took me to admit how I feel about Burski but now I can look you straight in the eyes and I can say ""I love Burski""?"
You don't even realize you said that as a question.
I really do?
I like him.
I do.
OK.
I like him.
Where's his mom?
- What type of mask?
"- Uh, round, like a baby."
Okay.
What do you see next?
[Laughter]
Fire.
"They were grilling lamb, and, uh, people were cheering."
[Rossi] All right.
It was a Greek restaurant.
"Baby, me and gyros?"
"- No, thanks."
- What?
- I'm gonna go check out this Mexican food.
"- Oh, baby, no."
"Baby, I'll be right back."
- All right.
- Stay there.
- I'm gonna come and get you.
- All right.
"[Rossi] Now, do you remember anyone in the crowd, anyone that didn't fit in?"
[Kiersten] No.
"But to be honest, I was already looking at the menu."
"All right, that's good."
"Now, don't look up from the menu."
Just listen to me.
"Now, when you love someone and they step away, there's an instinctive response to glance up to make sure that they're still there."
"Now, you did that last night, even if you don't remember."
Okay.
You're getting ready to place an order.
I already know what I'm getting.
I'm getting the gyros.
Fine.
He thinks I'm paranoid!
"I should bring him the helicopter, then we'll see how paranoid I am."
"Come on, let's go inside."
"- Yeah, it's gone."
- I don't hear anything.
Let's go back to your mother's.
- They all right?
- Beautiful.
They're great.
"Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?"
Didn't I tell him?
Yeah.
I need a hit.
Want to see helicopters?
"Come on, I'll show you helicopters."
"I've seen enough helicopters for one day, thank you."
My plan was I had to get home and get the package ready for Lois to take on her trip.
"Also, I had to get to Sandy's house to give the package a whack with quinine."
"Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass."
"Then I had the cooking to finish, and I had to get Lois ready for her trip."
- It's Sandy.
What is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.
- When are you coming over?
- In an hour.
"- You staying tonight, right?"
- I can't.
I got my brother tonight.
"Come on, stop."
"We'll talk about it later, okay?"
Goodbye.
Why do not you make yourself room.
I'm exhausted.
No heart!
DEATH ...
Book of death?
How to use it .
This is English.
The person whose name is written in the notebook dies
This works if has the face of the person in mind.
This is ineffective on people of the same name and surname.
The cause of death must be written within 40 seconds for that to happen.
Cardiac arrest is systematic absence of cause.
Very fun.
Ouch!
I will not let go .
I would have preferred it to disappear
Ridiculous.
- This is his?
- Yes.
"Yagami, you know some Sakota?"
- Yes.
- Mr. Yagami Light.
Yes.
I checked the content and it's your mobile phone.
He was in his jacket pocket.
Uh...
He reportedly died.
Died?
Water boils!
Last night 23 to 30 h at a motorcycle race he crashed into the barriers a crossing.
He died instantly.
You know him?
I'd rather keep this monkey - than ruin my life loving a man who plays Batman in ketchup.
Right!
I'll change my mind as soon as the dogs stop barking - the stars fall off the sky and the flames of the world are down.
Did you get it all down?
-He did.
"Women are like that, Jesse."
Your mother said the same when she left me.
I love Haitian manioki.
It's the best.
"I'd like to make a toast with you, Marie-Claude."
Perhaps we'll sing the national song of Haiti together one day.
You're wonderful.
"I don't know you, Dad!"
"-No, you don't."
Where's the toilet?
Pee out the window.
I should brush my teeth.
My fiancée has a cold.
"What's wrong with you, Mom?"
Go back to sleep.
This is it.
What's wrong with Jesse now?
He's so weird.
And you hate him.
Are you taking orders from children now?
You're nuts.
It's too late to regret.
-Right.
Did you say that she can see into my soul?
"Relax, Jesse, and let her look."
Don't hide from her.
"Relax, take it easy."
-Just don't bustin' my balls.
"Hey, Tommy..."
"If I was gonna break your balls, I'd tell ya to ""go home and get your shine box."""
This kid was great.
"I used to call him ""Spitshine Tommy."""
I swear to God.
"Oh, he'd make your shoes look like fuckin' mirrors."
Excuse my language.
He was terrific.
He was the best.
He made a lot of money too.
"Salut, Tommy!"
"No more shines, Billy."
What?
"I said ""No more shines."" Maybe you didn't hear about it..."
You been away a long time.
They didn't go up there and tell you.
I don't shine shoes anymore.
Relax.
What's got into you?
"I'm breaking your balls a little bit, that's all."
I'm only kidding with you.
Sometimes you don't sound like you're kiddin'.
"You know, there's a lot of people around."
"Tommy, I'm only kidding with you."
We're having a party.
I haven't seen you in a long time and you get fucking fresh.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you."
"I'm sorry, too."
"It's ok, no problem."
"-Alright, salut."
Now go home and get your fucking shine box.
I didn't come here to give myself a blowjob!
?
What if the sultan never visited his daughter?
What if there was no fruit basket?
The snake would have bit heranyway.
"Oh, c'mon..."
Destiny is not a choice.
Do you really believe that?
"You know it all, don't you?"
Could you stay out of this?
"Gross, what a shit hole!"
"Not forme, thanks."
I agree.
"Imagine; they're swirling around in silk skirts, and red leggings..."
Your new clothes don't mean you're no longer a bear.
And fancy clothes don't make you a princess.
Save yourwisdom for yourcook book.
Was it a long night?
Why?
Show me yourflat.
This is not a good time.
Ljust want the best for you.
When are you sending me the samples?
I am finalising them.
Are you happy with them?
Absolutely.
Have to go now.
"I am worried about you, Daniel."
No need.
You're such a good photographer.
You're wasting yourtime.
"You know, I'm always here for you."
"What did you say, hysterical?"
Who?
Hello?
Hello!
It was me.
"I know, when my... husband behaves well, then I become a beast."
"I lose control, become inexplicable."
"I was sure that it was Gianni again, but I did not have... any inclination to speak nor to listen."
"Love, I tell you something:"
my cock is hard.
"Can you hear, beloved?"
I thought about it and I got a hard-on.
-That's the way it is!
-Who is talking?
-You are not Teresa.
"-Of course not, I am Rosella."
"So what, I have a hard-on."
So what can I do about that?
-Lend us a hand.
-Who allows you of using me?
"Sorry, I continued to believe you were Teresa."
"But I told you, I am Rosella."
"This is just as well, give me a hand, it is good."
What hand?
I do not understand.
"A hand, just a hand."
Indeed!
But you must pretend that my hand is yours.
-You are crazy!
"-Please, don't hang up."
I could not forget that voice.
It's sensuality prevented me.
Because of Mum?
Right.
Do you want me to get rid of them?
'Cause I will if it's bugging you?
"How about you just keep the music down a bit, OK?"
"Thanks George, you're the best."
Good work Dad.
(PARTY MUSIC IN OTHER ROOM)
Hey Shay.
"Gotta love your brother, right?"
He doesn't give up.
"You do know what a lost cause is, right?"
Mm-hm.
"Except it's not, is it?"
"You know it, I know it, so why avoid the inevitable?"
Because maybe I want more for myself?
"Not to be one of the Lindsays of this world, hanging off some random guy's every word to fill the void of my existence."
"Yeah, but I'm not some random guy, am I?"
But you might as well be.
Dad?
"It's time, Dad."
Time for what?
We want our house back.
Fair enough.
Alright everyone!
Just...
"Sorry to break up the party everyone but it's time to move it elsewhere, please."
Sorry.
"Thanks for having us, Mr T."
It's been spiritual.
"Yeah, thanks Ollie."
No worries mate.
- At Brian's house.
- Oh my God.
Can you believe it?
Right in the front yard.
Brian watched the entire thing through his kitchen window.
I thought you and Angela were really tight.
She was like my best friend.
This whole things been really hard for me to accept.
But Brian wouldn't lie.
So it's like...
it's like she's this completely different person.
Like a slut?
No.
"No, she's not."
I think she's just confused or something.
- Do you want me to kill her?
"- No, it doesn't matter."
Brian's the one who ought to be killed.
He should definitely die.
You know he's going to rat on Rickie.
What actually is there to rat on Rickie.
Do you know?
"I know whatever he did, he did because he had to."
You haven't had to clean him up after some Neanderthal...
beat the hell out of him.
"Come here for a minute, son."
Rickie Vasquez.
Are you familiar with the name?
Excuse me?
"What can you tell me, son, about Rickie Vasquez?"
He goes here.
"I don't, I mean..."
You can't just sit here.
Hello.
[dialing]
Yeah.
Chayton.
Chayton.
This is Otto Bernhardt.
Listen...
"Well, there's a fellow here in my office, and he refuses to leave."
"In fact, he refuses to even talk."
I suspect that he's here on your behalf.
"Actually, he's there for you, to help you make sure nothing happens to my money."
"Yeah, but that's... that's... that's really not necessary."
"I'll see you in the morning after my case is dropped, when I come to get what's mine."
Whew.
That's better.
Good to get out of those church clothes.
"I tried cleaning this up, but he about bit my head off."
"That's what marriage is, mostly... putting up with each other's shit."
[doorbell rings]
You expecting anyone?
I am.
- [knocking] - [door opens]
- I'm sorry to interrupt...
- Hi.
"... but, uh, this gentleman says he's here to see you."
Ah.
Dr. Barrett.
You met my grandson?
Just now.
"Yeah, if you need me,"
- I'll be in my room.
It'll soften the blow.
It doesn't matter what I do.
He is never going to forgive me.
Of course he will.
You're his only daughter.
He has to.
"Congratulations, by the way."
- Thank you.
- How's it going?
Good.
Good.
"Okay, talk to your father soon, please, because I need your help on Saturday with the Novack wedding."
They want five additional cakes.
Cakes.
Mom-- mom!
Mom.
What?
"You don't even ask anymore, you just assume?"
What if I have plans?
Do you?
- That's not the point.
- What's the point?
That I could have.
What time Saturday?
8:00 a.m.
I love you.
I don't know how to tell him.
"Honey, ever since you could crawl, you've been out to prove a point-- that you could do whatever your brothers could do, only you could do it better."
"And you've always been way too smart, except where it comes to your father."
You're 30 years old.
When are you gonna stop looking for his approval?
I thought we were going out.
"In South Korea, there are only five people who know about this."
What's the plan?
Infiltrate Pyongyang.
And take the lives of 30 North Korean generals.
Are you planning to go on the mission?
I can't just give up.
"I will be the one going, you should quit."
You're not alone now.
Kyeong Hee.
Mu Yeol.
"Must have been tiring alone, right?"
I'm sorry.
Please hold this...
"This is our son, isn't it?"
Let me have a look at him.
"Oh, he's really handsome."
"Baby, I'm your father."
I heard that you didn't come out quickly.
Your mother worked so hard.
"Both of you, you are now new parents."
"Ms. Kyung, you've worked hard."
"Kid, she is your sister-in-law."
Thank you for returning safely.
I saw the news.
You don't know how much I was worried.
"Don't worry, I'm all right now."
Crazy guy!
Why would my wife worry about you?
I know that you're as strong as my husband.
"Ah, I'm broken-hearted!"
I need to get married this year at once.
"Well, take good care of sister-in-law."
It's not like you're one of them.
Schanke...
um...
What would you say if...
What would you say if I told you that I was an addict?
"[LAUGHS] Yeah, right, and I'm the Maharishi."
"Hey, wait, wait, wait, I'm serious."
"I'm talking to you, here, okay?"
Seriously.
An addict?
"Wait, wait, we're not talking about the red wine in the refrigerator, are we, because..."
"No, no, no, absolutely not."
"You're perfectly all right, Nick."
You're perfectly fine.
Absolutely not.
Trust me.
[LAUGHS]
So much for step number one.
Yeah?
What's step number two?
[POURING]
"Hi, my name's Nick, and I'm an addict."
"It's the hunger that drives me, and it's not for, um... for booze, or crack, or junk."
"It's for, um..."
I drink blood so that I can live forever.
LACROIX:
What's so terrible about that?
"You have to fight it, Nick."
You don't have to listen to him.
"She's right, Nicholas, don't listen to me."
Listen to your hunger.
Listen to the beast in your veins calling to you.
You knew the whole time!
"All of you, you're all a bunch of idiots!"
"Jimmy, we've lost the war."
Women and children will suffer more than anyone.
You're pigs!
A country full of pigs!
- And what about you?
- Shut your mouth!
You go into homes certain you can... buy everything with chocolate and cigarettes.
I loved her.
You loved her?
So what's stopping you?
You're a pig!
A pig from Cleveland!
I wanted to marry her!
Isn't that her man?
Always there when I need you...
"I won't forget the chastity belt, Cliffton."
At least I haven't forgotten to wear it until now.
- Worried about syphilis?
- I can't believe it!
VDs can be more destructive... than war.
But thanks to penicillin...
"Yes, Captain?"
You're one hour early.
Hospital?
"Yes, I'm coming."
- Could I make a phone call?
- Yes.
- Excuse me.
- Who are you calling?
- I'm calling Ted...
- It's a little tight.
"- Yes, that's to correct your posture."
Soon you'll have a mighty hump.
Now you really are my son.
This calls for a celebration.
Let's fire some employees.
Excellent.
"Okay, let's make this sporting, Leonard."
"If you can tell me why I shouldn't fire you without using the letter ""E""... you can keep your job."
"Uh, okay."
Um--
- I'm a good work-- guy.
- You're fired.
- But I didn't say--
- You will.
Eeeeeeee!
[ Chortling ]
Let me try one.
Mmm.
Mmm.
"Hey, the trail of donuts ended."
- [ Gasps ] Bart!
- [ Gasps ] Homer!
[ Gasps ] What a coincidence!
And a perfect opportunity for you to prove your loyalty.
"Go ahead, Bartholomew."
You may fire when ready.
- [ Groans ] - [ Whimpers ]
Hurry.
Fire him now or I'll disown you.
You'll lose everything.
"The fabulous toys, a lifetime of wealth and luxury... the gift certificate from Blockbuster Video... the freedom to do whatever you want."
That's a Palm.
Keep it.
Got ten more on order.
Why don't you crawl on back to your crib?
"Hey, you need a beer, keg's always on tap."
Yeah.
This ain't right.
What's the verdict?
"Well, other than a few hiccups, it's looking good."
What hiccups?
"According to Julien's statement, he didn't see the shooting."
What do you mean?
He was right there!
He says he was in the woman's apartment.
But I wouldn't worry about it though.
It's gonna be a good shoot.
–Dutch.
–Jordan's alibi checked out.
I ran a records check on everyone in Kayla's building.
–Any hits?
–Two: a woman passing bad checks and a Bob Lindhoff.
Bob Lindhoff?
I just had him down here.
"Nine years ago, an attempted kidnapping charge, later dropped."
She's coming to again.
Get in the car.
Hey!
"Hey, I tried to call, but there was no answer."
We went out to grab a bite to eat.
What's up?
I've got a suspect down at the station I was hoping you could I.D.
You mind coming back?
The lady that went in the elevator...
Is that a student?
No.
I think that I know her family...
"No, no."
She's a teacher.
"Hi, sweetheart!"
Ready for cyberspace?
I just got in a very exclusive chat room.
A friend has just arrived.
She's an Internet virgin.
You do this every night?
No.
On Thursdays I eat at my mother's... then I come home and take a Valium.
Wouldn't you rather meet someone live?
In a real place?
Like at the beach?
And compete with those teenagers who live at the gym?
No.
Thank you.
By any chance... do you meet live people in real places?
No... but I don't want to meet anyone.
Everyone wants to meet someone.
I already met the person I was supposed to meet... and I married him.
Are you divorced?
No.
Widowed.
I'm sorry.
"No, Nadine."
It's not like I'm some traumatized madwoman.
"Okay, but I am."
Must be Gary.
- I don't blame you for not trusting me.
"Look, if it makes you feel any better, the Marta I knew wouldn't be involved in anything like this."
People don't change that much.
"Jacob, where are we going now?"
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get her back.
"If I'm gonna save her, I'll need your help."
Can I trust you?
C'mon.
That's it.
"Shit, c'mon."
Jared.
How'd you recognize me?
From pictures.
Of us together.
Where's Jacob?
"Take me to Julia, and when I know she's okay, I'll call him."
"What would you say if I told you, uh she was still in Italy?"
Then you don't get your money.
"Good old Jacob, huh?"
I shoulda known he'd keep the game interesting.
Where is he?
Is he looking at us now?
Is the girl in Italy?
"No, she's here in Zurich."
I have a taxi waiting.
How long was I with you?
Not long.
You were setting me up.
To get the money.
(speaking German)
How did we get together?
Does it really matter?
"- Hey, Katie."
- Mm-hmm?
"Why don't you sit your bottom here, next to me?"
"Oh, Vali, I think I'm going to go ahead and probably sit next to anyone else."
Fair enough.
- I'll sit there.
- Okay.
Mom.
Do you want to go ahead and sit next to me?
Oh!
I would love that.
"Hey, I'm sorry things got awkward with us today."
Let's just start over.
"Happy Thanksgiving, Greg."
"Oh, happy Thanksgiving."
You...
You just unhooked my bra.
That's not even a thing I can do if I'm trying!
"Oh, Greg."
"The one time a year we get little marshmallows on sweet potatoes, and you're too high to put them on the table."
I made a lot of bad decisions yesterday.
You're telling me.
You left the oven on all night long.
You could have burned down the house.
I also left the sink on.
It would have put out part of the fire.
Oh.
No!
"No, no, no, no, no!"
What?
"Apparently, I also agreed to make an ""Amazing Race"" audition video with my mom."
"Always say no to drugs, Katie."
What?
I'm already married.
"No, you're not."
That was private.
It was a private conversation.
You had to buy the ring yourself in Woolworths.
"When times got hard, he tried to send you back to Wales, and he's disappointed in you?"
"He's a stupid bloody fool, but he's not as much of a fool as you."
"He changed your name, for Christ's sake!"
Where's your fucking self-respect?
How dare you?
You have no one.
You don't know.
- I know you deserve better.
- You?
You're the better?
Catrin-
- I-
- I--
I think-
"- Look, I think you're mustard."
And I think...
"you're a drunk, squalid bully."
Come and get out of the water.
- Hush!
You were speaking of Flight Lieutenant Lundbeck.
Ah.
You know he only did the film under orders.
"""They told me it would be good for Eagle Squadron recruitment, sir."""
"He's desperate to get back in the air, poor boy."
"- Tea, sir?"
- Thank you.
- Please.
"Rick, please, I didn't mean to start anything like this."
Please just let me hold you.
You need to sleep.
"Lil, I'll call you."
It'll be okay. lt will.
You wouldn't want to be a flower girl.
[Zoe] How would you know?
You're supposed to look like a robot who marches up the aisle dropping rose petals.
- What's wrong with that?
- l'm so glad you're not making this complete spectacle with this wedding.
"What if you have two flower girls, me and Jessie?"
Mom?
- Mom.
- lt's okay.
What's the matter?
Nothing. I'll tell you later.
"Mom, are you okay?"
[whispering] No.
"No, honey, I'm not, but I will be."
"Oh, Mom."
I'm okay.
"- [woman] Karen Sammler's here,"
"- Oh, great."
"Oh, uh, how you doing?"
[stammering] I want you to know how much I appreciate this.
- l'm not doing this for you.
- l didn't mean...
- lt's for my clients.
- Of course.
And I need something from you in return.
I didn't know you engage in back-scratching.

"When Cassie shows up, remember, all you have to do is believe."
And don't limit yourself to what you can see.
You know?
"I mean, we can't see the air."
- Hmm.
- Does that make the air less fucking real?
No.
- What page?
- 16.
"Jesus Christ, you're a slow reader."
Yeah.
"Oh, here we go."
"[Cassie] Oh, hey, ""kiss and run."""
"P.S., uh, I lied, those were my balls."
You're welcome.
Hello.
- [groans] - [chuckles]
"Uh, look um, fuck it."
I'm not gonna apologize for kissing you.
"I did what I did, and..."
that's that.
So.
[inhales] Yep.
- [sighs] - [chuckles]
"Ahh, well, that's way too long of a pause."
"I've overplayed my hand, haven't I?"
"Look, despite almost losing a tooth on impact, the kiss was nice."
You running away was fucking weird.
"Yeah, I think I used up, uh, all my adrenaline on the kiss, and I...had to hide in the men's room until closing to recharge."
[both laughing]
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!"
"Stop, stop, stop!"
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!"
"No, don't, don't!"
Don't!
Don't!
Stop!
Stop!
No!
"Oh, fuck."
That was one second.
Either he's super susceptible to this or the software is way too powerful still.

Why did Cooper go?
- I...
"- Mom, I'm right here."
I'm...
"- I'm right here, Mum."
- I have to call Cooper.
I have to call and make sure that he's safe.
I have to call him.
I have to call him.
I have to call him.
"Guys pulling out, that's how I ended up with a kid in the first place."
"All right, fine."
I'll do it.
But it's not fair.
You asked me in the middle of sex.
"I was like: ""Uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"fine, I'll take him to Dave  Buster's."""
"Okay guys, quick announcement."
"It's a new year and I wanted to spice things up a little bit, so I decided to dye my hair red and then I chickened out."
Thank God.
Because red hair is the worst.
"However, I did convince Candace to do it."
Yeah!
I love it.
No.
I love it.
It's so good.
It's like a...
like a nice warm bowl of tomato soup.
"If I had a grilled cheese, I would just dunk it on your head."
No I love it.
Like your whole head's on fire.
"I love you, fire-head."
Yeah.
"All right, Brett, I'm going to kill you."
- What do you have against red hair?
- I love redheads.
"When you sleep with them, it's like putting a fire out with your penis."
Just look.
The first time my dad cheated on my mom he was
- dressed as Ronald McDonald.
- What?
Are you crazy ?
It's Jimmy Cooper's flare gun.
I found it in the hall closet when I was looking for rain gear.
"Yeah, but it's not raining."
"Well, this was last November."
What ?
"Jimmy doesn't need it anymore, and it's cold, and it's shiny, and it feels so good in my..."
Here.
You try it.
Eww !
I'm not touching your pistol.
That is stupid and dangerous.
"Oh, my God."
Go 187 on that zombie ass.
It's in the kitchen.
Follow me.
Stop or I'll shoot !
"Oh, my God !"
I've been hit !
Mom ?
Taylor... you shot me !
sorry
I came here because I was worried about you.
"I know, Mom, and it really means a lot to me that you did."
"Save it... that's the last maternal instinct I'll ever have, since you shot me."
It was just a toe nick.
You're totally fine.
Until sandal season !
"Taylor, I'm going to have to see a plastic surgeon right away."
"I already told you, there's no way to get you to the hospital."
You're just going to have to tough it out !
Pancakes is hurt !
Are you sure about this?
If the bag is   so give it to Marie.
Okay.
- Do you want him to die?
- Who are you?
Lisa's boyfriend.
It is our son.
Why do you help him?
- We must first know what has happened.
- At the expense of his life?
We only need new identities.
Give us a chance.
Murderers must serve their sentences.
Armed men entered the apartment.
Frank defended us.

A friend at Kungsgatan have seen Wagner.
He is heading for North Stan.
See now picking up speed.
- Wagner are Kungsportsplatsen.
- We must not let him get away from us.
Others are looking for the reward.
Two shots to the head should be enough.
- Yeah.
- The end.
And the last.
- Anyone wanna talk about auditioning?
"- Oh, God."
"Oh, yeah."
"Remember, there was that huge to-do about my hair and my makeup and all that stuff on my last audition."
"Remember, Pete?"
Remem...?
Somebody went...
Did you go shopping for clothes?
- I went shopping for clothes.
- You brought options.
- I bought 800...
- That was the first time we met.
- That's right.
- We read together.
"Pete and Kerry Kohansky gave me pointers and really helped me out, you know."
Was this something I shouldn't talk about?
Never mind.
- That was all a lie.
- We should talk about...
Let's rewind and...
"Wait, seriously, should we go redo that?"
"No, it's okay."
"Oh, shit."
"Should we talk about that today is September 24th, 2008?"
- It's one week till the premiere.
- What's today?
"One week from the premiere, today."
- We have one week till the premiere.
- That's exciting.
She ain't bad.
"Yeah, she's the chick, all right, but she don't wanna do it."
"Well, shit, I'll go somewhere else."
"Now, now, wait a minute."
"If we discipline her a little, she'll be glad to do it."
"You'd like to watch that, wouldn't you?"
- Yeah.
- No!
[Whimpering]
[Laughing]
"Eh, can I, uh... yeah, but it's gonna cost you extra."
"Yeah, all right."
Go get your toy.
"No, ah!"
[Whimpering]
No... no!
"No, no."
[Gasping]
"No, no."
"Oh, please!"
[Screaming]
Do you have to get up early?
"I'm supposed to have the day off, but, uh, you never can tell."
What's your day like?
"So far, so good."
"Yes, Al, we're ready on the floor."
Twenty seconds to air.
"Mic up, over there."
"Sit down, here we go, in ten..."
"Five, four, three, two... good morning, I'm rodger grimsby."
"Here now, the news."
"Early today, the grisly remains of a reputed meat mobster, gino pontivini, were found on the floor of a warehouse in the South Bronx, beneath a huge meat grinding machine."
"Soon, I imagine."
Good.
I will wait.
"So I wait and wait and wait and wait, and still she doesn't come or call or anything."
What makes you so sure she didn't know you were there and why?
What kind of talk is that?
"- Please, Carl."
- Please what?
Why do you need a woman to do things for you?
To ask about things?
This is none of your business.
"Well, you sure don't need help from the lady who fixed up your contract with Somers in the first place."
You be quiet!
"Oh, stop it, Axel."
Both of you.
Stop it.
"So, what about you, Lisa?"
"You think I'm becoming a mouse, too?"
Huh?
All right!
I show you!
I show everybody!

"I'll get it, Della."
Mason speaking.
"No, no, you just caught me."
We've been working late.
"Mr. Mason, you'll be in your office first thing in morning, yes?"
"Well, I'll be here, but I have a calendar full of appointments."
Cancel them.
I be there at 9 sharp.
And then you fix Somers for me.
I think I got some in your steaming hot pocket.

Not a whisper.
If the Navy find us in this soup...
What's happening to the Navy?
Looks like a long swim home.
Do you swim?

"- Chills, you guys."
"Literally, chills."
"- Hey there, Nikolaj."
It's your papa.
"If you're watching this, something bad has happened to me."
But I want you to know that I love you very much.
- You want to stop filming yourself and help me with these many items I'm carrying?
"- Sorry, I was making a video for my son."
"You know, in case I never see him again."
Do you not do that for your kids?
- Of course I do.
I make those kind of videos all the time.
"You know, in fact, I was about to do one right now."
"Hey--hey, girls."
"It's me, Daddy."
"If you're seeing this, I'm dead."
But I want you to know that I love you now and forever.
"- Okay, time for a lullaby, sung in your native Latvian."
Ligo!
Ligo!
Ligo!
"- Yeah, yeah, lullaby time."
Look.

- What the hell are you guys doing?
- Good call.
Blocking the door.
"Keep it up, smorty-pants."
- Oh--
- Uh--
"- That's a good thing, eh?"
"- No, thin like you're not eating properly."
Oh!
"Yeah, I don't have time to go to fancy restaurants like you."
- Are we doing this now?
- You were out for a date on our anniversary?
!
- How do you know it was a date?
!
I just wanted to see you.
I haven't asked you if you're seeing anyone else and I'm not going to because I just can't.
- He's a friend.
"- Oh, well..."
- And a divorce lawyer.
- What?
"- I'm worried, Harry."
I don't want to lose anything else after the house.
So that's what you were discussing with your friend the divorce lawyer over dinner?
"- Well, that's very convenient, eh?"
"- You're still gambling, aren't you?"
What?
Aren't you?
"I'm trying, Anna."
"Do something about it, Harry."
For all of us.
Mr and Mrs Clayton?
OK?
Mr Clayton?
There's someone to see you.
I'm sorry about your daughter.
Is she OK?
Yes.
"Okay, you go on, I'll be right there I go first..."
Okay!
This is the best harvest ever!
"Ah-fang, you devil!"
Stop crashing around!
What're you in such a rush for you idiot?
I'm racing with Master Chang I left that old fellow 80 feet behind!
Eighty feet behind?
Who...who's that?
Somebody's stolen the grapes!
Yes...for the third time already!
Can we still make Night-sweet Premium?

The film that we might work on together is actually sort of about that.
You're gonna work with Jim Jarmusch?
I don't want to go to a bar on Smith street.
Let's just go back to my place.
"I live with my dad, but he'll be out tonight."
- We can have a drink there.
- What year are you again at N.Y.U?
- Senior.
- Senior?
Okay.
"Wait, so you're 22, right?"
I'm going to be soon.
I'm 21.
"You don't think i'm too old, do you?"
I'm 30.
30 is cool.
I've been with guys older than you.
But are you a man or a boy?
"Well, what's the difference?"
With a man... you feel like you're being taken and you like it.
And with a boy you feel like they're stealing something from you and you don't like it.
This is it.
Thank you.
"Shit, my dad is home already."
We can go to seventh avenue and grab a drink.
We're going in his office.
It's fun in there.
It's a beautiful brownstone.
- Your dad's a therapist?
"- Yeah, he's a pain in the ass."
He thinks he's the Carl Jung of Brooklyn.
I like Carl Jung.
Yeah.
Do you remember that he had scars on his face?
"Oh, sure."
It would look like he was burned.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"This is where your father had his office, right there, where it says tickets, upstairs."
That's 1501.
"That's where he was, right here."
[truck roars by]
(Kahn) The office at 1501 Walnut Street was the last place I saw my father.
My mother would bring me here sometimes after hours and on weekends.
Lou would lean out the top floor window and toss down a key wrapped in yellow tracing paper to let us in.

You will die together.
"Give my regards to King Tut, asshole."
How much time do we have left?
- 45 seconds.
He's leaving.
Turn it off.
- I can't disarm it.
- What?
They've got it rigged.
I got an idea.
I always knew you'd get us back.
"- Yeah, right."
- Later.
"Thanks, Daniel."
You sure you wanna do this?
She doesn't want to see me anymore
And i don't want to see her either.
"Look, i'm not gonna keep arguing with you about this."
"Michelle, you need to fix it."
- You don't need to keep...
- You need her.
Don't need to keep what?
"Hi, regina."
So what do i owe to this displeasure?
You know what?
I told you this wasn't a good idea.
See?
"I'm sorry to bother you, regina,"
May we please come in for a second?
We will not stay long.
I promise.
"Well, my day couldn't get any worse."
Come on in.
Get going.
so i brought michelle here
Because i think we all have some things we need to clear up.
Michelle told me what happened and...
And i'm sure she gave you
Her twisted version of things.
"Look, regina, i am tired of you disrespecting me."
"First i'm stupid, now i'm twisted?"
- You know what?
Let's go.
"- First, regina..."
Shh-Tch!
"First, regina,"
I want to apologize for any misunderstandings
You're Lori's trampy friend.
"Oh, no, that's Hillary."
"Well, whoever you are,"
Amanda is not allowed to have visitors.
"Oh, but do tell Kyle, ""Nice try. """
Hey!
Dad!
Josh!
Guess who was a hit at the symposium?
I knew you'd be.
"Yeah, I was a little nervous when I got there, but I look out and I see a room full of computer science geeks."
My peeps.
Sounds like... really fulfilling and fascinating stuff.
"Say, uh, why don't you take a load off, and I'll put that projector away for you."
Sure.
Thanks.
That's our block?
On a map of the power grid.
There's our house..
and Amanda's.
And how does that help?
I need to know how the neighborhood is wired.
"This has high-voltage cables, transformers, utility lines, breaker panels-"
It's part of the plan.
I'm back.
"Jessi, please try to use the-"
Oh.
Front door.
Right.
How'd it go?
12154.
"So, uh, I'll see you at the Rack later?"
I know nothing about bullfighting but a lot about desperate women.
Yeah?
And who told you I'm desperate?
You gave me that impression.
You don't care about bullfighting.
You're interested in my relationship with El Nino.
"Tell ""El Pais"" the answer's no and leave me alone!"
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Get me out of here!
- What's wrong?
"Get me out of here, please."
There's a snake in the kitchen!
Give me the keys.
- The door's open.
"- Calm down, and stay here."
My purse...
Thank you.
Take me to a hotel.
I'm never going back to that house.
Which hotel?
"- The Eurobuilding, for example."
- Very well.
"Don't tell anyone about this snake business, please."
- Only my family knows about it.
- Don't worry.
One thing I respect is other people's phobias.
"After all you've done,"
I feel bad about saying no to the profile.
Sleep on it.
I'll call you tomorrow for your decision.
Thank you for everything.
Why would he do that?
- Objection.
Speculation.
- Sustained.
"Mr. McBride, do you have any other questions for the witness?"
"Yes, sir."
"I have plenty more-- about Karl Stoltz, but you won't let me ask them."
That line of questioning has been shut down.
"Please move on, sir."
Gabriel... um...
"Well, Your Honor, I'm a little stuck here."
Ms. Senate.
"You have no idea what made that boat blow up, do you, Mr. Marquez?"
Not really.
Thank you.
"Officer, Mr. Marquez is done."
"Mr. McBride, call your next witness."
Mr. McBride.
Mr. McBride!
I-
- Do you have another witness?
"Yes, your Honor."
The plaintiff would like to call Wendell Corey to the stand.
He's not on the witness list.
He's not even here.
He doesn't have to be on the list.
He's a party to the action.
Mr. Corey has no information about what transpired on that boat.
"Oh, that's great."
Let him testify to that.
"Your Honor, this is unfair surprise."
We have the right to call him.
You don't think you can eat that.
We're building us a smudge pot so Patton can find us when he comes.
"Twenty parts of cellulose, one part phosphorous."
Watch.
He'll be able to see our smoke signal four miles away.
But Patton is 400 miles away.
"Well, I say, be prepared."
"- Heh, Ok, boy scout."
"-Hey, look what we got."
- The phonograph!
- Music!
"Put it down here, boys."
- We made a deal with Barracks 1.
"-Now, where's that distillery?"
"Over here, boys."
Let's have that distillery.
"Come on, we swapped it for the phonograph."
"Any objections, Sefton?"
Take it.
"- Hey, Price."
Any news on Dunbar?
-Huh?
"He's still at the kommandants office, that's all I know."
Don't worry.
When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
- We'll give him a hearty welcome then
- Hurrah!
Hurrah!
The men will cheer and the boys will shout
The ladies they will all turn out
"- huh, you dipshit?"
"- Uh, Gene?"
G-Gene?
"Uh, no, I'm not coming to Fort Lauderdale."
Why would you think that?
What?
[Chuckles]
"Because you're still using the corporate credit card, you dummy."
"Listen, Nate,"
I don't know why you're doing this.
I don't know if you're trying to embarrass me.
I don't know if you're trying to sell this product to another company.
"Hey, man, I thought you cared about this company."
[Laughter]
Of course I care.
"What are you talking about, man?"
- I care more than anyone else.
- Shh.
I put so much on the line for this!
"I lied to my wife, I lied to my family"
- because I care so goddamn much.
- [Laughter]
"I told you he would cry, right?"
"You girls owe me shots, shots, shots."
- Am I on speakerphone?
"- Oh, yeah."
"Me and the ladies,"
- we needed a new drinking game.
- [Laughter]
"So, uh, listen, I'll let you go."
"You drive safe, sweetheart."
[Laughter]
I can't tell.
Uh...
Who is this?
We're her friends.
Do you have a problem with that?
"Yeah, I have a problem with that."
And I have a problem with you looking at me like that.
Who are you to look at me like that?
I don't like him.
Let's go.
Me neither.
Who are you to look at me like that.
"Come on, Kathy."
Bye.
Wait.
I can't.
"Friends are really hard to get, especially when you're pregnant."
I'll talk to you later.
Isn't it harder to get a boyfriend when you're pregnant?
(ALL GIGGLING)
Ben just wants to see his girl.
Ben needs some happiness in his life.
He deserves it.
"I don't feel like letting him pretend to date me, okay?"
I don't like that.
That would be using me to do something that I don't even think he should do.
And Ben's my friend.
He shouldn't ask me to do something I don't want to do.
I've got the harder part.
I have to go over and convince Dylan's parents to let her go out with me.
But I think I'm up to the challenge.
It could be fun.
The great yoghurt investigation.
Oh.
I thought we would just be bringing our own lunch.
"Oh, I thought I'd bring lunch."
My treat.
"Oh, I thought we would just be having our own Tupperwares-type thing."
You weren't taking me out to lunch.
"No, but..."
It wasn't like a date.
No.
"I mean, two middle-aged people on a bench in Piccadilly."
"It's not exactly Roman Holiday, is it?"
No.
Be nice if it was.

Blackjack's a great game.
"No, look, it's easy to learn and there's really not as much strategy to it as people think."
"I grew up on it, actually."
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.
"Every night after dinner, my father and I would play."
"I knew basic strategy before I was, like, nine years old."
"If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream."
And what if he won?
He'd still take me out for ice cream.
"Oh, yeah."
"Sure, yeah, he's your dad."
"Ben, you should feel the thrill of winning more money than you can possibly imagine."
I think you should come to Vegas.
'Cause I'm guessing that you could probably use a break from this place.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Okay.
"If you change your mind, you know where we meet."
Yeah.
You're welcome any time.
"You know, I think the best thing about Vegas is you can become anyone you want."
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.
- No.
- Plus 11.
No.
"- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago."
"- Don't call me ""dude."""
- Plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.
"What, are they getting engaged?"
I don't know.
I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy's stupid astronaut story!
What astronaut story?
You texted me Penny's dating an astronaut.
"I texted ""architect."" That's amusing."
Auto-correct must've changed it.
"Yeah, it's hysterical."
"All right, look, just forget about the astronaut."
Architect.
Where would you have met an astronaut?
"Look, just find out what's up with this trip to India."
I don't want to do this anymore!
Don't you quit on us!
"Bernie, you okay?"
It was an architect!
"Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon."
You're a good friend.
I'm glad you think so.
That's what I strive to emulate.
"Okay, let's see if this drug works."
Can I help you?
"Forgive me for staring, but you're very beautiful."
Thank you.
That's a great accent.
Where are you from?
India.
"Oh, cool."
I've always wanted to go there.
It's a beautiful country.
You'd love it.
May I join you?
We could launch a drone off of any carrier in the gulf and hit any target we want.
"Excuse me, miss."
"Sir, you can't leave that there."
"Hey, buddy!"
"Twenty-four, I'm in the rotunda."
I got a maintenance--
"Eli, you all right?"
"Keep moving, let's go, push."
Get your security teams up.
Mr. Speaker?
Mr. Speaker?
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
We have to get out of here.
You follow me.
- Where's the vice president?
- In the chamber.
Tell him we need to institute Continuity of Government.
- I tried.
He's been cut by some glass.
- Now stay close.
"Don't panic, take your time."
There's been an explosion at the Capitol building.
- And?
- I'm crashing the White House.
We're crashing the White House.
Get the CAT Team.
I want all nonessentials evac'd.
Get that hallway clear if we have to move.
"Sergeant, bolt these doors."
I need Marine 1 here as fast as possible.
"Sir, I need you to move away from the window, sir."
She's very classy and even prettier in person.
I must say this could change everything.
Yes!
"Oh, are you gonna finish that sandwich?"
I've been driving all day.
-Please.
-Thanks.
Now we're just gonna need some proof of employment.
Some what?
Some pay stubs tax records.
Just something I can submit to the board.
Miss Montana pays in cash.
Is proving this going to be a problem?
Of course not.
[Growls]
How'd it go?
Stupid proof of employment.
Tax stubs.
No cookie.
I drove 200 miles just to say...
You want proof Cookie Lady I'll show you proof.
Hey uh why didn't you just use the emergency Hannah kit.
You keep in your car?
Because I forgot!
[Mimicks cat snarling]
Yes Miley the directions you gave me were perfect as usual.
Now if I could just find that incredibly competent and extremely attractive.
Admissions woman that you described.
[Gasps] Oh wait there she is.
You are the best.
"Kiss, kiss."
Bye.
"So, um, so just out there."
Anybody could tell that old man wasn't...
You can't assume anything about anybody in a case like this.
That's the guy that's going to fuck you.
Damn right.
Shit.
"I been police chief here for, hell, going on, uh, six years."
I never even had to draw my gun.
"Good night, you."
Can you kiss your favorite mommy?
Get in the bed.
Get in there.
Get in the bed.
"See you in the morning, okay?"
"Good night, mommy."
Night.
Enjoying yourself?
Getting enough to eat and drink?
"Well, just about."
"That's your second bottle, isn't it?"
"Yes, it is."
I want to apologize about Dale's comment.
Bet John feels terrible.
Dale didn't mean anything by it.
He just grew up talking that way.
"Well, I understand, and I'm..."
I'm sure John does too.
"These people are pretty dangerous, aren't they?"
"Yes, ma'am, they are."
"You know, I've never seen Dale this excited before."
I guess this is about the biggest thing that's ever happened to him.
"This case, I mean."
I wrote it before I left.
"I got my mum to send it, as an alibi."
E-Eleanor was right.
It was me.
"I'm sorry, Chris."
You convinced me the first time around someone else is going to have to own up.
"For fuck's sake, somebody please!"
"- Come on, don't go all gay on me."
- Fuck's sake.
"- Please, no!"
"- Man up, fella."
"Do you want the truth, Justin?"
Your brother was a creep.
"- No, that's not true!"
"- Yes, it bloody is!"
A creep!
"A weirdo, all twitchy and desperate."
- I thought you were his friends.
- He didn't have any friends.
No one liked him.
None of us.
So you just watched while Chris pushed him around?
I didn't see the fight.
But I saw Felix.
He was upstairs in the bedroom.
Eleanor was going down on me and...
- Felix was watching us.
- What?
"I was getting a blowjob and Felix was standing in the doorway staring at me, with my dick out."
"I told him to get lost, naturally."
"""Get lost, you bloody queer!"" were my exact words, I believe."
Are you saying my brother's queer?
- I have proof.
"You really did it, Lex."
You in here?
What happened?
- You okay?
- Somebody hit me.
They destroyed the picture.
But you were right.
I saw the picture.
It was Lex.
"When I went to see Lex, I found Lionel's locket."
"But without that photo, we can't prove anything."
- What about the key?
- I X-rayed the mansion.
It's nowhere to be found.
- Jimmy and Lois?
Where are they?
- I don't know.
And I'm worried.
"The last I heard, they were leaving the Daily Planet."
If whoever attacked me
- followed the photo from there to here...
- He may have stopped them from leaving the building.
I got to go.
"If Lex has both of those keys, not only will he discover your secret, but he'll have complete power over you."
That's not just your worst nightmare...
"It's everyone else's, too."
Be careful.
I've got an exclusive for you.
"When we get out of here Lois lane and,"
Jimmy Olsen are gonna be world-famous.
Our name in lights.
Everybody loved Stacks.
He was supposed to do was steal the panel truck and afterwards compact it by a friend of ours out in Jersey.
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.
Morrie...
Have a drink and shut up.
Just because he set this up he felt he could bust Jimmies balls for an advance on the money we were going to steal.
He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.
I had everybody working for me.
"Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd."
D'ya have a good flight?
I hate Pittsburgh.
Where'd you find such creeps?
They're not that bad.
"And it's worth it, isn't it?"
is this the same baby you used last week?
"No, that one was my sister's."
This is Deirdra's.
Big yawn.
"She looks just like you, Lois."
That's what the stewardess said.
-Yeah...
"Take it easy, Sandy."
"Come on, Henry..."
Give me a break.
You got enough here to go around.
You got all day.
"Just make it last, all right?"
Take it easy.
-l got to go.
-Where are you going?
Don't start.
"Oh, I'm sure he'd never..."
"- No, that does sound quite like him."
Yeah.
And that's why I want him gone.
"You could be his role model, teach him how to beat it."
"No, no, no."
You've picked the wrong man.
I don't think so.
"Ah, Mitchell, my bro."
- Yes.
- OK.
"Brilliant, brilliant."
"OK, I know we all got off to a bad start but I'm thinking if we all pull together, this could be an interesting, enriching and very brief experience for us all."
"Yeah, level with me, Mitch."
How do you stick it with this sad-arse?
I think you need a new wingman.
"I, sir, am a registered poon hound."
"Have you ever actually had sex, Adam?"
"You know, proper balls-deep sex?"
Have you touched a boob?
"Be honest with me, Adam."
Have you ever even touched a boob?
Because...
Ha-ha-ha!
I have.
Loads!
"Ah, someone doth protest too much."
You don't come near me.
"But, Mitch, we're like brothers in arms."
I'll have a Scotch.
This is near me.
This is where I told you not to be.
What are you doing here?
Oh.
"I, um--"
I came to pick out a dress for Hilla's funeral.
And to listen to her records while you read her diary?
"It's, uh, in German."
"Look, Stephanie, I am the coroner."
That doesn't give you the right to go through her things.
She was beautiful.
My camera loved her.
You took that?
It's a hobby I'd hoped to turn into a profession.
Hillie and I were gonna go back to New York together.
"She was gonna be a big fashion model, and I'd shoot all her covers."
She'd have made it too.
"I keep expecting her to walk through the door, you know?"
Hillie understood life better than most people.
Maybe because she'd seen so much death.
That's why I can't believe she killed herself.
Maybe she didn't.
- What do you mean?
- She may have been murdered.
"Oh, God."
Do you have any idea who may have done it?
No.
Everyone loved her.
No one... would want her dead.
What?
Nothing.
It's not nothing.
What are you thinking?
Truesdale fired her.
"Expect we'd better bivouac at Elephant Rock, as usual."
"Yes, Markham sahib."
"I don't like it, Mitchell."
I don't like it.
Silence is unhealthy.
No word from Markham in 48 hours.
"Blast it, an officer and his patrol don't vanish into thin air."
"- Telegraph just got through, sir."
- Good.
What have you got?
Wires apparently down for the last two days.
I thought it was something like that.
"Emergency signal, sir."
Why doesn't he go on?
"Wire's gone dead, sir."
I don't like this.
Can't have the wires down.
Things start too quickly up there.
Higginbotham.
Find Sgts.
"MacChesney, Cutter, and Ballantine, and bring them here."
"That's a bit difficult, as they're all on leave."
"On some mysterious mission, they said."
It'll be a mystery if they come back right side up.
Bring them here at once.
- What do you want?
- Where's Sgt. Ballantine?
- Here.
- Where's Sgt. Cutter?
He's busy.
Buying a map for a buried treasure.
You ought to have your head examined.
"Well, can we watch ""Lost Boys""?"
I've heard of that one.
Those... those are different lost boys.
"(whistling ""Snowbird"")"
"Are you whistling ""Snowbird""?"
Yeah.
That's awesome.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, why do you get to ring it?"
Because I was into her first.
"(doorbell rings) Let's flip for it, or..."
I can't believe you did that.
I cannot believe you just did that.
(doorbell rings) Will you stop it.
She's going to think we're weird.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Hi.
Miss Murray.
My name's Brian Griffin.
"Uh, first of all, I just want to tell you what a huge fan I am."
"Aw, that's very sweet of you."
And I'm Stewie.
I'm the one who sent you the vibrators.
"Well, I'm glad you enjoy my music."
Would you like to come in?
We'd love to.
"Wow, nothing says success like free on a Tuesday at 3:00 p.m."
I'll get there.
"So, Miss Murray, the reason we came is that we have a question about ""Snowbird."""
"It's about a relationship, right?"
"No, no, it's obviously about the fear of growing old."
"You know, I think you're both kind of right."
"Die, you sucking pervert!"
"Dr. Corday, hi."
We need some Haldol here!
- You think that's necessary?
- Yes!
"Doctor C, looking good."
"Thanks, Malik."
"So, what's the GCS on this motorcycle trauma?"
"- Sorry, I didn't do the ride."
- Oh.
"Well, have the X-ray tech..."
- ... come down for portables.
- You got it.
- Hold the CT till we eyeball the patient.
"- Hey, welcome back."
Thanks.
So do you know any of the specifics?
"Sixteen-year-old girl, motorcycle versus utility pole, no helmet."
Carter's bringing her in.
- What's a chick doing on a motorcycle?
- What's anyone doing on a motorcycle?
"Have the rapid infuser primed and ready, draw her up 100 of fent four of Ativan."
Make sure the airway drugs are out of the box.
- It's like you never left.
- Yeah.
Vital sign.
- We need some O-neg.
- She got a rhythm?
- P. E.A. to agonal before arrival.
- Decreased breath sounds.
Intubated for agonal resps.
Didn't know you were back.
"All of sudden she.said, ""Excuse me'"
"I said, yes please?"
"She said, ""My watch isn't working."
"Could you tell me the time?"""
I know.
This is an outdated idea to start a conversation.
Quite possible her watch must have stopped working.
You are unnecessarily suspecting her.
- No need to advocate for her.
What happened next?
- What else?
I told her the time.
Again there was a silence.
There was no sign ofthe bus.
I decided to walk. I had just put a step ahead and she said...
"""Listen""."
"-l said, yes, tell me."
"She said, ""You are leaving me alone over here"""
"""l am scared to be alone."
"Can you drop me home?"""
Why?
Was the bus-stop in a forest?
-Not exactly.
But she was afraid.
I told her to come along.
Then we started walking.
I felt like the poor thing was a bit tired.
"You know there are benches on the footpath, don't you?"
I told her to sit down for a few moments.
She sat down.
Then I saw that she was staring at me.
I asked Meena whatthe matter was.
Do you guys want to go see a movie?
Ooh. hold on. hold on.
Hello?
Check your bank account. your money's back.
It's georgina.
Georgina where are you?
what happened to poppy?
You don't have to worry about her ever again.
You got your money. that's all that matters.
- Now you can go to yale. - well i'm going to n.y.u. now.
Oh. great. then i'll see you next year.
Wait. what does that mean?
Hello?
georgina?
What?
Georgina sparks?
Yes that's right.
I recently enrolled in gallatin.
Here's my paperwork and my check.
Thank you miss sparks.
Is there anything else?
I'd like to request a roommate-- blair waldorf.
She's my best friend and i just can't wait to live with her.
Serena.
Carter.
Aren't you supposed to be in dubayy?
You know you can't lose me for long. where you headed?
Everywhere.
I have something you might want to know before you go.
I hope it doesn't have to do with blair.
No it has to do with you.
It's about santorini what you were looking for there.
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a cop.
Jeffrey's a professional killer.
He murdered somebody.
I've been after him for months.
- I don't believe you!
-Jenny!
"- Listen to me,Jenny!"
- No!
"-Jenny, it's true."
- Chang!
"Jenny, calm down."
"Listen, please!"
Sit down.
Six months ago...
Jeffrey shot your face up by accident.
Now his employer wants him dead.
I don't believe it!
"I'd like to help, but I can't, in my position."
I hope you'll cooperate with us.
"Jenny, we're using you as bait."
It can bringJeffrey in this time.
I'll save his life foryou.
"Otherwise, the guy who hired him will kill him."
Name your price.
I want him dead.
He was recognized doing thejob.
"I want him wasted, the sooner the better."
"Deposit $1 00,000 into my account now... and $200,000 more upon completion."
"No money, no action, Mr. Weng."
Not even if I see his finger on the trigger ready to blow your head off.
- Put the hundred grand in his account.
No.
"Young man, how much cash do you have on you?"
"It's not a girl after all, it's a boy."
Who would've guessed?
"Fine, have it your way."
(BLADE GRUNTING)
"Noah, hurry up!"
"I've prepared a stronger dose, which I'm hoping will make it last longer."
"The problem is, you're developing a resistance to the retrovirus."
"Fine, fine."
"Enough talking, old man."
Just do it!
(GRUNTING)
(GASPING)
BLADE:
Stop!
"Get out of here, little girl."
Shame on you.
"Not very sporting, killing your prey in his sleep."
Let's let him rest a bit longer.
No?
"He's a hybrid, half-human, half-vampire."
What they call a Daywalker.
"The drug helps suppress his thirst for blood, but the side effects are excruciatingly painful and get worse every time."
Coffee?
"No, thanks."
(CHUCKLES)
"You know, I've known Eric for along time."
We first met on a night much like this.
"Dover, England"
"I'm sorry, mister."
I had to.
Is that your friend?
Your friend Clementine?
"Yeah, you know, as long as people are coming over, maybe she could come over too."
To the apartment with Grace and Jack?
"Wouldn't she be, like, the third wheel?"
Wouldn't she be a fifth wheel?
"Fine, I don't care."
Might as well get that out of the way.
What out of the way?
Making friends with your friends so that hopefully she'll leave you alone.
She's an old friend from a long time ago.
"I never slept with her and I'd never sleep with her and if I tried to sleep with anyone other than you, she'd probably kick my ass."
What does that mean?
That means I said the wrong thing.
I just want her to meet you.
And John.
Fine.
Bring her over.
"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
I wasn't thinking.
Were you on the phone with your wife?
"Yeah, that was Amy."
She wants you to come over tonight.
She wants to meet you.
Why?
You're my friend.
She thought maybe you could be her friend.
Really?
"Okay, I thought maybe you could be her friend."
My friend and her friend.
I don't know.
Why not?
Because my eyes are filled with someone else.
What are you smirking at?
Huh?
You are in serious trouble.
You're going to need fucking flippers... to wade through the shit you're in.
The lady was so upset...
I had to sack out on her couch.
Hysterical crying and shit.
"You know, I'll have to write this up."
You know that?
"Oh, yeah."
"Oh, yeah."
There was one time... me and my friend Dennis...
we were 8 or 9... we were in the front row of the grand stand... and I had a Coke in my hand.
And when I looked down...
"I mean, it was a direct hit."
And I said right there and then...
"I said, ""I'm going to live in one of these buildings... with a view like this."""
What?
You want to go inside?
Shh.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Open your eyes.
I want you to look at me.
My face is so fat...
I don't think Ray wants to sleep with me anymore.
I'm growing a mustache.
"No, it's the medication."
They're not here.
Ray took them to the movies.
"Look, come over."
I haven't felt this good in years.
[chuckles] i knew the future looked bright.
i knew it.
- yeah.
"[clicks tongue] they didn't get along so well after, you know, the incident with... little tim."
- what happened with tim?
- [sighs]
"- hey, hey!"
what happened to tim?
- oh. oh. oh.
"so suddenly you care about tim, huh?"
- i've always cared about peepers!
- [sighs]
- what happened to my harley?
"- remember the phrase,"
"""i'd rather push a harley than ride a honda""?"
- yeah.
- that's for people who could afford them.
"you were too good to ride a honda, but too lazy to work to make the money to keep a harley."
"now, come on."
this is hurting me just as much as it hurts you.
- [sighs]
- makes me realize i was a bad mama.
"you never did learn how to cook, and wayne took to eating the pimento loaf at the dollar king all day long."
- dang.
wayne!
"[scoffs] wake up, you lard."
it's time for work!
- [sighs] it's christmas.
- so?
the dollar king ain't never closing!
- i quit.
- quit?
I don't like you!
Close cover before striking.
Close cover before striking.
My daddy told me never to play with matches.
My mummy told me never to play with matches.
"Oh, that's it."
He's gone too far.
"- I have to stop this, Al."
- Don't!
Ow!
There's someone here to see an Annabella Wilgis.
Annabella Wilgis?
- He's here!
"- Who's here, the killer?"
- He's coming.
- Sit down!
Who are you now?
"My name, young man, is Annabella Wilgis."
How dare you speak to me like that.
Here he is.
"Your interrogation of my client is over, Detective."
Your client?
"- Darren Russem, Ms Wilgis' lawyer."
- You're her lawyer!
- Miss Wilgis is not here voluntarily.
- She came in as a witness!
- Are you torturing my client?
- She came in voluntarily!
You don't seem to understand the scope of my client's disorder.
She asked you to meet her here?
You called ahead because you knew you'd need a lawyer?
"Five minutes, that's all I need."
A great gift.
"Oh, this ..."
Ordudaydım before the priest.
- What does it mean?
"- ""Self-sacrifice"" of the Latin."
I have tattoos and 4 had a friend like that.
"1 word, it's all a aradaydı."
So ... what other elements fell?
"Freedom, Family, Blood and Courage."
I fell to sacrifice?
Do you know what it means to altruism?
No.
One thing to say bless.
"Me and my friends, in Afghanistan, Special Kuvvetler'deydik."
"Our mission, to destroy the production of heroin."
When the rocket hit 3-dağlardaydık us.
I'd survived a single.
"Of course, after something like that You can not predict who would survive."
... And So I've been a priest?
"I became a priest, because I can do it thought it would be the hardest thing."
"Pretty stupid, huh?"
So ...
Looks good.
How are you?
Are you okay?
You know what?
I think your brother will be here soon.
I'm sure the job was just.
- He comes back to you until we ilgilenebilirim.
OK?
- Okay.
- Hey.
And then I- I do the rest.
"You know, I'd really like to know how you got me to do this."
You and I both.
What are you thinking?
You're just- You're really-
You're very beautiful.
Don't sound so surprised.
(SCOFFS) No.
"No, I guess it takes a moment like this to wake a guy up, so he can actually see what's right in front of him."
That's our cue.
(GASPS)
(LIGHTER FLICKS)
IVAN: it's amazing.
"Even hazy and out of focus, you can still recognize your own silhouette."
I wondered all day- How?
How is this possible?
"So, Marcus here is going to babysit."
And you-
You're going to take me to see what's over there.
(IVAN CHUCKLES)
I would not have believed you if you'd told me.
Kicks them out every night at 8:00.
Yeah.
What about the daytime ones?
I don't know.
"Since we found it, it's only been doing 'em at night."
What's this?
"Uh, it's- it's the newest one."
Okay-
Okay-
Here's the deal.
Every day you're going to take this photo.
- I'm not hungry
All right.
Don't eat.
How am I bothered?
Eat it
I told you.
I'm not hungry.
Come on now.
Eat
What did you say?
I got carried away
Never mind.
"In big places, such small things happen"
"You were right, Senorita."
The spirit of adventure in this barn... you could never enjoy in that room.
- But how do we get to Zurich?
"No, not Zurich."
"Tomorrow evening, we entrain at Berne."
Tomorrow morning... we take the first bus at eight.
I've found out everything
"Now, nothing can go wrong"
What's that?
- Life
Aren't you ashamed to drink in the presence of a lady?
Better than dying before the lady!
"If you wish to live on... you too should have a bit, Senorita."
- Don't you dare come near me
"All right, don't"
I'll see you tomorrow morning if you're still alive.
"Until then, goodnight"
"""May I have a jig?"
"- Oh no!"""
I remember that.
This was one of the craziest days of my life.
- I don't know if you guys recall.
"- Yeah, I remember that."
Yeah.
"You guys were shooting without me, so I had..."
I was...
"- Oh, this was the day."
- That's a great story.
"- Yeah, but there's not enough time."
- It'll take all day to tell.
- Michael had a crazy adventure.
"- I did, yeah."
Because I thought I was coming in to work at 6.
That's what I was told.
And then I didn't end up coming until 2.
"And anyway, there's too much to say."
Too much.
But Devendra Banhart is in this scene.
- Right.
That was cool.
- Later on.
"And your friend Kevin, right?"
Kevin and Devendra Banhart are in the scene we're about to see.
And...
- Kevin visited a bunch of times.
- This is a sweet scene.
"- This is the handholding scene, right?"
- Yeah.
I remember Aaron and I were talking about...
He was really nervous before shooting this scene because this was his audition scene.
And I had said my import authority...
Saiba.
We buried their warriors so the Paathars sent women?
It's a woman who shall kill Jilaan.
Muraakis give only one chance.
"This full moon night, we shall conquer Paatharghat."
"Conquer me, and you conquer Paatharghat."
Who are you?
Doom.
"Barbaric Muraaki, you have never been this close to a woman, have you?"
Get lost.
I've come to kill you.
You will have to defeat me to win me over.
Show me your face.
Why do you need to see my face to fight with me?
I need a reason to fight.
Then lower your gaze.
Why?
Saiba's beauty is like the sun...
It's wise to lower your gaze.
You got a reason to fight.
Now do you have the courage to fight?
Just her and me.
Jungle Trap.
This is your Paathar's dense jungle.
A huge tree at the end.
And a dagger on the top.
The first one to get the dagger gets to draw blood.
"If I draw your blood, you give up on Paathar."
And what if I draw yours?
My Ghat will belong to you and so will I.
Jungle Trap.
"One hundred paths, One hundred wrong ones."
Bosnia.
1995.
"The general-- remember, I told you about him?"
The warlord that you had to shoot.
You saved a lot of lives doing that.
I killed him...
"I, uh..."
I killed him right in front of his own son.
He's got allies and family.
This is about revenge.
"You-you can't know that, Booth."
It was just one X-ray.
"I mean, Aldo knew that I was the shooter."
He killed himself so he wouldn't have to give me up.
That's one possibility.
There are others.
"It's the only thing that makes sense, Bones."
"And whoever this is, they're not gonna stop until..."
What should we do?
Just be ready.
"== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man"
"Previously on ""Somewhere Between""..."
"For one to live, one must die."
"Mommy's coming, angel."
I came back.
To eight days before.
Why am I the one under arrest?
She's the one who attacked me.
He's a trophy keeper.
All I'm asking for is the code to the lock on DeBray's apartment.
These could be trophies he took from the first five victims.
"Hi, dreamboat."
I'm not talkin' to you.
Skeets.
(DOOR CLOSING)
"You want to see me, Aunt Nancy?"
"Well, yes, Willy."
I...
I wanted to have a little talk with you.
Uh-huh.
(CLEARING THROAT)
"I'm rather worried about you, Willy."
Did I do somethin' wrong?
"Oh, no, no."
I don't think so.
"Oh, no, I'm sure not."
"Well, I..."
"Uh, what I mean to say is, well, I don't think you know very much about girls, do you?"
I wouldn't want you to get into trouble.
What kind of trouble?
"It's difficult to explain, but..."
"Well, some people are born girls, and some people are born boys."
I'm glad.
It makes it so much nicer for dancing.
Yes.
"What I'm trying to say, Willy, is that girls are usually more mature than boys."
You have to be careful.
"Oh, you're talkin' about the birds and the bees."
I'm talking about you kissing Skeets in the park.
"Well, can you explain that?"
Not in one afternoon.
"Well, now, it's..."
It's perfectly all right for little girls and little boys to kiss.
"All right, all right."
Then the way I see it is somebody's going to prison.
It's just a matter of who.
All right.
"Lame-ass TV ads aside, your lawyer here, he cooked you up a pretty killer deal."
"Time served, no probation."
He's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.
"You don't give us the name of your supplier, you're going nowhere."
"Agent, the tough guy act is unnecessary."
This young man is cooperating fully.
Is that right?
You cooperating?
Let's start with a name.
He just goes by Heisenberg.
Heisenberg?
How old is Heisenberg?
Old.
Like 50 or 70 or something.
Height?
"Average, I guess."
"Medium height, medium weight."
- What color hair?
- No hair.
Dude's balder than you.
1963.
James Edward Kilkelly is convicted of stealing a vending machine.
1975.
Breaking and entering.
1982.
- There go my kidneys as my sides split
- Up.
"- Yeah, like you're the boss of me."
John Mitchell?
Who's asking?
You're a worryingly easy man to find.
"We assumed you'd be keeping a low profile, and then suddenly your name pops up on a job application."
"Bad move, that."
Sloppy.
Who are you?
Oh.
Richard Hargreaves.
"Oh, right, so all this cloak-and-dagger stuff is to sell me a rug, is it?"
Sarcasm.
How unsurprising.
I'm here on behalf of the Old Ones.
"The, er... the vampire elite."
They've entrusted me as their agent.
- Get out!
- Mm-hm.
Is it true how they live?
"All that hardcore Hammer horror shit, avoiding sunlight, and sleeping in coffins and that?"
I don't know.
I wouldn't be so impertinent as to ask.
"Well, so, this is what all the fuss was about."
"You know, I expected some... demon."
What do I find?
The last Russell Brand in the shop.
With me.
"No, I'm sorry, pal, I'm not going anywhere."
Oh.
"Oh, I think you are."
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.
I never meant to hurt you.
I was a child.
I was in love.
It was wrong and you knew it!
You knew what you were doing.
Now I do!
This is my place.
Get out!
I did what I did.
"You don't have to be happy about it, but maybe we could help each other out now."
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
"Bronze piece, about this size, with a hole in it, off-center, with a crystal."
You know the one I mean?
Yeah.
I know it.
Where's Abner?
Where's Abner?
Abner's dead.
"Marion, I'm sorry."
"Do you know what you did to me, to my life?"
I can only say I'm sorry so many times.
"Well, say it again, anyway."
Sorry.
"Yeah, everybody's sorry."
Abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth looking for his little bits of junk.
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.
Everybody's sorry for something.
"It's a worthless bronze medallion, Marion."
You going to give it to me?
Maybe.
- Bye.
Seven and I work at a production company
That cranks crappy reality shows.
Our job is to find and cast
"The quote, unquote talent."
Such as it is.
So just be natural and forget that the camera's even here.
Well I'm very comfortable in front of a camera.
So why don't you tell me how you and Burt met?
I'm sure that's a great story.
We met on the internet.
Now take these two.
"There here for a spot on the upcoming show ""Geezer Town."""
Some people will say or do just about anything to be on TV.
A blue pill a day makes your lady want to stay.
Oh yeah!
Hey Dale
Ohhh...
Seven
There's a call for you on line two.
Oh.
Really?
Um...
I will be back in just a second.
This is Dale Squire.
It's Becca
Can you come pick me up please?
"Yeah, what's wrong?"
"I'm on Doheny and Sunset, make a left."
"Ok, I'll be there in two seconds."
You don't want to leave this in there.
"That was Becca, she was crying."
I just had to have some of this chili.
You see?
It's pie.
"No, what Eric's saying is that we put signs up on our highway chatting up our soup and pie."
"You're a real smart young man, Eric."
You think so?
"Why, sure."
"Now, certainly a man of the world like yourself feels more at ease in the big city, but a guy like you could do pretty well in a town like ours."
You think so?
Maybe I will stay for a while.
Really?
"Yeah, you know, good woman, good friends, good pie."
I think I could be happy here for the rest of my life.
Eric.
"Let's see, do you really think you could be happy here?"
"I'm already happy here, Cor."
These people have taken me in.
They've made me feel important.
"Back home, I'm just a loser who didn't get into college, but here,"
I could be king.
"Well, congratulations."
I'll just tell Mom and Dad.
I know they'll be so proud.
I know I am.
I'm the prince of Sprinkle Land.
Hey.
Soup and pie for everybody.
The new guy's buying.
"Oh, man, this is good pie."
I was three hours from home.
Dad!
Cory!
I must look like I was attacked by wolves.
"I apologize, I didn't even notice."
"Mmm, uh..."
Could you excuse me while I go to the ladies' room
- for a minute?
"- Sure, sure."
Do you enjoy dancing?
I used to love to dance with my father.
You?
I find it embarrassing.
I enjoy watching it.
"- Oh, thank you."
- Thank you.
- Watching?
- Pairs...
It's interesting how coupling appears in nature and in mathematics.
- You were talking about pairs...
- The twin-prime conjecture.
"It explores pairs of prime numbers, numbers that are only divisible by themselves."
Three-five.
Five-seven.
Not seven-nine...
- Nine can be divided by three.
- That's right.
"Then you have 11-13, and 17-19 and so on."
It was discovered that pairs were often separated by...
One number in between.
Exactly.
Did you read my book?
"- No, I'm sorry."
- That's all right.
This is really marvelous.
- Thank you.
Sorry.
She has this book club.
It's a couple of ladies from the school.
- My school?
- Yeah.
"They sit and pretend they read, but mostly it's just gossip."
"Hey, if you help me, we can get out of here really quick."
- Help you?
- We just need set out some sandwiches.
"Oh, uh..."
"Boy, I just..."
I don't know how much of a help I would be.
"You know, I..."
I once worked for two weeks at McDonald's and I accidentally gave away the secret to the secret sauce.
"It's ketchup and mayonnaise, by the way."
"Christine, are you embarrassed by what I do?"
No.
I'm not embarrassed at all.
"But I mean, why didn't you tell me you were Marly's housekeeper?"
"I'm sorry, should I have said:"
"""Before you get too attached to me, you should know I'm a housekeeper""?"
"Well, you came right out with the Portuguese thing."
"I'm kidding, I'm kidding."
"No, I..."
I don't care what you do.
I am not like one of them.
"Great, then help me so we can get out of here."
Okay.
I'll...
I'll help you.
I'm excited.
# Now I'll run from you #
# This tainted love you've given #
# I give you all a girl could give you #
# Take my tears and that's not nearly #
# Oh... tainted love #
# Tainted love #
"# Don't touch me,please #"
# I cannot stand the way you tease #
"# I love you,though you hurt me so #"
# Now it's time you pack your things and go #
# Tainted love. #
"The guy sings a five-minute song about what I bitch I am, and then kisses me and walks away."
I should not be turned on right now.
I can't believe he walked away.
"I mean,who does that?"
"And what,has he been locked away at T Hot Rocker Academy of Kissing for the past five years?"
"Hey,Bella."
What?
Where's my car?
Hello!
"Obvious sign,girl."
What the hell?
- You were driving.
- Exactly.
I was busy.
"Dude,I'm gonna blame you."
It's my option.
Are you serious?
"I'm not paying this time,just so you know..."
"Hi,Marty."
"Um,so,my sister is an ass."
"And,uh,we're gonna need a ride."
And a piece of macaroni omeIet.
In case you get hungry...
Am I leaving on a trip?
- You have a tape worm.
- When I was a kid!
"Besides, if it eats the omelet, the ham and the bread, it's no little tape worm, it's a tape python!"
"Morning, Mrs. VoIpe."
- You're still here?
- AfuII employee.
She has to go!
"I understand, but why do I need this?"
"If you lose it, we'II replace it."
"Don't waste time, there's a line forming."
Want to be here till nightfall?
"I'm talking to a client, I can't do him Iickety split."
Take the toothpick out of yourmouth.
I need it so I don't stammer.
"I'II handle this man, you continue with the others."
- Mr.?
- Scapece.
What can we do foryou?
I'd Iike to apply for a Postamat.
Afriend?
Afriend of his came here and got a Postamat.
This friend gets his retirement pay accredited to his account so he can easily withdraw cash.
Without sweating blood.
Do you understand?
could you repeat that?
I got it!
Third window.
Come in.
- What is it?
Or else one day your scream will kill me.
Look..
"look brother, my heart is beating so fast."
"Forgive me, Airport my friend, but.."
"No brother, today I will have to.."
..tell you what your problem is.
Why do you have such dreams?
What else ajobIess person do otherthan have dreams?
till my dreams dont come true these..
..dreams will keep on following me.
Oh this means I will have to get you ajob.
"Come brother, I will talk to my producer about you today."
And get you ajob of spot boy.
Which hero is shooting over here?
"Hey forget about the hero, the producer and.."
..director Mr. N. Chandra is coming.
-Okay.
call him sir and fall on his feet.
But why should I call him sir?
Because this is how you greet here!
Come on!
-Sir!
What is it?
"-Sir, that.. he is Krishna."
"He is a very hard working boy, sir."
He wants a spot boysjob.
"Its a small thing, keep him."
Why do you need to ask me?
"You have done me a huge favour, sir."
Sir..
- He gave me a house to stay.
I had my clothes with me and you..
"And eww, why're you so dramatic?"
My hit points are going down
Sent!
What'd you send?
A picture of Lin getting excited about this gross room
"It's gross, isn't it?"
Yeah
But... awesome!
Thank you
"Kidding, I'm about to puke"
Big Sis...
Obviously I'm kidding.
Otherwise it'd just be offensive
"Anyways, love what you've done with the place"
Now it's not sad!
"The bathtub is pretty cool, too"
Really?
Can I take a look?
Of course.
This way
"Lin, come too"
Ok.
Can I take pics?
Sure
Holy crap!
Gross!
I didn't do anything with my life
That hunting today got me thinking
"When I was younger, I just watched anime or went to brothels and forgot about it"
"Ignoring the root of the problem, I was satisfied with immediate pleasure"
Youth is a crime
"No, I am full of potential"
I don't see anything that I would consider to be art.
But you took the picture.
Just because ducky told me to.
- I'm sorry.
- That'okay.
I'm sure you find other things beautiful.
Like gibbs breaking up a chick fight.
I can't believe I missed that.
"Well,I've got good news."
Guess at is now playing on mcgee tv.
I hug and kiss technology.
You liar!
mee-yow.
Which one's siri?
The one that gibbs is pulling off e other girl.
It's always good to have a face to put with genetic material.
You get a match on h off finn's clothing?
Yeah.
But not just her.
There was a party in finn's pants.
I found genetic material from two distinct females.
- Siri and...
- A mystery woman.
That would explain why rebecca refused thcheek swab.
Told us she hadn't seen him in six months.
Play iagain.
"Plus,rebecca's got a lot of anger in her."
"Oh,I wouldn't assume siri is innocent."
Why not?
Look at the fight.
Siri initiates it.
She may not be as sweet as she looks.
We have to talk.
I know Migs is with you.
He voluntarily came back to me.
"Bela, the only person who lost a memory is Migs."
Not you.
"Don't take advantage of him,"
Give him back to me.
"If you're thinking that I'm a mistress now,"
"If you're thinking that I'm a mistress now, you got it wrong."
You're probably forgetting...
I'm the first love...
He's happy with me.
"If he ever forgot you, it's not my fault."
Maybe that was destined to happen.
I'm begging you.
You already have everything.
Give him back to me.
You're wrong.
I waited for so long to be with him.
I can't give him back to you.
It's Migs' medicines.
I know you don't want me for Migs.
It's not that I don't like you for my brother.
I just really got used to him and Bela.
Just tell Mommy and Daddy that Migs and I need some space.
I'm begging you.
Take good care of Migs.
Your patient has fallen asleep from waiting for you!
I think she wants you to tell stories.
"Joy, April and I will just do the rounds."
-We'll go ahead!
-Bye!
"-That's up to a jury, sir."
But she's behind bars?
"She's not getting out, right?"
-What kind of bail?
-That's up to the judge.
"A woman like that is a danger, like the one who cut off her husband's dick."
These are the people they lock up and throw away the key.
That should do it.
"Thanks for your time, Mr. Fuentes."
MR. FUENTES:
Sure.
-Mrs.
"Fuentes, gracias."
You'll let us know if she gets out on bail?
Notify us somehow or another?
"Yeah, sure, we could do that if you want."
"Yeah, sure."
"-Anyway, thanks for your cooperation."
-Sure.
SlPOWlCZ:
Yeast infection?
How much is that gonna cost?
"I spent a month in the hospital, it didn't cost that much."
"How old is this dog, anyway?"
You think he's gonna live for a while?
"All right, okay."
is there any chance that this could be a special dog...
"... maybea purebred,anything?"
"No, it wouldn't, huh?"
"All right, well, you got my Visa, go ahead and treat the dog."
-How we doing on those supplementals?
-Okay.
"Zhu Li, come on!"
We got guests.
Whip up a pot of that green tea I love.
"Yes, sir."
Zhu Li's in prison with you?
Of course.
I don't go anywhere without my assistant.
Do you?
"We're not interested in your tea, and this isn't a friendly visit."
Don't tell me you guys are still mad about everything that happened.
I did some good things too.
"Korra, who warned you about Unalaq?"
I did.
"Bolin, who got you into the movers?"
I did.
"Asami, who saved your company?"
I did.
"Mako, who got you thrown in jail?"
I did!
"Oh, yeah, I guess that was a bad thing."
"You stole everything from me, and you tried to kidnap the president."
Those are pretty bad too.
I wasn't going to hurt him.
I just needed to start a war.
"Well, a bigger war."
"Well, we're gonna end it."
Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami?
The future industries stuff?
It's on my battleship.
You have a battleship?
Of course I do!
"I bought the first one they made, named her the Zhu Li."
But he will tease if I tell him.
Which is why...
You are a friend who knows him well.
He will not get a better partner than you.
A storm is galloping like a horse...
And my heart has climbed aboard and vanished.
Even robbery becomes just...
When my wish steals you away.
"Hey, love has become my eyes..."
And is withholding your beauty.
Your fragrance has become my way
And brings me closer to you.
"Siri, time?"
"Siri, call Deepa."
"Hi, Deepa."
I'm waiting for you.
Where are you?
'Sadhana Calling'.
Deepa.
What happened?
Is something wrong?
I can help you only if you tell me.
"Please, Deepa."
Tell me.
What's it?
My sister fell in love with a guy.
His family is quite well off.
"But, they still accepted their wedding."
Since it was my sister's wish...
My father spent more than he could afford
He got her married in a grand way.
She is happy with her life.
I think we've gone through...
-...too much together.
-Yeah.
"We'II always be part of each other, Iike, growing up."
I'm just glad that we did it right from the start how we wanted to do it.
Yeah.
There's been so many bands that have come and gone.
And no one really talks about them anymore.
"I'd Iike to be like, remembered for the records that we did."
Do you know what?
"It'd just be amazing to be remembered like, even as a mum telling her daughter:"
"""The boy band at my time, One Direction, they just had fun."""
Do you know what I mean?
"""They were just normal guys but terrible, terrible dancers."""
Yeah.
Are they down here?
I'm excited to see what's gonna happen.
"Two, one."
"Everybody, three, two, one."
So I'm gonna just get in the car up here.
"Come on, girls."
Can't believe actually today's here.
have a present for you.
There you go.
-congratulations.
-Thank you so much.
Thank you.
-My pleasure.
-Thank you.
The key.
Right.
Are we ready?
Calvin.
"-Well, not precisely a man."
"Hello, detective."
How is your investigation coming?
-I thought you were dead.
"-Technically, I was never alive."
But I appreciate your concern.
I made a switch.
It was an unprocessed NS-5.
"Basically, I fried an empty shell."
-I couldn't destroy him.
He was too--
-Unique.
It just didn't feel right.
You and your feelings.
"They just run you, don't they?"
"Two thousand eight hundred and eighty steps, detective."
"Do me a favor, keep that kind of shit to yourself."
No guards.
The override is disabled.
Robertson wasn't controlling them from here.
He wasn't controlling them at all.
"Oh, my God."
"You were right, doc."
I am the dumbest dumb person on the face of the earth.
Who else had access to the uplink?
Who could manipulate the robots?
Use USR systems to make Lanning's life a prison?
Poor old man.
He saw what was coming.
He knew no one would believe him.
So he had to lay down a plan.
"Don't worry your pretty, little head about that."
Pretty?
"While Hayley and I distract Austin, you need to look for this."
It's a false wall.
A secret room.
That would be the perfect place for Austin to hide the grisly trophies he takes from his victims.
Exactly.
"Now, if you find evidence that Austin is the killer,"
I get equal credit.
No double-crosses.
Deal.
"That way, Mason Wood has to make both of us members of the society."
Let's go.
Hold on.
Is that what you're wearing?
- Yes.
- No.
Deciding between something I brought and something that Rick's about to buy me.
I think I know the direction you'll be leaning in.
Oh.
You really do deserve to be in the Greatest Detective Society.
Austin:
Wow.
"Come in, come in."
Let's get some drinks in you.
Ooh.
Here you go.
Ooh.
A little something to loosen your inhibitions.
"Oh, don't worry."
We're plenty loose already.
Not after I've tied you up.
You'd lose your head if it wasn't fastened on.
"You were the door to another life, where my seed might have been affirmed."
Ta-da!
I found your shoe!
"I""ve brought back to this hole a breath of life, which I am trying to use."

"We don""t fake you, we just take you."

"Always has been, always will be."
"Ã""rale."
"Ã""rale."
"Welcome to the clica, carnal."
"Por vida, ese."

"Are you coming out, ese?"
Staying in.
"Are you sure you know what you're doing, ese?"
SimÃ²n.
You scared me by showing me a glimpse of what my life might have been.
That's Lourdes.
"Ã""rale."
"Hey, be careful!"
"Don't worry, homes, I ain't gonna crash."
Check that one out.
See all the people?
They were throwing rice and shit.
Look at Mama.
Pull over up here.
I gotta take a leak.
"This medal I send to you as a gift for helping me find my voice, a key to my soul which I will use."
St. Dismas is the patron saint of all those in prison.
He has protected me.
To the cemetary.
Your brother's grave.
My dead brother is not the problem.
Your mother is.
She might be dropping by just to say hello.
Mothers are like that.
So we're gonna go stake out a cemetary?
Until you come over with something better.
A.D.E.
What?
- After Death Experience...
- I know what it is.
My mom had one when I turned her.
Which means she saw you being turned.
By Marcus.
At the House of Chthon.
She's probably looking for me there.
"Please, please help me!"
I need to see my daughter.
I...
"Sorry, sir."
She came out of nowhere.
Not a problem.
Happens from time to time.
Is she?
Infected...
"Lane, this is Leon."
I've got a stray in the lobby who needs an immediate transportation to disposal.
"Ma'am, if you'd like to accompany these gentlemen through that door,"
I'll see to it that you receive all the attention you deserve.
"I want my daughter, where is my daughter?"
"Ma'am, we're gonna take care of you."
There's a pube right there.
I did that to trick you.
That's 100 percent beef you're staring at.
"Wait, why not just play rock paper scissors?"
"What are we, fucking ten?"

- Could you repeat that?
I can see what's going on here.
You make my dad angry just like my granddad made him angry.
Why?
The situation with your dad and me is complicated.
What are you looking for in his old case files?
Just something that'll make him less angry.
"You know, I'm glad you're here."
"My dad's done so much by himself, you know?"
He really needs you.
"I'm glad he has a brother, and I'm..."
Glad I have an uncle.

He was going to college in the fall.
"Dad, just go through it with me."

Please tell me you have something more than that.

He's crazy in love with you.
Not a chance!
"We were togetherfor a year, this is all I have left."
Why did you break up?
"He never says no, not even to his mom, he neverrisks anything."
I got mad and put him to the test.
I told him I'd asked to transfer.
And what did he do?
"Nothing, sir!"
- Mr. VoIpe?
- Mr. Director.
What is it?
You want to report me again?
Why don't you talk to yourmother?

It says right here on the map.
"It was an entire 50 zeny, so search properly."
Who would believe such a cruddy map?
The same goes for that boat.
"Thanks to you skimping out, the engine broke."
"Now we can't even get back to the port, can we?"
.
How could you?

Am I going to die here...?
Just stop complaining and get searching for the treasure.
I'm so hungry...

Yeah.
"I mean, the plane leaves when you do."
"Is that what you know from experience, Joe?"
It's something I've learned from my grotesquely irresponsible client roster.

You've been amazing through all this.
"No, I just don't think it has hit me yet."
"So Andy, was he working really hard or something?"
- How long will you be gone?
- At least till nighttime.
Nice.
Hello Miss.
I just wanted to deliver you a message from our friend Biberkopf:
He'll be home late.
Did he order you to do that?
Not exactly.
But I thought I might as well just see you and settle over what happened last night.
- Just what do you want?
- I already told you.
And there is nothing wrong visiting a beautiful young lady.
Nothing wrong with that?
It's a nice day and we will drive a bit around.
- Franz will join us!
- Franz?
Yes!
He'll meet us in the evening.
You know that we are friends.
Allright.
"It's an opportunity to have a talk with you, about Franz."
- Fine.
- Where is he?
"Freienwalde, Plumber-Karl is helping us out."
You wanted to tell me about Franz.
You've known him for quite a while.
I could talk for hours.
Great guy.
- A little weak but...
- Last night he cried in the hallway.
- What?
- He doesn't wanna go on like this.
Maybe Caleb is the same.
It's only Hanna.
I wasn't asking who you were on the phone with.
Do you want the last bit of cobbler?
I can just bring it up for you.
"No, thanks."
Okay.
"- What do you mean, ""only Hanna""?"
- It's my mom.
Things are still sub-zero around here.
Did you tell her about Paige's dad?
No point.
She'll say it's my fault for choosing a disgusting lifestyle.
Paige is such a knob.
- I don't think it's all her fault.
- What do you mean?
What's going on between you and Aria?
It's nothing you have to worry about.
You were snarking at each other like you were on a reality show.
The Real Teens of Rosewood.
"Oh, tell me about Toby."
He says we have what he wanted us to have.
"It's the right message, I'm just reading it wrong."
He wants me to come to his house Saturday.
Are you going?
"If I don't, how are we gonna figure this out?"
I'm shut out with Melissa and lan.
- Where are you?
- What do you mean?
I'm right here.
Any fire truck you can hear at your house I can hear at mine.
"Oh, my God."
- I think you're reaching because you don't want your sister's murderer slipping through your grasp.
"Which I totally get, by the way."
"I feel you, bro."
But our hands are well and truly tied here.
Where and when are we handing him over to the Feds?
We're still waiting for the final instructions from Quantico.
- Sometime in the next 24 hours.
- This has the cartel all over it.
- He's not wrong to think like that.
- No.
"No, he's not."
"Okay, I'm gonna ask this once and only once."

"I'm just saying I'm confused, that's all."
Confused about what ?
Me ?
A little bit.
I don't know.
Yeah... no... maybe.
Maybe ?
"So, hold on."
What ?
"Are we talking about Stepps and school, or are you talking about the grocery store, the sidewalk and museums ?"
"Break it down a little bit better for me, 'cause I don't get it."
When is it okay for us to be together ?

- Do not.
You are a free man.
- But promise me one thing.
- Tell me.
Aluxia must do this for Selegna Sol.
Fact!
"Now it's just you and me, Mara."
Just you and me.
Alone on the ice.
You were right about them.
You were always right.
It's a murder.
It always was.
And I owe this crime.
I give up  I give up everything.

"""Well done, Spartan."
They're... small fry... tiddlers.
Their father was in the Resistance.
Dirty little habits...
The tiddler says...
"Good evening, Miss."
"Fire and brimstone at Mr. Venom's, huh?"
You made a good move.
I'm making another:
Your engagement present.
- Good behavior:
"Seven years, minus ten days."
"- Shit, how could I know?"
They haul me out of the clink only to say that you're shitting in Venom's boots.
It's not '45 or '68 any more.
"In '45, you were king of the streets."
What a result.
- The streets are still around.
- So am I. But the posters have changed.
"Well, I'm not dumb enough to get my head on a poster!"
But dumb enough to have your father clean up after you.
Your stepbrother is right.
"To survive, it's better to forget."
"So they got you banged up, guaranteed you a soldier's pension, is that it?"
"What I did, I did in memory of you."
And for her.
"That's one too many, Mickey."
"To survive, you've got to forget!"
I did it for you.
"Here, have your beloved son!"
Your favorite!
I love you!
Mary!
You shouldn't be in here
- Are these yours?
"- No, my brother's"
Here
Thanks
Whose are they?
Your ex's?
They were my mother's
Turn around
That stuff really worked.
The pain has gone completely
"OK, you can turn around"
"It suits me, doesn't it?"
Are you closed?
The power is down.
What else can I do?
So you're hitting the bottle?
Look familiar?
He attacked your waitress
Ever seen him in the bar?
No idea I have a lot of customers
Put it up inside
Call me if anyone knows him
Go easy on the whiskey
The beds aren't great
But you will sleep well enough I never sleep anyway
"Camille is in danger, but so are others I have to warn them"
You're safe here

- Ifyou like
You're very welcome
No.
It's all one fuzzy blur.
That's great.
That's perfect.
Okay.
I must have passed out after I reenlisted.
- What?
- I said I passed out.
- Why do you think I was lying here?
- You don't remember what you did.
You didn't have any idea what you were doing last night.
- How could you?
- But I did.
"Give me a little credit, Captain."
"I may be a rummy, but I'm no dummy."
The army provides you with a home and a career.
This from the man who built himself wings... and tried to flap his way back to the States?
Now the army's my best friend.
"I may get shot in the stomach, but I won't get stabbed in the back... not the way I did by that wife-stealer Gus Nagy."
Oh.
"So, you mean..."
You mean Laverne and Gus...
"[Bawling] Oh, Laverne!"
Klinger.
Klinger.
"Klinger, come here."
Get-Get up.
Look-Look.
You're gonna get over Laverne in a little while... but that's no reason to throw away the best years of your life.
- I haven't.
- What do you mean?
"Well, it's not official until I raise my right hand and Col. Potter swears me in."
"No, I really think that it would be good for me to know why you cannot live without this other woman."
"Well, we'd been together since college and she gave me an ultimatum."
"She said, ""Either we get married or we break up."""
So we got married.
Wow.
You caved.
It's complicated.
Really?
What?
You're a dick if you date a girl for too long and don't marry her.
You marry her and you're an asshole for marrying before you're ready.
"I mean, shit, I don't know."
[SIGHS]
You're really hot.
And I am obviously attracted to you.
So I think the best I can do is eventually find this piece of paper and call you and hope to just help you out in your career in some small way.
Hi.
Hi.
What's going on?

"Hi, this is Gigi."
Is Alex there?
Hold on.
- Alex?
- Yo.
- Drinks are good?
MAN:
"Yeah, one more."
"- No, no."
"- Yes, we are."
"- No, we aren't."
We are.
"All the girls came to get me, that's cool."
Where's Sarah?
"- Kitty, he's sitting in the back with you."
"- No, seriously, thanks for bringing the whole family."
"I mean, my day wasn't bad enough."
They were worried about you.
"Oh, you had the do the right thing, right?"
"Because Kevin always does the right thing, except sleep with women."
"Justin, could you shut up for ten seconds?"
"If you didn't want my help, why'd you ask?"
'Cause I was in jail.
I figured I should call the family lawyer.
"I mean, that's what you are, right?"
If your father could see this behavior!
He'd what?
Judge me?
Tell me to get a job?
He'd be so diappointed!
Disappointed?
Who the hell is he to be disappointed?
He's the disappointment!
What does that mean?
Forget it.
"Your father loved you more than anything on Earth, you little spoiled brat!"
- You know what love means in this family?
It means you suck!
- Get in the car!
It means nothing you do will be good enough!
"Paul, can I borrow you?"
I need you to check something for me.
"Do you know how many wives and girlfriends we've had sat across from us, insisting they were completely in the dark?"
You're in this up to your neck.
"We're watching all the ports, so they have nowhere to go."
I don't know where they are.
"That's bollocks, and you know it."
"- Sarge, can I...?"
"- Tennison, we've got this."
No.
Go on.
"If you want to help David, you need to tell us where he is."
Did David tell you about Julie-Ann?
She was 17.
"Someone strangled her and dumped her with the rubbish, like she didn't matter."
Where was he on the evening of Sunday 13th May?
- I don't know.
- It was raining that night.
"Did he come home, soaked to the skin?"
He was home!
How's he been acting since?
You're his mum.
Mums always know when something's not right.
I found... a photo of them both.
Him and Julie-Ann.
"She mattered to David, didn't she?"
Did he tell you about her?
Did you know she was pregnant?
- Was the child David's?
- God...
God.
Where can we find him?
And so will you.
It's time to go.
You think we could stop by the hospital on the way to downtown?
I can't.
Kyle will panic if I'm not there when he wakes up.
I spoke with your wife.
She's at the hospital.
You don't understand.
"When Kyle got sick, he asked me what happens when you die."
And I told him it was...
"I told him it was peaceful, like going to sleep."
And he was afraid to go to bed so... so I promised him... that I would be there to wake him up.
I have to be there.
Please.
"MERCY GENERAL HOSPRTAL KYLE McGOVERN'S ROOM THURSDAY, MARCH 17"
"Hey, Kyle."
Your mom's in the cafeteria.
Where's my dad?
He asked me to be here when you woke up.
Why didn't he come?
"Kyle, your dad loves you very much."
He'd do anything in the world to make you well again.
But... he did something wrong.
Did he rob a bank or something?
/ No.
Did he hurt anybody?
He broke the law.
He broke the law to get you a kidney.
He was just trying to help you.
So...
why is that wrong?
"John, what you did took a lot of balls."
I knew I had 'til eight or nine o'clock to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.
"But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew, I was going along with the program."
I pulled out his hair. I bit him.
He's out fuckin' cold.
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.
I walk away.
We start to go in the fuckin' joint.
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.
I don't want to fuckin' turn around.
I don't want to turn around.
"He picks up his fucking head, he says, ""Ah...."""
"I said, ""Don't say it! """
"""Jerkoff! """
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
I fucking fly at him!
"I got him and I'm banging his head, biting his fuckin' face."
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.
I beat him to a fuckin' pulp.
"To a fuckin' pulp, I tells ya."
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.
Forget about tonight.
Forget about it.
It was like a load off my mind.
Poor bastard.
He never knew how close he'd come to getting killed.
Even if I had told him he would have never believed me.
"-Jimmy, could I talk to you now?"
-You're a pisser.
What?
"Dreaming about him like that,"
It's got to mean something.
What are you talking about?
"(karen:)come on, two nights in a row?"
Dreams are our subconscious working out
"What we can't, or won't, awake."
So mom used to tell me.
The last time we saw da veiga
He was chasing us through the jungle with a pistol.
What's to work out?
"(karen:)you're not sure he survived,"
Are you?
"(syd:)nigel, run!"

Did you set up our first meeting?

One of our viewers has sent us this picture... through MMS.
Look at the ugly facet of the police...
Mr. Pradhan.
You here?
Are you here with the token?
Token?
I'm here to show you your qualities.
Take look.
Take look how ACP Ayushman Thakur... is openly assaulting an injured man... in a quiet housing-society.
The people demand an answer from the police.
Because if the protector turns cruel... then whom will the people go to?
The police are often accused...
Mr. Pradhan those with name...
"Oh, man."
"I freaked out and thought I was gonna have to get my tendon resoldered, but it didn't happen."
- You can't fool around with that stuff.
- No.
Didn't mean to.
- I think this was a reshoot day.
- No.
Didn't we...?
Didn't we reshoot the...?
"Oh, it's a different moment in the van."
It's when I'm looking out the window at Tris on the car.
"- Yeah, that was a reshoot."
- That was a reshoot.
Because I remember...
Remember Raf and I were giving each other a hard time this day.
Do you remember?
It was the reshoots and I was a little scared.
"I was like, ""Oh, my gosh."
"He's really getting angry."" I think I was making fun of his accent."
That's the way to get him mad.
Michael would make fun of Raf.
He'd be like:
"""Oh, later on, Rafi Gavron."""
Rafi's from London.
"You can't tell by the movie, but he's English."
"Oh, and Ari this is the best deli."
Remember?
- I wasn't in this scene.
I came to visit.
"- Yeah, but you came to visit us."
"We got Tony, our script supervisor, a cake because it was his birthday."
Of course.

[Miley whooping]
Here we go everybody!
[Singing] Come on!
You get the limo out front.
"Hottest styles, every shoe, every color."
"Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun."
It's really you but no one ever discovers.
Who would have thought that a girl like me.
A girl like me.
Would double as a superstar?
[Whooping]
You get the best of both worlds.
"Chill it out, take it slow."
Then you rock out the show.
You get the best of both worlds.
Mix it all together.
And you know that it's the best of both worlds.
[Laughing]
[Singing] Jesse's back in the band but then things got out of hand.
He gave Hannah a kiss.
Something the world didn't miss.
On Leno.
Hannah Montana was getting frozen yogurt yesterday.
Did you hear about this?
Did you hear about this?
When asked why she got both chocolate and vanilla.
She said she wanted the best of both swirls.
Did you hear about this?
[Singing] Now Mile and Jesse can't hate.
Is that a problem?
Just wait.
Is he telling the truth?
Is Tucker not my son?
"You gotta believe me, I never meant to hurt you."
What is that supposed to mean?
Why did you lie to me?
(struggling)
I'm so sorry.
Melody!
"Look, put him in interrogation until NOPD comes."
Let him go.
Do what?
"Look, I said just let him go, damn it."
I probably would have done the same thing if I were him.
Lasalle...
"Look, just do it!"
Stay the hell away from my kid.
Get out of here before I change my mind.
PRIDE:
You believe him?
I don't know what to believe.
"Melody did seem pretty clear about it, though."
"I mean, she kept saying she was sorry."
"I mean, how could she do it, King?"
Bring a little boy into my life and tell me I'm his father...
when I'm not?
"I don't know, Chris."
Something you gotta ask her.
"Well, it won't change anything, so what's the point?"
"The point is, you deserve to know."
"It doesn't matter, all right, it is what it is."
Christopher.
It's not something you can pretend didn't happen.
"He suffers a little from being too arrogant, both in his writing and as a person."
Oh.
Match made in heaven.
I don't know if I can continue to accommodate you here.
Why is that?
Because you're a pain in the ass.
I have to go to the city today.
What for?
See my agent.
- Henry?
- Henry?
No.
Henry's not been with me for 10 years.
Why not?
Because he's a cocksucker and a little piece of shit.
"Oh, fuck!"
"Jesus, God Almighty."
Fucking thing.
Look at this.
Is this a meeting about something new?
Hmm?
"Well, potentially."
It's complicated.
We're hoping for some money from a sale of movie rights.
Is that woman still your editor?
No.
She's an asshole with no loyalty as well.
- What about...
- Are you here only to put me on the spot?
None of this is worth revisiting to me.
I've been betrayed by a lot of small-minded and worthless people.
Do I need them to accomplish anything?
"""Cardiff, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Belfast, Liverpool, Slough."""
Operator.
That wasn't the right code.
What?
What I just called in.
It wasn't the right code.
Tell me you killed the girl before you figured that out.
What?
Fuck!
They got to the emergency phones.
Just let me think.
"No one even knows we're in trouble, do they?"
"No, they don't."
"-There has to be a safety measure, right?"
-No.
-Something or someone?
-There's nothing.
Someone who cancels the broadcast when something like this happens.
There's no one.
"There has to be some kind of back-up, like an emergency back-up..."
Something like this doesn't happen.
"Seventy years, the code's never been breached."
Somebody has to be out there who can...
"Katherine, there's nothing but the goddamn numbers!"
(PHONE ringing)
"If we do ourjob, we get out of here alive."
I promise.
-OPERATOR:
"You kill her for me, I let you live."
-(sighs)
No.
We've gone to a lot of trouble here with these broadcasts.
So get out.
See the world.
Learn some new things.
I don't want to disappoint Simon.
He raised me after my parents died.
Helped me earn my Ph.D.
And I owe him so much.
But sometimes he can be so...
Demanding?
Hm.
More like tyrannical.
Kelly...
It's your life.
It should be your decision.
I wish I had as much confidence in me as you do.
"I shouldn't admit this, but when we were in Thera,"
I had the most awful crush on you.
Me?
Really?
Perfect timing.
That's odd.
What?
"Well, the Ark of Solon was made around the 6th Century B.C., in Athens during the Iron Age."
"But according to this, the tool that dented it was made from tin, and judging by these trace elements, it came from the mines in Cornwall during pre-Roman times."
Cornwall?
Isn't that near Exeter?
Yes.
"Why, does it mean something?"
I'd better get to the academy.
May I go with you?
Yeah.
So why do you think your grandfather's so hostile about Atlantis?
I was drafted behind my back.
"- So, can I be discharged?"
- Discharged?
- You're gonna be impeached.
- [Both Laughing]
- [Laughing Continues] - [Hawkeye] Exactly what you need.
"- Tell me, Lieutenant Hutchinson."
- ##[Jukebox.
Swing]
- How does it feel to be a member of the ruling class?
- It feels terrific.
"That's speaking unofficially, of course."
"If anyone says you're not a real lieutenant, they'll have to answer to me."
- [All Chattering]
- Just think.
"Even if I didn't know it... for a couple of hours there, I was the leader of the entire free world."
It just goes to prove the American Dream is not dead.
Any boy can grow up to be first lady.
"## [""Harbor Lights""]"
Will you excuse me for a moment please?

Any requests?
It's my nickel.
'Hello?
' Hello?
'Kessler?
' I was right. it is him.
'Are you positive?
' Yes.
I think he might be on to me.
'Did he recognise you?
Eva has never gotten over it.
She has worked like mad.
I've hardly seen her.
"-Never miss home, Aksel?"
-No.
It's been 20 years.
Things look different now.
And Eve?
It's been 20 years for her too.
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.
"Hello, my friend."
I have been in contact with the ministry.
I thought it should exist willingness to find a political solution.
There is a whole community.
Hundreds of people.
There is not a single company that will take us with pliers!
I do not think it's going to go this time.
Do not say that.
I've failed them.
I've failed everyone.
Me you...
"-No, You have not."
"-Yes, That was your."
"Solar Tech was your life's work, and I threw it away."
I love this place.
The people here are ...
I have lived here more than half my life.
All would have been affected.
"So what you're saying, is that you practically bankrupt?"
"No, what I am saying is that I believe in miracles."
"If it's what it takes to save the situation,  so I believe in anything."
- You gotta talk to me.
- What does Dr. Beckett say?
- He says I'm hilarious.
"Thursdays at 4, highlight of his week."
He should be paying me.
"- Okay, I..."
- I...
Just please.
"Please, just..."
I didn't know that he had stopped coming to see you.
"I'm really scared, and I'm really confused because Eddie has so much going for him."
- He's so loved.
"- Julia, depression is not circumstantial."
It's got nothing to do with what you did or you didn't do.
Eddie is not choosing to feel this way.
I know.
I know.
And she could reach around a wall and smack you in the head before you...
And the arm would...
All you'd hear is this:
Ernest Hemingway blew his head off with a shotgun.
"Click, bang."
Thank you.
Can we get the check?
"His wife, Mary, said he was simply cleaning the gun."
And I think that's some housekeeping gone awry.
"Hey, how are you?"
- Haven't seen you here in a while.
- Yeah.
"Had he hung himself, would it have been that he was just cleaning the rope?"
- How's he doing?
- Fine.
"Well, I had a great day."
"I haven't learned a thing about comedy, and August and I had a huge fight."
"Oh well, how would you like a nice doughnut?"
"from this bag labeled ""donuts""."
Ahh!
You touched doggy doody!
Since when is doggy doody made in Taiwan?
They have dogs in Taiwan.. big ones.
"Funny, right?"
- I don't know.
"You know,"
I don't think I'm ever gonna see my coat again.
"Okay, Harry, why don't you sit down, you'll feel a lot better?"
Right here.
Excuse me.
Damn!
"You know, at least I can take comfort in knowing that I treated my coat well."
Such as yesterday.
It was hot on the bus.
I took it off and folded it neatly and placed it under the shade of my seat.
What?
You left it on the bus.
No-o-o!
You know they have a lost and found Harry.
Oh you mean I might see my coat again?
Oh I am so happy.
"Dick, I've been thinking about this ""humour"" thing."
Why don't you try what those guys on TV do?
Everybody says they're funny?
"- Oh, yeah, those guys!"
You know..
The McLaughlin group?
And no sor of music would tempt you out?
Not at all.
Not even if it was Tiger Feet by Mud?
"Well, that would tempt me out, yes."
Or Fox On The Run by Sweet or anything from the '60s or 'the 70s.
"Pretty much anything I'll go and dance to, actually."
I hate being in the kitchen at parties.
I'm no good at it.
Do any of you have party tricks that you do?
Any little things that you can sort of just...?
"Yes, yes, Rhys?"
Take that.
Listen to this.
"Two, two, testing."
"That's not it, is it?"
What I'll do is I'll do...
"For the festive season, I'll do the sound effects of Santa arriving at the top of the house and then coming down the chimney to put the presents under the tree."
Here he comes.
"Santa arriving, folks."
MAKES FAST GALLOPING SOUND
MAKES THUMPING SOUNDS
Ohh!
Aagh!
COUGHS
Ho ho ho!
APPLAUSE Very good.
That was...
That was special.
So we're heading to a new year.
What does it hold for my guests tonight?
"Rhys, where will you be?"
Which hemisphere will you be in?
I'm picking entire bloody structure either.
"Could you get from the high over there, please?"
Of course the irony is... they've given this to a bloody documentaries director.
He won't want any dialog anyway.
It will all be fishing nets and local kids playing football.
You wait.
"What if, it's not what the American does that makes us put our work?"
It's what he doesn't do.
He falls for those.
He doesn't try to come between her and Johnnie.
Self sacrifice.
That's noble.
Only if he stands a chance?
Maybe he does.
Maybe she likes him because he is the sort who let her fix the propeller.
"So give him a name ""Margenes""."
Joe.
Hard boiled types only have last names.
Buckley.

Now what were you before you became Cole?
Catrin Pule.
Kathrine?
Catrin's the Welsh version.
It was his idea.

Cardiff Cole.
Caffeine Cole.
Coalmine Cole.
Hey!
?
"Another hard day at the office, eh, boys?"
What are you two doing in here?
- All the pretty ladies are out by the pool.
"- Well, it's safer in here."
Are these the waiters' jackets I ordered?
Yes.
"With those coats, your waiters will look better than your members."
- You look warm.
"Mac, get him a drink."
"- Er, two cents plain."
That's seltzer.
You got Lena workin' double time on the sewing machine?
- These weren't due till Tuesday.
- She has an incentive to finish early.
Mama and me are going on a vacation tomorrow.
A vacation?
I don't believe it.
Mm.
Believe it.
For years she's been harping me I should take her somewhere.
"Finally, she said,"
"""You don't take me on vacation, I find myself a younger man."""
"Yeah, big deal."
"At our age, an old man is a younger man."
"So, a vacation - what'll it hurt?"
"So, we're going."
It sounds like she's really got you worried.
Worried?
"What, me?"
Never.
"Of course, she's been acting very nice to old man Burnestein lately."
Where are you gonna go on this vacation?
They're putting the fig leaves on the statues.
- Mr. President.
- Bob.
"I don't know whatto say, sir."
"As soon as we learned from the secretservice you were en route, the directorwas notified."
- He should be here any minute.
- Oh?
Where the hell is he?
"Uh, well, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir."
"So, let's go."
"He told me to take you to his conference room, sir."
"No, his office."
I wanta very private conversation with him.
- I don'twanna be bugged.
"- Then, his office will be fine, sir."
Okay.
Hi.
"How's the job going, Bob?"
"Frankly, itstinks, sir."
I have no access.
We'll see to that.
"He's nervous, sir."
He's heard you're looking for a new director.
He certainly isn'tacting like it.
That's Helms.
He's the epitome of Sangfroid.
Aworld-class poker player.
Yeah?
"Well, I own the fucking casino."
"I'm honored, Dick, thatyou've come all the way out here to Virginia... to visit us at last."
"- My friends call me ""Mr. President."""
- And so shall I.
Unbelievable.
That was one of the things that he had:
enormous trust in young people.
Lou put me in charge and gave me his checkbook.
"And he said, you know, ""You distribute the fees."""
And I grew a beard because I wanted to look older.
I'm serious.
How old were you when Lou died?
- I was 11.
- That's what I thought.
"- I was 11, yeah."
- Did you know him well?
- I have a sense for him.
- Right.
"And I saw him, you know, once a week, maybe."
"- That's all, though?"
"- That's about all, yeah."
"- Did you ever travel with him, or..."
"- No, no."
"That's why I wanted to talk to you, because you spent a lot of time with him."
"- Oh, yeah, me and my family did."
- Your family did too?
"He used to spend Christmas with us, yeah."
- He spent Christmas with you?
"- He loved Christmas, yeah."
He absolutely loved it.
"I can remember him lying on our bed watching cartoons with the kids... and then falling asleep, you know?"
"They'd just say,"
"""Lou's sound asleep, Daddy."""
"That's when we'll leave... ""You know, leave him be."
"He's tired."""
"Lou was very willful, you see?"
With your best friends as an escort.
- Why is he here?
- Ogawa?
That guy makes me itch.
"Well, the Japanese want their tsuba back."
"With the sword gone, it's all that's left of a national treasure."
Don't worry.
They're leaving tonight for Japan.
"By tomorrow, the tsuba will be on the other side of the planet."
"By the way, just to ask it, who did give you that file on Artie?"
That's my secret to keep.
"Cooper, see that they get on their plane."
No detours.
"Yeah, and--and don't rule out shooting them if necessary."
What's going on?
What?
It's Ogawa. it was him at the embassy.
He walked out with the sword.
- Are you sure?
"- Myka, I saw him."
You have to trust me.
Dickinson looked at him when I asked him about the file.
Artie was right.
"Yeah, and now he's got the sword and the tsuba."
Heading for the diplomatic terminal.
There's no security.
"How about you both just take a time-out, huh?"
Just for the drive to Dulles.
Let's go.
Bored?
Yeah.
"Oh, finally."
"Get out, sinister one!"
"Get out, terrible one!"
Away with you!
Away!
Get away!
Away!
Don't touch me!
- Go away!
Away!
Die!
"Pray for us, Sister Renata!"
"Pray for us, Sister Renata!"
"Have pity, dark one..."
"Look, isn't that the one who put your viola out of tune?"
There she is!
There she is!
You yourself are a devil's servant!
Profanity comes from your lips!
"Die, crumble away!"
Crumble away like ashes in the desert!
You are a devil with a tail and hair.
"Sisters, tear off his clothes!"
Trample him down!
Trample him down!
This woman is guilty of carnal intercourse with the Devil.
She is subject to the judgment of the inquisition.
She shall be tortured and then burned at the stake.

"Love is like a net, capturing heroes' hearts"
"Like a sword, vengeance cutting through love and hate"
And shut up.
"Right everyone, your work-experience placements have been finalised."
"And as 99% of you left it to the careers officer,"
I don't want to hear whingeing about where you're heading.
Sir.
There seems to be some mistake.
"Is the mistake you choosing to ignore me saying ""No whingeing""?"
"No, sir, it says here I'm going to work at a garage."
Yes.
Come on.
Me.
A garage?
- Does that seem likely?
- What's your point?
I wrote to the local paper.
To shadow a journalist there.
Maybe even write a few pieces myself.
"Right, let me have a look."
"I don't get paid extra for this, you know."
"OK, it says here that Sutherland is expected at the newspaper."
- Case closed.
"- Well, then there's clearly been some sort of mix-up."
I don't mean to be rude but  look at him.
- No offence.
- None taken.
"What was your first choice, Sutherland?"
Airplane driver.
- And that is...?
- Someone who drives planes.
- You mean a pilot.
- Do I?
- What was your second choice?
- Never.
- What else did she say?
- That he was nice to her.
That he helped her get over Quini.
Thank you.
"Bye, buddy."
Goodbye.
His name is Sebastian Rovira Galvez.
He doesn't work at the hotel anymore.
He got fired.
They still have some of his things there.
We need to get them.
MOTHER WITH FRIEND
TOMORROW AT 7:30 AT THE CROSS.
GO ALONE.
The photos of the girls were taken with a roll like that one.
- Only one place sells them.
- Where?
Where are my photos?
- I don't have them yet.
- And what do you have?
"Aguila Photography, in Seville."
Someone places a prepaid order every month.
- Who?
- A good-looking guy named Quino or Quini.
"They develop them there too, but they wouldn't tell me about them."
But definitely not communion photos.
I think there's someone else there.
You can see the reflection of whoever took the photo.
He's blurred by the flash.
Tell me who he is and you'll get your photos.
"All right, but I'll need the negative."
I'd be happy to show you around.
Right.
Please follow me.
"- Go, go, go!"
"Quick, come on."
- Move.
"- Grab these ones, too."
- What are they doing in here?
Riley said I can't keep it up in my room any more.
- You can't keep it in the freaking kitchen.
- This is our common area.
"And as you can see, we keep a very tight cleaning schedule here at the house."
"We also like to focus on and stress education, music..."
Hot soup coming through!
"The kitchen, where we provide a well-balanced diet."
They're his pets.
Rescue rats.
Tweaker grew up in the basement of a candy store before coming here.
- They were his only friends.
- Take me to Mr Webb.
"Hey, clean the crumbs off the floor."
They're very clean for rats.
"Hi, I'm Randy Webb, home director."
I see you've met Furry and Scurry.
"Wonderful, lovely creatures, I assure you."
"This is not good, Mr Webb."
Not good at all.
"Come on, over here."
- Did you get what I needed?
"- You betcha, Ms Frazier."
Excellent.
"Two season tickets, third row, centre as promised."
"Clutched his halo and held it straight, didn't he!"
How do you know all that?
I know everything you do and think.
Dr. Jekyll wouldn't tell you.
He ain't the kind of...
"And as you were leaving the room, you turned at the door, didn't you?"
"And you said, ""For a moment, I thought..."""
What did you think?
What did you think?
Did you think Dr. Jekyll was falling in love with you?
"You, with your cheap little dreams?"
"Or did you think, perhaps that in him, you saw a bit of me, Hyde?"
"Oh, but it confuses you, doesn't it?"
"It isn't quite clear, is it?"
Oh...
What are you going to do?
Something so simple.
I'm going to put an end to all that confusion.
"Please, sir!"
"Oh, no!"
"Please, no!"
"Yes, dance."
Dance and dream.
Dream that you're Mrs. Henry Jekyll of Harley Street dancing with your own butler and six footmen.
Dream they've all turned into white mice and crawled into an eternal pumpkin.
"Here, you in there!"
Open this here door!
Police!
- Ivy!
- I'm going in.
Governor!
"Ho, there!"
I love you very much.
"Good morning, sir."
"John, what do you think of the president's proposal?"
I don't know.
"It's good to have less enemies, I guess."
You're a military man.
You don't think he's putting us at risk?
That's a little above my pay grade.
If you feel that way why didn't you run against him?
"- No, no, no."
That's one job I never wanted.
I like my office.
I like my constituents.
I like being a thorn in the side of the administration.
But I think voters today want somebody cool.
"Oh, come on, Mr. Speaker, I think you're pretty cool."
He went to bed at 8 and watched...
The president has a call scheduled with the speaker at 9:30.
"- I should be there for that, shouldn't I?"
- No.
You have to be here in case of a deadlock...
"Hey, I'm gonna see you later."
-
-With the red tie for that.
- Jenna?
"- Absolutely, Mr. Vice President."
Red tie's the way to go.
Jenna.
Jenna.
Did you get me in?
- What do I get if I did?
- What do you want?
Shizuru!
What?
Has something happened lately?
Eh?
"No, nothing."
"Yeah, but you are acting a little weird."
And so!
"Because our class has not been on the ball lately, the teacher chose a new motto for our class!"
What do you think it is?
Sis!
Eh?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Man...
You just don't listen to what anyone else says!
I'm sorry!
Say it again!
I don't want to!
Please!
I will listen this time!
Please!
What I was saying was...
My class has not been doing well so my teacher choose the motto Everyone has kibi kibi kibi-dango!
Sis has been acting like that for a long time.
G-Grampy?
You are acting like you are in a haze.
"What, did you get some of that Katsuragi-kid's smoke?"
"I admire her desire to search for anwsers, but the thing she wants to know about is so vast and vague, that she is struggling."
She is like a small bird caught in a net.
A net?
It is a trifling thing gor someone like you who can see those things.
- The truth.
- Why?
Because he could come back!
They've got a right to know.
- OK.
I'm coming with you.
- No.
- Let me take the blame.
- No!
"I got us into this, not you."
Although...
I'm in so much trouble
I think they might actually eat us.
I'll see you next time I'm allowed out.
Which is probably in the next 50 years or so.
You could leave them in the den till they promise not to punish you.
"Yeah, I might just do that."
You sure you don't want to split the blame?
- Positive.
- OK.
I'll see you in 50 years.
"I can smell you out there, young lady."
You are beyond grounded!
"Open this door, Maddy."
Open the door!
"You and Rhydian gave Tom and Shannon, a picture of you in wolf-form!"
What were you thinking?
"In some parts of America, wolves are protected."
I'm going to get our wolves protected too.
"If you want the Government to start passing laws to protect them, you need..."
- proof they actually do exist.
- I've got it!
-Get out.
"-lf l can't have you, then the jailer can."
Uh.
[WlNGO LAUGHS]
"Hot-blooded, passionate."
What a woman.
Maudie.
"My, my."
I don't know how you manage to resist such a display of ardor.
stains:
We'll bear witness.
We'll be on the jury.
Mr. Litefoot here is gonna look after our interests here at Eagle Bend.
You have entrusted me with this case...
... andsoIguaranteetoyourightnow that this man will be convicted.
"And hung, or--"
Or you get your money back.
"All right, let's ride."
Your name...
... Obediah.
"Obediah was a, uh, prophet of God."
He predicted the downfall of the Edomites.
The Edomites were an arrogant people.
They thought they were better than everybody.
"They tried to destroy Obediah's people, but-- lt didn't work."
Obediah's people rose up.
Justice was served.
Anything you wanna tell me before we go to trial?
"No, sir."
This Obediah just wants his day in court.
"You tell a story like that, Josiah..."
... you'lldojustfine.
Shit.
"Sir, we have Black Hawks coming in."
Which direction?
"From I Street, and fast."
"How do you feel, Mr. President?"
"Surprisingly good, Dr. Cale."
"Let me call in, make sure they don't think we're dead."
"The former vice president, Alvin Hammond.."
is clearly calling the shots as the new commander in chief.
I have John Cale on the line.
Cale?
Where's Carol?
Finnerty's been relieved of command.
The cavalry's coming.
Should be hitting the residence in a few minutes.
"No, no, no, not by air."
They have to come by ground.
I think we can handle this.
They have Javelin missiles.
Not according to our intel.
"Even if we wanted to call them back, they've gone dark."
"If they fail, they're going to kill every single one of those hostages.."
including my daughter.
Just go.
Take this and stay out of sight.
Thirty seconds!
Let's go!
"Incoming, three of them!"
Spread out!
Castle in sight.
"I say again, Castle in sight."
Are you ready?
You know that?
Completely hopeless.
- Any sign ofthem?
"- No, Your Majesty."
We've searched everywhere.
We've found no trace of your daughter or Sebastian.
"Well, keep looking."
"Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored."
Let no one in this kingdom sleep until she's safe at home.
"Yes, sire."
"Oh, what have I done?"
What have I done?
- Has he kissed heryet?
- Not yet.
Oh'
"Oh,Judy'"
Yo' Flounder' Any kissing?
"No, not yet."
Hmm.
"Well, they'd-- they'd better get crackin"""
Move over.
Move your big feathers.
- I can't see a thing.
- Nothing is happening.
"Only one day left, and that boy ain't puckered up once."
"Okay, all right, this calls for... a little vocal romantic stimulation."
Stand back'
Wow.
Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.
"Oh' Geez, man."
I'm surrounded by amateurs.
"You want something done, you've got to do it yourself."
"A good soldier should forget his past, and realize that he might not have a future, because he fights every day as though it were his last."
"Really, Alonso, when it comes to inspiring people you are one of a kind."
Come on.
I dont understand.
The place where we they're meeting us is...
It's two blocks from here.
"Also, coincidentally, they're meeting us in my neighborhood."
"Please, can you give me something?"
It's to eat.
Yes.
Here you are.
Thank you.
I've never seen such poverty.
The War had just ended.
People were hungry and there wasn't much food.
just what they got with their ration card.
My grandfather told me.
How everything has changed.
Hey.
I could swear that's you.
When I left home yesterday it was half-painted.
It was going to go in the sitting room.
Should we go in and ask?
No.
We have a mission to complete.
(WHISPERS) He's late for the Angelus.
Here.
Let's go.
I'm sorry.
-Is Lola working with the Nazis?
Impossible.
She is saving lives and risking her own.
"Look, Ronon says we're close."
"If we lose the trail now, we may never catch the Wraith."
Rodney and I will find her.
"Alright, but be careful."
Understood.
I'll come with you.
"No, I think it's best if you stay here."
"Look, is there anywhere that she liked to go?"
Any favourite hiding spots or favourite places?
"Yes, she often goes off for hours at a time, up into the hills."
"I don't like it, but she doesn't listen to me."
It's a start.
"You know, I thought it was pretty nuts, when Ronon was trying to track a Wraith through this forest."
"Now that it's just us, do you feel any better?"
Oh yeah.
Supremely confident.
Father.
Ellia.
Where did you go?
I was hiding.
I didn't want the others to know.
To know what?
Ellia!
Why did you take the retrovirus?
Because I don't wanna be this way anymore!
I hate what I am.
You heard what Dr Beckett said.
You know the retrovirus isn't ready.
I have no choice.
"When they kill the other Wraith, I won't be able to pretend anymore."
Pretend what?
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.
"Yeah, just, uh... just came in."
"Abby, check your in-box, please."
"Uh, I just sent you his I.D. photo."
Oh.
Great.
Facial comparison should get us somewhere.
"Michael Beers, 41, retired Marine."
Air marshal since 2010.
Lives up in Syracuse.
- Wife and two kids.
- I'm digging this guy's glasses.
"Those would be cute on you, Gibbs."
"I mean, not that squinting isn't totally super cute on you, too."
"I checked his accounts, boss-- he's got an open credit card at a motel about a mile from here."
Never checked out?
"Not yet, anyway."
"Well, okay, red flag city here."
"As much as these two look alike, the key markers-- it's definitely not a match."
"Well, who's that at the airport?"
I don't know.
"But whoever it is, it's not Air Marshal Mike Beers."
"All right, boss."
You got it;
we won't.
Won't what?
Why couldn't that be on speaker?
Gibbs doesn't want to alert the innocent bystanders that our friend over there is an imposter.
You were right.
You were right.
We were both right.
Then who is he?
Not a clue.
No one told me you were Australian.
Is that a problem?
Only if being horny as hell is a problem.
"Uh, okay, well, Lizzie has not been herself."
She's not moving very much and she's getting night sweats.
Just take a look at her.
Oh!
What is it?
I hate it!
Lizzie!
Lizzie?
Lizzie!
Lizzie is a lizard!
"I love snakes, but I absolutely hate lizards."
Lizards are a myth.
And she's been very weak.
She hasn't been moving very much lately.
"Ugh, you should have gotten a snake."
They wriggle all over the place.
Do you think I should enter more crickets into her diet?
"Oh, look, you're clearly flipping out about this."
I need to talk to him on his own.
Is there a master bedroom we could go to?
"Uh, the kitchen's right over here."
"Yeah, we could go to the kitchen."
"No, you stay here, mind the leg snake!"
"I could tell Trevor had a thing for me, plus, I needed to tell him what I was gonna do."
Listen.
Your snake's clearly gonna die unless I do surgery on it.
I don't find you attractive.
You'll come 'round.
"- No, I won't."
"Don't ever go back to the department, Colt!"
They'll use you up and hang you out to dry on Christmas!
You'll wind up sitting there with your freezing family waiting for the phone to ring!
"Don't worry, Dad."
They'll call you.
That's right.
And it'll be Bob Pogo on his hands and knees begging you to come back.
There's no reason for us to be worried.
Everything's gonna be fine.
That airline cannot go on without you.
Now enjoy your show.
Psychedelic dandelion!
I've been dosed!
There's a lizard in my brain!
"I'm Roger Dunbarton of Mohican Airways, and we are back!"

"Call today for a ""reservation""!"
I'm going to bed.
It's only 7:30.
- It's midnight in my mind.
- Frank...
I liked him better when he yelled at us.
God.
"Oh, God."
Why did he buy that damn TV?
No.
Otherwise it's impossible.
I won't use it.
You can trust me.
Would you trust someone like you?
You have my word.
Can he sleep at night?
Your partner.
I remembered.
He was in the Social-Political Brigade.
"You know, Franco's Gestapo."
He killed a girl at a protest in Vallecas in '71.
Shot her twice.
He's aged badly.
And I'm glad.
Hello.
How are you?
That's Marina.
She and my daughters were close friends.
Quini took her to the hunting lodge the other day.
"After they were together he asked her not to get dressed, and he tied her to the bed."
Then he left the room and came back with another man.
Who was he?
She didn't see his face.
"All she knows is he smelled good, like expensive cologne."
And that he had very soft hands.
He took photographs of her.
"Quini threatened to show them to everyone in town, if she told anyone."
The night my daughters were killed...
"Marina was with Quini, but not the whole night."
Do you think she'd be able to tell a judge?
She couldn't even tell you.
I have to go.
"I've had enough of the Cold War when we did... the ""Doctor Jivago"" shoot."
"You got the chicken, too?"
So good.
But I got the pieard.
I don't like playing with bones.
I'd bite my tongue on that one.
"You are so great, Richard."
I'm so glad you work at Skirt.
Some of the people there are so snobby.
The irony is they were all from trailer parks and they're all on the mate.
I was on the fashion closet and I heard Olivier and Resin talking...
- what is it with Paul?
- The duke?
What the hell is that?
Is he royalty or something?
Prince Chuck is his cousin or something.
"You'd never know, huh?"
Why do you think Resin is going out with him?
Do you think she'd be attracted to some guy in the art department?
But he's really cute... and funny... and smart...
Is it an arrow in your ass from Cupid Squivert?
- Yeah.
- But it's hopeless.
Why do you say that?
Things could work out.
- You never know a man's heart.
"- Yes, I do."
He already told me.
"He thinks of me as a ""great friend""."
The kiss of death!
But then on the other day he bought me fries.
He did?
"Mmm, yummers."
"He reminds me of Scotty on ""General Hospital."""
"No, ew, Jenna, do not like that man."
That is a bad man.
"God, you have a gift."
Laura Bush is your size.
[Exhales sharply]
Excuse me.
Hi.
What are you doing down here?
I'm known for being hands-on.
Clearly.
"That's how you should dress for work, by the way."
"Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines."
"Now, Afghanistan is a different situation."
[Indistinct conversations]
I'll have an apple juice.
"We don't have apple juice, sir."
Then I'll take a vodka and tonic.
"Hi, I'm Liz Lemon."
I know who you are.
I thought there was a strict dress code at this place.
I do recommend the pumpkin ravioli.
They're very subtle.
"So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy wanted me to talk to you about joining the cast of our show, and I don't know how you feel about that..."
"Let me ask you a question, everybody at this table."
"Did he just say the word ""pumpkin"" to me?"
"Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli."
Yo!
I'm buggin'.
I can't do this.
I cannot eat here.
I need a lawyer!
I want my lawyer!
- Oh.
"- Don't shout, Richie."
It oscillates the atmos and rattles my phlegm.
- I've found you a lawyer.
- Oh.
Met him outside.
Known him for years.
Spurty.
"- Pervy Sir Peter Spurty, QC."
- Mm.
"Bit of luck him being here, really."
He'll get anyone off if you buy him a dirty mag.
Remember when the Tory cabinet were found in that brothel discussing declining moral values?
Clear as a bell.
Pervy Sir Peter Spurty got them off.
Right.
He's the man for us.
Bring us our lawyer!
We demand Pervy Sir Pete.
"- In there, Spurty."
"- Blimey, that was quick."
"Well done the police, say I."
Why do left-wingers keep sniping at them?
"If you don't wanna get beaten up, you shouldn't be poor."
"Richie, shut up."
"Watcha, Spurty."
"Me and my mate are in a bit of a fix and are gonna do five to ten in the slammer unless you can stitch the jury, rig the judge and buy off the pigs with a kickback."
Eddie.
"Please, please, please."
"This is England, Eddie."
Just...
You wanna go?
Go on your bike.
"Yeah, yeah, go on your bike."
Fucking hell.
Sometimes it's easier just to say yes.
"Henry, catch!"
"God, I thought I lost you forever, Henry."
I was so scared.
I was so scared when you fell.
I thought I would never see you again.
"I love you, Henry."
I love you.
How sweet.
"If I took this moment and put it in a cup of tea,"
I wouldn't need sugar.
"Yuri, pozhaluysta."
"Each year, 100,000 baseball bats are sold in Russia and, at most, 50 baseballs."
Gives you an idea of a great Russian pastime.
This is a rare surviving bat.
Estelle.
Would you please be so kind and stand up?
Or do you want to take her place?
"Estelle, your boy's quite the white knight, sacrificing himself to keep you alive only for my dick... to kill you later."
"Are you sure, Henry?"
Are you sure?
Brilliant!
"Uh, come over here, Henry."
"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, Henry."
You... little... pussy.
"Give peace a chance, brothers."
My ego wants to kill you but my higher self doesn't.
You have to tell the truth.
"If Gene died from something he bought here, you are responsible."
Are you selling drugs?
No!
And we are done here.
You said you could help me.
You call this help?
She's practically accusing me of murder.
We're just trying to get to the bottom of this.
She's just the same as all the other mundanes.
They see the way we dress and they think we're freaks.
She's really just trying to help.
"It's okay, Coreen, I see who you're siding with -your minimum wage paycheck."
I thought you knew me.
I thought you understood the dark beauty of what I'm trying to create here.
I do!
Lexia!
"Hey, Coreen."
You came into this with an attitude about my friend and me and our lifestyle.
You were never looking to help her.
That is not true!
"Oh come on, think about it, Vicki, you can't ever trust anyone, can you?"
"Hey, excuse me, excuse me."
Oh my god!
Eew!
Yuck!
Eew!
Get off him!
911?
"Yeah, we need an ambulance to the Underground Club."
It's at Queen West and Crawford.
Thank you.
"But... whether I find one or not, you bury the German girl tomorrow."
"You know, he does have a point there, Sam."
"Oh, come on, Al."
I didn't leap in here just to bury Hilla.
"Well, there's nothing else that figures--"
Except-
"- Except if she was murdered, and the killer was never caught."
"Uh, well, look, if the chief finds the gun in the lake--"
He won't.
And-
"- And even if he does, it just means that the killer threw the gun in the water."
"Boy, you won't give up, will ya?"
Not when I feel I'm right.
All right.
Say you're right.
We find the gun-- even find someone to trace it to.
What does that prove?
You have no bullet to match it to.
I know.
"I know, Al."
It just doesn't make any sense to me.
"I mean, where's the bullet?"
"Talkin' to the stiffs again, Melvin?"
- Excuse me?
- That's the great thing about a stiff.
"They don't talk back, but, boy, can they listen."
[ Al ] Uh-oh.
"Uh, Sam, if-- if she's gonna do what..."
"I think she's gonna do, uh,"
I'm out of here.
"You okay, Melvin?"
Yeah.
Can you find it?
- Sure.
Give me 10 minutes.
Let me find now.
- Excellent.
- Hello?
"- Tool as a chartered company, consisting of religious statues a church in Los Angeles sent a large transport."
- Religious statues?
- Yes. 20 statue of the Virgin Mary.
But that address is sent to control a church in Los Angeles and I do not have such a church.
Tool company steeped in a bad way.
Even if this guy 5 cents there.
"House for sale was removed, his wife, the divorce lawsuit."
Çırpınıyormuş for the money this man.
- Someone must have paid kickbacks to him.
- Never been bribed.
- I rented the corporate bullshit.
I've never.
- We do not have anything at that time.
"- No, there's something."
- What is it?
Virgin lost 20.
- This is a bad thing?
- I think I look açına depends.
"- Michael, is not it?"
"- Yes, Mike."
"So Mike, this is really a very nice gesture."
- Are you coming to church?
Many familiar come.
- Sometimes I'm coming.
Yes.
"Yes, thank you again."
"God, that's terrifying."
I know.
Manny ditched us last night to go drinking.
"He thinks I don't know, but I know."
He smelled like a sweaty peppermint.
I saw the pictures that he texted Luke from the strip club.
Is that where Javier took him?
Oh.
You did not know that.
I'm sorry.
But it... it looked like one of the classier establishments.
"The girl that was sitting on Manny's lap had on a really cute top, at... at least in the first picture."
"The one time that I thought that he was going to be a good father, and he teaches Manny how to be a dog!"
I'm gonna kill him!
"Hey, look at me!"
I'm about to talk to a stranger!
(exhales sharply)
(slow rock music plays)
"Oh, yes."
This is it.
This is the one.
Ugh.
It wasn't this depressing last night.
The lunch scene in a strip joint is like a refugee camp with less hope.
Excuse me.
"Uh, my friend left some personal belongings here last night."
Anything left behind...
- goes in the lost and found.
- There we go.
Thank you.
"There's a jacket... glasses... hairpiece, I hope..."
- What about my stuff?
I was right.
Only $ 100...
I'm short of money right now.
I've been out of work...so just give me a little time.
"You understand, don't you?"
"You've got balls, young man!"
How come I never heard of you before?
You've got a lot of guts.
I'll find you some work for good money.
"No hard feelings, right?"
"If I can help you, let me know."
You've done well for yourself.
Enjoy the festa!
"Oh, this is too violent for me!"
What've you got there?
"Michael, your father loves you very much."
"Mr. Cicci, from the year 1942 to the present time, you were an employee of the Genco Olive Oil Company?"
That's right.
But in actuality you were a member of the Corleone crime organization.
"No, we called it the Corleone family, Senator."
What was your position?
"At first, like everybody else, I was a soldier."
-What is that?
"-A button, you know, Senator."
"No, I don't know."
Tell me.
"When the boss says ""push a button"" on a guy, I push a button."
"See, Senator?"
Mr. Questadt.
-You mean you kill people?
-What?
You kill people at the behest of your superiors.
"-You're the only voter i care-- -l'm getting that """"con"""" feeling."
-Like you're copping a plea.
"-No, come on."
No plea.
I'm just a pol who kept rolling along until he ran into a stone wall.
You were that wall.
And I realized...
... justlikeme whenIwasa kid .
"Young, ambitious, go-getter, but fair."
"Trading up, but always for the right causes."
You're doing good.
Not putting money in your pocket.
Just trying to maintain your position.

But down deep...

"I had the fire in the belly just like you, Kevin."
"And the odd thing is, I still have it."
Never left me.
I had the dream...

Like one of those guys before me said:
"""""lf a sparrow dies in Central Park, I feel responsible. """""
Well said. I feel that way.
I was gonna take that feeling with me...

So I thought I'd splash out and buy my daughter-in-law some furniture.

That's very generous of you.

"- Pawnshop, and it's awesome."

- I'm Bo.

- Right.
You've gotten mixed up with dangerous people.
- Like the mob?
- Sort of.
"Jenny, Olivia put a hit on you."
That's why Samir's been so distant.
He was protecting me.
Maybe he was leading you on.
Getting a piece of tail on the side while mouthing promises about leaving his wife.
Then he gets bored and just bails without even a goodbye.
Or whatever.
"I'm sure he cared about you, Jenny."
I can tell him to handle Olivia before somebody gets killed.
"Now get some rest, okay?"
Tell her what she's dealing with.
It's not fair.
No.
"I start talking about that stuff, Fae get mad at me and things start sucking."
"This is our life now, Kenzi."
We have to protect it.
This is how you want to play this game?
What a maverick.
Guess what.
I got 10 cops a week who pull this stunt in here.
"The tougher you guys act, the more I can see through you."
"Dyson, it's okay to ask for help."
Stab in the dark here.
I gotta hurry and get back to the shop before Mrs. Sparling's dryer shuts off.
I'll be out of a 50-cent tip.
"Don't worry, honey."
Aggie's gonna fix you up.
That German girl sure was pretty.
Her name is Hilla.
What dress did you get for her to wear?
A blue one with a...
bow on the back.
I left it in her room.
"That's not like you, Melvin."
You're always after me for forgetting' things.
"Well, you better get it."
We can't bury her naked.
Even if she didn't have no money.
You knew her?
Nah.
But you hear more in a beauty shop than a priest in confession.
"Uh, don't-- don't overdo it."
Just--Just keep it natural.
"Sure, Melvin."
[ Door Closes ]
"What are you doin' back here, Sam?"
I came to get a dress to bury Hilla in.
You decided to stay for the late show?
"I thought you were gonna sit this leap out, Al."
"Now, don't get me wrong."
"I've had a lot of fixations on women, but this-- It's not one of your cheap flings."
Whatever.
This is an obsession.
"Look at her, Al."
She's so young... and beautiful and... full oflife.
I can get a full-time job.
But what about college and law school that you've always talked about?
That's just a dream.
I can't do it.
My old man doesn't make enough...
Whose father does?
Not everyone in college is a millionaire's son.
Don't get so steamed up.
"Ted Carter, you've always wanted to be a lawyer."
"Now, go be it."
Don't crumple up at the first obstacle.
"The first obstacle's the biggest, the money."
"Well, then get over that and the rest should be easy."
Do you know how long it takes to become a lawyer?
What difference does it make?
It's what you wanna do in life.
One of the things I want to do is marry you.
"If I don't do it now, maybe I never will."
"Ted, the only family I'll ever have will be half yours."
I'll wait no matter how long it takes.
Good night.
"Good night, Selena."
Ted thank you.
Ma?
Ma?
Joey?
I thought you was something out of a dream.
Where's Ma and Joey?
"Let's have a drink, celebrate your growing up."
Where's Ma and Joey?
They're working at a party at Harrington's.
Let's have a drink.
"""When I came in to open up one morning..."
"""you had your head half in the toilet."
Your hair was in the toilet water.
"-""Disgusting."""
"-I told you, I had the flu."
-I said my piece.
"-Great, I can't even defend myself, now?"
-No one's attacking you.
-It doesn't change anything.
But I can verify that he was sick for a little while.
This thing with the dog.
How could you not see it on the chair?
You're getting emotional.
That's because I know what it's like to lose a pet!
I happen to know that you were high at my mother-in-law's wake.
"You were talking non-stop for 20 minutes, nothing but gibberish."
My mother's wake.
Jesus Christ.
-You want to read your statement?
-I don't write nothing down.
So I'll keep this short and sweet.
You're weak.
You're out of control.
You've become an embarrassment to yourself and everybody else.
-Listen to you.
-Guys.
"We said ""non-judgmental."""
Fuck that.
Let him take his medicine.
"Seriously, you want to talk about fucking up?"
"-Watch it, Chrissy."
-What?
Fire!
Who's that out there?
What's happening?
Goss.
- Has Defiant been taken?
"- Why, no, sir."
Whose...
Whose voices?
"Mr. Scott-Padget, the captain."
Did Goss tell you?
- I took the Venetians.
- Did we lose many men?
- A dozen or so.
- And wounded:
About threescore.
"Excuse me, I'm needed."
"Before she went down, we took a great deal off her."
"Crates full, en route to France."
But there's a much bigger prize.
Bring in the Frenchman!
"You wouldn't believe it but this figure is Colonel Giraud, a political advisor to Napoleon."
"All right, take him away."
It's fortunate that Colonel Giraud omitted to destroy all his papers.
He knows of plans for the invasion of England.
- Does he know when?
"- Within the next few weeks, sir."
He must be sent to London.
Of course.
"After I make the necessary repairs, we shall make all speed."
- You've done extremely well.
"- Thank you, sir."
"And, Mr. Scott-Padget this crew serves well, if you don't drive them too hard."
So?
JOHN:
"So, do we talk to the mother?"
What if she tips off Lila?
She wouldn't do that.
"She wouldn't do that, not Lila."
Have you heard from Lila?
"No, I haven't, not since last summer."
"Sometime around June, July."
"Mr. Dixon, you know Lila, you know she wouldn't do what they're saying she did."
"They must have kidnapped her, brainwashed her."
"Miss Walker, some of the best policemen in this country are after Lila and those other two fellas."
"Now, they're going to catch them too."
It will go a lot better for Lila if she turns herself in.
"Chief Dixon is right, ma'am."
"I can't make any promises, but if your daughter cooperates with us, that will be taken into account later."
I haven't heard from her.
"But if I do, I'll tell her what you said."
"Ronnie, you heard from your sister?"
"No, sir."
Would you tell us if you had?
"Yes, sir."
Grandma...
I'm hungry.
MRS. WALKER:
"Byron, don't bother us now, honey."
JOHN:
Who's that?
That's Lila's boy.
Didn't you know Lila had a boy?
And he's a pretty boy too.
Thanks for your time.
The victims are all over the map.
"Four men, three women."
Different ethnicities and ages.
Each of the victims had something removed...
"An ear, an eye, a finger."
Why?
What's the significance of that?
There is none.
"And because of the randomness, no one was able to connect the murders."
"Until Phillip Harris, of course."
So Phillip was right.
A serial killer's been hunting in L.A. and New York for three years completely under the radar.
All this way for a dead end.
"Oh, it might be for the best."
Ignorance is bliss.
"No, ignorance is hell."
Mr. Castle.
The GDS is requesting my presence at headquarters.
This must mean I passed their test and they want me to join their ranks.
"I hate to burst your fanboy bubble, but how do you know this is on the up-and-up?"
Is this on the up-and-up?
"Yes, sir."
What are you doing?
Watching your back.
Oh.
"Uh, we have..."
Hello.
"Mr. Castle, Ms. Shipton. [Door closes]"
It's a pleasure to meet both of you.
I'm Mason Wood.
What a pleasure.
I cannot even believe I'm here.
"Alive, even."
"Lowe, did we I.D the fingerprints yet?"
–There's a backlog.
–Backlog?
I cant find her if I can't I.D her.
Give me that.
Have your guys do door knocks.
Talk to every neighbor.
"Tell everyone if they find anything, give me a call."
This is Detective Wagenbach.
I told you I needed a rush on those prints.
We don't know she's dead.
She could still be alive.
"And if she is, I'd hate to see your backlog cost her her life."
–You told Claudette I was gone for an hour?
–You were gone for an hour.
Jesus!
She's all over my ass about this Tio connection.
She said she'd talk to you.
I figured the truth was the safest bet.
–Now it looks like I'm lying to her.
–You are lying to her.
"–What, are you trying to be a wiseass?"
"–No, I'm just..."
Just shut the hell up!
–Christ!
–Where are we headed?
I got things to do.
I gave you guys to Aceveda for the day.
–What?
"–Apparently, a group of male hustlers... is hangin' out on the same block as Aceveda's campaign headquarters."
He's setting up a sting operation.
"""What the hell are you doing, kiddo?"""
Right.
So who was I?
You were the voice in my head.
Like Emile Sayles is...
Like Emile Sayles is a voice in Liz Kenyon's head.
Only she wants him out.
That's what she told me.
"Now, when you used to hear my voice, where were we?"
Where we were putting in the work.
Backyard.
You making me work the heavy bag.
So when she thinks of him is where they put in the hours.
He started working with her in middle school.
So she wants him out.
Maybe she takes him back to where he climbed in.
I've got agents covering 100 possible targets up and down the west coast.
I can't drag away assets because you and I are working out some family crap.
"Well, you know, I thought we were catching Kevin Whitfield's killer."
Me and you.
It's a three-hour drive from here.
We can make it by opening bell.
Let's go.
[Bell rings]
[Indistinct conversations]
Can you tell me... why are we here?
I don't want you anymore.
It's been long enough.
I'm leaving you here.
You think you brought me here?
!
I brought you!
Suspected QVapor overdose and psychosis.
Welcome to the Pinky Amusement Park.
Here will be the wettest dream come true!
Get in!
"Commander Bishop, sir?"
- Commander?
"- It's full with Steam, sir!"
"Hey, idiot..."
General Trajano requests your report for the service!
Time to take you home!
Raise it up.
OMG!
"Commander Bishop, are you all right, sir?"
"Do not call me ""sir""!"
"Commercial sector 1, insured."
Prepare 51 for Spartan-7...
Bishop...
"It'll be good to see you again in your uniform, Bishop."
Who says I'm going to put it?
"Come on, we both know, you're not a deserter."
"Find another, for your murders."
You made an oath on Spartan-7.
"Take off your uniform, do not remove the promise."
"Come on, then, arrest me."
All my oaths were broken long ago.
Sorry for Mara.
She was a good woman.
It is difficult to deal with such a thing.
Especially today.
"That's why I brought you here, son."
It's time to get Mara closer.
We told you that your baby died.
You remember this place?
Of course.
I'm not brain-dead.
You used to bring me here every Sunday.
We'd get strawberry milkshakes.
Yeah.
With extra whipped cream.
"Yeah, and you'd always let me eat yours."
Yeah.
Seems like a lifetime ago.
"So, what did you wanna talk to me about?"
You.
"Uh, let me guess."
"Ok, you hate my hair,"
"My clothes, my friends..."
Sarah--
How I'm ruining my life.
"Sarah, I'm here because I wanna understand what happened."
I just wanna know how you and I ended up like this.
I don't know.
It just happened.
"Listen, I understand that the problems between your mom and I didn't or haven't helped the situation, but..."
Can we-- can we just order already?
All right.
I'm just trying to understand here.
"Well, you never do."
You just believe what you want.
"Well, maybe you do that, too."
What can I get ya?
"Uh, two eggs, over medium."
Multigrain toast.
"Uh, I'll do the mushroom and cheese omelet, please."
"Oh, you want to play some more."
"Well, bring it on."
"Oh, we're playing dirty, huh?"
"Hmm, looks like we've got a music lover here."
Reinforcements!
"All right, soldiers."
Looks like it's on us to save the day.
"Luckily, I've got a plan."
"Eska, Desna, listen to me."
You've got to help us stop Unalaq.
"I know he's your father, but Vaatu has made him completely crazy."
We will never turn on our father.
"Please, if you let me out now,"
I can still stop him from destroying everything.
"Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe."
"Desna, he won't be your father anymore."
You don't know what you're talking about.
Our father is the wisest man in the world.
"If he says what he is doing is right,"
I believe him.
Huh?
"You know, if I wanted some ball of evil lurking over my shoulder all the time,"
I'd have stayed home with my mother-in-law.
"All right, spirit army, your general is here."
Follow me!
It's working.
It's not working.
Get me out of here!
Whoo-hoo!
Aah!
"All right, guys."
Rescue time.
"Okay, I think we got some things out in the open."
"Nathan, do you think that basketball is part of your families problem?"
- Part of.
- But you still like playing?
I don't know anymore.
"Great, nice break through Nate."
"Thanks, Doc."
- Dan.
- Hustle up!
No way this is helping.
"You're right, Dan, we don't need a shrink to identify this families problem, you just made it obvious."
"I'm not his only parent, Deb."
"- Hey why don't you ride with your old man, Nathan."
"- Stop it, Dan."
"Come on Nathan, lets go."
Let the kid make up his own mind.
"What do you say, son?"
Nate?
Nathan!
Here we go.
This is the writer I was talking about.
Somerset Maugham?
"Well its, ""Maugham"""
- Human Bondage.
- Bondage!
"Yeah, its not like that."
"So, you're good."
Are we done here?
"Well, I just thought that this was a better opportunity for us to spend some time, you know, hang out with each other."
"And it is, but can we maybe do it someplace that smells a little less funky?"
"Haha, it's the smell of old books."
Like I said!
These were captured by our spy satellite cameras.
It's a public base on the Pacific Coast.
We'll see if we can talk to the fighter jet pilots and get a report from them.
Department Head?
"The wind is so strong, why did you open the window?"
- Because it was a bit stuffy.
- I understand.
Then I will leave first.
"""Twenty people were betrayed by their own country."
"I will definitely come to take it."""
My child!
"No, no, no, no!"
My child!
My child!
No...
My child...
"No, don't."
My child...
Mu Yeol is dead.
I will take the child and support him.
"Only without this child, can you find your own happiness."
Start all over again.
You must be happy.
"Silence that child, if you want to live!"
"Mu Yeol, I took the child and I'll give him his name."
Not as Park Yun Seong but as Lee Yun Seong.
I will go on.
"This is the world's cruelest revenge, because that's the reason I survived."
-=10 years later
"- The Golden Triangle, Northern Southeast Asia=-"
"Boss, this man stole our drugs to sell."
How do we deal with it?
I heard you got into an accident.
I only found out after I got out of the hospital.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
"Oh, I-I'm fine now."
What happened?
It seems weird.
I'm going to your house right now with your stuff.
I'm close by so I'll be there soon.
Okay.
She said she's coming here...
Good.
"I was too busy to get Yoon Jae's things, but I guess she's doing it instead."
What about Yoon Jae's hospital?
Do I have to start working tomorrow?
You can't do that.
Say that because of the accident you need rest and get a break.
Then what about the marriage?
Do I have to do that too?
!
"Until then, he must come back."
He must.
"Even if he doesn't, I'm not planning on doing that for him too."
Do you want to clean while we're waiting for Se Young?
"Hah, I had to clean Yoon Jae's body."
Do I have to clean his house too?
No thanks.
"When you meet Se Young, have your manners and don't look at her with weird eyes."
I'll stare at her with open eyes.
Where is the vacuum?
"Oh, this is heavy."
I guess it wasn't an empty bag.
Looks like Yoon Jae packed his suitcase.
Come on with me.
"-ls that him there, kid?"
-No.
-How about him?
-Nope.
-That's the guy--
-Get him.
Excuse me.
-Scumbag.
"-Come here, you piece of shit."
-Know this kid?
-Yeah.
-Know where he lives?
-Yeah.
-You deliver mail to his house?
-Yeah.
"From now on, any letter from that school to that kids house comes directly here."
You understand?
"If another letter from that school goes to that kid's house in the fuckin' oven you're gonna go, head first."
That was it.
No more letters from truant officers.
No more letters from school.
"In fact, no more letters from anybody."
"Finally, after a couple of weeks, my mother had to go to the post office and complain."
How could I go back to school after that and pledge allegiance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit?
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.
Mickey called.
Want me to call him back?
"All right, make the call."
He used to get all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back from an outside phone.
Is that you?
Why'd you leave so early this morning?
We could've shared an Uber.
[chuckles]
"Oh, I didn't want to wake you..."
Or talk more.
I've almost never been up to this floor.
Now I guess I have six-foot-four reasons to come hang out.
Boop!
"See you at lunch, bae!"
ALL:
Ooh!
I can't believe Amy works here.
And why is she acting like we're dating after one casual night of the best sex of her life?
Because you straight-up agreed to date her?
"Uh, don't you remember?"
"Uh, no."
"Oh, no, Jack, did you do that thing where you only act like you're listening and instead just say ""uh-huh"" and ""great"" to everything?"
So nice to put a face to the paycheck.
Uh-huh.
This has been fun.
You're a good listener.
Great.
"Look, I'm done sleeping around, but if you think we have something real here..."
Uh-huh.
...then let's go back to your place.
"Wait, what?"
"Oh, great!"
EMMA:
Wait.
So you only heard the part when she brought up sex?
"Isn't that gross, Clark?"
The timing is the key.
"Ifwe delaythe Germans by a half an hour or more, that'll solve the problem..."
They'll face the encirclement.
"How many people will you assign to the attack, mayor?"
I won't let you burythe whole regiment here.
I agree.
The Germans are not to be worried right now.
And I'll send my scout companythere.
"-Yes, I will."
-What yes?
-They'll be there.
-Who will be?
-Malyutin and his people.
- Malyutin?
-Do you mean the guywho killed the saboteurs?
- That very Malyutin.
"He isjust a boy, you know such people."
But a verytalented one.
-Will you issue such an order?
"-Yes, I will."
Because you'll give it to me.
And the orders are not to be discussed.
"OK, it is all hot talk."
We might tryto find some other solution.
"In any case, I'm not going to bury my people for peanuts."
Comrade colonel...
-What?
-A new one.
The former one was better.
OK. I'll help you if I can.
You know everything will be assigned to this breakthrough.
"Please, pass overto your Malyutin my request. lt is not an order."
Uncommonly pretty eyes.
Oh!
Ow.
Ooh.
- Are you all right?
Ow.
Ow.

"Nail-biting stuff, this is, isn't it?"
Ladies... it is with some surprise...
I announce the vote to be... a tie.
"This means that, as president, I have the casting -"
So sorry I'm late!
"Uh bit of an accident on my bike, Mrs..."
Madam President.
"You haven't voted yet, have you?"
"- Indeed we have, Claire."
"The vote was a tie, which means that I have the casting vote."
"With all due respect, Madam President -"
And I cast my vote in favour of closing the Institute for the duration of the hostilities.
But...
But I'm here now.
And it's lovely to see you.
"But, alas, I'm afraid too late for you to vote."
"I respect what you said about loyalty this morning, Mrs Cameron Madam President."
"Think very carefully about what you're about to say, young lady."
"Feel free to speak your mind, Miss Hillman."
You're among friends here.
I'm not ashamed to say the thought of war scares me.
"It terrifies me, if I'm honest."
But that's why I need this.
You.
"Ah, the pirate thing."
"Well, I don't need you to share."
You're something of an open book.
Am I?
Quite.
"Let's see, you volunteered to come up here because you were the most motivated."
You need to get back to a child.
"That's not perception, that's eavesdropping."
"Ah, but you don't want to abandon him the way you were abandoned."
Was I?
"Like I said, open book."
How would you know that?
"I spent many years in Neverland, home of the Lost Boys."
And they all share the same look in their eyes.
The look you get when you've been left alone.
"Yeah, well, my world ain't Neverland."
But an orphan's an orphan.
"Love has been all too rare in your life, hasn't it?"
Have you ever even been in love?
No.
I have never been in love.
- NEAL:
I think this little guy is hungry.
- (EMMA LAUGHS)
"Go ahead and get whatever you want, sweetie."
I'm gonna get directions.
I will.
NEAL:
"Hey, man."
- OWNER:
How are you?
- I've been better.
wayne!
this is mine?
i own this?
- all yours.
"- i have never gotten anything this nice in my entire life, wayne."
- so then... you like it?
'cause the guy i got it from said it's in great condition.
"- matsui, your favorite co-  please stop talking."
i just need a minute.
ahh.
"oh, yeah."
this is my helmet?
- that's your helmet.
"put it on, baby."
it matches the bike.
you look so good.
- thank you.
[chuckles] [sighs] how'd you afford this?
- don't worry about it.
it's a gift.
- is it from your college fund?
"- i was born in a trailer park, i was raised in a trailer park, i'm assistant manager of the dollar king, and my woman is cindy wegman."
- what?
"- that's who i am, baby."
- as long as you're sure.
"- well... you see, baby... meeting you brought so much joy in my life and -- [engine turns over, revs] [shouting] and i don't want that joy to end, so i was thinking, maybe you'd do me the honor of..."
[engine revving]
- whoo!
[laughs] [engine shuts off]
- you got to be kidding me.
- want to go for a ride?
- what?
Right.
"I've seen how crazy it can get at those tables, and sometimes, people lose control."
They give in to their emotions.
You will not.
You understand?
Yeah.
Get some rest.
- Some rest?
"- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow."
Tomorrow?
I have a Quantitative Literacy paper due Tuesday.
"- No, you don't."
- I don't?
"No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly."
"I told him you were helping me with a special assignment, and he understood, so he gave you an A."
"You see, Ben, amazing things can happen from the inside."
You'll get a call about details later.
"So did the girls go on ahead, huh?"
"Oh, yeah."
"They got a lot more bags to check, you know?"
Okay.
"Well, wait for us by security 'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head."
"No, I'm good."
"No, I really think you should go."
It's a long flight.
"- No, I'm okay."
- We're going to the bathroom.
"Honestly, I really don't have to go."
- I don't care what you have to do.
"- Look, I really don't have to..."
Please just shut up.
Why are you looking over there?
Mom says you're not allowed to call me that.
"Well, it all started three weeks ago when I got into a small but very severe car accident."
"- Oh, my gosh."
- What's the other thing
Dr. Ellie told Anna-Kat to do to stay calm?
"Oh, yes!"
Sing a song in your head!
No!
Not that song!
Too late!
♪ Don't let them in ♪
♪ Don't let them see ♪
♪ Be the good girl you always have to be ♪ ...stops.
I hit him.
- Oh!
"- So I'm driving... ♪ Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know ♪"
♪ But now they know ♪
What are you doing?
We spent three years getting that song out of this house.
It's spilling out.
♪ Let it go ♪
♪ Let it go ♪
"Oh, dear Lord."
♪ Can't hold it back anymore ♪
"Honey, you have got to calm down."
Isn't it a good thing your mom has someone to talk to?
"Now we've got the neediest woman in the world coming together with the biggest attention whore in the world, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid."
"So, no!"
Not good!
I'm gonna use a word...
Selfless.
You didn't want to ruin their holiday by not showing up.
"[Man on TV] Oh, that can't be goo for his lower back!"
"Human Baboon, you stinker!"
Stop your evil ways.
[Thwacking]
"Oh, no, you don't."
"[Arthur] Tick, help!"
Egad!
My cold has escalated into double vision.
I'm the real Arthur.
He's a clone.
I Arthur.
What matter of rare quandary is this?
How can I be sure which Arthur is the real Arthur.
[Starts to sneeze]
Look!
"Tick, look!"
He's turning into a monster!
Monster?
Where?
Can't see anything wrong with him.
"Um, Arthur?"
"[Sighs] If you two don't stop this roughhousing, somebody's gonna get hurt and end up crying."
I know how I can prove I'm the real Arthur.
I'll tell you something only you and I would know.
"Go ahead, Arthur-like person."
"Oh, uh..."
OK.
"Remember that time my sister gave me that V-neck sweater vest for my birthday and we tried to return it to the store and they'd only give me credit, and I was so upset, and then at lunch they put onions on my cheeseburger,"
after I expressly asked the waitress not to?
"Do you remember that day, Tick?"
Oh.
Indeed I do.
"and it said,"
"""Nuts."""
"Why did he say, ""Nuts""?"
"It means, ""Go to hell!"""
"Why didn't he just say, ""Go to hell""?"
"Because he said, ""Nuts."""
Nuts.
Peanuts.
Gail!
"Gail, my sweetheart, you look beautiful."
"Save it, Dad."
Was it your idea to get my son drunk tonight?
No.
No.
Right.
Okay.
Everybody back to the reception.
Come on.
But I'm hammered.
And I want to talk to you.
"Have a cup of coffee, Stanley."
Here.
"Well, what's this?"
"Well, as your brother's best man, you are required to give a toast, so I wrote down a few thoughts, some things that you might want to say."
You think I was going to wing it?
"Let's go take some pictures, okay?"
What's going on?
"Mr. Green, I have access to a keyhole military satellite that I can use to track New Bern's movements in the field today."
Beg pardon?
It's real.
The one restriction is that no one can know where you're getting this information.
Tell them I'm... scouting in the field-- tell them what you want-- but the satellite must remain a secret.
"The new, strange one?"
How many times have I told you?
I don't like it...
"I know, you don't like me looking at your works-in-progress, but I peeked."
It's weird.
"You know it's weird, because you never cover your paintings."
I'm going.
See you later.
Hon. I didn't mean to piss you off.
"Quit it, Charlie."
Get out of that.
"Damn it, Charlie, that's my dinner."
"Get out of there, Charlie."
Get out of there.
"Hey, help me up here, would you?"
My hip hurts a little bit.
I think you might have brushed me going by.
"Come on, fellow, help me."
Just a close call.
"I'm sorry, man."
I'm really sorry.
Quit gibbering and help me get up.
"I think I sprained my hip getting out of the way, and my back hurts a little."
"Oh, my God."
Did you really hit me?
"I can't deal with this right now, man, okay?"
I got 12 points and a DUI on my license already... and there's an ounce in my glove compartment.
What are you talking about?
Help me.
"It's not really primo stuff or anything, but an ounce is an ounce, right?"
"Besides, someone will come along pretty soon."
What the hell are you talking about?
Other way around.
Drummer first.
But it sounds good anyway.
Now let's sing together
"Grandma, leave cuz we're shy"
"--1,2,3..."
"Daddy, close the door --What, did you buy the whole store?"
Yeah
I got nothing today.
Go to the cafeteria
Today I have.
See?
Ellie baked them
Pastries with jam Blintzes with cabbage
"So, Pavel Ivanovich, shall we take a ride?"
I dug up some worms.
Made kasha for the road.
"Stanislav, let's take you as an example"
While you bring this woman along with you
"So, am I to keep silent about that?"
"Of all people, you should know better that she is practically my wife"
"--So let's not touch this topic --No, let's!"
"Since you started this conversation, then let's!"
"It's not clear to Masha ""practically"" whose wife she is, yours or that soccer players."
Vasin speaking.
Hello
--Press the button!
Hello!
--What soccer player?
I don't know.
There's lots of them.
"Raya, did Sorokin show up?"
"Hi, Norman."
"Oh, hi, Allison."
What's the matter?
Same old thing.
Grownups who act like children.
"Hey, could I walk home with you?"
No.
You'd get home late.
"You mean, your mother wouldn't like it."
- Well... .
"- Come on, Norman."
Come on.
Spend the afternoon in the library again?
Yeah.
Isn't it awfully dull going there every day?
Yeah.
Then why do you do it?
I like books.
Good place to do my homework.
"Besides, where else could I go but home?"
Go down to the water.
Sit in the square.
Take a walk in the woods.
I can't.
"You know, that was a nice speech you wrote for Mrs. Thornton."
I'm sorry I did it now.
Why didn't you read it yourself instead of Rodney Harrington?
Because I was afraid I'd cry.
Still might cry every time I think of Ms. Thornton not getting that job.
"You know, you just might turn out to be a great writer."
"Norman, I hope so."
"You know, every time I touch a book or read a story or even when I just open the dictionary something inside of me goes thump and my heart starts pounding, and my stomach."
The concert was today?
You could make a little planter out of it.
I'm sorry!
I've gotta go!
"Thank you, Scuttle!"
"Any time, sweetie!"
Any time.
"Yes, hurry home, Princess."
"We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's celebration, now, would we?"
Ha!
"Celebration, indeed."
"Oh, bah!"
"In my day, we had fantastical feasts,"
- when I lived in the palace.
- [Whimpers]
[Gulps]
And now look at me.
Wasted away to practically nothing.
"Banished and exiled and practically starving, while he and his flimsy fish folk celebrate."
"Well, I'll give 'em something to celebrate soon enough."
Flotsam!
Jetsam!
I want you to keep an extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his.
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.
"I just don't know what we're going to do with you, young lady."
"Daddy, I'm sorry."
I just forgot.
As a result of your careless behavior...
Careless and reckless behavior!
"...the entire celebration was, uh..."
"Well, it was ruined!"
That's all!
That often tells us that they know each other.
Not to mention it took many botched attempts to burn him.
Because the unsub didn't realize how difficult it is to actually burn a human body.
Or it's overkill.
He wanted Proctor to suffer the most.
[Rossi] Which definitely makes it personal.
"If he knew the first victim, it's a good chance he knew them all."
We just have to find out how.
We can start by talking to Tony Torrell's wife.
- [Door closes] - [Prentiss] How you doing?
"Uh, I'm fine."
"Uh, I'm here to see Agent Rossi."
He's going to be with you in just a few minutes.
I'm Agent Prentiss.
"Oh, I'm Kiersten Torrell."
Uh...
My husband Tony was killed last night.
"I know, and I'm very sorry."
May I sit down?
"Oh, yeah."
Are...
Are you working on his case?
"Yes, I am."
Is there a picture of him in your folder?
I want to see him.
"Kiersten, uh, your husband was very badly burned."
I don't think that's a good idea.
"What do you mean, he was burnt?"
The person who did this uses fire as a weapon.
Was Tony set on fire alive?
- We don't know that.
"- Oh, my God."
- I don't think I can.
"- Yes, you could."
Kiss me.
I don't know why I should act so experienced.
It was only my second kiss this year.
"It wasn't as good as Rodney's, was it?"
No.
"Hello, I guess I should've phoned but I was in the neighborhood..."
- That's all right.
I have a message for Allison.
Is she home?
"No, she and Selena have just gone over to Kathy Ellsworth's house."
That gives me a good excuse to talk to you.
- May I come in?
"- Oh, of course."
- You have a lovely house.
- Thank you.
Please come in.
This is a very comfortable room.
"Good books, pictures."
My own hotel room is a bit basic.
"I have a mirror for shaving, a basin for washing and a closet to hang my coat."
You ought to find a house.
I'm trying to.
"In the meantime, I have my hotel room, which I clear out of right after dinner."
You said you had something you wanted to tell me.
"I was telling you something, but you weren't listening."
Your husband?
He died when Allison was 2.
And Allison.
- A few years ago.
- She's grown a bit since then.
"Heather, there is a doctor here to see you guys."
I cannot believe you're calling in outside help when I'm right here.
"♪ I like the way you do it, honey ♪"
♪ Especially when we do that... ♪
Oh.
"Oh, I get it, yeah."
Okay.

"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"- Matt, Chad..."
"- Mm-hmm, yeah."
my three boyfriends before that.
None of them had steady jobs.
And all of them were these dreamers addicted to romance.
"- Yeah, you really do only date your father."
- Yeah.
You guys only got me for another 18 minutes.
You want me to dance or anything?
- Um...
- Can you unload the dishwasher?
(sighs)
"Anyway, I've done some soul-searching, and I think I've finally figured it out."
- I haven't told anybody this...
- HEATHER:
I think that sounds like a natural stopping point right there.
So great to catch up with you.
"Ah, yes, the last time you said that, you forgot."
"Ah, yes, the last time you said that, you forgot."

"Hey, hey."
Come on...
"- Darling, please don't go."
You don't want a man for a husband.
You want a coward who'll run out on a friend in danger.
"That's not me, and never will be."
"I don't care how much I love you, and I do, very much..."
I'm a soldier...
"I mean, I'm a man first."
"All right, MacCheesecake, get that silly smirk off your face."
- Come on.
- Let's go.
Surely Mother Kali is kind.
"One Englishman fly walks in, and now our web is baited."
More will follow.
Two more have crossed the bridge.
It is well.
Prepare.
You said this place was full of priests.
- Sahib do not give Din chance to say.
"- You've got a mouth, haven't you?"
Quiet.
It's Kali.
A Thug temple.
Why didn't you tell me they were Thugs?
I've a good mind to split you in two and stuff you up an elephant's trunk.
MacChesney roar so loud... poor bhisti cannot get a word sideways between roarings.
Enough of that.
We're here to find Cutter.
We should have brought every man in the regiment.
"I only wish you had, sahib."
"Hello, Din."
"Fine work, bugler."
I knew you'd do it.
You got anything?
Who knew so many people travelled through Colombia?
Wait.
Who was that?
Back it up.
"That is Alberto Velez, 52 years old, born in Santo Domingo."
Who is that?
"Abby, get rid of his beard."
Lighten his hair.
Clean him up.
I get it.
I totally know where you're headed.
Cross-reference him with the terminal crowd.
Got him.
"I'm gonna have to ask you folks to clear this area here, please."
Thank you.
Excuse me.
"Lana, is it?"
I'm afraid you can't let anyone off that plane.
They've been circling for hours.
I only take orders from TSA.
"Tell her, Ellie."
What's this all about?
Have you found a gun yet?
"No, but we're not done screening."
"Well, unless you want an assassination on your hands, you're gonna move that plane to another gate."
"This is the only gate that's cleared, and the plane's already de-boarding."
"Oh, no."
"Oh, yes."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are now pleased to announce the arrival of flight 3182 from London, now deplaning at gate 212."
"Esto es para ti, Gomez!"
Esto es para ti!
I do not like the sound of defeat.
You want to know where I'd be if I'd given up on my dreams?
"Living right down the road managing a Dress Barn, driving 400 miles in a ball gown to sing karaoke."
"I would not be the supermodel of the world that I am today, okay?"
Hello.
"Hey, listen."
I'm driving to Texas if y'all want a ride.
"Well, shall we sashay away?"
You know that's copyrighted.
"Say it again, and you owe me $12,000."

No.
I'm sitting next to RuPaul.
Transcribed by Uncle Andy
My marriage was a sham.
"I'm with Interpol, Serious Financial Crime Agency."
Your husband had the copy made for some oligarch to put on his yacht.
I see it in you now.
That look.
What look?
Revenge!
They were laundering money on a massive scale.
"You know, you learn so much more about people after they're dead."
I found him.
I found John Brandeis.
Choosing a blind man?
That is the Constantine Clios touch.
A blind art dealer?
"I had to, to make him quiet."
"""And then I didn't know what to do."
He was too heavy.
It was too far to the river.
So I left him.
Things kept going bad when I got back to our street.
His mum was already looking for him.
Thom!
Thom?
"""So I went behind mrs Bailey's house, where dad found that weird guy."
"That's where I had to leave the jacket."""
Christy.
Christy?
Ben!
Where's the phone?
I thought dad would still be asleep.
Must have been right behind me.
"""Things kept going wrong."
I went back for the jacket it was gone.
"And then I found out you were looking for a torch, so I thought if I put dad's torch back, you'd leave him alone."
"On Christmas day, I heard dad get up early."
I followed him up to mrs Bailey's house and I found the jacket there.
""" That weird man must have taken it."
"""All I had to do was put it back in her house."
""" Now ""her"", meaning ms murnane?"
But mum mum made it hard.
"""I just wanted us to have a normal Christmas."""
But it wasn't.
"""I came back with Tash, but then she came over."""
"We'd only been gone a day, and she was already after dad."
Thom was gone.
We'd gone.
"Your apprentice is smart, he has a bright future"

I'll teach him a good and harsh lesson

It's bad luck!
"In fact, you can take the punishment... as a form of practice"
It's not only horse stance that I'm having

Let me show you
"[J.D.] I knew if I didn't leave that bar and go back,"
"I'd never be able to enjoy any of the simple things, even a woman eating my former bangs."
Voilà.

"See, that's the thing about being an extra mile guy."
You never know who it's gonna rub off on.
"""Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you."""
"[High pitched Southern accent] ""Oh, have you, Stanley?"
"I wasn't expecting any."""
"- ""I hope you like it."""
- Aw...
"- You're hating this, aren't you?"
"- No, that's not it at all."
I don't believe for a second that you really want me to leave.
"You gotta feel it, Lyle."
Get involved.
What do you people say?
Let's take it from the top?
"""Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you."""
Again.
Do it with some force.
"Okay, honey, finish up."
We've gotta get to school.
- Mom?
- Yeah.
Does this map look like Portugal?
I have no idea.
But nobody knows what Portugal looks like.
"I mean, even the Portuguese think they live in Spain."
Sorry I'm late.
This is all I could find.
Ok?
"Winter break and then the month of July, and this is the first time she's even ever been around the house."
I don't think she's actually a mom.
She told you about my mom taking pills?
Did she?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You know everything about your mom?
The bulls and clippers are on tonight.
The point spread is perfect for a killing.
You want to put 50 on it?
You want to tell me why you stole my palm pilot?
What are you talking about?
From the office earlier today.
I want it back.
"You know what, screw you!"
"You know, my father's a little embarrassed to tell your mother, but..."
Heh heh...
I'm not.
I didn't take anything.
"All right, man?"
[Engine starts]
I want to set something straight.
Burton:
Ok.
I never told Anne about your flirting with me.
My mother saw us in the pool one afternoon that summer.
"I don't know where Anne was, but..."
"We were wrestling around in the pool, and my mother saw, and she jumped to a conclusion and told my sister."
Ok.
But it was the truth.
"Liz, you were a kid."
Please leave a message.
"Hi, baby."
"It's me, Stan."
"I was just sitting here on my bed eating dinner by myself, and I'm looking at the place where we, you know, were last night, and..."
Holy cow!
It's still warm!
"Oh, wait."
That's because I put my spaghetti pot on it.
I make a good sauce.
"I take a jar of Paul Newman's, and I add..."
"Wait, what happened?"
I slept with him.
"No, with the sauce."
What did he add?
I picked the worst person to have a one-night stand with.
He's a parent at Ritchie's school!
"He's depressed, he's needy."
"Well, it sounds like you two have a lot in common."
"What was I thinking going to the supermarket, picking up a random guy for sex?"
Huh.
"Out loud, it sounds foolproof."
"Oh, this is awful."
Sad Dad isn't going away.
"""Sad Dad""?"
Isn't that sweet.
You guys already have pet names for each other.
"Shut up, Matthew-- you've got to help me."
"Just pick up the phone and tell him the truth-- he was a one-night stand, and you never want to see him again."
No.
I'm gonna handle this my way.
I'll cut my bangs and eat a Dove bar and go to bed.
"Hey, did you hear that?"
The Inspector is up with him now.
Father.
What a terrible shock for you both.
Who could have done such a thing?
Edie is quite understandably wondering whether it was me.
I haven't said a word.
"No need to, Edie."
I made the tea and no-one else touched it.
"If I was in your position, I would think it was me too."
"Padre, what a surprise!"
"Good morning, Inspector Mallory."
Last rites and a murder.
"It's Christmas come early for you, isn't it?"
"Right, George, with apologies,"
"I gather you made Henry's tea, so I'll have to take a statement."
You know the drill.
"Yes, of course."
And please search my house.
"You don't need a warrant, I've got nothing to hide."
I don't doubt it.
"Thank you, though."
Goodfellow.
"All yours, Padre."
"Henry, may I?"
I'm here to offer you confession and absolution.
No.
Thank you.
As you wish.
Have you any idea who did this to you?
"May I ask, was that your first cup of tea of the day?"
Yes.
"That woman at your party, Iris Lightman, and the cover-up she was talking about."
I can't.
Why not?
"It was, it was pouring rain."
I could barely see out the window.
The car started to skid.
"I don't know, I saw the wall coming and I didn't stop, I just kept driving."
"What are you saying, Judy?"
What happened?
I didn't know that Grace's car seat wasn't clicked in.
I would never do anything to hurt my child.
Did you do this on purpose?
Sometimes I...
I can't help it.
"Sometimes, it's like I don't know how to snap out of it."
It's like... everything is coming at me at once and I just want it all to go away.
"Judy, did you try to hurt yourself?"
I just wanted it to stop.
- Do either of you have a moment?
- Shoot.
I think my MVC mom's suffering from severe postpartum depression.
- Just one second.
- It's the baby.
Grace Anderson.
- What about her?
- She's waking up.
I thought you might want to extubate.r.
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
What are her symptoms?
She drove head-on to a wall with her baby in the car.
I think it was intentional.
I'd like to put her on psych hold.
- Dr. Rasgotra?
I need new hair.
"Hi, Mom."
This is Rebecca.
"It's kind of a new relationship, so don't say anything too embarrassing, OK?"
"Oh, hi, Rebecca."
He wet his bed till he was 12.

Wanna sit?
"Hey Weasel, you wanna move your stuff off the table?"
We gotta cram for the math test tomorrow.
"My name's not Weasel, it's Morgan."
I thought you liked it when I called you Weasel.
I've never liked it.
"You like it so much, it's your name now..."
Weasel.
- What an assertive little sister you have.
"- Oh, it's the uniform."
"When she takes it off, she has a vulnerable side, I'm almost certain."
"OK, Morgan, soccer practice."
Remember what we learned last week?
Don't kick the coach.
"Hey, before we get started, why don't we take a break?"
Can I get you something to drink?
I got full access to all the major appliances in the kitchen.
Aren't you gonna show me your house first?
The house?
You wanna see the house?
Sure.
"Uh, this is the house."
Are there any other rooms?
"Uh, yeah, there's probably one right through here."
Do you wanna...?

"""The cheese board is the world,"
"""and the pieces the phenomena of the universe,"" as my old friend Huxley used to say."
Cheese board?
Chess board.
"""And the opponent makes no allowances for mistakes,"
"""nor makes the smallest concession to ignorance."""
I'm an ignorant old Doctor.
And I've made a mistake.
There's only one direction help can come from now.
I'll just have to sit here and wait.
"Ah, yes!"
Something along those lines.
The mark of the Master.
He must have added his own voice to the numbers and corrupted the Doctor's code.
But he's still here somewhere.
-I saw him.
He's been following us.
-The Master?
I think so.
It's over.
"Oh, and, Nina, it's not me, it's you."
Ladies ofthe Hub... why do we try to act like we have no needs?
I have needs.
"For instance, I need a date for Saturday night."

"12,378, here I come."
Hey.
So I went to see Jake Bradley-
You mean- [Imitating Eric] Jake Bradley?
Yes.
To see if he wanted to hang out.
And you know what Mr. Cool Guy was doing?
Just hanging out in his basement with his friends... and they were watching The Six Million Dollar Man.
It was eerie.
Was there a skinny guy dating this really hot chick... who's way out of his league?
"You know, there was."
Wait.
Does this mean we're not gettin' a fat kid to play with?
"No, man."
We don't need anyone else.
You know what?
We've only got two months until graduation... and we can't waste a second of that.

"Let's seize the day, man."
"Hey, weren't we supposed to seize something, man?"

I've been waiting for ten years for this.
You told me I didn't have to go into the family business.
You said I should make my own choices.
"Ah, so you managed to do your own thing, huh?"
"Yeah, uh, for a while, yeah."
And I think I went to college because of you.
"But, you know, people grow up."
Yeah.
Responsibilities and--
"But still, um you took an interest in me when no one else did."
That matters.

What kind of ability are we talking about?
See these books?
They're filled with drawings made by my ancestors and some other people who had the same ability.
"And the drawings are of Wesen, which is how they like to refer to themselves."
"Who, the Grimms?"
"No, the Wesen."
And that's what I can see.

And there are all kinds of them.
They're kind of like species that exist within us-- some of us.

Not necessarily the cheapest.

"Oh, yeah."
"There's not much point in saving a few quid if they end up through the windscreen, is there?"

"Wait a minute, you could just work 40 hours straight."
There's no rule says when you have to get your work done.
"Like, just keep working around the clock?"
"Terry, that idea is-- what do the gays say for ""good?"""
- Yeah.
She's been emailing me.
Here.

Piper murdered Riley Marra months ago.
You've been getting emails from a dead girl.
"Okay, no, it's not a crush."
I'm just a little obsessed with his podcast.
(CHUCKLES)
But he was with Riley.
- That was so sad.
"- Now, he's always with Audrey."
"Although, after that video last fall, I guess guys aren't really her thing."
Did you see it?
Who would even post something like that?
Mean people who don't think.
"In other news,"
I definitely think there's something we can do about this whole Noah situation.
"- No, Brooke, please."
I really don't...
- (PHONE VIBRATES)
"- Ugh, unknown numbers drive me nuts."
Hello?
- _
MAN:
"That, in black ink, my love may still shine bright."
"Okay, you are blocked on all social media, phones, even the telegraph, Branson, and you're blocked for a reason."
"I miss you, Brooke, and I heard that you broke up with Jake,"
- so I wanted to...
"What's the matter, Sweetie?"
Wow.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYS)
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
"Tonight on ""bachelor pad""..."
Whoo!
Welcome to your second competition.
(vienna) I cannot even explain to you how badly
I don't want jake here.
Who do you want to see go home this week?
That is a hit.
Jake.
(blake) jake is a dead man walking.
(kasey) everything is perfect right now.
I'm in control.
Do you think you deserve to be here?
"Yes, I do."
That's full of (bleep).
"Like, honestly, come on."
You don't deserve to be here.
There's nothing more in me that wants to reach out
"And just punch him across the face and say,"
"""that's for america."
"That's for my girlfriend."""
"(woman) in the middle of drama and chaos,"
You can still find love.
"Seeing you, like, makes me realize that..."
"I really want you to be happy, you know?"
Here's to you and I having already taken
The most important prize of this competition.
"I think from here on out, it's you and I till the end."
"OK, he admitted it but there was never any evidence."
"Oh, Mark, come on."
He was seen in the area the night Jesse went missing.
- He killed 4 other children.
"- No, no."
His other victims was older.
It's a different MO.
"- He admitted it, Mark."
- Tell me then why does everyone keep on talking like he's suddenly gonna turn up one day
Because of your mother.
Why do you think we don't live together anymore?
Because she can't move on.
"Now look, he is dead, Mark."
Jesse is dead.
And this is... ?
We have to do a 100.
"Every hour, on, the hour."
I need you to double-check these forensic results.
"Why, what's the problem?"
The problem is they don't make any sense.
Can you stop that?
We've had a DNA hit from the Missing person database.
- From a kid that went missing in 1995.
- What?
"Yeah, so how about you you stop pressing with your boyfriend and check it again?"
Thanks.
Is that Pru?
"Yep, under her married name."
Pru Carew.
"Yeah, it's unfortunate."
"Oh, to think she could have been Mrs. Mark Wells married to a hot-shot lawyer."
And we're back in the playground.
It's almost like we were hooking up with her together.
"You felt that, right?"
I couldn't have performed if I did.
"Don't you see, Ted?"
We had a bro-nnection.
"All right, I got to know what she looks like-- show me a picture."
"Well, normally, I'm above such things, but it's been a while, and, uh, Teddy's braggin'."
"Okay, here she is."
Okay.
Scrolling up.
"Oh, yeah, those are"
"""plow me"" heels."
Nice.
Uh-huh.
The knee bruise is encouraging.
Working our way up to those 20-year-old ta-tas.
"Oh... gravity's cruel grasp hasn't found you yet, my sweet perky miracles."
"Now, let's get a gander at Dirty Girl's face."
Mm-hmm.
"Her face says, ""Ready to bone,"" am I right?"
"I say again, am I right?"
That's my half sister.
Then you probably shouldn't scroll to the next picture.
No!
"That's my sister, Ted!"
"Well, look, I didn't know!"
"None of us even knew you had a sister until two years ago, including you!"
This is just some crazy coincidence.
"There are four million women in the city of New York,"
"Ted, and you sleep with my sister?"
Why would the universe do that to me?
I don't know.
It's Paul's nephew.
Punk.
- What happened?
- Don't know yet.
"Detective Santos was signed out, that we know."
"But he carried no radio, wore no vest."
- Any backup?
- Zero.
Total breach of department policy.
What was the guy doing?
Taking a meeting with a drug dealer?
You got me.
But it adds up to a dead kid and a dead nephew of the head of the Zapatti family.
"Here's a guy headed for Attica on a 10 to 20, and he cops probation."
Probation?
No jail time?
Probation's a sentence in New York these days.
Which he skips out on 2 years later.
We've been looking for him ever since.
The mayor will want to step up for the wife.
I wouldn't do that if I were him.
"And who are you, again?"
Internal Affairs.
Listen we can bury Santos.
"And if it turns out he was dirty, well good cop turns bad."
Happens all the time.
Sure.
"We'll give him a full-dress funeral, to boot."
Who is she?
A lawyer for the Detective's Endowment Association.
I guess she'll be representing Eddie Santos and his family.
- I was wondering when you'd ask.
(SOBS)
"Hey, look, it's going to get better."
Sean?
(inaudible)
(GASPS)
(gasping)
(SCREAMS)
(screaming)
(SCREECHES)
(yelling) No!
allison:
"lfJackson doesn't know what he's doing, then he probably doesn't know that someone's controlling him."
Or he doesn't remember.
What if it's the same kind of thing that happened with Lydia when she took off from the hospital?
A fugue state?
SCOTT:
He'd have to forget everything.
The murder.
allison:
Getting rid ofthe blood.
STlLES:
"But he had help with one thing though, the video."
Maybe someone else helped him forget that.
Whoever's controlling him.
allison:
Are you sure Jackson has no clue about any ofthis?
He thinks he's still becoming a werewolf and that being with Lydia somehow delayed the whole thing.
allison:
So do we try to convince him he's not?
"If it helps us find out who's controlling him, then yeah."
Do you think he'll talk to us after what we did?
"Yeah, it's us."
why?
Brígida Bonazzi.
A change sex?
-Brígida Bonazzi.
-She is not patient mine.
It excuses.
"It matters to him, young lady?"
Thus it will learn to bother an honest worker of the street.
What has done to him?
We were in charge.
"Help, please."
"But, who is Brígida Bonazzi?"
Four Fernets Branca for the horsemen.
Thank you.
"Strip, strip."
You watch what handsome.
You watch that teats and what ass.
Mother mine!
"It is already enough, Alvaro.?"
What you do?
They are going to us to stop to all by insult to the modesty.
Desínflala already.
"Sight that curved, it is not looked like Lella?"
"Alvaro, I will not get tired of decírtelo, you are rich, stupid and also a jerk."
To the women it is necessary to deal with them with hand iron.
Muéstrale to Lella the man that you are.
So that I have decided that it is better than not we see more.
If it is what you want...
"Pity, had made me a bikini of crochet for this summer and she wanted ensenártelo."
A bikini?
-Yes.?
You want that it embosoms it to you?
"Oh, put those greasy newspapers in the dustbin, Henry."
They're smelling the place out.
It's like French perfume to me.
"Ahh, tomato soup."
My favourite.
Sir.
Oh.
"Oh, you're very kind."
lsn't she kind?
Don't mention it.
Erm...have you been in any good pubs lately?
"Oh, delicious soup, my lord."
Do you have a French chef?
"No, just an ordinary, plain cook."
"Eh, Stokes?"
"Yes, very plain, my lord."
"Hey, Cissy, did you not speak at a meetin' of the United Workers Party?"
"Yes, I put myself up as candidate for the party in the local by-election."
- Do you think I'll get in.
- Nah.
Not with that eyeglass and the posh accent.
We all thought you were patronising' us.
I found the whole thing very embarrassing.
"I'm sure nobody could hold you responsible for the actions of your children, my lord."
"Which would you like to taste first, my lord?"
"The stout, the raspberryade, or the Montrachet?"
The bishop's arrived.
They're all having coffee in the drawing room.
"Well, I'll be off now, then."
"Erm, you can take those cold chips home with you."
Oooh.
That'll be nice.
Ok.
"- I love you, B."
"- I love you too, Mom."
I'm proud of you.
"So, what are you up to tonight?"
"Think I'm gonna work on this, actually."
Sounds like a plan.
"Hey, guys."
Anyone wanna play Dawn of Armageddon with me?
I just got it.
- Isn't Connor coming over?
"- No, he, um... he couldn't."
Oh.
How come?
"Well, I'll play with you, Judicorn."
Run.
"""Dear Callie, My name is Sophia."
"I'm 14, and according to my dad, I'm your sister."
"I've never had any siblings, so when he told me about you,"
I couldn't believe it.
"My dad says we look just alike, so I sent you my picture."
I know this must be really weird for you.
"It is for me, too."
"But I would really, really like to meet you."
"And I hope you want to meet me, too."""
"Washington,DC, hasn't seen snow like this for Thanksgiving in decades."
"The roads are slick, and visibility is near zero."
A bitterly cold windchill makes our nation's capital feel more like the frozen Arctic.
What caused the shift in temperatures is this high-pressure system that you can see...
"I've flown in worse, honey."
Paris.
Sir?
What's the matter with it?
"My father died very soon after he called in your debt, Harry Clayton."
"And you were there, in the casino, the night it happened."
SURI:
So what happened?
BEN:
There was a shod and the screen jumped.
- SURI:
I can't believe that.
- Suri.
Wait.
Suri...
- It cut out.
- What cut out?
There was a shod.
Ben just told me.
Everything went down.
(SIGHS)
"Why weren't you honest with me, Harry?"
- I looked like an idiot in there.
- I'm sorry.
How am I supposed to do my job knowing you were at that casino the night Lau died?
"- Yeah, I should have told you that."
"- And yet once again, you didn't."
"You're the reason I got to where I am, Harry."
"Everything I've learnt has come from watching you these two years, but that doesn't mean I'm going to let you screw it up for me."
Detective Superintendent Winter and I couldn't be quite sure who was interviewing who.
You have to think the way they do.
Should be quite easy for you.
You'd be a smartarse if you were smart
(LAUGHS)
"Thank God Candy left when she did, or I never would have finished the book."
"Thank god Rebecca left, and Catherine and Alison."
You're the only guy I know who can't have sex and chew gum at the same time.
Why does everything have to be about sex?
Because everything is about sex.
"When I'm with someone, when I'm involved with them,"
"I tend to get a little sidetracked, that's all."
"Greg, you call 14 years to write a book a little sidetracked?"
I bet she's still out there.
"- If I know Candice, she's out there."
"- No, no, no."
Henry!
She's out there.
"Come on, face her like a grown-up."
Come on.
"Wait, do me a favor, Henry."
Don't let me go home with her.
Say we're going out to dinner.
We are.
It may seem odd not to invite...
"Please, Henry, just don't let me go home with her."
All right.
All right.
Are you all right?
- It was that stupid wine.
"Hello, Candice."
- Hi.
- You look great.
- Thanks.
I hope you don't mind me just showing up like this on your big night.
No.
It's just that I've been thinking so much about you lately.
Can you copy up on top?
Anybody copy?
Come again?
Just making sure We can communicate.
How am I looking?
I should be headed Right towards the beach.
"Yeah, you're about 20 to 40 Feet Past where you were before."
"Far from the boat, Shawn is truly on his own."
"Come on, shawn."
Here's a big boulder.
"It's a big, big rock."
I like big rocks.
Here we go.
"Come on, keep it up."
"Come on, let me see it."
I've been in nome About five years.
It was my dad's Get-rich-quick idea.
So we're sitting in hawaii.
"Everything was cool In my happy little life,"
And I had my own Painting company.
"He's like, ""Yeah, We just got to pump dirt."""
"And we'll get rich, And we'll come back here,"
"""And we only have to work Six months a year."""
"At that point, I was already."
A master painter Living a great life.
"So looking back, you have To be very selective."
On who you get ideas from.
100 miles east of nome...
Here's a big boulder.
"Determined to keep His gold empire from failing,"
Shawn pomrenke is going For broke at the bluff.
Here I'm seeing Some much better color.
"Now, come on, get out of here."
Take his car.
"After you've gotten rid of him, drive out to the airport, leave the car there."
All right.
- How did it go?
- Nothing to it.
I left his car at the airport and took a bus back.
"Good, then all we've got to worry about is his wife."
This will control the lights in the house.
"Ready, Cinnamon."
"The more I think of that Harper dame, the more I wonder if she shouldn't have disappeared with her husband."
Yeah.
"Well, that can be arranged."
Burt!
Burt!
It's her.
"Burt, please."
My husband is back.
He's in the house.
"I was in the kitchen, fixing something to eat, and I heard a noise in the living room."
I went in there but there was nothing there.
Nothing but cold.
It was colder than anything I've ever felt in my whole life.
Then I felt as if someone were watching me.
"I turned around and there he was at the top of the stairs, looking at me."
"Well, whatever it was, lady, it wasn't your husband."
"Oh, it was."
It was.
"He was just like he was this afternoon, with blood, here, on his sweater."
There he is.
I'm terribly sorry.
"I was coming over to my brother's, I saw Lynn come up the road."
"We're savages, aren't we?"
We aren't supposed to know anything about saving money
"Yeah, Mr. Policeman."
"You're Japanese, sir"
You don't know how hard our lives are
Only Mr. Wu here understands us
He's a beautiful serpent
He's a viper!
- Excuse me
- Hello
"- I'd like some salt, please"
- No problem
Oh no!
It's raining!
"Hurry up and go home, sir"
Or your glorious uniform will be soaking wet
Go ahead!
Go on!
"Run, sir!"
Your Japanese fur is too precious to spoil
It's raining
Go collect the laundry hanging outside
Can't you tell what needs to be done first?
"Hey, come back!"
Are you taking the baby out in the rain?
I'm sorry
What an imbecile!
Who'd marry such an idiot like you?
"When it rains, it pours"
Good morning
This is our policeman Hanaoka Jiro
This is our new police minister Ekawa Hakudo
Staring... with wide eyes at the sky.
"After that, he was possessed by the eye."
He could see nothing else.
And he kept drawing that picture.
I can't forget that eye either.
No other eyes are as frightful as that eye.
"The moon also gIitters, but it's not frightening."
moonlight is nice.
"Yes, it was on a night just like tonight... a strange thing happened--"
Stop it!
Don't tell us any scary stories anymore.
I never told... you a scary story.
"When I was in the kitchen, I heard a feeble voice saying:"
"""hello, hello."""
I heard a feeble voice.
I Iooked... and saw a strange boy poking his head in.
"He said, ""Your Suzukichi--"""
Suzukichi again?
"""Your Suzukichi was drowning in the pool..."
"""so I pulled him out..."
"""and carried him here."
"""I put him on the grass over there."""
This was what the little boy said.
He was a skinny little boy.
"And sure enough, he was soaking wet himself... with water still dripping from his hair."
I was so shocked.
I rushed out to see.
I saw...
Suzukichi lying there.
Looking quite dazed.
And what happened to the skinny little boy?
When I Iooked around... he was gone.
"We didn't really play, I just listened to Big Sis and Miyu discuss BL"
Must have been awesome
"But a little while ago, 6 months to be exact..."
"No, 8 months ago?"
Miyu started dating someone
Why does having a boyfriend make her a sex slave?
Lin named her that.
He's darker than you think.
Beware
That's pretty scary...
Maybe with me too?
"No, don't worry."
I have absolutely no interest in you
"Oh, umm..."
I was just kidding.
Sorry
It was a joke?
Yes
The sex slave thing is a joke too
She did sexual things before us and became braggy
So we started competing who could be meaner to her
The way we would compete was...
These things happen because she fell for the wrath of pleasure
I don't really get it
And since when can't you get ahold of her?
About a month...
"No, 4 weeks"
"No, 29 days"
You can't get ahold of her at all?
Yep
That's worrisome isn't it?
Yep
And deaf. I couldn't hear anything
"Then gradually, I was able to make out figures around me"
The other children?
Yes
But I couldn't see them very well l just felt their presence like spirits
I remember Audrey was one of them
She called to me
Victor?
Come here
Why did you come to see me?
is it because I'm like you?
It's because of the fairy
The fairy?
What fairy?
She's supposed to protect me until Mum comes back
Mum said I would recognise her
Who is this fairy?
You think it's me?
"No, I'm not a fairy"
"Fairies have nice hair, pretty dresses..."
They are always smiling
They have magic wands I don't have any of that
Can I?
You remember Victor I'm not here for him
"What is it, then?"
It's the power failure
"We don't know how long it will last, so we're checking everyone is OK"
People are worried.
The shops have shut
Do you have all you need?
"Yes, I'm fine."
Thank you
We will chop off your head And then laugh when you're dead
Duloc is a creepy place
Come on in What the heck
Fall right down Break your
Face
Duloc is Duloc is
Duloc is a creepy place
Get out.
- Let's do that again!
- No!
"Well, then..."
This ought to be fun.
Fun.
"Yeah, right."
I find myself agreeing with boss.
This looks to be a very entertaining evening.
You know what?
I just figured out what your costume is.
You came as a kiss-up!
"All right, all right."
"Buckle up, everybody."
"The quicker I scare the wits out of you lot, the sooner I can be home, cozy in my bed."
Unless anyone else thinks they've got what it takes?
"Pick me, pick me!"
I have a scary story.
"This isn't the one about you getting trapped in the petting zoo again, is it?"
'Cause that's not scary.
"Actually, if you look at it from my perspective..."
"Hey, guess what, Pinocchio?"
No one cares!
"Get ready to send these jokers home, Shrek, 'cause I've got a doozy."
And it's all true.
Worth 30000/- i though you would give at least 100000/-.
Whey?
"Did you knew, i will give you money?"
Yeah... do i look parrot from my face?
Parrot!
"Muna, Papu take all the stuff from this house."
"T.V., fridge, sofa... washing machine and every thing."
"Take that swing too, i like it"
"M.M. Munday, Murli Manhoowar Munday, not less not too much, take half... see she has bundle of cash... take all the stuff of this girl."
Leave the money and go you way.
You will scare me with that?
"I wont spare you, and you too."
One minute uncle... put finger in you ear.
Why?
Go ahead... sit...
why?
Yeah?
This girl is your sister from now on.
Understand Munday?
"M.M. Munday, Murli Manhoowar Munday, not less not too much,"
give the bubble gum... yeah take it please.
From today if she has any problem then i will beat you like hell.
How!
What are you talk brother.
Listen!
Last nail of coffin...
listen completely what i am saying.
What?
"If you ask her for money or ever threaten her... then i swear upon my mother, i will shoot from Mumbai, and it will hit on you back."
And on 26th July 2005.
You will be laying on the road like dead cow.
Understand?
I can feel it closing in on my nuts right now.
And after that conversation with the Bossman?
"I don't know, I'm starting to think maybe we are on the evil side of things here."
"Maybe you're just not emotionally cut out for this, Joe."
"Yeah, maybe."
"And clearly, you're not either."
I ever tell you the story about my dad?
"What, your real dad or your adoptive dad?"
"Asshole, my adoptive dad is my real dad."
"Okay, okay, good."
I didn't wanna hear a story about you searching for your biological father.
"- Shut the fuck up, Joe."
- Done.
Please continue.
"My dad Carl was a loving man, tough man."
- Like you.
"- Much more loving, much tougher."
"He worked in the, uh..."
"in the mills in Bethlehem, all right?"
Provided a decent living.
He took care of us.
Supported us.
Nothing lavish.
- Right.
"- So, one day, he gets a call into the big boss's office."
First time he's met him in 30 years.
"So, what did the boss say?"
Nothing.
Nothing?
What the fuck kind of story is this?
"You see, it's not about what the boss said;"
"it's what he didn't say, Joe."

She came home to her father's estate.
She was young and happy and hopeful.
"She read book s and played music for her mother and sister, and laughed while she waited for some nobleman to come and ask her hand in marriage."
The French came instead.
She hid and watched all they did.
She saw them blind her father.
She saw them rape her mother and sister Maria who begged the French to kill them.
They spared her sister but killed her mother.
"At the end, she was raped as well."
"When the French were gone, she buried her mother."
"And on her grave, she made a sacred oath."
Death to the French.
She plays no music now.
Nor reads book s.
Nor smiles or sings.
But rides the hills and hunts the French and hopes to die.
But today I saw her smile.
She smiled at you.
It almost broke my heart.
"For that alone, I thank you."
Buenas noches.
No that one's a bit sad
I'll play a reel for Miss Teresa.
"""Salamanca."""
- Who goes there?
"- Sharpe. 95th, the Rifles."
Advance and be recognised.
"Pass, friend."
"Stand easy, Cooper."
"Can I ask you a question, sir?"
"Where did you learn to fight so dirty, sir?"
"Same place as you, Cooper."
"-Frank, honey."
Lunch!
And your family.
"Senator, I guarantee this is nothing but a blemish on a great metropolis."
The party will never see that blemish in June.
"All it'll see is the Garden, the Plaza, the Waldorf..."
"... electricity,excitement,fun."
Catch the noon news in D.C. He's only magnificent.
Four extra classes graduate the academy this year.
Unions?
Did I hear you say unions?
Every municipal contract....

You watching this?

Want to read about the convention in the Chicago Tribune?
"Well, okay."
Okay then.
Wait till you see his performance on the 6:00 news.

What happened to you?
I called you.
You were down in the basement.

Was me and the old man.
"As of this morning, got to be just me."
"Dispatch, we have a code 32 off Carrion Road."
"Burning pretty good, by the smell of it."
I think I found us Ken Mersey.
"What the hell happened to you, Ken?"
Where'd you get off to?
Shit.
"Well, that's everyone that's come in."
Closest thing to a Molotov cocktail these folks have seen is a broken air conditioner.
"Sorry about that, Deputy."
But I don't believe your friend is here.
Didn't say he was a friend.
And it's Sheriff.
Is Ken in there?
Is he okay?
"Don't give me that look, Wallace."
"Surprising, is all."
Ken Mersey is a good man.
He looks after me.
"Oh, Wallace, stop it."
What do you know about the truck?
He bought it.
He told me to fix it up and sell it to Shep.
You know he was smuggling ammunitions across the border in that truck?
- That's a lie.
"- Well, whatever he ain't telling you got him in trouble last night, got him confronted."
By who?
Still sorting that out.
But whoever that may be...
I ain't gonna tell you that Ken Mersey don't got his own consequences coming to him.
"Ah, fuck."
"Oh, Bruiser!"
Bruiser!
Fighters... set to.
Regency boxing predated today's Queensberry rules.
"Come on, Mr. Dean!"
"Come on, Bruiser!"
It combined punching with wrestling and was always bareknuckle.
Who wants to back the favorite?
Who's going to show first blood?
First blood!
First blood!
Time!

"Okay, uh..."
Dad let we drive.

"Is that what you're looking for, grammar police?"
"Rusty, you can't disappoint a kid, then make up for it by stuffing him with ribs and taking him out to do something illegal and dangerous."
Oh. (Chuckles) Brick's happy.
"Sure, until the next thing comes along that you miss."
"Look, you're in and out of our lives, and I get tired of making excuses about where you are or why you're not around."
The kids ask about you.
"I say, ""oh, you know Uncle Rusty,"""

I think you're the absolute worst.

My dad thinks we should get off the streets.
Why ?
Did he hear something ?
About aftershocks or looters or...
Zombies ?
"I know, that was my first thought, too."
"But no, it's just a precaution."
It's Ryan.
Is everyone okay ?
"Yeah, we just have to make a little change of plans."
Hmm ?

Your dad said to go home.
But I think we should all be together.
This is a bad idea.
We're almost there.
"No, we're not."
It's just a few more minutes.
"Well, I know where my house is okay ?"
"Look, I command you to stop this bike."
"I'm sorry, okay but I'm starting to get a little creeped out."
"Not that I don't want to play Pictionary by candlelight and raid Taylor's Apocalypse kit, but I think we should just go to your house."
"Okay, but I'm still awaiting on news of Pancakes."
Pancakes ?
You said Ryan said everyone was fine.
"I know, but I don't know that he included rodents in his head count, so I texted him to be sure."
And ?
- She sounds like a duck.
"Smells like one, too."
"Oh, 'cause I thought he was asking you to explain how his penis worked."
What?
"Yeah, so, uh, Dennis went to my dad-- my dad's a really famous doctor-- and my dad had to show Dennis a book on how to fix his broken penis because he was too stupid to figure it out on his own."
Shut up.
"Yeah, that's probably why you phoned three grades, Dennis."
You're always gonna have to rely on the smart people to explain things to you.
Smart people like my dad.
- Are you feeling ready for this?
- Yes.

Okay.

He is expected to call for similar renovations... at several Virginia plants.

Son of a bitch.
I congratulate my friends at Edgewater Petrochemical... on a job well done.

You have a message.
And they thought that a bush pilot was a pilot for George Bush.
"And right after the gulf war,"
George Bush was not a very popular person.

Claytor decides to make a brief stop in Zambia to refuel and chart his course to Burundi.
Bueno Bungee.
How's everything here?
"I am from Ndola, but I needed to refuel."
Hello.
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Claytor...
We are just from around here.
The lanky American is an unusual sight wherever he lands and his grasp of African languages is often a crowd pleaser.
This is my first time ever to come here.
It's nice to meet you.
"Oh, it's very nice to meet you."
"When landing, you're suppose to pay something - a landing fee."
How much should I pay you?
I want to pay.
How much?
How many kilograms?
It's one ton.
5-60 5-60.
How many U.S. Dollars is that?
It's about one U.S. Dollar.
I understand that
Can I pay you two U.S. Dollars?
So is that okay?
This is more than okay.
Okay no but please the change is for you guys
You can have it.
With a tremendously big sound... the ground started shaking.
Suzukichi was terrified.
He didn't move.
Staring... with wide eyes at the sky.
"After that, he was possessed by the eye."
He could see nothing else.
And he kept drawing that picture.
I can't forget that eye either.
No other eyes are as frightful as that eye.
"The moon also glitters, but it's not frightening."
Moonlight is nice.
"Yes, it was on a night just like tonight... a strange thing happened..."
Stop it!
Don't tell us any scary stories anymore.
I never told... you a scary story.
"When I was in the kitchen, I heard a feeble voice saying:"
"""Hello, hello. """
I heard a feeble voice.
I looked... and saw a strange boy poking his head in.
"He said, ""Your Suzukichi... """
Suzukichi again?
"""Your Suzukichi was drowning in the pool..."
"""so I pulled him out..."
"""and carried him here."
"""I put him on the grass over there. """
This was what the little boy said.
He was a skinny little boy.
"And sure enough, he was soaking wet himself... with water still dripping from his hair."
I was so shocked.
I rushed out to see.
I saw...
Suzukichi lying there.

I've had the most extraordinary letter!
Madame George Sand is quite brazenly inviting herself to the fortnight!
You know the one.
She wears men's clothes and leads a most depraved life!
I'm dying to meet her.
charles?
"She writes that marriage is barbaric, darling."
They say no marriage is safe around her.
"Just think, she might take a fancy to your turkey wattIes."
Didier!
Don't touch that!
Come here!
I'm in a quandary because I've invited alfred de Musset.
Everybody knows he and Madame Sand practically tore each other to pieces.
I'm petrified that if they so much as clap eyes on each other... (howIs with rage)
Has anyone ever met this duchess?
No.
Must be one of those titled tarts stuck in the provinces with an uncouth husband.
She's probably famished for culture and determined to import it at any cost.
charles!
- Where are you going?
- Hunting.
- Goodbye.
I'II be back in a few days.
- But you can't!
She has a head contusion.
She needs medical care.
"Then admit her upstairs to the medical jail ward, but her husband has a knife wound, and she's under arrest."
Mom?
Do not handcuff her in front of her daughter.
What is happening?
"Tammy, it's okay."
She's traumatized enough.
"Cooper, get her out of here."
No!
I want to stay with mom!
"No, no, no."
"Tammy, Tammy..."
"Everything's okay, sweetie."
I love you.
Mom!
"I love you, sweetie."
I love you.
Tammy.
You want me to give up a hospital bed for a kid with a broken arm?
"She's 11 years old, her dad hit her, she just watched her mom get hauled off by the cops."
"All good material for a country song, but lousy on a medical report."
"You look like day-old dishwater, Coop."
"Why don't you go grab a shower, get some rest?"
You've done all you can here.
"No, she's my patient, and I should've known what was going on."
I could've stopped this.
When are you going to Violet's to get your stuff?
"Oh, Charlotte, come on."
Have you talked to her?
"This is not about Violet, okay?"
"I haven't shaved and my shirt's a little wrinkled, but beneath the depressed hobo look, I am fine."
But he didn't hang up the phone.
We had to scrub the audio.
"At first, it was quite feint."
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
"You came back, and you put the jacket in ms murnane's laundry."
1:16 pm.
Resuming interview with eva gundelach.
"Now, eva, I'm going to read back over what you said before lunch about the death of thom murnane."
Do you understand?
"Anything I say that is in correct, please stop me and tell me."
"You said,"
"""it happened the night mum and dad fought."
"They'd fought before, but this time was different."
It was loud and I went to listen.
I heard mum saying she wanted to leave dad.
I'm not going to tell you who it was!
"Ok, you promise me you won't say."
Tell me who it was.
It was Jess.
Jess?
Jess murnane?
You said you wanted to know.
"""I couldn't let mum and dad break up."
Couldn't let Jess murnane ruin our family.
I had to make her leave the street.
She wouldn't stay without her boy.
""" If Jess didn't have thom anymore, she'd go, and leave dad alone."
"""I waited till dad got home."
He went to the door and he came back home.
He came back inside and I waited for him to go to bed.
How the hell could you think it's okay to sleep with a teenage girl?
!
I don't know what you think you've heard...
Are you calling my wife a liar?
You know damn well what I'm talking about.
"I'm giving you a dignified out, Wallace."
Take it.
"I have to make this official, sir."
Is that your wife?
Amanda McNeil?
I've got to get out of here.
I understand.
You don't understand a damn thing.
"Sir, Amanda's body surfaced in connection with Sara Collins disappearance, so I need to know where you were Tuesday night."
"Uh, fixing the irrigation in my orchard."
Did you have any company?
Yeah.
Peaches.
Does that count?
"Look, I don't have an alibi."
- Is that what you want to hear?
"- No, not really."
Look...
I've lost my wife...
I've lost my friends...
I've lost my city.
"Look, Agent Kelton, you do what you want."
I've had enough.
It must be quite a change to go from running a city to running an orchard.
Do you ship the peaches right after harvest?
Why?
I'm just wondering if you have a refrigeration system on your property.
I-I didn't kill Coach Nelson.
"Todd Fleming had an alibi for the night Nelson was killed, which leaves you."
Okay!
Okay...
"Yes, we sent the e-mail, okay?"
I'll admit that.
Yeah.
Nice.
"See, my-my dad, he doesn't make a lot of money."
So the only way I'm going to college is if I get a wrestling scholarship.
"Coach Nelson, he moved me up a weight class."
That totally wrecked my chance at State Championship.
"So we thought if we sent these pictures around, maybe it'll get him fired."
So you e-mailed them to yourselves to throw off suspicion?
"Yeah, but that's all we did, okay?"
We had nothing to do the murder.
"Ah, you know what, actually, you kind of did."
'Cause we're thinking it's those pictures that got your coach killed.
Where were you Thursday night?
"I was at, uh, school."
I was at a basketball game.
Got somebody who can vouch for that?
"yeah, yeah."
"My, my-my, my Dad."
He picked me up around 10:00.
What's his name?
Alex Sheridan.
He works at the Manhattan Superior Court.
He's a court officer.
"He was struck by something hard, a club or a pipe."
"It wasn't the son, it was the father."
Court officers have metal batons.
I have newspaper stuff after school.
But no later than 6:00.
- We'll go out to eat after?
- Anyplace.
It's on me.
You don't have to do that.
You're a graduate.
You get to be pampered.
Then I'd like to go to Chateau Jean Georges La Jean Georges in Paris.
I'll look it up in Daggit and book the Concorde.
I got to go.
I got to get ready.
"Wait, I wanna see my little graduate one more time before the big event."
Do I look like I'm ready to make my way in the world?
"If all else fails, you can marry rich."
I love that we always have that option.
What'll you do with your hair?
I got the curling iron warming up.
"Mom, the cap."
"You put it on, it's gonna smoosh the curls down."
- You are a genius.
- See you tonight.
"Try to seat us next to a celebrity on the Concorde, like Sting or someone."
I'll try.
"- I told her, 'Look, missy... '"
- You called your advisor 'missy?
'
It was attitudinal.
"I said, 'I'm not taking AP Calculus from Henemen."
I'm going with Branch.
"'Branch is a graduate of MIT, and Henemen went to Berkeley."
"'He may have majored in Math, but what did he minor in, bean sprouts?"
You should say no
The first time you saw him was last night in the garden
You were scared and you called me
OK?
Why do I have to lie?
Because if you tell the truth they won't believe you
They don't believe in ghosts lt's our secret
OK?
Go to your room
is he dead?
He was already dead
That wasn't him
"Whoever it was, it wasn't him"
Then what was it?
"I couldn't let him torture you like that, Adèle"
What makes you think he's really dead?
What if he comes back again?
"If he does, I'll be here I'll always be here"
Do you believe me?
Come in. I've finished
- See you later
- See you
Hello
How are you feeling?
"Better, thanks I feel like I know you I was there when they took you away"
Give me your hand
Were you here while I was asleep?
I was keeping an eye on you
Just in case your attacker came back
"Thanks, Alcide"
You know my name?
"Yes, you told me when you came in"
"Yeah, we get it."
You're good looking.
"Look, doesn't anybody have anything new to say?"
"So there's this car that runs on water, man."
"It runs on water, man!"
"Okay, Nina, I brought you the special."
"One small soda, one medium popcorn... and one large Fez, dark and sweet."
"Fez, you know I've had a lot of fun hanging out with you."
"Hey, 37 times of fun, to be exact."
"It would've been 38, but you know- And then again, I apologize."
Now enjoy your meal.
"If you need me, I'll be smelling your neck."
"Fe-Fez, I'm starting to feel like I need some space."
"But I want you to know it's not you, it's me."
Okay.
"Well, I guess tonight I'll be doing number 12,377 of the other thing."
That's sort of gross.
"Hey, it may be gross, but that's the way I learned how to count."

Yeah.
And we were sitting in these exact same seats when we saw it.
"Actually, you were sitting over there."
"I remember, 'cause I could see up your skirt."

"Hello, Sheldon."
Come on in.
Thank you.
What's up?
I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
"I'm sorry, what?"
A date.
You and me.
"Dining, dancing, perhaps you'd like to take in a prizefight."
(microwave beeps)
"God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?"
"well, now, what is that?"
That's the treasure chest of a pirate?
"-Oh, stanley."
would you--?
"-That's pearls, stella."
Ropes of them.
"What is this sister of yours, a deep-sea diver?"
"bracelets, solid gold."
Where are your pearls and gold bracelets?
"Be still, stanley."
And here.
Diamonds.
A crown for an empress.
A rhinestone tiara she wore to a costume ball.
-What is rhinestone?
-Next door to glass.
Yeah.
I have an acquaintance who works in a jewelry store and he's coming to make an appraisal of that stuff.
"-Here's your plantation fella, right here."
-You know I-
- Stupid and horrid.
You stay away from these things before she comes out of the bathroom.
The KowaIskis and the DuBois got a different notion on this.
"Indeed they have, thank heavens."
I'm going outside.
Go ahead.
You come on out with me while blanche is getting dressed.
"Now, since when are you giving me orders?"
Are you gonna stay here and insult her?
You bet your life I'm gonna stay here.
"hello, stanley."
"Here I am, all freshly bathed and scented and feeling like a brand-new human being."
"Flynn, are you all right?"
"Yeah, I'm great."
- What are you doing here?
- My counselor brought me.
Your boss said you had an accident.
Yeah.
Your story checks out.
"Well, I'm sorry for the security measures."
Are you comfortable?
Give me what I want and I don't give a damn where you hold me.
"You fought against the Hunters, but now you want to join them?"
The humans took me away from my mother.
They took my baby.
"They used me, made me fight against the Hunters."
I want to be with my own kind.
I think I believe that.
So Liana's coming for me?
Not quite yet.
"First time I shot up, I was 16."
I was a punky-ass kid on a skateboard.
"In the parking lot of a 7-11 in Davenport, Texas,"
I bought a dime bag from a dealer named Shotgun Vallardo.
One taste and I was hooked.
So you were a junkie.
Is that supposed to impress me?
"Oh, I wasn't hooked on the junk."
I was hooked on the deal.
Next day I was running for Shotgun.
"And six months later,"
Shotgun's wife was a widow and I had every last one of his buyers in my pocket.
"See, we're the same under the skin, you, me, all us Hunters."
We have the same animal urges.
What the hell are we watching?
Meerkats.
These meerkats are wearing no clothes.
"Give me the clicker, now!"
"OK, fine, but no cooking programs."
Give me the clicker.
She was just scared.
I'm pretty frightening.
"He hated me, Kitty."
Is that what you think?
I could see it.
Always the look of somebody who doesn't expect anything from you.
"Until all you do is disappoint him again and again, but he disappointed me, too."
He loved you with all of his heart.
"They have to love you, it's their job."
"He just didn't know how to show it, to anyone."
"Well, he showed you."
"And yesterday, he showed me what he thought of me."
Now he's dead...and I...
"You know, after you enlisted, he used to call me every day."
"You know, just to talk."
And you know what he used to talk about?
Justin stories.
Great ones.
"He told me that out of all of his children, you were the only one who made him remember what being a kid was."
You were the only one who could do that.
Hmmm...he was so proud of you.
"C'mon, at age 60, you taught him to surf."
He wasn't very good.
"Because of you, he was the only 70 year-old who appreciated ""Death Cab..."
"Curdle."""
Death Cab for Cutie.
Luke?
Um...
I don't know really.
I know.
"Fifth grade, when you two got your mack on, during our class trip, to the Museum of Tolerance back of the bus."
Classy lady.
You know what?
"What's your problem, Cohen?"
"I mean, what did I ever do to you?"
"Nothing, Marissa."
I've lived next door to you forever and you've never done or said anything to me.
"Oh, my God, you're the one who never talks to me."
You think you're so much better than everyone.
I do?
"Well, if you're talking about Luke, then yes, because that guy shaves his chest!"
"Hmm, he plays water polo."
We know--half the team tried to kill us the other night.
"I'm not too popular around here, and your boyfriend--a little bit angry."
You're telling me you didn't try to hit him back?
"Actually, I hit him first."
"Well, hard to believe you're not more popular."
I thought this could be your room.
I still don't know if it's a good idea for me to stick around or not.
You should stay.
Okay... for a little while.
"So when she says it, you listen?"
Hey Summer!
"Oh, hey, hey, hey."
Is that Summer?
Tell her I said happy birthday.
"Coop, where are you?"
We're coming to get you.
"- One, two, three!"
"- Hey, Yo-Yo!"
- Yo-Yo!
Guess what!
Tia and Tony just drove off in a flying saucer.
Flying saucer?
How about whooshing yourself into the bus?
"But, it's true."
"Lookit, I saw those two kids do miraculous things."
"I believe anything and everything, except that."
Get in.
I hope this school teaches about flying saucers.
Yeah.
Flying saucers.

To see what life in the big city is all about.

But if anyone abuses my father.
I won't endure that.
The teacher's reputation was maligned.
What happened today?
Why is he so timid today?
On one hand the father los this reputation... and the son his stubbornness.
Look Rajan.
I'm not saying anything because father's asked me to.
What a family?
The son can't speak the father can't walk.
Brother!

Won't you go bring him home Satyakant?
He hasn't achieved any act of bravery... that I should welcome him.
He's a murderer.
He's returning after serving his sentence.
Exactly Satyakant.
He's served his time.
Look Satyakant.
Every saint has a past... and every sinner has a future.
If you don't support him at this delicate moment... then you might lose him forever.
Father.
Please forgive brother.
Of course he does.
But what happens when your father starts poking his nose into this Malcolm fellow?
Hmm?
"I mean, the guy is former Special Forces."
God only knows what he's doing for a living right now.
Isn't is safer for your father to maybe not remember what happened?
You should delete this.
You okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Why don't you head back to the spa?
Don't have to tell me twice.
[Sighs]
"[Door opens, closes]"
Check this out.
"I compared the drive-on list from the studio to people connected to the fourth New York victim, Pat Crews."
- Any matches?
- Yeah.
Crews was a writing teacher at The New School.
"One of his early students is a successful screenwriter named Jordan Keegan, who now lives in New York but happened to be on the studio lot in L.A."
when the murder weapons went missing.
Let's pick his ass up.
"So, you're doing a news story on my nephew Malcolm, huh?"
Mm-hmm.
It's about war heroes.
Oh.
Look.
Isn't he handsome?
"Oh, yeah."
"But like I said, he's out of the country."
His job keeps him really busy.
"Let me get you his number, okay?"
"- you, like Alex, would fall in love with me."
- Rose...
Rose... no...
"I know, I know, I know, I was wrong, it was unfair of me to think you'd change."
- Rose...
Rose... but I think...
"- I know what you think, Greg, and just let me finish"
- what I was going...
"- Rose, Rose, I feel..."
"You feel very strongly about your beliefs, I appreciate that, but..."
"I'm sorry that I broke our agreement, it was just that I fell in love with you... stupid, right?"
Rose...
Rose...
I feel... that...
I don't want you to feel bad.
Because I'm not in love with you anymore.
What?
"Which ironically makes me perfect for this marriage, except now I don't want it."
"Suddenly... dinner doesn't seem like such a good idea, does it?"
I should...
I should go.
- Whe... whe... where are you going?
Your mother's?
- Just until I find my own place.
I...
"I hope at some point we can pick up where we left off, as friends."
Friends?
"I really do thank you, Greg, you're the first man who wanted to marry me... for any reason."
Can I call you tomorrow?
What for?
"You all have copies of the syllabus, right?"
Yes
Compared to you and Charlotte anything's quick.
"- Softly softly, catchee monkee."
- I didn't know you spoke Spanish.
See!
I told you this was a great place to get your fingers stinky.
"Oh, my god, she's going for his cock."
"Oh, what you doing?"
Shall we go somewhere more private?
- I want you.
- Right.
"Careful, no-one's touched that before, it might go off."
Good!
"Crikey, careful."
Are they allowed to do that in here?
- Crikey!
"- Fuck me, she's gonna wank him off!"
The jammy git's pulled an experienced cock handler.
"Or, someone so inexperienced she thinks it's the best way to pull an older boy."
- Either way it's a win-win situation.
"- It's not really, though, no?"
"Thanks to me, we're now watching Simon get wanked off."
Thank you so much!
- Getting a bit weird now.
- I hate it when he makes eye contact.
"None of us do, Neil."
Call me a short arse now!
"Come on then, you fucking coward!"
"- Oh, please, not his face!"
- I'm gonna do you!
"Northwood are in the house, you're fucking dead!"
How embarrassing.
- That was brilliant!
What are you talking about?
Please!
"Wait, give me a second"
What is this?
What the fuck?
We broke up
So she doesn't live here anymore
Where does she live now?
She lives in Tokyo I think
"Well no, for sure"
What do you mean?
"Officer, it's not like I was holding her in custody"
"She was over 20 too, so we were just living together"
Ok...
"Plus, I am a victim too"
A missing person's report was it from her parents?
Or was it these two?
Is it normal to be investigating together?
Not that it matters
This really doesn't concern me anymore
So it's a little annoying
You need to be more responsible
Hey...
What about me is irresponsible?
I'm mentally fucked up cause of her
She is the one who is irresponsible
How is she irresponsible?
Miyu was texting me about the violence she was tolerating
Miyu is the victim
What?
She was betraying me the whole time
What?
Like someone not pickin' up after walking' their dog?
"Well, I guess so."
Like someone not eatin' everything on their plate?
"Well, I guess so."
Like someone peeing' in a hot spring?
That's right.
"When he wakes up, he just keeps destroying... tons until he gets sleepy again."
I get it.
Then he's a bad guy.
That's not so.
Beerus-sama is a god.
"For there to be balance in this plane of existence, if there are gods that create, there must also be gods that destroy."
"Then he's strong, right?"
"He's on a level far beyond ""strong""."
He's capable of destroying absolutely everything there is.
Nobody stands a chance against him.
I can't wait to meet him.
Goku.
"I'm begging you, please try your hardest not to do anything stupid."
Okay?
You understand?
Got it.
"As long as he doesn't do anythin' bad, I'll keep away."
Oww...
What was that for?
.
Honestly...
What is it?
Beerus-sama...
"So that's this ""God of Destruction""..."
I see little kids hurrying off colourful na ransel
Colourful backpacks on their backs shou kodomo-tachi kaketeyuku
What's wrong with that?
"Master, the stance you taught us a few days ago"
Is it like this?
2nd Brother
"Oh, it hurts!"
You bloody fool
"Dad, 3rd Brother beats Gao Jian!"
What's the first rule of our school?
T roublemaker and treacherous fighters
Will be punished severely!
Someone has got a pig's foot to sell
Someone has got a ghost story to tell
Someone has no voice yet wants to yell
"Someone standing on a bench, shivering like hell"
Who over there could be so ecstatic?
I'll feed you to a dog if I get hold of ya
"Wow, don't be so cruel!"
It must be hard on you
T alking wastes energy!
Be careful!
You're out of breath
Mind you don't get a bad breath!
I'm now holding my breath
Save your breath.
I did that on purpose
So that Master will punish you
And I can release my long held breath!
Oh!
I'm sorry!
I've stepped on your injured foot!
Help!
"Quick, go practice after dinner"
The 20% drop in homicides and street crime last year.
"Also, Stern's record."
Hard-line.
"Good, Kevin."
Corporation Council?
We've commissioned a study that'll...
... provethiscityhas the toughest probation guidelines in the country.
Excellent.
Get Community Affairs involved.
Tell Parks...
... cleanuptheirplaygrounds.
"Hover, nudge, show we care."
And then we gotta do something concrete.
"Something big, something important."
Something that means jobs.
That means building BankExchange.
I won't let these shootings interfere with my program for the city.
I'm speaking at the boy's funeral.
James Bone's funeral.
That's a blueprint for trouble.
I don't care.
It's the right thing to do.
I don't think you'll be welcome there.
They got me anyway.
Let's go to work.
"Kevin, I need you."
So what happened?
Frank Anselmo and his real-estate cronies is what happened.
They want the subway stop to raise their land value.
The property around BankExchange?
And?
"Anselmo said, """"No subway stop..."
"Can you give me a second, please?"
Can I have some space?
"All right, listen to me."
"You're not gonna outshoot him, so out-D him."
All right?
Play it like it's football.
"Put a body on him, steal the ball away, put it through the hoop."
Huh?
"What's he gonna do, call a foul?"
We're in jail.
I can do that.
No.
No.
That's game.
"Let's have it, man."
"All right, badge."
Here it is.
"Couple weeks ago, we're in rec watching some tube."
"This Samoan dude walks by, he tries to change the channel."
Dawkins almost throws down there.
"You should have seen him, his eyes were crazy."
- Because he changed the channel?
"No, bro, it wasn't that."
It was something on TV that made him go crazy.
What was he watching?
"Dana, your luxury vacation includes first class airfare, seven nights at the Kahiko Hotel."
"All-access VIP passes to the annual Festival of the Islands, which kicks off two weeks from now, and since you'll need a little spending money while shopping on beautiful Kalakaua Avenue,"
- we're throwing in $ 1 million.
- Aah!
Aah!
She's the reason Dawkins broke out of prison?
She won a million dollars and a trip to Hawaii.
"Tea, Henry."
Edie.
Thank you.
Right.
"You were absolutely right about the WI being able to cope without me, so I was just wondering if... the invitation still stands?"
"Yes, yes, of course!"
Wonderful!
May I offer you a celebratory cuppa?
"Yes, all right."
A year ago we had Henry's hanging work and you were giving us weddings and funerals at St Mary's.
Now we have nothing.
"I was just sharing out the work, Edie."
You're not the only florist in the area.
I think we both know what you're doing has got nothing to do with fairness.
"Look, if you promise to give us some more business,"
I won't enter the flower show.
I think I can win the competition without your charity.
"Thank you, though."
"Please, Mrs McCarthy, we're on our knees here."
Henry?
Henry!
Henry?
Henry!
Father.
Hemlock?
"That's what the doctor thinks, going by Henry's symptoms and the smell."
How extraordinary.
Poor Henry didn't notice the odd taste and drank the whole cup.
Probably because of his excesses last night.
How long does the doctor think he has?
Hours.
A day at most.
"Oh, you Jews are so Old Testament."
I did my job.
How are things?
"Barney and I are still under the same roof, if that's what you mean."
"He does the dishes, I sort the socks and ironing, we don't talk."
So all back to normal.
"As in, you mean, are you off the hook?"
"No, I didn't mean that."
(Quiet knock on door)
Just a sec.
Wendy rang.
"Something about a meeting with John Bartrop, which typically you didn't share with me."
I don't know any John Bartrop.
Who is John Bartrop?
You were apparently due at Fuzz's school an hour ago.
"Oh, shit."
That John Bartrop.
Sorry.
"Um, Red, can we talk later?"
Why?
"He is a beautiful student, an absolute pleasure to teach."
"You don't have to sugar coat this for me, you know."
I mean every word of it.
"The other teachers' comments have ranged from,"
'Is everything alright at home' to 'Have doctors mentioned medication?
'
"(Laughs) Well, Finnegan has issues."
His attention span isn't enormous but he's so engaging and clever.
Wow.
"Well, he does like your classes."
English is the only subject he seems to study.
He expresses himself beautifully.
Widowed for 10 years.
Her husband was AIban Lajeunesse.
"After he died, she sold her land, and kept the house..."
like a Iot of people around here...
"like me, too."
What happened?
"I was coming home from a date, happy, it had gone well between us."
It was exactly 1 :15.
"I slowed down in front of C,duIie's, all the lights were on outside."
"I saw polo, in his PJs, alone in the yard."
"I got out and I saw C,duIie with the gun."
"And then I saw the black guy, with eyes big as saucers."
"He came on his bike, but why come here?"
And why the gun?
"I asked C,duIie: "" What's going on?"""
What's going on is...
"what's going on... it's... that, there."
"...she said, showing her broken little plaster negro."
Then I understood what was going on.
"The statue was beyond repair, even for Crazy glue."
I Iooked at the kid and asked:
What got into you?
"Him, not a word."
He didn't seem to understand me.
So she told me:
Maybe he thinks it's ugly.
"That happens sometimes, huh?"
We don't all have the same taste.
"No, but you still got to be pretty shameless."
And he was shameless.
He didn't look at all ashamed.
"I took the gun from her, but she defended him and said:"
"Well, we couldn't stand by and see you suffer for speaking your mind."
Mrs Cameron's loss is very much our gain.
"You're very welcome here, Claire."
I can't thank you enough.
- You just have.
"Well, here's to ""speaking your mind""."

"You're thinking about Joyce, aren't you?"
I can practically hear the pistons of frustration pounding in your head.
I'm not wasting any more mental energy on that woman.
But I am thinking about how we might resurrect the Institute.
Might not mothballing be for the best for the time being?
Given that everyone's looking inwards now.
Grand theft auto.
1984.
Armed robbery.
"1987, 1992."
You get the idea.
And here he is today.
Better known today as Jimmy In-'n-Out.
"City, State, and Federal."
He's spent 44 of the last 58 years inside.
An entire life behind bars.
Jimmy provides a very special service.
"For a price, Jimmy will go to prison for you."
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?
He's actually more comfortable inside.
The outside world hasn't been too kind to him.
"Sometime during the Clinton administration,"
Jimmy figured out how he could use his talents to turn a profit.
So...
- When does all this happen?
- It's already happening.
The buy is set for tomorrow.
"Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out, everybody's happy, and all it's gonna cost you is 80,000 and one pound of your finest meth."
"$80,000 for eight years of his life, huh?"
"First of all, he's not gonna do eight years."
"I'm gonna represent him, and I guarantee there's gonna be some unexpected problems with the prosecution's case."
"Secondly, he gets 30."
50 goes to me.
- You get 50?
For what?
- For facilitating.
Who's taking a bigger risk?
Seyed!
Seyed my cart is stolen my cart
"- Hey girl, have you seen a cart?"
- What?
- Cart have you seen my cart?
- No.
These ooward people put my father in trouble and now they are doing same to me.
"My father left Tangak because of me, because of Hanieh and my mom."
But at this time I came to Tangak by myself and I won't be stopped at all.
I will stand for it until the end.
How dare they underestimate me?
Are they Kufa's people?
"If my father can't play kettledrum till dawn, I will do it."
I promised to play kettledrum for Hanieh's leg to be cured.
"I stand for it, until the end."
What are they thinking?
"Seyed Abdullhossein, You make them understand!"
I am Bashirou!
Bashirou!
ZaerAli's son!
Tangaki Captain ZaerAli's son!
I confront them until the end!
Unljl last moment!
Can you hear me?
Did you hear or not?
"If you are real men, show up then I'll show them!"
I do something to you that nobody has done it before.
Their neck twisted.
"Do whatever you want with me, I am so tough skinned."
I am still in Tangak_
Do whatever you want with me.
I am still in Tangak_
"Essentially, it's like feeding the beast-- this big, ugly, greedy beast that demands to be fed over and over and over again."
Is this your first meeting?
Hi.
"Yeah, actually, it is."
My name's Nick.
I'm Monica.
Hi.
Your words were an inspiration.
Thanks.
"Yeah, she's great, isn't she?"
This is Hillary.
"Hillary, this is Nick."
"Hillary, it's a pleasure."
Hi.
"Listen, if this is your first time, you shouldn't feel pressured to join this group."
There's others in the city you might want to check out.
Hillary's right.
It's really important that you trust the people you're going to be looking to to help you...
And who'd you rather look to for help than Monica?
"You come here to get off drugs, and you meet Monica."
That's a pretty good deal.
I'd marry her tomorrow if she'd give me the word.
"Henry, settle down."
You're going to scare Nick off.
"Well, that's the idea."
Less competition.
"We'll, um, talk later, right?"
Yeah.
I'm his sponsor.
"Look, why don't I take you over to Angie?"
She's got books and pamphlets.
"Nick, it's going to be rough, but we're all here for you, and if you need any help, just call me, okay?"
"I am a grown man now, Your Majesty... and know better."
His son in all but the name.
"You want to trip, I'll bring it to ya ?"
"Frylock and I'm on top, rock you like a cop ?"
"Meatwad, you're up next with your knock-knock ?"

"Come on, get your car wash!"
Get it on ?

"Come on, get your car wash on ?"
"Hot dog, we want you to get your car washed!"
"Hey, look at this igloo!"
Now go on and get your car washed!
"Come on, y'all."
Somebody get a car wash.
- The dogs of Roland!
- What rock did they crawl out of?
!
We can't use big spells in a tangled battle like this!
Out of the way!
Where are they?
Where's the commander?
!
Is it you?
Are you this army's commander?
!
You're...
I just made mincemeat of the Estabul commander.
"If you resist any further, I'll kill you all."
That bloodstained red ring...
It's Crimson Fingered Claugh!
"That's Crimson Fingered Claugh, of Roland!"
Damn it.
All this pointless killing of each other...
Defeated again?
It's like they're reading our army's every move!
I told you!
I told you it was reckless!
- You pick a fine moment to say it!
- Crimson Fingered Claugh?
"You said Roland's commander was Claugh Klom, did you not?"
Ma'am.
"From what I have heard, he has gone to extreme lengths to force our men to surrender without killing them, has he not?"
- Ma'am.
- If that is how Roland battles...
"If that is the will of Sion Astal, the Hero King, then this fight is..."
Don't be ridiculous.
I want my daughter.
"Agent Collins,"
Mr. Van Sciver will see you now.
Will you follow me?
"Sure, thank you."
"My mom is in that ambulance, let's go!"
What can I do for the FBI?
"Well, I'm just following up on a case."
What do you know about a young man named Zack Starr?
That name isn't familiar.
What about Krista Starr?
- His wife?
- Sister.
"I'm sorry, what is this about?"
"Zack Starr was murdered and the case was being handled by a local detective, a cop named Brian Boone."
Looks like Krista Starr was involved in the investigation.
"- Well, have you talked to her?"
"- No, she's missing."
"You wouldn't know where I could find her by any chance, would you?"
- Do you say Boone?
- Yeah.
Is this the same detective who is being accused of this cross country killing spree?
Yeah.
And you're handling that case.
"Well, it might be tied to the Starr murder."
"You think it might be 2 murders, him and his sister?"
No.
She isn't dead.
"In fact, her uncle saw her recently, just doesn't know how to get ahold of her."
- You spoke to the uncle?
- Uh-uh.
And he tells me that you and Krista know each other pretty well.
"The photos are reflections of one another, right?"
"Reflections in lakes, reflections in people's eyes."
Pictures of people taking pictures.
"There were, uh--"
He was taking pictures of people taking pictures?
Yeah.
"I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I actually owe you one, Jack."
Thank you.
"So you'll be getting me those files, then?"
"Oh, I'll get back to you on that one."
[dialing phone]
"Dozer, I think I know why the Chameleon killed Walker."
"So I'm standing in line, which is already annoying enough, and this chick--"
Are you listening to me?
"No, no, baby, I'm sorry."
I just...
I got stuff on my mind.
"So this chick, she takes a step back, and she steps on my foot, right?"
And...
Yeah?
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go check my messages.
"So, was I right?"
Give me a second.
Yep.
Chameleon was carrying a camera.
Shoot it to me.
So she was taking pictures of a building?
She was staking out the place.
These pictures could've been taken months ago.
"Well, maybe not."
Marla said that Walker was adding last-minute photos to the exhibit.
People have always had the potential to change in horrible ways.
Who in particular are you thinking of?
You or me?
"Mariá, everything might be over as early as tomorrow, but I think it's been worth it."
- There's Smithy with two others!
"- Emiliano, Smithy's coming with two others."
"- Yes, that's Smithy."
- Are you sure?
- Who are they?
- We couldn't have found anyone better.
- Is Carrasco here?
- I'm glad you're back.
"- Yes, he's here and waiting for you."
- We were in the same cell.
I'm Hidalgo.
"Hello, Smithy."
Is it really you or is it your ghost?
Of course it's me.
You know good old Smithy's body.
Ghosts can disguise themselves.
You scared us.
"This time I nearly died, but at a certain point I said to myself,"
"""You're going to make it, because you want to be embraced by Mariá again. """
"If you should ever leave your Leopard, a scrawny European is waiting for you."
"With you, I'd end up as a tea-drinking landlady."
- So you've cheated death once more.
- As always.
This is Hidalgo.
He used to fight in the north.
That's Joaquín.
He wants to go and see his family.
He's leaving today.
"Frankly, I'm not at liberty to reveal the particulars of the agency I work for and all that, that implies."
"You mean, uh, national security?"
(CHUCKLES) Let's put it this way.
"Every once in a while, things happen that just can't be rationalized in a conventional way."
People wanna know that their government has a response.
I am that response.
"So, were there any witnesses?"
"Well, sir, if you'll just follow me."
- (METAL CLANKING)
- We did find this.
MARV:
"United States Government, huh?"
"Guess that means something big's happening here, eh?"
"No, Marv."
Big things happen in big places.
"And the sooner I fill out my report, the sooner I can get back to them."
"Enormous beast, yeah... (CHUCKLES)"
Biggest thing in this town is probably the homecoming queen.
"Oh, my God!"
"- Come on, Marv."
Come on.
- MARV:
Okay.
I need a witness.
It's around the corner.
Come on.
- Pick up the pace here.
- Don't pull so hard.
I've never seen anything like it.
"It's like a big, big ""chomp"""

"Damn it, I can't stand him."
I can't believe this is happening.
Richard... used to work for me years ago.
"And that's Priscilla, my best ex-wife."
They recently moved back to New York.
This is not gonna work.
Let's get out of here.
Why was she your best wife?
Everything with her was as intimate as kissing.
I never really got over her... the most orgasmic woman I've ever been with.
Who was the most orgasmic woman you've ever been with?
You could use my first name.
But I hope I'm not the most orgasmic woman you've ever been with.
I'm not that easy.
"- Hello, Priscilla."
"- Hello, George."
- You look absolutely beautiful.
- I don't.
"I look like shit, but thank you."
- How do I look?
"- Depraved, but well-fed."
"Jonathan, this is Richard and Priscilla Antrem."
Richard is the new editor of Women's Wear Daily.
"George, you know I'm editing GQ."
Don't be petty.
- I'm sorry.
I get the two confused.
- Of course you do.
You ought to try doing The Times crossword puzzle.
It's supposed to be good for senile dementia.
"Richard, George, please."
"Well, it's very nice to meet the both of you."
The Association sent him up to talk to Coble.
Trying to figure what they're gonna do with a child killer like Tom Horn.
People think you did it.
"You don't understand what's going on, do you?"
"No, I can't say as I do."
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking I want a drink.
"Whiskey, George."
Leave the bottle.
- Sorry I'm late.
"- It's all right, Charles."
- Let's get started.
"- What'll I need, Joe?"
Just your writing things.
Where's Tom Horn?
He's over to the Interocean Hotel.
What kind of condition is he in?
He'll be just about where we want him by the time we get set up.
Come on over here.
We got a mattress laid out here for you behind the door.
- Can you write okay lying down?
- Can you rig me a little light?
Absolutely.
Got the bottom of the door planed off so you can hear real good.
But you got to be real quiet.
"Joe, what if Tom Horn sees me in there?"
"- You mean, will he kill you?"
- Yes.
"I'm not going to let that happen, Charles."
A man like that you don't want to get mad at you.
I'm going to be sitting right over there at my desk.
I've got this Colt patent.44 in my vest... and a German automatic over there in the drawer... one of the new ones.
"And I'm his father, and I should be able to get what he wants."
It goes back tomorrow.
"Skyler, it will crush him."
That car directly contradicts our story.
"And if you're so invested in protecting this family, it means protecting the story."
"What do you think the neighbors are going to say, Walt?"
What about Hank and Marie?
How about the IRS?
"What were you thinking, Walt?"
I was thinking that I wanted to do something nice for my son.
[scoff]
Look.
I just worry that he'll blame you for this.
"Oh, he will."
"Once again, he'll blame his bitch mother for taking away what his loving father has given him, so thanks for that."
[sigh]
"But you know what, Walt?"
Someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family.

"So how the devil have you been, Eric?"
You've gotten a bit rusty since last I saw you.

"Noah's stiff the same, I see."
Only more so.
He's not exactly mellowing with age.

Bakk me up against the press now.
Please.
We need to lay off 200 in the first place.
"I'm sorry, but there is a Chinese on the phone."
"Take a message, Marianne."
He said you would rather discuss funding with him than bankruptcy with the board.
I've been thinking that maybe we should take some time off.
I can give my clients to someone else.
We can go on a trip together.
-What are you going?
-I'll going to Norway.
-Norge?
-There are work.
Cann't you send someone else?
-It is in Lifjord.
You're going back to your hometown.
I thought you hated being there.
It's an interesting business possibility.
A solar cell factory.
-It seems promising.
-Is this a strange coincidence?
-Can you stop interrogating me?
-No.
-Oh my God.
-How many times have I asked you about your past?
You will never say anything.
You give me one sentence about an unhappy childhood.
That's because there is not much more to tell.
Every year we send Christmas cards a mother I've never met.
"And now, suddenly, you are going there on business."
"These people, they are ..."
I mean...
No problem there.
Wow.
"Soul mate, right there."
"God's little gift to Landry, that's what that is."
Why can't you just be happy...
"Hey, Smash, you're on TV, homes."
And I want to apologize to him and everyone for doing so.
"Anyone can say, ""I'm sorry. "" Doesn't mean they are."
"Smash Williams is an arrogant, violent thug who attacked us just because we're white and have money."
And everyone's defending him.
He's lucky me and my friends acted civilized.
"And from the Smash Williams controversy, we go now to Kevin with the rest of today's sports headlines."
Smash?
"Hey, what the hell are you doing here?"
"Looking for you, man."
Did you see Adam Hughes on TV?
Do you want to respond...
"No, you're trying to get me in trouble!"
I'm just trying to get the truth.
"Hey, hey!"
"Tell him the truth, Smash."
Just shut the hell up!
Just shut the hell up!
"Smash, what happened that night?"
Was your sister hitting on him?
Is what he said true?
"Hell, no, that's not true!"
That's not true.
"All right, look, I'll tell you like this."
He was saying some foul things to my sister and I.
"Racial, sexual and threatening."
That's right.
- (Foster) Good evening.
(Cissy) Hello.
(Poppy) Hello.
- What your name?
- Jock McGregor.
Jock McGregor.
Do come in.
"I'm Cissy Meldrum, this is my sister Poppy."
I-I won't shake hands.
A kid were sucking' a stick of toffee on the bus and it went all over the handrails.
"Ooh, aren't you strong?"
Your muscles are bursting out of that suit.
"It fits you very well, of course."
You develop muscles when you work for a living.
May I say what an honour it is to be invited to your beautiful home.
We think it's a bit old-fashioned but you can't shift Daddy.
We know that fine at the factory.
"I'm serving drinks, who wants stout and who wants raspberryade?"
"Nonsense, Ivy, I'll mix some cocktails."
"Now, who fancies a white lady?"
"It's going to be agony, George."
They could stop for hours.
How will we get rid of them?
Don't worry.
I've invited the bishop after dinner.
One look at his dog collar and they'll be off.
"Ah, hello, everybody."
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
"Oh, not at all, my lord."
"I was just saying what an honour it is, and a privilege,"
- to be invited to your beautiful home.
- Ah.
- How about her?
How about the new girl?
- No.
"I mean, I don't know her."
Shut up.
"Look, I want someone I know, someone who knows me, someone who we know each other, someone like, uh..."
Topanga!
"Topanga, my honey."
- May I call you honey?
- No.
"Topanga, my girl, my friend, my girly friend."
"Believe me, I don't want this any more than you do, but everybody around here is pairing off, and I think you and I should spare ourselves a lot of uncoolness and walk through life together."
"Cory, my dear little butthead..."
May I call you butthead?
Sure.
- I can't walk through life with you.
- Is there someone else?
There's everybody else.
Why?
"We're already standing together, and we look great."
"Oh, come on."
Work with me here.
"Cory, when guys and girls go out, first they fall passionately in love."
"Then, after a week, they hate each other."
"So for one great passionate week, we'd lose a friendship that could last a lifetime."
- I'm in if you are.
"- Cory, don't worry."
I'm sure there's someone out there for you.
Gimme a name!
"- For the record, I dumped her."
- That's how I saw it.
"Well, Dubin's out sick again."
Do you want any more?
Please
"Hello, Camille"
We used to see you at school.
We're Esteban's parents
"Hello, Mr Koretsky"
"Yes, I remember I'm sure a lot of people ask you this, but we wondered..."
Esteban is fine
Have you spoken to him?
Spoken?
"No, I wouldn't put it that way"
But our souls have made contact
Did he mention... well us?
Yes
He said he misses you
He can't wait to see you again
Esteban is at peace
He's waiting for you
He knows you will meet again
What is she saying?
She's giving them hope
Look at her I've never seen her so happy since she came back
She has found what she needed
What?
"A sense of purpose lf anything had a purpose, wouldn't we know?"
You scared me I decided to take you up on your offer
- You kept your keys?
- Yeah
You can take my room ifyou like I'll sleep here with Victor lt's up to you
It wasn't the cannibal who died yesterday
I think I sensed it
But you're safe here
"So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad, one of argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?"
Why?
Because... he's evil.
You just don't like him.
The guy...
Bugs me.
I don't know what it is.
Just look at his face.
Any other theories?
You okay?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Are you all right?
"Hey, you don't look so good."
I just need to get some water.
No one leaves their seats.
Stiles says you know how Jackson's parents died.
Maybe.
Talk.
It was a car accident.
"My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18."
"So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?"
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report on my dad's in-box.
He keeps everything.
"Scott McCall, please report to the principal's office."
"I'm fine, just give me a minute."
Perfect.
Don't forget the dates.
"""Passengers arrived at the hospital doa."
The estimated time of death...
"9:26 P.M., June 14, 1995."""
I must see to the sentries.
"Excuse me, ladies."
When will you pay me
Says the bells of Old Bailey
When I grow rich
Says the bells of Shoreditch
When will the...
"Oi, blimey!"
- Sh!
"Is that you in the dress, sir?"
Nice.
"- Give me your picklock, Cooper."
"- Picklock, sir?"
Catch me with a picklock?
They did.
"But when you got out of Newgate prison, you got another set."
- That's the one the officer wants.
- Come on!
"Do I get it back, sir?"
Trust me.
"It's very hard to trust a man who wants to borrow your picklock, sir."
So...
You could not wait until Torrecastro
"Very well, you shall hear the story."
A thousand years ago the Muslims swept across Spain orn their way to Rome
My ancestors made a stand in these mountains at a hard rock we call Torrecastro.
They were many.
We were few.
We died hard.
"At sunset my ancestor dying called on Sant'lago, St James, the saint of Spain."
Sant'lago came.
"He came with a banner of blood and a bright sword, and he slew the invaders in their thousands."
Henry.
(HENRY GROANS)
"Why are you hitting yourself, Henry?"
Hmm?
(THUD5)
ESTELLE:
Baby?
"Baby, are you okay?"
AKAN:
I love how protective you are of me.
Mmm...
You owe me an apology.
For?
Doubting me.
I did have certain apprehensions.
Then Why'd you let me do it?
I was just entertaining my woman and losing all of my men.
(GASPS) ls everybody dead?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you know when I realized this was working?
When?
"When Henry pulled me into the escape pod, trying to get me out of the lab no matter what."
Who would've thought that pussy is a hell of a motivator?
(SNIFFING) Ah.

Each one's first memory will be his wife slipping a cheap brass ring on his finger.
"Every single one of my soldiers will wake willing to do anything my brilliant wife tells him, whether it's marching on Paris or the White House lawn."
I would like to pretend you understand the part you played.
"You didn't make history, Henry."
You helped end it.
Cricket!
Never mind.
I've decided to diversify Charles' evenings at home.
Tonight I have a surprise.
I've asked a few young friends over for a little music-making.
"Charles, you know the Orme-Herricks?"
Did you know that Miss Orme-Herrick was a student of the cello?
She's going to play for us tonight after dinner!
Charles.
Charles.
I really have to go...
Please.
"I'm afraid Jorkins has to go, father."
He has to be up very early in the morning.
"Oh, what a pity."
"Goodbye then, Mr Jorkins."
I hope that you will pay us another visit next time you cross the herring pond.
"Goodbye, Mr Ryder, and thank you."
I'm so sorry I have to leave.
"- I'll just see him out, father."
- Such a versatile young man.
"You must ask him again, soon."
"Goodnight, Jorkins."
What very dull friends I have!
"You know, without the spur of your presence I would never have roused myself to invite them."
I have been very neglectful about entertaining lately.
Now you are paying me a long visit I will have many such evenings.
You liked Miss Orme-Herrick?
No.
No?
Was it her little moustache you objected to or her very large feet?
Do you think she enjoyed herself?
They're prepping him for surgery now.
GRANT:
And you've let Stonebridge go off on some suicide rescue mission.
With the only lead to Latif.
Please tell me Crawford gave you the intel beforehand.
Negative.
- Sinclair.
- And I think I'm about to get arrested.
Walk away now.
You don't know me.
Go.
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
JACOUB:
"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
There are two wells near here.
The Janjaweed will be close to one.
"The nearest is Bir an Natrun, that way."
"And we're trusting him as our guide, why exactly?"
It was Tahir's men who destroyed my village.
And my family.
"And your friend Scott, he promised me much money, and a new car if I help you, yes?"
You gotta love that mercenary spirit.
So what's your reason?
"This isn't only about Latif, is it?"
Not for you.
"If we don't get a signal soon, get some back-up, we're driving towards Clare in a hearse."
"Look, I'm not going to hurt you."
"I need some drugs, adrenalin, something to keep me going."
"If you come with me, I can get you your drugs, and examine your wound also."
Soldiers here.
They are looking for me.
Why?
- a nice walk.
- I hate walking.
"Besides, my driver's around the corner."
I have to go meet Simas Gort Morgan... and he's going to introduce me to Milo Norbuck... who's gonna be in the new CK campaign with me.
I can.
Should I come with you?
- It's business.
"- It's business, right."
"Page me tomorrow and maybe we'll have dinner, okay?"
Page?
"You know, Jocelyn, I have been inside all day... and I would like to take a nice walk."
- Would you like to join me?
"- Sure, I'd love to."
"Darling, change of plans."
"I have to meet Norbuck, at the Mercer, at 2AM... let's have some dinner at Raul's."
"- I'll take you next time, okay?"
"- Sure, no problem."
Okay.
"Antoniette, can I borrow your intern?"
The Doyle Gallery just called and... they desperately need this gown.
"It's the dress Kim Basinger orderly... asked, the one with only one sleeve, the one for the celebrity couture... auction, immediately."
You can finish this when you get back.
Hurry up!
- You heard her.
"- For God's sake, watch your back."
There are spies everywhere.
Trust no one.
"- Guard that with your soul, darling."
- I shall.
I owe you lunch.
"November, December or something..."
- our girls will figure it out.
"Ooh, I like him a lot."
"Just sign here, and your son will stand to inherit my entire estate."
Whoo-hoo!
We're rich.
"Bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows."
We want to get the old people smell out before we move in.
"- Dad, Mr. Burns hasn't passed away yet."
- Huh?
"Oh, right."
"So I guess you're in okay shape, huh?"
- No heart problems or anything?
"- Well, I--"
- Boo!
- [ Groaning ]
[ Groaning Continues ] I'm okay.
Now that you've all agreed to reap the windfall of my death...
"I must return to my large, empty mansion to rattle around... and await the inevitable alone."
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah.
- Let's push him down the steps.
- No!
"You know, Bart, since he is giving you all of his money... maybe it would be nice if you spent some time with him."
- Well--
"- Come on, honey."
All right.
How come Bart gets to do that... and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house?
"Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of""booger man""... but, uh, I'm really not such a bad... dude."
"Oh, your milk's gone cold."
I'll ring for the maid.
- Whoa!
[ Muffled Grunting ]
"- Oh, sorry."
"Inaho insists that she is an imposter, but there's no telling just how much he can see."
Have you eaten?
In a bit.
Let me find a good place to leave off.
You've been this way since we were little.
"When you're into something, everything else fades away."
Here.
"Thanks, Yuki."
"You've heard, right?"
"About Asseylum's, uh..."
Yeah.
That proclamation seemed to prove everything you've been saying.
"It all seems a little too convenient, and if that really were the genuine Princess Asseylum, would she think of a founding a kingdom in Earthspace?"
Slaine Troyard.
That douchebag who shot my dear little brother?
Thanks.
"But watch your language, Yuki."
It doesn't matter if she's real or not anymore.
I don't think anyone would bother to listen to her.
Even if she tried to broker a peace between Earth and Mars again.
"About the attack on Earth, Milord, if there are no problems, I will get preparations underway."
Milord Slaine?
I'm listening.
Proceed as planned.
"Yes, Milord."
Her Highness has yet to-.
She will wake up soon.
I know it.
"I eagerly await that day, Milord."
But... tragedies do happen.
Milord?
It's nothing.
Let's get this typed up.
What?
I'm going to miss this.
Are you going somewhere?
I've accepted a job offer back home.
You're going back into advertising?
Head of Morale Ops at the new camp in Virginia.
"They're looking for Camp X grads to teach there, so..."
The Americans will be lucky to have you.
And no more bad guys to shoot you.
I will miss this place.
So visit.
"Could you get those handcuffs off, please?"

"Klaus, I'm Duncan Sinclair."
I'm Oliver and Billy's father.
Do you remember me?
Have a seat.
How's Bowmanville suit you?
Little more comfortable than the Russian camp?
Why am I here?
- Did my father arrange this?
"- Now, Klaus,"
"I can't elaborate, for security reasons, but..."
Our families vacationed on Lake Constance when you were a child.
"We couldn't keep you kids out of the water that summer,"
- do you remember?
- No.
This isn't the same breakfast the other prisoners of war receive.
"Well, Klaus, Bowmanville's good, but it's not that good."
I don't want special treatment.
Are you sure...

"Yes, one penis after another."
"General, Guillaume, every month..."
I recieve a limited supply of penicillin from the United States.
And what do you think my priority should be?
To save a sodomite who likes sunflowers... or a wounded American?
- Now please excuse me.
"- General Cork... it's Coronel Eliot, sir."
He says it's urgent.
"Be quick about it, Coronel."
We're at war.
What?
"No, no, that makes no sense."
Let's start over from the beginning.
"Right, first we want a creamy soup."
"But our soup is creamy, like mud."
Tomato soup?
"Yes, I think that's alright."
And don't forget the bleach.
"I don't know, it looks like we'll have to look after her stomach."
Anything else?
"But ""why isn't there any fresh fish in Naples""?"
"Coronel, you don't have to remind me I prohibited fishing."
The Bay of Napoles is mined from here to Sicily.
"But when Mark Cork gives that Renaissance dinner there will be... fish cooked with mayonaise, understand?"
How do you know?
Try the aquarium...
Soldier...
Fish cooked with mayonaise.
My god!
Do you think she'll like that?
- I have no idea.
Let me get on the floor and beg
"That makes me look bad, so no"
"Anyways, the report please"
Yes.
Someone seems to be home since last night
Ok.
Please lead us there
Yes ma'am.
Please follow me
He's been on a stakeout since last night?
Of course
"If he stayed, this old beast may have attacked me"
I was so scared!
I'm so sorry
Don't look this way evil one!
Yes
The final battle with this party...
They're on the fourth floor
I'm calling the police if they aren't there
They're there
Their lights were on until really late last night
I was watching his door from across the street
Didn't stop you from going shopping
I'm sorry...
Lin...
Let's go in!
Let's persuade her and bring her back home

So much for Plan B.
"That's it, boy."
You're our last hope.
Ohh.
"I just don't want to be here, Dad."
"Besides, I started a fire this morning that I really should keep an eye on."
"Bart, this isn't the kind of thing I normally would think was a good idea... but you wouldn't have to live with Mr. Burns."
You'd just get all of his money someday.
This could provide for your entire future.

"Hell, yeah."
That's why I can't smoke weed.
Weed is dangerous for somebody like me.
I already got too many voices in my head.
"Last time I smoked weed,"
I got so high
I was driving around looking for my car keys.
Just stopping people in my neighborhood.
"""Hey, yo, you seen my car keys, man?"""
"""No, for real."
"You seen my car keys?"""
"The dude that I asked, he was high too."
"He was like, ""Maybe you should keep driving around"""
"till you find them."""
"But I was so messed up, I was like,"
"""That's a good idea."
"I'm gonna keep driving."""
I can't do it.
"I'm messed up, man."
I'm messed up.
I went to the West Coast.
I did a show out in Oakland.
That's already a bad situation.
And I had something called a weed cookie.
"Yes, ""Ooh,"" is right."
I was high for two days straight.
"It was so bad, I was in my hotel room in the bathroom mirror having an in-depth conversation with myself about why I should keep my voice down."
"Because the walls were thin, and the next-door neighbors was gonna think I was crazy."
So I'm in my hotel room looking and sounding like Sméagol from Lord of the Rings.
Good to see you.
"You, too."
Yeah.
That was great.
Thank you.

Ok.

What do you want?
I want to know the name of the person who put your client on that plane in Thailand.
What will you give her for that?
I'll make sure they don't prosecute her back home.

You sure?
That's what it was.
4795 pounds when it came into the shop.

That's 120 pounds overweight.
And when it was booked into Marseilles it was 4795.
That's still 120 pounds overweight.

"We'll save the home and we'll get them back, I promise."
Everybody off to practise.
"Hustle up, let's go."
Practise time.
L'll get the sticks.
"Dumped in a Dairy Queen bathroom at age five,"
Alex Gorrall was a kid without a home.
A kid without a future.
But now this unlikely hero has one shot to win the cup.
And he's done it!
Gorrall has won the cup.
"Give it up for A-train, people!"
"Nice shot, Dairy Queen."
"Dude, this is my private time."
"Yeah, well, the Newman Home knows no secrets, you know that."
"Yeah, sorry about the little dudes, man, I did all that I could."
"Hey, it's not your fault, okay?"
"Look, I called CFS."
"Bernie requested no visitors, so we can't even go see them."
I promised lan he'd be safe.
"Well, all we can do now is try and get them back."
"Wow, at least someone's excited about my plan."
"So, how are we doing on money?"
Let's take a look.
From our jobs we have $500.
That's not counting food and utilities.
"Well, Mr B's giving us free ice-time."
We still need the entry fees and gear.
"You're gonna have to get me an Easton Stealth Pro Stick, I'd be like..."
"I'd be like Harry Potter on his Nimbus 2000, bro, unstoppable."
He had a licensed revolver for security.
He had just got in a cab and inspector Varma ascended.
He had a pistol in hand.
"Your honour, Inspector Varma was in muRi."
"And you see, one's identification is not inscribed on his face."
My client took him for a crook.
And he tried to escape.
Then Mr Vijay threatened to shoot him.
To defend himself Mr Balwant fired at him.
It's not true.
It is baseless.
Because Mr Balwant vey well knows me as a police officer.
This is not our first encounter.
On the 16th of October I tried to arrest him at Malighat.
But he managed to escape.
- Wrong again.
"On the 16th of October, Mr Balwant was lying in the hospital and not in Malighat."
He was ill and was bed-ridden.
This medical certificate proves it.
"""Me and you in a locked house"""
"""And the keys not to be found"""
Hello!
"Inspector, he..."
- What times!
A decent man like me... ..can't even walk on the streets!
"- Inspector, the fact is..."
What is the problem?
I was on my way to the beach for a swim.
He whistled at me and passed remarks at me.
- Lies!
I am seriously stressed up myself!
"You see it, don't you?"
"Iâm the one getting my ass kicked over here, itâs not you."
Horace.
"Yeah, I have children here, you don't know what that's like."
(change jingling)
"Yeah, but I'm not gonna do that."
"What are you, crazy?"
Yeah.
"No, I can't do that."
Come here.
"Go downstairs, get mama a pack of cigarettes."
"Yeah, I know, I know, I know."
"I know, Abby."
"Oh, okay."
"- Well, Little Horace, when he was about six, he was in the little league and I coached his team, right?"
"And so he played right field, so right away, you know how good he is, right?"
"I mean, how many kids that age could hit it out to right field?"
"So he'd be out there, you know, picking his nose and staring off, and then one day, he comes running up to me in the middle of the game, up to the bench, he says,"
"(high pitched) Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete,"
I gotta make a pee pee!
"I said, get the fuck back out on the field!"
What's the matter with you?
(laughter)
"He said, (high pitched) time out, Uncle Pete, I gotta make a pee pee!"
"I said, I don't care if you gotta make a doo-doo."
You don't stop in the middle of the game.
What are you doing?
"What is this, girls' softball?"
"And then he's crying like, wahh..."
"All right, all right, I had to call a time-out."
"So I say to the ump, time out."
"And then I go over to Horace, I said, okay, all right, come here."
"Here, come here."
But thank you for the invitation all the same.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
"Henry and I would like to thank you all very much for coming, and Lady Felicia, of course, for all your kindness."
25 years sounds a lot.
"Some of you will know it's not been our easiest year but we've stuck though it, together, like we always have."
"And, well, I think that's the secret of a happy marriage, really."
"So thank you, and enjoy your evening."
What about Edie?
"Red Lion, anyone?"
"Ready to sweep all before you tomorrow, Mrs M?"
Tomorrow?
"Oh, you mean the flower show."
"That's just a bit of fun, isn't it?"
"Now, what can I do for you?"
About George...
You can save your breath.
You clearly put him up to that little stunt.
"Mrs M, you've got it all wrong."
He did come and see me but only because he was feeling nervous.
He'd wanted to ask you out for lunch for a very long time.
"He seems a jolly decent chap, and I think he really likes you."
Was there anything else?
No.
Only that Gerard's Brasserie is quite the place to be at the moment and the Dover sole is really rather good.
"Your Cosmos looks lovely, by the way."
Edie.
Tea's up!
George.
"Mrs McCarthy, good morning."
May I have a word?
"Yes, yes, of course."
Let me just...
"-Oh, stanley's polish, you know."
"Oh, yeah."
"Something like Irish, isn't it?"
well....
I bought some nice clothes to meet all your lovely friends in.
well....
I'm afraid you won't think they're lovely.
"well, anyway, I bought nice clothes and I'II wear them."
I guess you're hoping I'II say I'II put up at a hotel.
I'm not going to put up at a hotel.
"I've got to be near you, stella."
I've got to be with people.
I can't be alone because....
"Because as you must have noticed, I--"
I'm not very well.
You do seem a little....
will stanley like me or will I just be a visiting in-Iaw?
"I couldn't stand that, stella."
You'II get along fine together.
If you just try not to compare him--
"-Oh, he was an officer?"
"-He was master sergeant in the Engineers Corps, decorated four times."
He had those on when you met him?
I assure you I wasn't just blinded by all the brass.
"-Oh, that's not what I--"
"-Of course, there--"
There were things to adjust myself to later on.
Such as his civilian background.
How did he take it when you said I was coming?
"-Oh, he's on the road a good deal."
"-Oh, he travels?"
Good.
Look Mom!
Maybe she used to watch me from right here.
But she hated movies.
The only one we saw together was Dumbo.
Takizawa-kun!
I'm fine!
I wanna keep watching you.
Target acquired.
He's in front of the merry-go-round.
Finally found them...
How dare those jerks sneak off on a date...
Is this... thanks to you I remembered that I once lived in New York.
Get in!
Are you the one who called me yesterday?
Yes.
Prime Minister Iinuma's wife requested I meet with you in secret.
The Seleção aren't the only ones who don't like your request to become king. and she loathes you for it.
Then why does she want you to bring him back?
Mrs. Iinuma wants to hear it straight from his mouth.
And I personally want to see what happens with you as king.
What do we do?
I already deleted the new search engine.
Take the Eden of the East System down.
That should at least buy us some time.
How much would that help?
It'd give us exactly 48 hours.
More evidence of how incredible our Eden really was.
Eden of the East 000 NEETs in Toyosu anymore.
It's being used by people all over the country.
We have no choice.
Micchon?
I switched over to the wireless LAN.
It's mine.
Soon we will welcome Turkey
In the embrace of the European Union.
"We Belgians, finding us in the heart of Europe,"
We will celebrate this historic occasion
Giving the Turkish people our most beloved Mini-Europa Park.
He has already sent me eleven messages.
I do not know how I can do my job while I'm following this documentary.
The Queen would not cancel her because of her annual cold.
Sire.
"If you allow me,"
Mr. Bulut told me the evening program.
"At 18, show of dancing dervishes."
"No speech, just a few words."
"I remember not to mention Iraq, Syria, Israel, the Kurds, Armenia,"
"Our federal problems, our debt,"
"And, above all, football."
It is a delicate topic.
The gala dinner will start at 8pm.
Nine courses.
No kebabs?
One two Three.
"Mr Moreau, are you sorry?"
Thank you.
And action.
"Sire, the press conference will begin at 11pm at Miniatiürk."
"His speech, sire."
The Prime Minister has made some changes.
"I remember that in Turkey, the handshakes are energetic."
It's even shorter.
Brussels insisted on brevity.
"Clearly, a consequence of my speech in Scotland."
It's only Fairclough's word.
And he was telling the truth.
"And that's what it's all about, isn't it?"
"Really the truth, that's where our loyalties are, not in clocking up convictions."
"But there again, if the truth doesn't suit you, you can always do what Charlie Fairclough did."
He invented it.
And no-one noticed?
"You have to trust people that you work with, unless you have a very good reason not to."
There's no other way.
So I'm going to find the truth.
That's what's going to get Michael King out of jail and put away a murderer.
And not by what your opinion is of me.
(Everyone applauding for Jack)
"Come on, back to work."
It's not Ladies Night at Masonic Lodge!
Mr. Mullett.
Superintendent.
Goodbye.
"Darling,"
Yep.
It's Inspector Frost.
Thank you.
"You're back, Inspector."
If you think you can just walk in here and talk to James.
"No, no, it's you I wanted to chat to sir."
"Thank you very much, Mrs. Barr."
"Yes, well the thing is,"
I don't think that your brother killed his wife.
You've arrested Sheridan?
"No, no Mr. Sheridan's innocent."
He's got an alibi.
"Your brother would have had an alibi too had he gone to Bristol, on your instructions."
"What'II happen?"""
No wallets!
It's so fuckin' tense.
"Like when you're in line with everybody and you're going through the zigzags, yeah, you're having the time of your life."
"The moment you touch a bin, you're in the Octagon."
Nobody's your buddy.
Nobody's your pal.
They're timing you.
"As soon as you touch a bin, go!"
"""That's as fast as you can go?"
How many bins do you need?
Laptop and an iPad?
"Where the fuck are you going?"""
Then you gotta go through that goddamn Stargate machine.
What is that?
Why do we just do it?
What is it?
"If you asked TSA, ""What does this even do?"""
"They're like, ""Well, shows us where your sweaty spots are, and then we tackle 'em."""
"Next time you're at the airport and you step into that Stargate machine, look at the person on the other side and be like,"
"""I guess Los Angeles, 1984, please."""
"""Sir, please come out."""
"""Oh."
"How long was I gone?"""
"Do all that. ""Sir, you can step out."""
"""How long was I gone?"
"Where am I?"""
"""Very funny, sir."
"Please go, get on your flight."
"You, ma'am, with the baby formula, why are you here?"""
"""I think I was sent from the future to kill a boy."""
"""Sir, please, grab your bag."
She's the one who used to pinch my bum on the side.
"Yes, I did."
Look out!
-I'II pinch your bum a bit more.
-See?
You know you meet a lot of people who kind of see  lik e a media perception of you.
And it's just nice coming here and spending a bit of time with people who know me.
Most important part  of having time off.
Being able to come home and see me mother me father my brother Greg.
"Lord, may Denise and Greg be united in love forever."
never had any problem going up and asking me father anything.
"The birds and the bees, the one-two-threes."
He left here as a 1 6-year-old.
He knows more about life than me really now.
I come from a very rural background.
still live in a rural background.
He's going out and seeing the world.
I can't give him advice.
He knows where he's at.
This is the fifth day he's actually been home since he left two and a half years ago for X Factor.
Yeah.
"-Hi, love."
"-Good to see you, my darling!"
How are you?
Are you all right?
Long time since I saw Louis.
I know.
I see you every day when I walk out the toilet because you're on the wall.
"Goodbye, my love."
So lovely to see you.
I'II get my earplugs then and I'II come to see your shows.
"Yeah, that'd be lovely."
LAUGHTER
"Ellie, what do you get jealous of?"
"I think I get quite jealous, like, if I hear my husband on the phone to another woman and just hear her being like, ""Press 4 for customer service""."
LAUGHTER
Whore!
LAUGHTER
What do you guys get jealous of?
I get career jealous.
Mm.
Career jealousy.
"Yeah, I get jealous of North Korea."
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
Is that the nice one?
I think so.
You get jealous of people's careers?
Yeah.
I found that one of the highest-paid actresses in England is the Witch of Wookey Hole.
The kids' show?
"No, she's actually in Wookey Hole, which is a cave, and she just pops out at people and she's just a witch."
LAUGHTER
"And that's a proper job that she's on, like, 40 grand a year for that."
"Sorry, you're jealous of a witch that lives in a cave?"
LAUGHTER
"I mean all right, I think we can probably get you that."
"The bar's pretty low, Jimmy."
"David, do you ever do anything..."
Have you ever made anyone very jealous?
Ugh.
"Well, my friend Mike and I, he lives near a cafe where I drink very strong coffee, and I go to his house and do shits sometimes."
And...
LAUGHTER
Hmm.
"Um, we had a fairly intense screaming match."
No.
"Wherein I suggested that you take your head and store it within yourself in a fashion that, while, while space-saving, might limit its exposure to, to sunshine."
"Well, that describes 95% of my employees and everyone in my family..."
except for my dog.
:
He's such a good boy.
Well...
"I'll see you later, uh..."
Randall Wilkerson.
Marshall Eriksen.
"Gary Dinkersfield, right."
"Great, he doesn't remember you."
Not great.
Arthur Hobbes hating Marshall-- that's no big deal.
He hates everyone.
It's the people he doesn't know that he cuts loose.
He just fired What's-His-Face.
"He fired What's- His-Face, Ted, and What's-His-Face was invaluable."
"Look, I can understand you getting upset, but it's not worth killing yourself over."
"Yeah, wait till you get laid off, then kill yourself."
Like What's-His-Face.
Although I guess now it's more like Where's-His-Face.
"Look, it was just two cigarettes."
"Okay, I can handle two."
"As long as I don't have three within 24 hours, then I'm not going to get hooked again."
What's Lily going to say when she finds out you smoked?
Lily's not going to find out.
I have a system.
"Ah, yes, Marshall's system."
"Hey, Lil."
-That's right.
That's where I want it met.
Impossible.
"They'll turn him over to the Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI."
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.
It would be like trying to kill the President.
-There's no way we can get to him!
"-Tom, you surprise me."
"If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anyone."
-Rocco?
-Difficult.
Not impossible.
Good.
Why did you ask me if something was wrong when I came in?
I thought you were going to tell me that you were moving your family to Vegas and that you'd been offered the Vice Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.
-I thought you'd tell me that.
-Must I tell you every offer I turn down?
-Let's do business.
-All right.
"Just consider this, Michael."
Just consider it.
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.
"Are they worth it, are they strong enough?"
Is it worth it?
You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?
"I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom."
"Just my enemies, that's all."
"Are you with me in these things, or what?"
"Because if not, you can take your wife, your family and your mistress and move them all to Las Vegas."
"Why do you hurt me, Michael?"
"You""re the one who will have to change."
"I don""t like it, but I work within the system."
"- Maybe you""re right."
"- Of course I""m right."
You need to spend less time with the kids and more time in the sack.
You smell good enough to eat.
"All that hot, warm syrup."
Cherries.
How could Mike not appreciate this body?
"L""d never get tired of this foot, knee... or this little spot right here."
I love you.
"I don""t know what I""m supposed to tell her."
Her own father left me.
"And the next two-faced liar I met, Bo... slept with my best friend when I was in the hospital."
"In the hospital, Lucas, having surgery on my right ovary."
Cassie knows this.
"She knows I found that slut""s library card sitting next to my birth control pills."
"Like Karen""s ever read a book in her life."
Cassie remembers how her mama struggled.
Remembers all four of us crammed in that stinky one-bedroom apartment.
- The one with the all them red ants.
- And that creepy neighbor.
He was a pervert.
Registered and everything.
I looked him up.
"L""m just trying to protect her."
"She""s my baby girl."
"Can I get some help over here, y""all?"
Hello?
"Miss Bacha, you""re gonna have to hold on."
"L""ve got a situation here."
"Why are you arguing with me, anyway?"
"I was too worked up,"
"So I made a few phone calls, I organized the junk drawer,"
And then I fired off an e-mail to the principal
About ms.
Rinsky.
You did what now?
Don't worry.T's good.
You wanna hear it?
Mm-hmm.
I made some very good points.
"""dear principal Larimer,"

"An issue of concern for me as a parent."" huh?"
"""it regards one of your teachers... ms."

"""I have tried repeatedly to have an open dialogue with her"
"""about my son's education,"
"""but she has been completely uncaring and dismissive."
"""today, more than ever,"
"Don't we need teachers who are caring and missive?"""
"okay, that might not be the right word, but wait."
It gets better.
Okay.
"""her teaching skills in math don't add up."""
"Mm. ""Maybe 'cause when she was born"
"The numbers only went up to ten."" oh."
Mm.
"I don't remember writing that, but..."

"Good, you've got it."
"All right, good."

"Now, low, low, lower, lower."
(Ali speaking in Arabic)
"Yes, he does."
Every inch a king.
Who are you?
(Exclaiming)
"With the ceremonies complete, the tomb was sealed."
Tutankhamun was finally left alone in the silent valley.
"Pharaoh Ay reigned for just four years, leaving no heir."
"When a new dynasty began,"
Tutankhamun's name was removed from the monuments he had built.
"With his records erased, his memory was allowed to wither away."
"Goodbye, old chap."
- All done?
- All done.
"So, was it worth it?"
"I think so, yes."
"Oh, yes."
And did you find him?
"A bit, yes."
A bit.
"During his lifetime,"
"Howard Carter received no official honour in Britain or Egypt in recognition of his unique achievements, and when he died in March, 1939, his funeral was poorly attended."
But Tutankhamun's tomb remains the most famous archaeological find of all time.
"Since I was the only black kid at my school,"
I thought people stared at me all the time because they were fascinated with me.

The last address Yale had for Preston was a town I'd never heard of.
"Welcome to Gulf City, Mr. Murdock."
Murdock....
"Yes, a room is reserved f or you."
Nobody knew I was coming.
"- Warren Murdock, and f rom St. Louis."
"- l don't get it, but I'll take it."
It's our best.
The gentleman who telephoned insisted.
"- Then it's f or me, all right."
"- Front, boy."
"Geronimo, the paratroopers' jump call."
"It was Johnny, all right."
We could read each other's minds.
He knew I'd want to help.
He'd seen me look at the back of his pin.
"Will call later, the message said."
That was 10 hours ago.
"How long is ""later""?"
"What to do in a hot wind, smelling of jasmine ex cept wait and sweat and prime the body to sweat more?"
A phone directory might help.
I'd never heard of Johnny speak of any relatives but I was ready to try anything.
"""Prendergast, Prescott, Prestwood. """
"Stalled again, like a jeep on synthetic gas."
48 hours since he'd called and no word.
I'd pitched the Cardinals into the pennant and set the Red Sox down in the World Series.
"Suddenly, Johnny's service record came to me like a photograph."
This is new territory for me.
"No, it's new for me too."
"I, uh..."
Maybe this trip and the juggling everything...
"Too much, too fast."
I think you're right.
Maybe we should go home tomorrow.
"Yeah, I think-- I think that'd be best."

"So I'm the best man, standing in front of... 300 people?"
Mmhmm.
"And I hear ""beep, beep, beep."""
So I silence my pager.
It was a pager.
"90 seconds later,"
"""beep, beep, beep, beep."""
You got to be panicking at this point.
Think about how the guests feel.
Everyone assumes it's an international emergency.
"I know I have to take it, but it's in the middle of the ceremony, so I go back down the aisle, past the 300 people, and out the door."
Everyone must think China's invaded Russia.
Everybody's thinking China's invaded America.

YATES:
"This ain't your fight, mister."
-Who the hell are you?
-Name's Yates.
I'm a U.S. federal marshal.
Vin Tanner...
... you'reunderarrestfor murder in the sovereign state of Texas.
We've come to take you back.
Let's go.
"Marshal Yates, all I'm saying is that a man's actions should speak for him."
Couldn't agree more.
But I got papers say...
... thisfellowTanner'sactionsin Tascosa were that of a murderer.
Just because some papers say it doesn't make it true.
A lot of people will attest that Vin Tanner...
... hasriskedhislifemany times to protect this town.
"Mrs. Travis, I'm not the judge and I'm not the jury."
I'm not ever after that bounty on Tanner's head.
I'm just a lawman sworn to bring him to trial for the killing of Jess Kincaid.
"Good afternoon, ma'am."
"Marshal, you ever heard of a man by the name of Eli Joe?"
Should I?
He's wanted in Texas for the slaughter of two families.
"Well, what's that got to do with me?"
Tanner claims this Eli Joe set him up.
You know that for a fact?
Then what you have to say don't count for much.
MARY:
I'll wire the judge.
"You can do that, ma'am, but a territory judge..."
"-Yes, I did some writing."
-Did you get any of it published?
"No, I got a job working for a book publisher."
"He didn't by any chance publish those books with the... the plain wrappers, do you remember?"
"Yes, you do."
Remember?
"You were always afraid, and everything frightened you."
I can't get over how wonderful you look.
"-Really, you look great."
-Thanks.
Though you never said good-bye to me when you left Peyton Place.
-Never even said good-bye.
-I'll never forget that Labor Day.
-I won't either.
-I see you have 2 Purple Hearts.
-What brings you home?
Vacation?
-Haven't you heard about Selena?
"-No, what?"
"-She killed her stepfather, Lucas."
The trial starts in two days for murder.
"Lucas was always a bad Joe, but she always seemed to put up with him."
Who ever knows what anyone's able to put up with in this world?
"Well, that's true."
"It sure took me a lot enough time... to know a little about myself, understand Peyton Place."
-Cigarette?
-Thanks.
I'm going to go back and try to work things out with my mother.
Maybe we'll both be happier.
"If not, maybe at least I've made the effort."
You know?
I always wondered why you enlisted.
- Are you bullshittin' me?
[Grunts] That car's dirty.
Take it in and tear it apart.
[Jimmy] Tear it right out.
Tear it out!
"Nothing here, Jimmy."
Look in here.
[Coughing]
This is all solid.
[Loud Hissing]
[Tire Bouncing]
[Whirring]
There's nobody been under that car since it came from the factory.
That thing is clean.
"I don't buy that, Irv."
The stuff is in that car.
"Well, you find it."
I can't.
[Indistinct]
[Speaking French]
"Look, the car was lost some time last night."
"First, they send us to Pier 1, then they send us here."
Then what?
I don't understand why you parked the car down by the waterfront.
You tell me you're staying at the Doral in midtown Manhattan... and you lose the car out by the Brooklyn Bridge?
"Look, Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French television."
He probably left the car to look at some point of interest.
We were told by the police commissioner's office that the car was brought to this garage.
I demand its immediate return.
"You're going to have to be patient, Mr. Devereaux."
"We get 400, 500 cars here a day."
Monsieur Devereaux is a very important guest of this country.
How long?
- Month or month and a half
Will you hold this for me?
And turn around
Moron!
Did I bring you up to see this day?
"No, don't drop that"
"Are you all right, Pops?"
"Pops, you're right."
I ought to take care of your business
You've become so old.
- You tell your father that?
"Pops, I've decided against Europe."
I'm joining the offices from tomorrow
"In this house, only your father decides."
You're going to Europe
No.
I've had enough of a goodtime.
My years of youth are over for me
Never say your youth is over.
All my life I've slogged to give you whatever I couldn't do
"When youth came and went, I never got to know"
"But I wasn't sad, because I knew that my son will have my years"
"If you think you've had enough of a goodtime... if you think the years of youth are over for you, well no problem"
Just go and live my years for me
Ajit's letter?
Lajjo!
"Look, what's here Letter!"
From my friend
From Ajit
"Just smell it, lady!"
The fragrance of Punjab!
Why didn't you just telephone the restaurant?
The line was engaged.
"There isn't really a fire at St Mary's, is there?"
) George is Max.
"Well, I think I had better get back, just, just in case..."
Good idea.
"I hope we can do this again, Bridget?"
"Oh, yes!"
Of course!
I'd like to eat this fish but I don't think it would be safe.
I know you killed Vera Blanchett... ..and let an innocent boy swing for it.
"I don't know what you're talking about, Father."
Your work took you to the Crown Court regularly.
That's where you met Vera.
"She was young, impressionable."
You were a Detective Sergeant.
How could she refuse you?
But she did.
"And that's when it went horribly, horribly wrong."
I presume Max is your middle name?
If you leave this restaurant I will call the police.
Was it your idea to pin Vera's murder onto Thomas?
"It was my boss's idea, and his boss's."
"To protect their reputation and the ""good name"" of the police?"
But I did nothing to stop them!
Did you poison Henry too?
What?
No!
Surely he needed to be silenced.
Thanks to Iris he knew that you were Vera's killer.
But I only just found that out from Mrs McCarthy.
"Father, I have done some monstrous things in my time but believe me, I would never, ever harm Henry or Mrs McCarthy."
She won the money.
Maybe they have joint bank accounts.
"Yeah, or maybe he wants Craig for something else."
You know what?
Freeze their accounts.
"I want thorough backgrounds on Dawkins, Craig and Dana."
Run their names through NCIC.
"Chin, what about the phone you found?"
Dawkins got it from the car he stole.
But the call history was erased.
"He must have made some phone calls, reached out to the phone company and sure enough, two calls were made right after the escape."
The first one went to a local woman named Sofia Archuleta.
Archuleta.
"That's, uh, Dawkins girlfriend."
Warden said she's a regular visitor.
She's the first one he's going to for help.
What about the other call?
"That one was made to a local lightweight ex-con by the name of Makani Huku, they spoke for three minutes."
"Kono, follow up on the call with Makani, find out what they were talking about."
"Chin, pull Dawkins' jacket."
See if we find any links on Dana and Craig.
Easy.
- We need to get an address for Sofia.
I'll get it.
You should change your shirt.
You look like an animal.
"You should go apologize to your sister, she's been sitting there for five hours."
"Thanks, buddy."
I'll take it from here.
"Mary, I'm sorry."
You okay?
Yeah.
"Fortunately, this yet to be completed formula... was stolen by a Jewish Scientist, who intended to sell it to the Americans."
"Since the Jew's nanny taught him Mandarin, and to evade attention, the deal was carried out in H.K."
"They cold named the formula the ""Beast""."
"On knowing this, Hitler sent 2 Gastapos to H.K."
"To catch the ""Beast""."
Nothing can stop the world from rotating.
But there are always exceptions.
"You're always so fast, only takes you less than a minute."
"That's simple enough, even a dog can do it."
Someone's at the door!
- Who's turn?
"- Yours, of course!"
Give me a hand!
Hold on!
- O.K?
- O.K.!
"Hello, this is Yoyo Private Eye's, I'm Super..."
No...
I'm the Great Super Yoyo?
What?
Your No.8 concubine has walked out on you?
"Such a simple case, why bother me?"
Wait till all 8 of them walk out on you!
What?
The Mayor inviting me to dinner?
Haven't got time!
I wouldn't be Yoyo if I can be so easily invited.
"Old man, what can I do for you?"
I've come to connect the telephone.
"Oh yes, you haven't paid the bill for 6 mouths."
I spent all my savings yesterday to pay for it.
Smart girl.
Yes.
For three points.
"No he's not, is it?"
Yes!
Who is he?
Benedict.
"He was the last one, Benedict."
Your answers?
Ratzinger and Benedict.
Show me your first letters.
Yeah...
And that one?
I guess so?
Let's see if you're right?
"Correct, for two points."
"Now there's something rather interesting about Pope Benedict and the current Pope, do you know what it is?"
He's the last one to resign for a long time.
For about 600 years.
"And so you have a situation where we have a Pope who's resigned, and you've also got a Pope, who's Pope Francis."
So Pope Benedict is now known as Pope Emeritus.
"So for the first time in about 600 years, we have two popes who are alive at the same time."
"Right, where are we at the end that round?"
"Lutrophiles, eight points, very well done."
"Araucarians, you're on four."
"It's round two, and you'll each face two hives containing three answers relating to a specific topic."
You've 45 seconds to complete each hive and score a maximum five points.
"So Team Lutrophiles, you're in the lead, you get to choose first from..."
"So, choose your topic first of all."
Physics or Geography?
Geography could be a lot of things.
Shall we go with physics?
OK.
"Do not break glass and kill the bee, you guys have... kill it... kill or i will give you a slap under you ear."
"Sir, she is gone..."
Chandu do something.
See the diamond's worth is 200000000/- it will be gone with the car.
Now every thing is in God's hand.
God...
"God... do something, anything... excuse me."
You?
You?
Both of you are here you should be shame of yourself.
You killed that sweet and innocent Laxmi Narayan and fled?
Having the punishment for that same sin.
Actually we thought he is the Laxmi Narayan who was about to buy car.
But he was not that Laxmi Narayan.
Which car?
"A green old broken car, couldn't sale even 7 months."
"If it could not sale for two day more, that would be nice."
Are you talking about 6121?
"Yeah, how you know?"
That's my car.
I will transfer all the balance to AMI 200000000/-!
"If you will take 75°/°, that would be good too."
All right give the 5°/°.
"In 1000000/- really, paper are ready too."
And Laxmi Narayan would be on his way at 4 o'clock with money.
Here's the 50°/° from advance.
"Its not nursery now, i have changed my mind, i don't want to sale my car."
Here's the car's papers read it.
I don't want to sale my car!
I am taking this car.
That's my car.
"I made it car, see this, i have made the headlights, and the paint too."
Why is that lady rubbing on someone else's body?
Yoon Jae!
Da Ran...
You came?
Hello.
I came to see Yoon Jae.
What are you thinking coming here by yourself without saying anything?
!
I had no idea that he was a doctor!
And I came to see my body!
Your body?
"What, you don't think I'd be curious to see if my body's doing okay?"
And there's a precious personal item that I have to find too!
Then...
Follow me this way.
Hurry up and put this on.
"But, Teacher Gil..."
"There's a girl doctor among his friends, right?"
She's a little strange.
There's something weird about her touch.
Kang Gyung Joon.
You made my Yoon Jae be called an idiot...
Now you're even trying to get him to be called sneaky?
Sneaky?
!
Boys your age...
"I understand that when a girl even lays a finger on you, you think it's a turn-on."
Since I'm a high school teacher.
"But if you look at Yoon Jae's friend in that way with Yoon Jae's eyes, what do you think she'll think of my Yoon Jae?"
There's your disillusion growing again!
"You know very well boys my age are more likely to act out the more you act like that, right teacher?"
"Idiotic, sneaky and now incapable..."
[laughs]
"Oh, you're so like a man, Townsend."
[chuckles] [sighs] Is it possible that you are the worst friend a fellow has ever had?
[chuckles]
And thank you for picking up my tab tonight.
"Oh, no, thank Winston."
I signed his name to everything.
[laughing]
- [glass breaking] - [car horn honking]
[keys jangling]
[sighs]
"So you see, dearest Scott,"
"I worry that I'll never do anything of import, for I'm much too lazy to care whether a thing is done or not."
"All I truly want is to be young always, and to feel that my life is my own."
[indistinct chatter]
Tildy says the people of New York all have different kind of accents.
The likes of which she's never heard.
Plenty of different accents around here.
"You mean, like, Mississippi and Georgia?"
They are different.
Are they not?
"I think Tildy's talkin' about non-southern type accents, Daddy."
"Yes, Tootsie, I understand."
- We about done here?
"- Zelda, honey."
Could you post this for me?
I suppose so.
The streets are filled to the brim with people and cars and buses and trolleys.
It's all one big swirl.
Nothin' to love about the big city.
I think it sounds exciting.

She was a blackmailer.
And I killed her.
"And up to now, I'm glad I killed her."
And I believe that in this killing the murderer has the sympathetic part.
Does that satisfy you?
"Yes, sir."
That satisfies me.
"Lieutenant, you would do me an enormous favor if you stopped calling me sir."
Are you tired of living?
Yes?

"Lost thousands in company stock, he was recently laid off, and if Wickes Steel goes under, he will likely lose his pension."
SECNAV's green plan ruined this guy.
Sounds like a motive to me.
McGEE:
"If Ridgeway did it, he had help."
There's no way he's got the skills to break through AUTEC's firewall.
I found a post of his on a PC forum asking what a cookie is.
(laughs) Old people.
Old people entertain me.
"I can tell you Wickes didn't have the know-how to pull off this AUTEC job, either."
I think we're looking at a team.
So you determined from the interview that Wickes is involved?
(clears throat)
My findings were inconclusive.
GIBBS:
Any contact between Wickes and Ridgeway?
Not a peep out of Wickes since we let him go.
Wickes is a chess player.
It doesn't surprise me that he's taking some time before he makes his next move.
"McGee, get me a location on Ridgeway."
On it.
"DiNozzo, Ziva, get going."
"Oh, um, instead of"

"Yes, he is."
"Unless, of course, somebody blocks his view."
They're based on the Dominicans who fought for La Independencia.
- Los Gavilleros?
- Yeah.
They fought the US with a guerilla waftare for four years.
"For me, it's just another way of talking about sugar."
"That's what the Gavilleros were fighting over-- foreign companies buying property from people who don't even own it, then kicking the campesinos off their land."
"Anyway, that's how I got the concept for ""Europa."""

- I asked Daisy to marry me.
- Get the fuck outta here!
I asked her to marry me and she said yes.
I am high as a motheftucker right now.
"Dude, do you know what you're doing?"
Of course I know.
"I know I say shit sometimes, but that's just me being stupid."

"Now, I liked Eddie and I want to help you, but you got to help me."
What's that mean?
"An airplane ticket and $ 10,000."
"$ 10,000!"
"For God's sake, I can't..."
"- That's a lot of money, what've you got?"
- Who are you?
"Marybeth Cogan, Detectives Endowment Association."
I represent the Santos family.
What have you got?
I made the meeting for Eddie with Tino so he could give up what he knew about the judge.
And what was that?
"10,000 and a plane ticket."
I'll give you the destination later.
Your information is worthless unless I can bring a witness.
Which Zapatti are we meeting?
Paulie had two brothers.
"Tino was John's boy, Vinnie is Jimmy's."
So Vinnie and Tino are cousins?
"That's right, cousins."
They have cousins in Louisiana?
"Down there, we're all cousins."
"If you got a cousin, you got a vote."
Then why not run for office instead of carrying the mayor's bag?
I consider it an honor not only to carry his bag but also to fill it with things I think the city needs.
"Oh, the kingmaker."
The man behind the throne.
I'm beginning to suspect you don't like politicians.
You're no politician.
They run for office.
You're a walker.

But Tonraq isn't about to give up without a fight.
Dad's back!
Where's Jinora?
No!
"Her spirit is trapped in the spirit world, but she's going to be all right."
- How could this happen?
- It was all my fault.
I should have never let Jinora enter the spirit world without me.
I couldn't protect her.
"I'm so sorry, Pema."
"I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me."
"Don't worry, honey, I'm not going to stop until our little girl is back safe with us."

"""Ant-solutely"" delicious."
all night.
I couldn't care less.
"Lieutenant, I've been trying to figure out how much time Zucco had to plant this bomb."
Do you know what time he got here?
He got here about 8:00.
What time did he leave the store?
He was still there at 5:30 before Mr. Morgan left.
"That only gives him about, uh, two and a half hours."
That means this nut could've planted it anyplace...
"NewJersey, Riverdale, Staten Island!"
All right.
Here.
This is a list of addresses of these patients here.
I want you to call Explosives.
"Check out all their houses, okay?"
"Who knows, maybe one of these people got under Zucco's skin."
"Hey, it's possible, you know."
We're not dealing with what you call a rational person.
"There really is no need to check us out, Lieutenant."
He couldn't do it.
He loved us.
"We're a family, right?"
"Now, look."
I don't want to disturb your group.
"But maybe tonight, somebody's gonna get blown up who's got a nice family going for him."
"Now, did this Zucco complain about anybody or you complain to him, where he might have set off with another bomb?"
"Well, the only thing I talked to him about lately was baseball."
"I got him interested in the Mets, became their fan."
Strange.
He was never a fan before.
"How about you, Mrs. Holder?"
Anything mentioned about that divorce?
Swing by that diner up there.
The North Star.
Best Philly steak sandwiches in New York City.
Or do you call them Philadelphia steak sandwiches?
Who we gonna meet here?
What are you talking about?
You surface in front of my car at the cemetery.
You show just enough leg so I'd stop.
And the Grand Central is the long way around.
Who we gonna meet?
Albert Holly.
He was Eddie Santos' partner two years ago when Tino Zapatti got probation.
Thank you.
"Eddie got ahold of something, he wouldn't let go."
Eddie Santos was a pit bull.
"Pit bulls are ugly, but they're not stupid."
What was he doing without backup?
It wasn't the first time he'd taken Tino down.
He'd never had a problem with him before.
"Somehow, Tino must have got the drop on him."
It happens.
Why didn't he tell anyone he was going up there?
Because it was his collar.
"He made that case against Tino, then the judge went south."
There is no way Tino Zapatti could have walked two years ago unless...
... unlessinterestedparties...
... hadthejudgeintheirpocket.
Walter Stern is a jurist of national reputation.
I don't care if he's Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Somebody got to him.
And based on that one interview...
... youwereabletocome tothe conclusion stated in your testimony?
"I tried to stop my mother, but she insisted on giving an elopement party."
Which is a first for New Jersey.
I would be paranoid to assume the blue sedan was following Barbara and me.
There were plenty of other people on the bus.
But private investigators are paid to be paranoid.
So I made a mental note to check for the car when we came out.
I wonder if Barbara realized just how careful I was being on her behalf.
"- Yes, Mr. Masters?"
"- Hi, Higgins."
It's me.
"Magnum, why must you always call me on Robin Masters's private line... when there are four other perfectly good phone lines into the estate?"
"Well, it's the only number that I can remember."
"Um, Higgins, can I have the Ferrari?"
- You're asking?
- Of course I'm asking.
"This isn't like you, Magnum."
Not like you at all.
"Well, I..."
I need it delivered.
Delivered?
"Look, Higgins, I only have 24... 23 hours to solve this case that I'm on, and I can't do it riding around on a bus."
A bus?
You're on a case and you're riding on a bus?
"Don't laugh, Higgins."
Some of your best investigators use buses.
Buses can't be tailed.
You can always spot a tail when you're riding on a bus.
"Oh, Magnum!"
"This is too, too much."
"Just get me the Ferrari, Higgins."
I'm at...
Honolulu Lulu's.
"Oh, yeah."
Lightning's ready
Ka-chow!
Get your antenna balls here!
"Go, Lightnin'!"
- Whoo!
"- You got that right, slick."
Uh!
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
"I'm Bob Cutlass, here with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip."
We're midway through what may be an historic day for racing.
"Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof."
"If this gets more exciting, they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth!"
"Right, Darrell."
"Three cars are tied for the season points lead, heading into the final race of the season."
And the winner of this race will win the season title and the Piston Cup.
"Does The King, Strip Weathers, have one more victory in him before retirement?"
He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years!
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?
"And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks."
He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career.
Chick thought this was his year.
His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow.
But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!
"You know, I don't think anybody expected this."
The rookie sensation came into the season unknown.
But everyone knows him now.
Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?
"The legend, the runner-up, and the rookie!"
"Three cars, one champion!"
No you don't.
Eric sure is taking an awfully long time with those sodas.
[Laughing]
"I'm sure it's no reflection on you, Lance."
He probably just wants to make sure a good friend like you... gets the freshest soda available.
"I know Eric doesn't like me, Mrs. Forman."
I only came over for the chance to see my beautiful Donna.
And after I make my fortune in robots...
"I'm gonna come back to this Podunk town and buy whatever flour mill Eric is working at... fire him, and make Donna my wife."
You're a creepy kid.
You know that?
"Mrs. Forman, I think we both know the real reason you invited me over here."
"You're after Mother's coveted peach cobbler recipe, no?"
Your mom makes peach cobbler?
I had no idea.
"Please, let's speak frankly."
"I have something you want, and you have something I want."
W-We're not in a- in a position to just give you Donna.
We could give you Eric.
Mother tasted your stuffing at the Thanksgiving Turkey Trot... and ever since then she's wanted the recipe.
I've been instructed to arrange a swap.
Don't you have any weird friends to play with?
Friends are for the weak.
"Okay, you guys."
MeetJulie.
"She's got two horses, a brand-new Firebird... and her dad works for Six Flags!"
"[All] Hello, Julie!"
"Hey, Hyde."
Love your hair.
You can touch it if you want.
"Oh, get lost, skankoid."
We're all full.
"Damn, Jackie!"
- All began on the same day.
- Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
"From Latvia to Lithuania, from Estonia to Slovakia,"
"from Russia, from Poland to the Ukraine-- wherever we found them."
"250,000 blonde-haired, blue-eyed nuggets... harvested for the Third Reich."
"Nordic nuggets, to lighten up the dark Bavarians."
They took children from their parents?
They were misplaced Germans.
We brought them home.
( rhythmical resounding sound )
Eva:
"Look at you, posing for my camera, as if you didn't know I was there."
Hitler:
Do I look more mysterious in a hat?
( Eva giggles )
Eva:
Why did you never wear an official army
- SA or SS uniform?
- Better to remain undefined.
Suggestive indefiniteness.
There are so few public pictures of you smiling.
There were none before I was chancellor-- nor any with children or small animals.
The holiday in Iceland was a joyous time for my sisters and me.
You should have come with us.
You were always inspired by the Viking sagas.
The only flaw in the trip was a delay before we departed from Hamburg.
I had no time for holiday trips.
The police came just before we were to leave.
A family was removed from the ship.
- l'll never forget the cries--
The King and Queen of this year's Snowflake Ball are...
Harvey Kinkle and Sabrina Spellman!
(cheering)
Sabrina?
I thought dancing alone was embarrassing.
I can't believe she's missing this.
"Hello, um, I'm really grateful for the honor and all, but since Sabrina's disappeared, maybe you guys should pick somebody else."
SABRINA:
No!
Sabrina?
"Ow, my foot!"
Sorry.
"Dreama, do me a favor."
"Go onstage and stall them until I can find the camera, would you?"
"Okay, but only because people are starting to think I'm talking to myself."
SABRINA:
Here I am in my moment of glory and no one can see me.
Too bad I'm not a bigger fan of irony.
She's really levelheaded and pretty down to earth.
Is that girl talking about me?
"Yeah, I voted for Sabrina, too."
"I mean, she's nice and she definitely doesn't follow the pack."
"Oh, great, I dieted until I became invisible and spent a load of money on a dress and they voted for me because I don't normally do that."
I'm back.
All I needed to restore myself was a little self-esteem.
And I definitely don't need to diet.
"In fact, if I don't eat something,"
I'm going to keel over.
Mrs. Quick!
Sorry about your dress.
"Oh, that's okay."
"If you don't mind, I think I'll keep this for the next time I swell up."
-Excellent.
"A theorist named Zena sent us an old French map that has a bunch of locations that correspond to the island,"
-that are known.
-Okay.
And one of them that's unknown is a hatch.
"Themapis avery rudimentary sketch, if you will, of the island."
"You know, I mean, are we hoping that it's a trap door?"
- Absolutely.
But perhaps you have an explanation of it.
"And, really, the only way to do it is to set eyes on it, so..."
Yeah.
Why don't...
why don't we take a look.
Couldtheso-calledhatch reallybeevidence of an underground tunnel onOakIsland?

"It'dbeincredibly intriguing if he says,"
"""Youguysreallyare  onto something here."
"""It's a possibility that it's a shaft, a tunnel, aman-madeopeningtothearea below Oak Island."""
"Idon'tknowwhathe's gonna say, but perhaps he can give us some insight."
Just a hole in the ground.
It's odd.
"Has it collapsed in, did you say?"
- Some.
- Here's the thing.
"This is all flat, then sometime later,"
-all this earth goes somewhere.
-Yeah.
That's what puzzles us.
It's just not a natural phenomena.
-Yeah.
-I don't believe it.
-Definitely.
(Horn Honks)
"Well, I just saw Louis Bernard talking to that Arab."
- What Arab?
- The one that was shouting at Hank.
They were talking like they were dear friends.
"Well, he probably knew him before."
What does that mean?
It means that Mr Bernard is a very mysterious man.
What?
He seemed perfectly normal to me.
"Now, what do you really know about him?"
What do I - l know his name.
"We were sitting there, we were talking."
"You don't know anything about this man, and he knows everything about you."
"0h, wait."
"He knows that you live in Indianapolis, Indiana."
He knows you're a doctor at the Good Samaritan Hospital.
"He knows that you attended a medical convention in Paris, and that you stopped off in Rome, Lisbon and Casablanca."
Alright.
He knows that you served in North Africa in an army field hospital.
"Honey, it was just a casual conversation, that's all."
"Darling, you weren't just talking casually."
"He was asking all kinds of questions, and you were answering them."
You might as well have handed him your passport.
We just had a conversation.
I've got nothing to hide.
But I have a feeling that Mr Bernard has.
"I know this is mysterious Morocco, but we're not gonna lose our head, are we?"
- l know. I know what it is.
- What?
You're sore because this fella didn't ask you any questions.
"- 0h, hardy-har-har."
Among us...
Waiting
Don't believe in him and please don't meet him again
So he won't annoy you
The kids are sleeping.
Do you have any other order my Sultana?
Take a rest you too.
Sleep
I heard you were a cruel Barbarian
Now I see with my own eyes
You haven't seen anything yet
Don't be that sad
"Look, everyone treats us good"
He told me that I have seen nothing yet
Who?
That barbarian called Süleyman
He thinks I get above myself.
Who do you think he is ?
Sultan doesn't look as a terrible barbarian.
I was surprised
True
At least fire doesn't blow out of his eyes
But his tongue is poisoned
"Your Majesty, Hürrem Sultana is here"
Let her in
"Welcome my moon, my sun"
I can't close my eyes without seeing you
I'll visit Hatice tomorrow
I'll give her a gift
I'll give her the lucky amulet you gave m
That'd be good
Visit her more frequently.
I already know?
"Look, Mr. Sandover, I really didn't pay any attention to it after I saw your initials on it and your forwarding slip when you sent it on to the bank."
Let me try to remember.
There may have been some other smaller--
Mr. Sandover?
Get the bags.
"Beth, it's me."
Don't get all excited now.
"I just missed my train, that's all."
But I have something to attend to this evening.
I'm taking the car.
Missed the train?
"But that was hours ago, Sandy."
"For heaven's sake, what happened?"
"I'll explain later, dear."
I'll fly down to Phoenix in the morning instead.
- But Sandy--
"- Look, there's nothing to be alarmed about."
I thought you were going out to dinner with Dorothea this evening.
"Well, yes, but later, so I really wanted to use the car myself, but..."
Oh.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"- Sandy, this is Perry Mason."
- Oh.
"I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Sandover."
Your wife and I are very old friends.
"Yes, of course."
She's always talking about people she used to know when Mr. Devro was alive.
"Sandy, Perry was nice enough to come by on his way home from work to give me some professional advice."
"Oh, all right, Beth, if you're thinking of a divorce, that's no reason to call in such an expensive lawyer."
- Sandy!
- I never handle divorces.
This Thanksgiving is gonna be the worst!
You don't know that.
"The years my dad comes are great, and my mom years are disasters."
You should really try to appreciate the time you have with your mom.
Spoken like a man who drove his mother all the way to Oregon and enjoyed it.
"Well, our book club had just ended, and the last three books were set in the Pacific Northwest."
It just made sense.
I just want a peaceful Thanksgiving.
I have nothing to be thankful for!
Your three beautiful children are right here.
"Called to school by Dr. Ellie... great Special Ed teacher, terrible necklace-chooser."
Anna-Kat's behavior has been a little heightened lately.
She organized the stuffed animals by fur color.
Looks a little race-war-y.
Is anything going on at home?
Any changes?
"Well, her favorite toy pony, Frenchie..."
"Oh, I know about Frenchie's leg."
Mm.
Anything else out of the ordinary?
"Uh, the holidays can be stressful for parents, and sensitive kids can pick up on that."
My mother.
She's coming for Thanksgiving.
Ahh.
I-Is that complicated for you?
No.
It's pretty simple.
She's the worst.
My mom's the biggest narcissist on the planet.
She was a Pan Am stewardess back in the day when it meant something.
But was she there for me growing up?
No.
"- You're a class act, aren't you?"
- I'm a necessity.
Destroy the lives of innocent people just to keep me your slave.
Stop being so melodramatic.
You might learn to love me first.
"Well, what do you want?"
I want you to watch the undercover cop I mentioned to you.
His name is lain Risdale.
I think he was involved in the death of his commanding officer.
The man smells corruption.
"Things'll work out just fine, John."
One simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
"Ay, Papito, si."
"Duro, duro, duro."
More.
Ay delicioso!
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh, f..."
"- Oh, what did I tell you?"
- Si!
Si!
Si!
Si!
"- Oh, si!"
- Oh!
Police have arrested two Albanian men in connection with the murder of British businessman Jacob Gould.
Gould had stepped down from the day to day running of his shipping and cargo businesses after being linked with the illegal arms trade.
"Police confirmed that Mr Gould was being investigated by undercover officers as part of Operation Merlin, targeting gun-running networks in Britain."
There was also speculation that the killing could be linked to an attempt by Albanian mafia to control gun-running in London.
- Where are you from again?
- Hampshire CID.
-But I'm going just the same.
Stay here!
"You belong here, both of us, together!"
-We've been friends ever since...
"-Good-bye, Selena."
But your mother?
How can you leave her alone?
Mother's always been alone.
"Oh, Selena... I cried all the way to New York... and my eyes were the color of the oak leaves... that had started to fall back home."
"For days, I struggled to keep alive... and I shivered with loneliness in the back room of nowhere."
There were times when lwanted to crawl home... but somehow I managed and I stayed.
I learned what I could endure.
But none of us in New York or in Peyton Place... could guess how much would be demanded of us that winter... of deep despair.
I knew families at home would be getting up on frosty mornings... driving their sons to a place of hurried good-bye.
I prayed forthem.
"Come on, fellows, get your last cup of civilian coffee."
That army stuff is used for waterproofing shingles.
That's what I heard.
Make yourself.
-Take a cup.
-Did you hear what Norman Page did?
"-Yeah, became the first 4-F in town."
"-No, he enlisted in the paratroopers."
-No kidding!
-Our Norman?
-Norman Page?
-He volunteered.
The paratroopers.
It's the funniest thing I've heard in years.
Maybe they'll drop his mother with him.
"She'd kill 1,OOO Japanese before letting one touch her little boy."
Brought you a donut.
Get him on the truck.
Yeah.
Go.
it's all right.
24.
You're healing.
Just breathe.
by any measure.
"Oh, I used to do this as an extension of my hobby."
"I wrote stories that I thought were fun to read, and it felt good to have everyone else read and enjoy them."
But now...
I need money.
It's a commonplace reason.
"Isn't that okay, though?"
That's an ordinary reason for someone who writes for a living.
"If it leads to your motivation, I don't care what it is."

"If they ain't got your back, and you find you somebody else, 'cause it--"
She--she done been up there.
Look.
I'm saying--I'm gonna show you how she ain't have my back.
"I'm gonna tell you, okay?"
"We're in the Bahamas, people."
Physically how she didn't have my back.
We're in the Bahamas.
"Now, I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing, swimming."
I said I shouldn't be doing it.
I didn't say I couldn't do it.
I said I shouldn't have been doing it.
"I was in the water, swimming."
I swam all the way out to where the buoys were.
"I was just swimming like, ""A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha."""
"I looked in the water, and I seen this big brown thick thing with fins and teeth coming towards my pinky toe."
"Oh, it was a shark."
I kid you not.
"And I was trying to get her attention, because when you're in a relationship and you're in danger, you're supposed to have safety signals amongst one another that you can read, right?"
"So I went just like this, ""Unh, unh, unh."""
"That means, ""Bitch, get the lifeguard."""
That's what that means.
"But she ain't understand it, right?"
So she's on the shore thinking I'm swimming fast for her benefit.
"So she's like, ""Whoo, yes!"
"Baby, go faster!"""
"Whoo!"""
"That's how she sounds, I swear to God."
"""Whoo!"""
"I got back to the shore, I was like,"
"""Excuse me, did you not realize."
"""I almost got killed by a shark?"

I was holding the cycle for you to learn
-Who will teach me then?

I will give you a list of things I can ride

"Trusting you, if I ride and suppose if you.."

It was Henry's first tea of the day.
"Ground hemlock is brown, Henry's teacup was brown."
The powder could have been placed in his cup earlier that morning and George wouldn't have noticed.
"So in theory, anybody could have done it?"
I need to find Iris Lightman.
"Her anger when Henry refused to help her expose the ""Max"" character was palpable."
"What about Edie, with all her money worries?"
"She's hasn't exactly been all sweetness and light, has she?"
What did happen to all that cash that Edie's father had?
Vernon had money?
"Oh, yeah."
He made an absolute fortune on the black market during the war.
I had no idea.
"Sid, I've got a small job for you."
I want you to find out who Vernon's solicitor was.
"Sidney, your nails are filthy."
"You know me, Mrs M, always happy to get my hands dirty."
Ta-ta.
He's helping Edie out in her garden.
Sidney Carter in a garden!
She needs all the help she can get.
Which is why I've decided to enter best bouquet in the flower competition on her behalf.
You?
You're serious?
Perfectly.
A first prize could be very good publicity for her right now.
First prize?
I did flower arranging at finishing school.
I doubt you've ever read Constance Spry.
"No, I have not, and neither has the Father."
"Fortunately, he and I are of one mind when it comes to the floral aesthetic."

She had to stand and walk about in a trench.
"The interesting thing about Alan Ladd was he was only, like, four foot three, but it was all his legs that were short."
"Like, his trunk was normal."
"- Sat down, he was taller than most people."
- Is that true?
Good heavens.
"But when he stood, yeah, they had to put him on a little apple crate."
I never know with you.
That's what's so worrying.
"- No, it's absolutely true."
- (laughter)
"Alan Ladd was to recall working with Sophia Loren in Boy on a Dolphin, that ""Working with her was like being bombarded by watermelons""."

"This was Lou's only major building in Philadelphia, and I wanted to like it."
But I had to agree it was kind of disappointing.
"Around this time, an article appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer about my search."
"It quoted me as saying that I wanted to hug my father's buildings, which was very embarrassing, but it stirred things up."
"I got several letters, including one from a relative of Lou's who was a rabbi."
He said that he'd officiated at Lou Kahn's funeral and Lou Kahn didn't have a son.
Hello?
- Is this Rabbi Kramer?
- Yes.
"Yeah, hi."
This is Nathaniel Kahn calling.
"God in heavens, the whole world opened up, my friend."
What are you talking about?
"I mean, gosh, I've been raising hell with the Inquirer."
"I said, ""Find that man."""
You're raising hell with the Inquirer?
- Why are you doing that?
"- To find you, sir."
"Oh, well, I'm glad you did find me."
"Look, don't forget Lou Kahn's my first cousin."
Lou Kahn is your first cousin?
And my parents was his godparents.
"Wow, I didn't know that."
"Well, I knew Lou very well."
"With all due respect, I hear Lou fooled around."
"Well, you know..."
"Anyway, I'm here, so that's a good thing."
What would you do with the film once you...
"Oh, it'll be on... it'll be on TV, you know."

"..like a magic for me, Tabbassum."
"Ok, Mr. Krishna, it is said that behind.."
"..every successful man, there is someone."
Today you are shining like a star in the sky of prosperity.
Can I know who the one behind all this is?
"There are many people, but my sir is the most important one."
Sir!
"Mr. Krishna, our audience would.."
..definitely like to know..
"I would Iike to tell everyone, Tabbassum."
Sir.
This is the name I worship before worshipping God.
Because God gives and then takes it back..
..but my sir hasjust given me.
"Today, even though I am away from him.."
..but because of his blessings..
..today thousands of people and watching my show.
Even my sir might be watching this show.

"You ain't never turned to Animal Planet and seen a polar bear with a down jacket on, have you?"
"""Don't talk about the baby."""
"And it messes you up too, 'cause some people put their dogs in strollers."
"So you be expecting to see a little one-year-old, but you go up to the stroller and you see this shit right here."
"""What up, nigga?"""
What?
The hell you doing in here?
You got four legs.
"Walk, motherfucker!"
"""Don't talk about the baby."
"Not the baby."""
That reminds me of The Wolf of Wall Street.
Y'all seen that movie?
"Now, uh, first off, Margot Robbie, the main chick in that movie, uh, she can get the dick."
"That's my woman crush Wednesday every damn Wednesday, I'm telling--"
"She, ""Mommy doesn't feel like wearing any more panties."""
"And I said, ""I agree with you."
"Yeah, you shouldn't."""
"But the part that that reminded me of in the movie was the part where Mr. Jordan,"
"Leonardo DiCaprio, is in the car with his daughter, and he tries to run."
You know what I mean?
He tries to get out of there.
But he hits the tree.
"And that's not a funny situation, 'cause putting a little kid in that situation, that's not safe."
But what was funny was the caretaker that they had.
You know what I mean?
"That Black lady that they had working, the nanny, when she came out, she was like,"
"""Oh, Lord!"
Get the baby!
"""Oh, Lord!"
"But, look, if you don't get ahold of Alice and get the recipe, how you gonna sell this stuff?"
- What are you gonna do?
-Very simple.
The first thing I gotta do is get some financial backing.
"Now, tomorrow when I go to work, I walk right in to Mr. Marshall."
"Mr. Marshall, the president of your bus company?"
"Why, certainly."
He's a swell guy.
"Last year, for instance, there was some guy named, uh..."
"Herman Fatrack, and he had some kind of an invention."
"It was, uh, a wrench lock."
"Well, he took it in to Marshall, showed it to Marshall,"
"Marshall liked it, gave him some money and now he's got a whole factory going for himself."
Called Fatrack's Factory.
"Not bad, not bad, Ralph."
"But have you got an idea on how to present this, uh... this, uh, stuff here to your boss?"
I don't need any idea.
I'll do the same thing we did.
I'll let him taste it.
He'll be sold on it just like we were.
"Now, soon as he puts the money in my company and Alice knows that my boss has got money in this thing, she'll be proud to give me the recipe."
"Ralph Kramden, I got to take my hat off to you."
"Now, let's see."
We got to get some kind of a name for this.
Yeah.
How about this?
Kramden's Delicious...
"Now, wait, ho."
Wait a minute.
"What do you mean, ""Kramden's Delicious...""?"
Mr. Marshall is putting up the money for this thing.
You got to get his name in there someplace.
I would've expressed my love for you...
Still I'm found at fault...
Is that my mistake?
"When you come after me, I feel angry..."
"When I don't see you around, I go mad about you..."
My heart rages in fire...
Time has no medicine to cure my heart...
"You fight with your conscious everyday, dear..."
What will your arrogance achieve?
Nothing wrong to accept your love...
"Stop fighting, sweetheart..."
Don't you like my arrogance?
"Daddy, I want to talk you urgently."
I'm in an important meeting.
Talk to me later.
No dad.
Ministers Malaysia programme got confirmed on November 8th.
They have come there on an official visit.
The clue 'LOSER' was given to me on November 9th.
Ministers Malaysia programme got confirmed on November 8th.
"So, he already knew about Ministers programme."
There is some link between their programme  his plan.
What are these Ministers doing in Malaysia?
Ministers are planning something unofficial here.
"Banerjee, we earned 300 crores cheating people  doing all the wrong deeds."
We struggled had to turn this money into dollars.
Your 300 crores is the first investment for the hotels we are going to start.
Big money will change hands.
He has come here to rob that money.
"If he had come here months before, he must've planned it well."
He must've planned a game.
There is a link between Ministers  my uncle.
"Since I'm going to church again, it's the same church that sponsors the nursery where you work, it's just..."
"It's really difficult to make friends because people are totally prejudiced against Christians, so I just thought maybe we could be friends."
But we're already friends.
"Great, let's hang out, let's do something tonight."
"Grace, I have a baby."
I have John.
"And by the time the church nursery closes and I get him home and I bathe him and feed him and put him to bed and do my homework, it's, like, 11:00 and I have a husband, so..."
I don't really have time to hang out with you or with any of my other friends.
What if I came over and I help you with John and we did our homework together?
And that would free you up for more friend time.
"Well, it's just that Ricky is in the apartment trying to study at the same time."
"Then I'll bring Jack, too."
"I mean, maybe the four of us can be friends."
"Thanks, Amy."
That's a great idea.

"Hey, what's up?"
Everything okay?
Grace wants to come over with Jack tonight.
For what?
"Just to hang out, be friends."
What?
My dad and Grace's mom want Grace and me to be friends.
What does that have to do with Jack and me?
"Well, Jack is Grace's boyfriend and you're my husband, so..."
So what?
"So, got roped into doing this tonight and I'd like you to go along with it."
"Hey, Ricky!"
Are you coming in for a coffee?
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
Okay.

And the people who get my name wrong the most are white people.
And I don't want to make it a race thing.
But...
Numbers are in.
Studies have shown that the demographic that consistently gets my name wrong are Caucasian.
"I did this show once, and the host was white, and probably still is."

Kept saying things like Shasheer or Saheer and moving letters around in my name and attacking it like a Sudoku puzzle.

"And Emily, she's a very beautiful girl."

-What made you make such a guess?
"- The place is called Zabolotye, isn't it?"
-Yes.
- This is where he was killed during World War I.
"Afellow villager came back from that war and told us that it happened near a city of Kaza, a marsh, a small river."
Everything seems to fit the description.
I neverthought I'd find his grave.
"And if it is true, eh?"
The family's fate has brought me to this hill...
There are a few mortar squads to the south ofthese pines.

- You sure it was from her?
- Positive.
"The wire came from Honolulu, and she's the only Diane I've ever known."
Did she ask for money?
Diane would never do that.
Things were different between us.
She was different.

We were married.
I don't care how long ago it's been.
Diane would never blackmail me.
"I don't understand the problem, sir."
Why don't you call the president and accept the nomination?
I don't dare take the chance.
- When's the last time you saw her?
- A few hours before the Japanese... bombed Pearl Harbor.

This team's not the Colts.
"The Colts are in the NFL, these... whoevers, they're in the Canadian Football League."
I find the CFL's game very entertaining.
It's a souped-up version of the American classic.
"The field is what, 120 yards long, with 35 yard in-zones, that's not a football field, Munch, that's the golf course at Oakmont Green."
"Their game's for speed and mobility, not three yards in a cloud of dust."
"I say, if you're gonna imitate an American sport, do it like Americans."
They don't wanna play our game.
That's why they invented their own.
"Then let them play it, but we're in America."
"I mean, we shouldn't be playing their version here."
That's a sacrilege.

Run to your main Sultana
My son
My Mehmet
What's wrong?
Why are you sad?
I went to mosque with my father
How nice!
"But everyone said "" long live Mustafa "" Noone said anything for me"
They don't know you yet my son
You are little yet
"But when they recognise you, they'll shout out your name the most"
İbrahim will teach Mustafa Italian
I wanted to learn too.
But he said no
Don't be sad my lion
Your mother will teach you everything
Go inside now
The most unique of the Sultanas.
May you order
Order what?
You said to Esma that you want to say something
My Sultana you told me to have my eyes opened and to inform you if I hear anything important
Say it
A huge grant is given to Maidevran Sultana to do charity work
Mahidevran Sultana will have buildings built.
"Hans, baths, fountains"
She's giving out gifts to concubines
Is it Valide Sultana's order?
I'll take care of it my Paşa.
Don't you worry
"But Sümbül Ağa, in silence.."
Right?
Mustafa go to your room.
It is late
We have things to discuss with your mother
"Mahidevran, I'm very pleased of how you raise Mustafa"
Your effort on raising him as a prince is great
"I'm doing my best, your Majesty"
I'll keep the honory of being graced by you all my life
About the things I want to discuss with you ...
I'm all ears your Majesty
"As a Haseki and mother of a prince, I am granting you a plenty of spending money to do charity anywhere in any way you want"
You make me happy your Majesty
Thanks to you I'll get countless of prayers
It is like you have given me the paradise
May God bless you
I'm going.
Have a good night
"What is it, Nasuh Efendi?"
You seem so troubled
It is nothing my Bey.
We are having fun
"Come on, welcome"
Is it that you are in love?
How can I fall in love My Bey?
I'd recognise a man in love even if I see him in the darkness
Obviously you have a heartache
"Diamond cut diamond, Nasuh Efendi"
Wine won't heal your wound
A human can heal
"Searcher, this is Captain Rogers:"
You got anything for us yet?
Over:
"[Man] Admiral, Captain Rogers requesting communication:"
"Thank you, Parsons:"
Put Captain Rogers on the vid-screen:
[Asimov] Dr:
Goodfellow has just completed his review of that ancient star chart:
"Ah, yes, dear boy:"
I'll tell you something:
I got into the chart here:
The planet you're now surveying was once inhabited: : :
By a highly advanced race known as the Goral:
The Goral were indigenous to that planet:
"That is, until they left their world in a strange mass exodus:"
"Oh, it must've been 10,000 years ago:"
- Does that planet have a name?
- A name?
"I should say it has, Buck:"
It's called Vor-Deeth:
D-double E-T-H:
Vor-Deeth?
That's right:
Crichton was good enough to translate it for me:
"Apparently, it means ""Planet of Death:"""
"Oh, terrific:"
You got any other cheery information for us?
Buck:
"Hold on, Doctor:"
We got some visual contact:
Looks like some kind of ruins:
"Ruins, did you say?"
"""True Lord, but what is the mistake of that new born in this"""
He is crying at your feet- lnnocent  refugee won't be punished.
He will be definitely protected.
Whose child is crying in the temple?
Who has left him?
What a heartless mother who has left her child in this isolated place.
Can a mother be like this?
"""Son, why are your crying?"
"Your mother will come just now"""
Whose son is this?
Where are you leaving your dear son?
Speak up.
Who is the mother of this child?
I got this boy here.
I don't know who he is or his mother.
"""You seem to belong here, tell me about this boy."""
"""Devi, Now, you are only his mother"
"- Me  his mother."""
I don't know who he is.
-He is the son of late king Satyavrath who left Shiv's Pradosh worship in the middle
And hence had to face death.
But this boy will prove to be your good fortune
Now give him motherly love and bring him up along with your son
I was searching for a long time for a holy man like you.
I have'nt named my son yet and call him Lalla only.
"""Please name him, Maharaj"""
Creator seems to have sent me here to name both your sons
"""Name them, Maharaj"
"- Your elder son's name will be Suchivrat"""
Suchivrat-And the one on your lap will be Dharmakunt
You won't have any difficulty in bringing up these two sons
"""By your mercy  help, my great work is done, Maharaj"""
You've got the truth.
I don't have the truth.
You'd be amazed at how attractive
-- the truth can be sometimes.
-
- Not f or a woman.
-
- You'r e wrong.
-
"- The truth is,"
"I have a job that involves me and stimulates me and r ewards me and takes up a lot of my time, and I'm not willing to do my job just a little bit."
I want to do all of it.
"It's part of me, and I am diff er ent without it, and that is who I am, and that is who you need to love."
-
- Ex cept it won't work.
-
"- Yes, it will."
It won't!
-
- Say it just like that.
-
- It won't.
"Dana, any man who hears that and doesn't say,"
"""For a woman like you, f or a person -- f or you,"
"""I will take whatever time you can give me and be gratef ul f or that all my lif e."""
[ Indistinct voices ]
Any man who hears that and doesn't throw you down on the near est flat surf ace
-- [ Laughs ] -- is just taking up space f or the r est of us.
And you shouldn't need Natalie to shove you in her e anytime you want to talk about something.
She didn't shove me in her e.
Kim:
"Five minutes to air, please."
"All I know is I joined this army to kill Johnny Rebs, and so far, I ain't even seen one."
You've been lucky.
"It's all right, Bill."
I know him.
"Glad to see you, Mr. Andrews."
What's your regiment doing this far south of Nashville?
General Buell moved out with most of the army to reinforce Grant.
There's a big fight shaping up around Corinth.
I probably don't have to tell you.
I didn't know Buell was gone.
Who's in command here now?
General Mitchell.
He's madder than a wet hen to be left behind.
So were we.
- Why are you left behind?
- To guard Nashville.
"It's nice to talk with you again, Corporal."
"Mr. Andrews... if you ever want help on a Secret Service mission, don't forget the name Pittenger."
William Pittenger.
"In all of East Tennessee, there's no concentration of Confederate forces worth the mention."
The Southern army at Knoxville is barely able to defend the city
- from Union General Morgan.
- What about Chattanooga?
Buell was certain a great army was gathering there.
"General Mitchell, there are only 2,000 raw recruits in Chattanooga, and another 2,000 that aren't even armed!"
"Here we wait with 10,000 choice troops under strict orders to guard Nashville."
"If only I'd been given some latitude, I'd march right into Chattanooga."
- Wouldn't that be defending Nashville?
"- Yes, by George!"
"As long as I keep the enemy in front of me, Nashville will be fully protected."
But I don't want Chattanooga unless I can hold it.
It might be two weeks before Buell could reinforce me.
Ooh!
Splendid!
"Positively splendid, Buck:"
"Now, I'll tell you what:"
Go down:
"For heaven's sake, go down, take a look, won't you?"
Yes:
It's entirely possible that the Goral...
[Wilma] Buck?
My photon sensor registers an energy reading:
It's got to mean that a fusion-powered ship is nearby:
"We've got visual contact on it, Wilma:"
"Searcher, we got a wrecked ship below:"
We're going down:
"All right, Buck, but be cautious:"
The name of that planet doesn't exactly fill me with confidence:
"Don't worry, Admiral, we will:"
Rogers out:
It's pretty badly banged up:
Took some fancy flying to set this thing down in a clearing this size:
I'll say:
It's an E:
D:
S: -104:
Hello!
Is anybody here?
"By Gideon's trumpet, a human voice!"
I never thought anyone would show up:
"I heard your engines, but I thought it was a flyby:"
The name's Reardon:
I fly interplanetary:
Quadrant 8:
Perfect.
- What's her name?
- Maria Concetta.
Before continuing with this simple meal...
"I'd like to say, Mrs. Wyatt, on behalf of all of us... we have a great debt to repay you."
"Your presence at this table, tonight... serves as a reminder that we must win this war as soon as... possible so we can go back to the women we love."
"Mrs. Wyatt, it's a pleasure to have you with us."
Thank you.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
This place is magnificent.
Who does it belong to?
The princess of Toledo.
Captain Malaparte knows all the princesses in Europe.
- Isn't that right Captain?
"- Not all of them, thank god."
"But Captain, you must surely know..."
Princess Carmela Esposito.
She was my best friend in school.
- Esposito?
- Princess Carmela Esposito.
"Princess Carmela Esposito, Mrs. Wyatt, is an impostor."
- What was that Captain?
- Princess Esposito doesn't exist.
"""Esposito"" is a name given to children... abandoned at hospices."
"Sadly, there are more ""espositos"" in Naples than ever."
"Well, all I know is that my friend..."
Princess Carmela Esposito lives in a palace in Rome.
Our State Department tells me... that she was always an anti-fascist and I plan on visiting her.
"If she's an anti-fascist, I'd say that that's proof... that she's not a princess."
"If what you're saying is true, Captain... then there were many other people in Cambridge... who were greatly decieved... which doesn't reflect well on the Italian people."
"In Philadelphia, our Italian community is among the best."
"Very well, Captain, very well."
She wanted me to fuck off.
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
"BUZZER Well, that sound tells me it's the end of the round and the end of the show, which means the final scores are,"
"Rob, Ellie, and Richard have no points,"
"Aisling, Jessica, and David have five points!"
That means we're the winners!
It's Pointless.
LAUGHTER
"Which means, because this is the studio where they record Pointless, that you are the winners."

LEONARDO DICAPRIO:
My first visual memories are of this framed poster above my crib.
I would stare at it every night before I went to bed.
My father was an underground comic distributor.
He's always been this sort of Zelig of the counterculture as I like to call him.
"Having painted in Warhol's studio, being roomies with Lou Reed, he knew R. Crumb and all these great artists of his generation."
"I mean, I was brought up on all kinds of wacky visuals as a kid."
So I would stare at this painting over and over:
The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch.
It was painted around 1500.
"And if you look at these panels long enough, they start to tell a story."
In the first panel you have Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.
"Birds flying off into the distance, elephants and giraffe and a lot of religious iconography."
The second panel is where it starts to become more interesting.
"Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite"
(Take me down) Take me down into your paradise
(Don't be scared) Don't be scared cause I'm your body type
"Just something that we wanna try (wanna try) Cause you and I (you and I), we're cool for the summer"
(Take me down) We're cool for the summer (Don't be scared) Cause I'm your body type

I'd never want to hurt you.
"The first few years, I couldn't bear to be touched."
Talking was torture because of the burns.
"But I adapted, learned to communicate with the tools at hand."
"I think she deserves the crown for having the most boring, awkward life anyone could ever have."
"Cos her life is basically just like an endless string of uncomfortable social situations, isn't it?"
"It's just like, she's gotta go to hospital, she's gotta shake strangers' hands."
She's got to talk to other people's kids.
Have you ever had to talk to other people's kids?
They are really boring.
"Do you know, I read a thing about Queen the other day, that when she does the State Opening of Parliament, she has to practise doing it, she isn't allowed to wear the proper crown because it has the Tower of London,"
so apparently she practises with a bag of flour on her head.
"I was like, surely she's got enough money to get a fake crown made, rather than just using things from the Ocado shop."
Or Burger King.
Or just use a corgi.
Or she might be a massive cokehead and pretending it's flour.
"""See that?"""
"""Oh, what's that?"
"I've just been practising me flour head again."""
I think it's time for a bit of rebellion.
She hasn't beheaded anyone once.
She's a British monarch.
They should give her that for her next birthday.
She should just be allowed one kill.
Who would you nominate?
"Oh, um..."
Jamie Oliver's wife.
Jules?
Not Jules!
"Poor Jules, sat at home watching this."
Just got the kids off to sleep.
"Better go and check on Spaghetti Pete, see if he's all right."
Better go and check on Spaghetti Pete!
"One of their kids is not called Spaghetti Pete, you made that up."
"In my head, I've gotta tell you, yeah, he's got a kid called Spaghetti Pete."
Let's have a look and see if the Queen is up there.

"""You are here, Narad-Then, where should I be?"""
You keep spreading Brahma leela  Shiv Leela.
"""Now when Shiv Leela is at its peak, you should also be there"""
I am coming from there only to learn from you as to what will be ultimate result of the war between Shiv  Jalandhar
You have erred like this many times.-What is that?
T o talk  think like an ignorant though you are a scholar
"""What did I do like that?"
"-Ask yourself, and not me"""
"""When lion  deer or mountain treefight,whowillwin? """
"""That means, Lord Shiv will only win."""
Your thoughts and words were without reason.
How long can a demon stand before Lord Shiv?
This delay is due to Vrinda's devotion.
The war is actually taking between Jalandhar's irreligion and Vrinda's sacredness
And Jalandhar is getting his strength from Vrinda's devotion
"""Always one in the path of wrong deeds, only feels he is winning..."""
...but has not won till today and will not do so in the future
"""From the beginning of creation, by the laws of nature, Creator..."""
...has written only defeat in the fate of one following irreligion.
"""Mother, I am satisfied."
"Father, I have the answer to my question"""
"""Swami!"

"""Has Swami returned from the war?"

--It was Vasin's idea...
--And now it was more appropriate to give the owners some time
"Understood, Igor Igor'evich"
--Zinaida Petrovna --Yes
--Immediately halt the demolition of garages --Is that an order?
Consider it an order
Pavel Ivanovich had asked that such an order must be in writing
What for?
Starting a paper trail?
There's a paper shortage in our country as it is.
To have an official document for why those wrecks are still standing
"Alright, I'll get you a written document"
--Hello --One minute
--Hello --Is this the communal department?
--Yes --I'm calling about the garage
"Comrades, your children will play on green grass in that spot"
--One minute please --This garage hardly bothers anyone
I'm not authorized to change the management's decision
So sorry
What's this I hear about our Vasin going rabid mad?
I told you he was kicked out of the house
"Last night called me all enraged, asking who I lived with, and could he spend the night over"
"Please stop your gossip, nobody wants to know that"
Don't shout at me
I told you that this is all under Sorokin's authority
Yes.
Hello?
"Pavel Ivanovich, is it true what they say that now all dogs will be walked behind the far lake?"
--They will --How will they get there?
"--Individually, or on an express bus?"
--They'll get their on their own
--Go straight here --I'll take Lomonosov str.
"Madigan, and Tbe Invasion of tbe Body Snatcbers, of course which is one of the great B-movies of all time."
Don SiegeI was a montage director at Warner Brotbers in tbe '40s.
"Tbe montages, tbe passage of time, tbat sort of tbing."
"For montages, you bad to be very clear about tbe images and very precise because it bad to tell a Iot in 10 or 15 seconds."
"In fact, He did the montages in casablanca."
"THen by train, or auto, or foot across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in french Morocco."
Don SiegeI was almost tbe last of a certain kind of breed of directors.
He did what one would call B-budget movies.
Baby Face nelson.
"Taut little movies done in a very lean, efficient style."
"I tbougbt: ""well, tbls'II be fun."""
He seems to know bis stuff and so we went abead and made tbe movie.
Tbis isn't tbe O.K. corral around bere.
Tbis is tbe city of New York.
We've got a system.
"Not mucb, but we're fond of it."
We don't like it wben some two-for-a-nickeI cowboy tbinks be can bend it out of sbape.
Coogan's bluff was a stepping stone into the modern world.
It was a little bit of a Western cbaracter but contemporary.
"Tben be goes to New York and in a sense it is, I tbink, almost a precursor of tbe Dirty Harry cbaracter."
Looking for Jimbo?
Don Siegel invited me to come by tHe set of Coogan's bluff.
And I Hung around late into the night watching them work.
He moved fast.
He was used to moving fast doing small budget pictures on tight schedules.
One thing struck me very noticeably.
"I'd been around enough sets to know that this was unusual which was that the star, Clint Eastwood, never left the set between setups."
He never went to His trailer or went to tbe pbone or wbatever.
He just bung around and watcbed.
Eastwood observed Siegel as intently as He Had observed Leone.
But He would learn even more from Siegel.
He became Eastwood's most important mentor.
Does Valide Sultana know about them?
No
If my Valide sees them she'd be upset

What language is this?

"Then, who wrote the book in your hands?"
"Eflatun, I mean Plato wrote it"

"They wanted a useful Scottish king, who would visit Scotland more than once a decade, who understood the Presbyterian Kirk."
They wanted everything that Charles was not.
So Warriston made a suggestion.
They should rewrite him.
"This was their rewritten king, the National Covenant of 1638, drafted by Warriston with the help of the leading minister of the day,"
Alexander Henderson.
It was addressed to an idealised Charles I who already understood his duties as a Presbyterian king.
"It was addressed, in other words, to a king who didn't exist."
"In carefully respectful terms, it attacked all the changes that Charles had made, and everything he stood for."
"It demanded a monarchy limited by a constitution, limited in power, limited by laws."
"The Covenant was a contract between three parties - the King, whose task was the defence of the Presbyterian Kirk, the people, and God himself."
"It was called the Covenant as a reference to the Old Testament, to the Covenant made by God with his chosen people."
"In the Old Testament, the chosen people had been the Jews."
"But it was and is an article of Christian faith that the coming of Christ, and his death on the cross, changed the Covenant."
God's chosen people now were Christians.
The National Covenant of 1638 went a bit further.
"God's chosen people were the faithful members of the most perfect Church on the face of the Earth, the Scottish Presbyterian Kirk."
"A meeting was scheduled here, at Greyfriars Kirk in Edinburgh, for the 28th February 1638."
"The Covenant was signed by 3,250 people."
"Warriston signed it himself, and in his diary that evening he wrote,"
"""This is the glorious marriage day of the Kingdom with God."""
Copies were sent to every parish in Scotland.
"One Sunday in March, Warriston took his family to a kirk south-west of Edinburgh."
It was a chance to see how the Covenant was being received outside the city.
The minister explained the Covenant.
The congregation sat unmoved.
Then the minister asked them to stand and swear their Covenant to the Almighty God.
The congregation rose to their feet.
They raised their hands.
"They broke down, they wept, they testified."
The minister was almost suffocated by his own tears.
They swore their Covenant with God.
I swore by the body of the Ming Cult leader to serve the Ming Cult

Even heroes have to succumb to love and hate
Not even the Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre can disentangle love and hate
Hatred in the sea of love
Regrets in this life filled with resentment and love who can answer what is love and hate
Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre are legendary weapons in the martial arts world
They were created by
Guo Jing and wang Yung
The legend says that at the end of the Sung dynasty
Guo Jing and wang Yung guarded the xian Yang which fell to the enemy's hands
Knowing there was no further hope before their anticipated deaths
They secretly sought a famous sword smith using the hardest quartz available on earth to amalgamate with hero Guo's heavy sabre to create the Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre
"As a result for hundreds of years martial artists wanted to find out the secret and possess these weapons, to be the best of all"
The Heaven Sword had been hidden with the
Er Mei School by heroine Guo while the Dragon Sabre drifted from one place to other
Our story follows the route to finding the Dragon Sabre
"At the end of the Sung dynasty, a powerful cult arose"
It was called the Ming Cult
This cult originated from Persia ...and came into China
The key person in our story is one of the four chiefs of the cult
Golden haired lion Tse Shun
"His wife and daughter were raped and killed by his teacher, Shing Kwun, which drove him to madness"
"This drove him to kill many innocent people, including ...many on the wang Puen Mountain"
He unintentionally snatched the Dragon Sabre from the Hoi Sha clan
Another character in the story is wu Ji the son of Chang Tsui San of wu Dong
Chang couple  Tse Shun became sworn brother  sister and made a retreat at lce Fire Island
Subsequently Chang and his wife because of quarrels with other clans committed suicide
Thus Chang wu Ji remained as the only one who knew where the Dragon Sabre and Tse Shun was when our story begins
Chang was injured by the Freezing Palm
Chang San Fang brought him to Shaolin for treatment but was unsuccessful
The two were spending the night at the pier
Suddenly...
Stop
He is tall handsome guy.
Is it not enough?
I am not able to understand you.
"Mother, is it proper to teach her all this things?"
You shut up.
The society has changed.
You are an old woman by birth.
Do you think he will meet you again?
My friend rain will take care of that.
It will unite us.
None of the cards are useful.
When you dont have luck how can you win?
Show.
- What?
- Show.
My score is 60.
What about you?
50.
- What about you?
- Ten.
What is this?
Are you trying to cheat us?
"Do you know, here people will bash you if you try to cheat."
Is it new for me?
Just joking.
Distribute once again.
I will have the show and pay you.
Are you trying to fool us?
Give the money.
I dont have any.
I have given all of them to you only.
Dont try to scare me.
- So?
I didn't realise whether it was a cow or a bull.
Why?
Was the bull wearing pants that you couldn't find out?
You fool.
Go and get betel leaf for me.
I am in the mood for betel leaf today.
"Father, money?"
I gave you 10 rupees in the morning.
I.. lent it.. to friend?
On what interest rate?
- One..
One percent.
None.
If you don't get the money in 24 hours.. ..then I will recover the money by selling you off?
"But father, who will purchase me?"
Quiet.
Get out.
You fool.
Who are you?
10 rupees.
And 50 paise interest.
But how can I take this?
I can't accept this?
- Keep it.
Everything I own belongs to you as well as me.
"No, no, no, no, no.."
"You shouldn't touch my feet, da.."
Kishen.
I suggest you accompany me to my restaurant.
I will treat you to a cup of tea.
Or let's go to my place.
Just wait.
Woman:
Here father.
(Man:
Is it clean?) Woman:
"Yes, of course."
Man:
Then do as I tell you.
Fold the sari into eight folds.
Woman:
"All right, father."
Man:
"And you, you count that she does it right."
(Boy:
"All right, grand-dad.)"
Man:
"One, two, three, four folds we make."
All the germs from the water we take.
Chorus:
"One, two, three, four folds we make."
All the germs from the water we take.
"Five, six, seven, eight folds we make."
Our drinking water safe we make.
"Five, six, seven, eight folds we make."
Our drinking water safe we make.
Woman:
"Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari."
Man:
So this is the cotton sari.
And through this we will have clean water.
(Applause)
I think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.
Maybe you can help me get my magic back.
I thought you said you didn't want it anymore.
I don't.
But if it's what you wanted...
I would do that for you.
You're better.
Yeah.
"I shouldn't be, but I didn't have any say in the matter."
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I lost control.
Again.
I knew the risks when I decided to help you.
So...
Was it worth it?
How do you feel?
Different.
A little more myself.
Then we'll continue tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I turned.
Once.
To break the sire bond.
Turning needs to be painless.
And from what I saw today...
We're still a long way off.
I can't put myself through that again.
You will.
"Because until you're capable of acting on your own free will,"
I'm not going to let you anywhere near my daughter.
You told me your secret.
This is mine.
You're a vampire hunter.
"Don't go this way, go that way."
"Down, down, down, drive on the road."
"Faster! - "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
That was a narrow escape.
"Now, take me to Brahmanwadi."
"Go straight then take a left, then right and another left."
"And you'll be home, go on."
"You brought me this far, so drop me home as well."
My job's to show the way.. ..it's your job to get to the destination.
Fine.
Keep it.
Thank you so much.
You're so kind.
- Thank you.
"Take care. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Papa!
- Sushila.
ls everything fine?
"Go up and take a look in the house, you'll know."
"Thankfully we survived, otherwise.."
"No, I'll talk to the police."
Don't worry.
They hurled stones and acid bottles in our house.
I don't care lf I die.
But the children.
lf Jigna would've been hit by that acid..
I won't let anything happen to them.
I am their father.
Please.
"So, understand the duties of a father."
Withdraw the case.
- You're a fool.
Move. . . move!
Can't you hear the horns blaring?
Can't you hear so many horns blaring?
Thief?
Where is the thief?
Who died?
- No one died.
"Not thief, I said blare."
Are you deaf?
"You speak loudly, and very fast."
So I don't understand anything.
Your moustache covers your mouth.
Move your lips slowly.
"When I see your lip movement, I'll understand."
I don't understand easily.
God !
- What did you pick?
Show me your hand.
I didn't pick anything.
"You've met me here, don't meet me in heaven."
You live in that building?
Which floor?
The traffic has got jammed because of you.
Look!
Why are so many vehicles parked here?
"So many horns are blaring, can't you hear?"
Are you deaf?
The traffic has got jammed.
Are you blind?
Who called me blind?
Looks like a gang who calls me blind is out.
Who are you calling blind?
I have turned into a horse.
Know what she gave me for breakfast today?
Egg shampoo.
You are laughing?
Thank your stars she served you egg shampoo.
She gave me a white handkerchief in my milk as cream.
Take this file.
Go through it.
- Is this the file of your murder case?
What did you say?
"I meant, whose murder case file is this?"
A man named Manish will strike a deal in diamonds worth millions. . . in Hotel Blue Diamond.
Then let him strike the deal first.
- Why?
Because law says that until someone commits a crime. . . you cannot nab him.
"As soon as he strikes the deal, you will catch him red handed."
Both saw the time.
Both jumped in.
Something fishy.
Even I will jump in.
I won't spare you !
I won't spare you !
Where are you going?
"- Girls, what are you doing?"
"I am on duty, let me go."
Where are you hiding?
Come out soon !
Did you see?
- Yes sir.
Sexy figures in the pool.
"Not that figure, you fools!"
Look.
What is it?
- I too dont know.
That is what I call extra speech.
I did not like your face.
"Salim, the scooter is not getting started."
Please kick start it.
If he likes someones face he will make..
Why does he have Shailus ring on his finger?
I had a similar ring made for my daughter.
She lost it somewhere.
Did you find it by any chance?
I was joking.
This is a girls ring.
Not good for you.
Your luck will be reversed.
Take it off.
"Oh, is it love!"
You must have that much passion.
But be careful.
If that father knows.. ..he might have your hand or leg removed.
His head will be removed before.. ..he decides between hand or leg.
His Anarkali is my daughter?!
Then why will she agree to become an actress?
She will not.
All of you come here.
Listen all of you.
"If all my debts have to be repaid.. ..and if you have to breath free air, then I must die."
Oh God!
Im coming to you.
How are you?
Bring some water.
What?
Am I not dead?
You may stop me today and tomorrow.
But I will go one day.
No one listens to what I say.
I will listen to you.
Swear by your mother that you will listen to me.
Okay I will listen to you.
Will you become a cinema actress?
"No, no."
You must pose like this.
Are you a director?
You are shooting a photograph like a movie.
My money is hard earned..
Excuse me.
No smoking sir.
I am the father of the heroine.
Even then you cannot smoke sir.
"Let the movie succeed, then I will take care of you."
"Hi, Salim!"
What are you doing here?
I came for Anarkali.
Where is your Anarakali?
Dont play games.
Then give your daughter to me.
I will look after her very well.
I dont even know your name.
My daughter is a star.
She will be a heroine.
She cannot be the lover of a loafer like you.
There is a lot of gap between you and my daughter.
"Hey, you cannot even touch her shadow."
What?
I won't kill when they tell me to... ...or risk my life just bacause that's an orders.
That's sheer dumbness.
The most important thing is to yourself with skills.
That's my style.
You mistake us... we're ordered to collect our money.
Stop bullshitting me!
Where're you from?
We're from the Bank of Canton.
last time because I was late... it selling my account in a couple of days.
They were just do their job.
I just lost 2000 bucks to you.
Shut your fucking mouth!
Move!
"We didn't do anything wrong, did we?"
You want us to take off you?
Move!
Move!
Isn't it right?
Serve them right!
"Come on, go back to your room."
Serve them right!
Wait a second!
Who are you?
Mr.Wing sent me to collect his money.
What money?
Take a look at this!
Have you finished?
You think it's fake.
Just wanna make sure it's not.
"What's wrong with you, Sylvester?"
I know what's on your mind sex maniacal
What do you mean?
I got a variety dream last night.
In that dream both of us were married.
Surprising!
I too had the same dream.
But first night was with Salman Khan.
I will never get married in this life.
What if I reject?
There are many other girls in the city.
If I am not agreeable to the below average beauty like you.. ..how could I expect any girl to like me?
I think I was a wall in my previous life.
That is why.. ..everyone is throwing dung cakes on my face.
"Jagan, come with me."
Where to?
- I will tell you afterwards.
Come with me.
Are you going to hit me there?
What happened?
You should not see.
Remove the hand uncle.
Sorry.
I know you very well.
That is why I said we will sit outside.
Please wait for a while.
We have to select the cards.
We can do that sitting outside also.
I wont do anything.
Come on sit down.
We should not believe this men.
Is this card nice?
No.
Look at this card.
Remove it.
This one here gets shifted up.
Ready to shift some stuff?
"Remember, we only have to do this once."
Right?
So its an upfront cost.
Okay?
It's your investment.
"And then, once you have it, you can have this forever."
"Anybody ever asks you, hey, I need to take with [inaudible] boundary conditions."
"You'd be, like, dang, I gotcha."
"You just take this matrix which you built in 2011 and you can apply it at any time in your life, okay?"
"Show your grandkids,"
Whatever.
All right.
Yes.
[inaudible] where that needs to go in there?
This one here?
Yeah.
Dang it.
"Didn't, did I?"
Where did it put it if you don't put it in there?
That's a good question.
"Let's just put it in, don't ask hard questions."
Alright.
That one's supposed to be there.
"No, no, no."
M minus one.
That's where it's supposed to go.
"I, I think it put it."
"Well, who knows?"
"That's, that's, sorry."
There we go.
How does he know?
Yes.
What you want?
When can we expect the rain?
Not at present.
- Why?
Because the pointing finger was selected.
Tell me correctly.
During the next 48 hours the state will not have any rainfall.
"You can dry clothes, dry chips under the sun etc."
Can we apply beer to the hair?
Do whatever you want and leave me.
Will there be rain at least after 48 hours?
This is a difficult question.
Wait a minute.
Select one finger.
Yes.
"There will be rain after 48 hrs, 6 minutes and 8 seconds."
Is the rain guaranteed?
"Yes, without doubt."
My finger never cheats me.
Since you asked so many foolish questions.. ..can I ask you just one?
- Go ahead.
You are inquiring so much about the rain.. .what seeds did you sow?
He is asking what seeds we sowed?
Tell him that it is the seed of love.
- The seed of love.
What?
The seed of love?!
Put the phone down.
"Hey guys, it will rain after 48 hours."
We all heard that.

"Look, Sonakshi Sinha."
"She is Rowdy, my Rathore's in the next alley."
Let's go.
Come on.
"If you hang up, I will resign his job.. .. and become a wayside astrologer."
You are not fit even for that.
O God of rains!
Till today I thought.. .. that only farmers pray to you.
But now even lovers are praying to you.
"Dont you have mercy, O God of rains!"
The moment we hung up there is thunder and lightning.
This means that there will be rain.
Hurray!
It is raining.
"Hey, stop."
She said that she will meet when it rains.. ..but did not tell when and where.
I am getting tense and cannot understand what to do.
It is me who should understand.
Why are you overacting?
Shut your mouth.
I know where to go.
Grandmother!
Did I not tell you?
The rain is here.
Yes I see that.
Leave me.
What is the use of holding my hands?
Go and hold the hands of that boy.
Where will you meet him?
You did not even decide on a place to meet.
I dont understand.
It is me who has to understand.
Not you.
I understood completely.
I will leave now.
Bye.
Really?
Then why did.. - Marry you?
"Yes, tell me, why did you marry me?"
Don't keep taunting me.
Anyone can commit mistake.
"Yes, just like your parents did."
You.
- Mala mind your tongue.
Or else.. - Or else?
- Or else.
- Yes.
Or else.
- Or else what?
"Hey, get back to work all of you."
Get to work.
"Bhikhu, you do your work as well."
Should I do all the work?
I can't even fire him.
People get motorcycle in dowry but what did I get?
This servant.
Who can't even dream of doing any work!
Be thankful that you at least got him.
Stop it
What is this?
It took you 20 years to realize your dream.
To turn your hotel into Bollywood Caf.
For this?
So that you can utilize every nook and corner of this place to argue.
"For god sake, your staff laughs at you"
"'God, please show me a way to stop mom and dad's arguments forever.'"
"Why did you bring me here, Tanya?"
So that you can explain to my grandpa.. ..why you're allergic to marriage.
Fire Alarm!
Look at you...
"Now that I'm sick, You seem to study harder and don't get into trouble."
I think I'm getting better because of you.
Really...
"Then Mom, can you come in front of our school?"
School?
Why?
You know how mothers direct traffic by the school.
Can you?
Sure.
I wish I were sick instead of you.
"If you ever say that again, you're not my son."
My baby is sick.
"Please, please let me be sick instead of him."
-Why do you make women cry?
- Huh?
"Oh, you saw it?"
"I didn't make her cry, kiddo."
"By the way, what's with your long face?"
Does your girlfriend want to break up?
"Or, you want to break up, but you're having trouble saying it?"
You're too young to be making that kind of face.
"When you get old, you'll have plenty of chances to be sad."
"Mister, what do you do anyway?"
Me?
"To keep the one I love,"
I make other couples break up.
What's that supposed to mean?
You wouldn't understand...
Here.
"Take this, in case you need it later."
And I thought... how that was the same body as the one that had... held me so many times before.
And... we didn't say a word.
They took him away again.
I remember I cried because they'd taken away from me the only thing that gave me hope.
"In 1982,"
I came here... to Tierra del Fuego.
I opened this storage room... and I... tried to forget.
"But... the doctors had nothing to do with that, right?"
"Yes, there were... military doctors making calculations."
They... measured the voltage people could take from the cattle prod.
"In other words, they measured the amount of pain a human being could take without the heart stopping."
It isn't here.
Come here.
You're alive!
You're alive!
Let my daughter go!
Let her go!
Let her go or I'll kill you!
I said let her go or I'll kill you!
Put that knife down!
- Put it down!
- Please let her go.
It's okay.
- Please don't take her.
- Where are the others?
Who?.
Please don't take her.
Let's get out of here.
Please don't take her.
"Let her go, you bastard!"
"It's okay, honey."
You'll be okay.
Your bun has so much red bean paste!
Just give me one bite.
At least give me some red bean paste!
"Choose the cup, choose the cup!"
Double your money!
Double your money!
Choose the right cup!
One bet!
It's this one.
- How did you know?
- I have quick eyes.
- Well done!
Good job!
- That's enough.
Don't I look funny?
Funny!
Funny!
"This one must have married this one, and given birth to this one!"
Look at how plump they are!
The police has to know I'm alright so that they'll stop chasing him.
- Who are you?
- Your father has asked us to find you.
The Councilor will soon be here to fetch you.
Tell the police to stop chasing the thieves as I am alright.
You were kidnapped by the thugs that attacked the police.
Are you sure you're alright?
Don't you understand that my father wanted you to find me before the police so that there would be no rumors spread?
"If you tell Eun Hye that I know about Hong Gil Dong, you will not go unpunished!"
Eun Hye!
- Father!
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.
Where would I go?
And what would I pack?
"Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing."
What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile?
Are you supposed to pack warm?
Opal?
"Opal, how did you get up there?"
"Hang on, you poor dear!"
Mama's coming!
Rainbow Dash?!
How dare you strand my poor Opal on the tree.
"Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you... ...this!"
What is it?
It's not...
You...
We all finished your dress for you.
Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
Do you like it?
Like it?
Like it?!
Uh-uh.
She doesn't like it.
"No, I don't like it."
I LOVE IT!
You ponies did an amazing job.
It's exactly the way I imagined it.
We just followed your brilliant design.
Like we should have let you do for our outfits.
Those first dressed you designed were perfect.
We're so super sorry.
You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them.
We all saw how well that turned out.
I'm sorry that I cannot touch your feet as my arm is wounded.
It's not necessary.
- Why not?
I had left with your blessings so I returned alive.
"No, my son."
Even death fears men who sacrifice their life for their country.
What did aunty say?
I've got it.
Wonderful!
Your words have strengthened my determination.
Do you know what my mother would have said?
"What have you done, my son?"
I told you not to join the defence services.
You are my only son.
"You were saved this time but, what will happen the next time?"
And then she would start crying.
For the sake of her child a mother has to cry sometime.
Some shed tears and some swallow their tears.
"What is the matter, aunty?"
Nothing.
"Aunty, can I ask you something?"
Don't you have any children?
I had a son.
He wasjust like you.
I lost him.
Your mother has come to see you.
"Please send her in, doctor."
I'll leave now.
- Why?
You must meet my mother.
- I'll meet her some other time.
"Renu, you stay here."
- My childhood spent with it's tunes.
My father used to play these tunes.
You know what?
I'll miss you all a lot.
Really?
- Yes
And listen!
"Do come to my house once, okay?"
My father is a very nice man.
You know what?
"In my childhood, he used to make me cry a lot."
"He used to say, I'll get you married with a police officer."
I never like the police officers.
What will you say them now?
Now?
"Now, I'll say... fine..."
I like one police officer only if he stops smoking.
Smoking?
- Yes.
You...
Really?
Really?
What if I wasn't a police officer?
Still...
But before encountering them it's very important... ...to bring out Radha safe from their clutches.
"But the problem is that if police will arrest them... ...or attack them, they'll shoot Radha."
Or they'll point gun at Radha for their escape.
"I think so, sir."
"Sir, I've got one idea."
What if we go to them in the disguise of goons... ...and attack them?
- Yes.
In that case they'll escape safely with Radha.
- What?
Go with the police and immediately get shekhar arrested.
"No, no!"
"I can""t do this!"
Then be prepared to go to the prison!
"Ms. kitty, there are only two ways in front of you!"
You can choose any one.
Fine.
I will go with the police. very good! very good! shekhar!
I want my share!
- I too want it!
I too want it!
- I too want it! shut up!
"Tiger doesn""t listen to nonsense!"
And he is not a fool that he will hand over.. ..goods worth lakhs and crores to you all! so that you all fight amongst each other!
Everybody will get their goods when the time is right!
When will that time arrive?
I have been after you for 3 years!
"And you don""t listen to me!"
I made a sale of 15 million pound in your diamond!
And in return..
I will never spare you!
I will never spare you!
"Why don""t you give us our share?"
"Remember! lf our boss found out then he won""t spare you!"
And our boss will follow you!
"You don""t know!"
"He doesn""t like deceit!"
He will not spare you!
He will kill you!
Tiger kills people!
And gradually you will find out whom Tiger wants to kill!
She's of use to me.
Come here.
Go catch her.
Go!
Where are you running?
Father.
"Father, are you taking your medicine on time?"
Yes dear.
- How is your chest pain now?
I have only one pain.
My young daughter drives the rickshaw.
And I live off her.
- Why do you think like that?
"Nowadays, girls drive a car, even fly a plane."
I only drive the rickshaw.
"When I was born, hadn't you told mom it's not a girl, but a boy?"
Right?
Sister!
- My Munni is back!
"Leave that, come to your sister."
She is the daughter of the house.
"You are back from school, child?"
Yes.
"But tell me, why did you quit school?"
"When poverty pulled my leg, . . . helplessness took away books from my hand."
"I could not become a doctor, but I'll make you a very big doctor."
"When I become a doctor, I'll first cure father."
"Yes, father will recover."
"Then you, me and father will go on a holiday."
We'll go to a place where there are mountains covered with snow.
We'll climb those.
- But how will I climb a mountain?
This will give some time to make Bandaid sale the stick and give me all the credits.
Our destiny is into your hands Bandaid.
"If this is the guild's will, Omega Zell will join you."
And you'll have my thief skills.
"Yes, my thief skills will certainly come handy."
"I'll get this staff one way or another and thanks to it,"
I'll finally get in the Justice guild in exchange of this one of a kind item.
Let it be.
We will be the fellowship of the staff.
One cheated noob to divide them all.
One cheated noob to disconnect them all.
"And to the real life, make them return."
My precious...
"Bandaid, what the hell have you done again !"
Cancel this spell right now !
"Artheon... ? but, it's not me, it's the staff that did it on its own."
"Hey, is the babe new?"
- Yes.
Is she still naive?
- Yes.
Stop.
Rs.
20.
50p.
- Get lost!
Hey!
Where are you going?
Pay my money.
"Come on, quick!"
"You don't want to pay, you want to take?"
"Wait, I'll give you."
Looks like Bhai is in trouble.
I dont think so.
It is raining since this is the rainy season.
I remember from the rain.
I will show you a beautiful place.
Come
Where to?
To the temple of thousand pillars.
It will be wonderful experience to see it when it is raining.
With two temples on either side of nandi .. ..and a rainbow starting from one temple ends on the other.
You have to see it definitely.
Really?
Will it be so nice?
You should see yourself to believe.
Come on let us go.
- Now?
It can be seen only when it is raining.
Believe me.
Please come once.
It stopped to rain.
Bye.
Where are you going?
Should I tell you?
At least tell me when will we meet again.
Let us see when it again rains.
What is that?
Didnt you tell that the rain is uniting us?
If we meet when it again rains.. ..I will also believe that there is something between us.
Bye.
You will meet again when it rains?
I dont understand a bit.
Do you at least know his name?
"What is there in the name, Grandmother?"
"Take it to the left."""
"""You can do it like that."""
"""Shake it the right or my ladies and my man and my men and ladies."""
"""My ladies and my man and my men and ladies."""
"""You can do it like this."""
"""You can shake it to the left."
"You can do it like that."""
"""Shake it to the right all my ladies &amp;amp; my man and my men &amp;amp; my ladies."""
"""All my ladies and my man and my men and ladies."""
"""What a terrible blunder."""
"""Marriage turned into a nightmare."""
"""It's a bundle of sorry."
"It's after your life."""
"""It's better to die."""
"""It's the reason for all the sorrows."""

"""When you're attending a marriage."""
"""Always advice him."""

Exactly...
"Exactly, in this way I had dropped the cup... ...when I heard about it for the first time."
"Actually, Mr. Shreekant, Jimmy clearly told me... ...that if they couldn't marry, they'll commit suicide."
Yes.
Yes.
"So, I'm thinking over it and you too must think All of us must think over it."
After all it's a question of our prestige.
What if they elope and do register marriage?
Then?
Then?
And what if they'll really commit suicide?
Then?
Tell them to commit suicide and you too do the same.
God!
Nephew?
- What?
Who...
"What nonsense is this, Damodar?"
"It's not nonsense, uncle."
It's a fact.
"Look, uncle."
It's difficult for me to speak the truth... ...and for you to hear it.
That's why I had to do this drama.
But it's true that Radha and that boy are really in love.
"Damodar, have you seen the boy?"
"Yes, of course."
Instead I know him.
I know him very well.
"Aunt, if we won't accept Radha's proposal... ...we may repent in future."
Damodar!
- Why will Damodar lie to us?
Boy is studying medicine in America.
We did all the work!
Older Brother...
"Thank you for protecting us, Older Brother."
Thank you for calling me like that.
Will you be... ... happy on behalf of my Hyun?
You're really weepy these days now that you're only half a man.
- Half a man?
"- He's missing half of his balls, isn't he?"
What's life anyway?
"Su Keon, you'll be fine with just half."
"Please take care of yourselves, Hwal Bin Dang."
- What Dang?
- We decided to call you that.
Because you helped us who were poor and powerless.
Hwal Bin Dang?
Is that our name now?
"That's so cool, isn't it?"
- It doesn't sound too bad.
- Let's make a flag with our new name!
Whatever...
Hwal Bin Dang?
How burdensome!
- But that's what people are calling us.
- Who cares what people say?
"- We're just thieves, that's all."
- But doesn't it feel good to have a name?
It does have a nice ring to it.
"Now that we have a name, let's go have a party!"
We have to get home safely first.
The police are still everywhere.
"When it gets dark, we'll scatter and leave the city."
We'll reconvene again in the mountain retreat.
You first go home.
- Let us go home.
"Ok, come on let us go."
Is that you?
- You remember me?
"Yes, are you from Warnagal?"
"No madam, I am from Vijayawada."
I came to Warangal to purchase vegetables.
My name is Venkat.
I studied polytechnic.
Height 62.
"Please tell me your name, address and other details."
Is it so urgent?
I dont want to miss again.
I am very sorry.
That day my father was in toilet.
With out knowing that I.
Leave that matter.
You must be tired by now.
"You are dancing till now from the moment we met, in my dreams."
I have to take you to my friends immediately.
That Jagan argues that no one is beautiful than Aiswarya.
He will shut his mouth if he sees you once.
Are you trying to impress me?
No madam.
I have already impressed you.
I think you like the rain very much.
Rain is my friend.
Correct madam.
It rained when we first met.
It is raining today also.
That means you friend rain is trying to unite us.. ..which means there is something between us.
I have bad news.
Suraj's plane hasn't returned as yet.
There's still no news about him.
- No!
Please don't worry.
The search is on.
His companions did not see his plane crash.
We believe that he is still alive.
- Then why hasn't he returned?
He must have fallen in the hands of the enemy.
We cannot be sure at this stage.
- No!
What is the matter?
Was it news about Suraj?
His plane is lost.
"What will happen now, daddy?"
Suraj's plane is lost.
"I hope, nothing has happened to him."
"No, don't say that."
Suraj is alive.
My blessings will save him from every peril.
"Don't cry, my child."
I believe that he will return soon.
He has told me that he will return and eat what I have cooked.
You took away my husband.
I didn't say a word.
You took away my father and I didn't say a word.
You were unjust to me at every stage.
I never complained.
But...
If anything happens to my son I will believe that you are not God.
That you are not the protector of the universe.
Say something.
Please.
I shouldn't have kidnapped you.
"The car, the bridge, it was too far."
Thank you.
But you shouldn't have lied to me today.
"You can't go off and do things like that, Elena."
Not while Klaus is still alive.
I know.
I just...I wanted to give Bonnie a moment with her mother without everything else getting in the way.
Without me getting in the way.
I didn't plan on kissing him.
"You're better than him, Elena."
You're better than both of us.
Elena's on her way.
Jamie's safe.
"He's a little bruised, but he's safe."
Do you think the hybrid will come back?
You kept your end of the bargain.
Klaus usually keeps his.
You're willing to do all of this for him...
And he's not even your family.
"He is my family, Bonnie."
"I know that might be hard for you to hear, but he is."
But that doesn't mean that I don't care about you.
I want to help you.
You can't.
You have no magic and I don't trust you.
"When I put mikael down, my magic didn't just leave me."
It drifted away.
"The longer I stayed away from you, the weaker it got."
I think nature was punishing me for abandoning you.
Your testimony and your blessings.
How did you know the deceased  when he was still healthy and among us?
[Crowd:]
He was a good man!
- Do you testify that he was a good muslim?
- We do!
"Earthly or unworldly, materially and spiritually make all your rights halal to him."
Helal olsun.
Helal ediniz.
"- One more time, for God's blessings."
- Helal olsun.
"May God accept your prayers, your testimony and blessings for the deceased."
May he rest in peace.
It's a very fine piece.
Hand made.
Great craftsmanship.
But this alone don't mean much.
It is valuable only with its pair.
Otherwise it's just like a button.
Wish you could find the other one as well.
Then I wouldn't want to sell it.
"Anyway, maybe we'll find it."
If we can't...
Then my husband will keep it as a heirloom.
- Thank you.
"- Have a nice day, miss."
We've come with great news.
Is that so?
How nice.
The forward buyings are going great.
We revitalized the market.
- Glad to hear that.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No at last.
How old are you?
30.
Then you're not a little girl.
No.
Okay.
"So, you're a 30 year old girl, who's afraid of a guy like me."
"Well, I don't even know if -- well, I don't know if I'll be afraid of you."
You -- I get real defensive with you.
Now what can I do to you?
"You can't do anything, but I can sure feel dumb."
And I can feel stupid for not having the right answers.
Now what would it do to you to feel dumb and stupid?
I hate it when I'm stupid.
What would it do for you to be dumb and stupid?
"Let me put it like this, what would it do to me if you were to play dumb and stupid?"
It makes you all the smarter and all the higher above me and then
I really have to look up to you because you are so smart.
"Ah, yeah."
Butter me up.
"No, I think you can do that all by yourself."
"Ah, I think the other way around."
"If you play dumb and stupid, you force me to be more explicit."
"That's been said of me before, but I don't buy it."
I don't think --
Now what you are doing with your feet now?
Wiggling.
[giggles]
You have neither fighting skill nor wisdom.
You don't even have courage to fight.
Just go and hide yourself like you normally do.
Granny!
Show me how to make a pouch.
- I'll make one for you.
- No.
I want to make it myself.
I want to embroider something on it too.
What will be good?
A flower?
A bird would be better.
I should be able to make it in two weeks?
- Did you arrange to meet him then?
- Yes.
I think it'll be the last time.
"If I make a pouch for him, will he cherish it?"
I suppose this is crossing the boundary too.
It's really been a while!
"Here, have another drink."
I really respect you!
I will accept that opinion!
I should have recognized you when you called me Doe Eyes the first time!
But you tricked me by saying Goggle Eyes instead!
"So you were fooled by that, right?"
I was a bit surprised at my quick wit too.
"Farewell, Doe Eyes!"
"Farewell, Goggle Eyes!"
It's similar!
You're really smart!
"At least you understand me, Doe Eyes!"
I really respect you!
"I called the coiffure, the girls said you weren't there all day."
I can tell something happened.
Nothing happened Cemre.
I just got a bit emotional.
I can see that.
"But I am asking ""why""."
Well...
I don't know.
It thought about how small... ... how short life is.
It is like a blink of an eye.
"I mean, one can be so determined and work too much for something... ... and then one day it all goes away."
"I mean, as if it never existed."
As if it was a big lie.
"Cemre, life is full of lies."
Every life ends the same way... ... which makes everything meaningless.
Wish I knew what makes you say all this.
I was just thinking about all these stuff... ... they got me emotional.
But really Cemre... ... we have just one life.
"One must live for herself, not for others."
One must only regret what they couldn't do.
That's how it is.
My dear...
Don't regret anything.
"Forget about others, you fight for the one you love."
Be happy with whom you love.
"Yes, sweetie..."
You love Kuzey?
Go grab his hand.
You two suffered so much.
Cemre...
You deserve to be together.
My dear...
Browse the results and follow anyone you like.
There are many ways to find people on Twitter.
Just keep exploring.
We think you'll be pleasantly surprised by who you'll find and who you can follow.
Woman:
Nick?
Is it really you?
It is.
Oh... ( chuckling )
"Oh, my dear, lost love!"
I'm paralyzed with happiness.
"Jordan, this is my second cousin once removed, nick carraway."
"Does that mean we kiss when we greet, or no?"
I hope it means we do.
Tom says you've just come from chicago.
Tell me everything.
Do they miss me?
The whole town is desolate.
"Oh, how gorgeous."
All the cars have their left rear wheel
"Painted black as a mourning wreath,"
And there's a persistent wail all night.
"Let's go back tomorrow, tom."
I love a persistent wail.
"Well, I love a drink."
"Come on, let's all have a drink."
( sighs )
I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.
You live across the sound in west egg.
I know somebody there.
I don't know a single person.
You must know gatsby.
- Mukaddes!
"- It's OK abi, no need to hurry."
"Sorry, my wife is coming now."
Good morning.
"I can understand how you feel, really."
I've met all kinds of people and situations in this profession.
I found cure to many wounded men.
"I will help you, too."
Yes.
I will help you.
"For instance, I won't file a complaint about you."
You broke into my house in the morning.
You almost suffocated me.
These are big crimes.
But I won't report you.
Thank you very much.
"Look, you go now and pull your mind together."
- And quit messing with Reşat Yaşaran.
- I am still not convinced though.
It'd be stupid of you to have him against you.
"- He is a man, whose hand you want on your back."
"- I'm fine, thanks."
You know what he said when he first heard of that incident?
"He said ""poor guy""."
"""Watch over him, don't let him ruin his own life."""
- What is it to him?
- That man works for this town!
Don't tell me bull shit!
"Look son, this man is so powerful."
Not only in this town...
He has a great empire in Istanbul.
You know how many people are working for him?
"One must not die, but kill."
One must kill.
He is not an idiot.
But he made me an idiot before everyone.
"Hey, dont cry."
It does not matter whether this coward lives or dies.
"You, old woman!"
Put the marriage mark on my face.
Hello!
Bhadranna!
Tell me what the matter is.
I am coming to Hyderabad.
If you make a single phone call.. ..I will send the entire Hyderabad to you.
Why do you need to come? - Because I need to kill a person.
Why do you take the trouble?
Tell me who he is and I will have him killed in an encounter.
No.
I must hack him to death in the open street.
"Okay, if you wish let it happen that way."
Before I finish my work and return to Warangal.. ..they should be no report of any activity in Hyderabad.
There should be no law and order.
"Okay, as you wish."
See you later.
"Look here DCP, for 24 hours.. ..ignore any incident that happens in the city."
- Ok.
"Hey, leave us."
Is it true that someone kidnapped her?
"No, that is not correct."
She twisted her ankle and was in hospital.
She will not give any interview now.
Go away.
"My boy, have you come?!"
This place is quite big for a robot safari park.
"Ah, there's the border."
Hello!
A real elephant has come here.
What are you talking about?
But look...
-Then go over to that side.
"-Yes, sir!"
There is an invisible beam fence around this place.
Then where did this elephant come from?
It can never enter this place!
It must be a robot.
"No, this is a real..."
Leave.
I'm busy.
This is a real one for sure.
But it is true that it did come from somewhere.
"Hey, where did you come from?"
Hold on.
"Atom, Atom."
He's late.
Where did he go?
Doctor Ochanomizu.
Welcome to our safari park.
"Hey, Doctor Hura."
How is it?
Isn't this a wonderful park?
I feel reluctant to use animals for hunting even if they were robots.
You are still too serious.
Real animals are decreasing in its number recently.
So I developed animal robots that's the same as real ones so tourists can observe them and enjoy hunting.
That's why I opened this safari park in this vast field of Africa.
What happened?
What happened?
"He's saying, there are broken idols of God on that land.. ..so it's become inauspicious."
The place has become cursed.
"- Oh, God!"
No one will buy this land.. ..that's the rumour in the market.
Nimish.
"100 years later, when people find.. ..idols of God under that land, the prices will shoot up by 4 times."
Four times.
And people will construct a temple there as well.
lf anyone wants the buy the land he can.. ..otherwise I care a damn.
What now?
I've an idea.
"What are you doing, Kanji?"
Suicide!
"Sister-in-law, suicide.."
Papa. - kahan kahan?
Leave me.
What are you doing?
- Papa..
I am not a coward.
I will file a case.
Have you lost it?
He's gone crazy.
You will file a case against an insurance company.. ..worth 3000 crores!
I'm sure there are many others like you.. ..who have filed a case against the insurance company.
There must be others like me who might have filed a case.. ..but no ever filed a case against your Kishen.
I...will...file a case against your God.
"What are you doing? "" Who controls this world? """
""" Who's that sitting high up in the sky? """
""" Why are You hiding behind the clouds? """
""" Why are You afraid of being seen? """
"""And it seems he won't change his statement unless he gives up on Cemre."""
"""I know, you don't care about it."""
"""You would rather staying in prison than being free with his testimony."""
"""Because you're a person like that."""
"""You wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice..."""
"""... yourself, your life for those you love."""
"""I wish I could be one of those people."""
"""Be among one of your truths  that you would never give up on."""
"""I wish I could be the woman, you kept loving..."""
"""... despite the impossible circumstances."""
"""Take care, Kuzey."""
"""Hope to see you soon."""
Why do you keep looking behind you?
- I look to see if anyone's following.
- Barış is right.
This has been an obsession in you.
You need to relax.
"Nothing as it look, Zeynep."
He still wants to kill me.
Who?
Barış.
He will not rest until he gets rid of me.
"Do you hear what you say, Burak?"
You don't know Barış.
He is so dangerous.
He killed Ferhat.
He's the one who put the gun in my car.
He also sabotaged my car.
Did you tell this to the police?
"No, because I need to find an evidence first."
"That is, if he doesn't kill me before."
"No, that will not happen."
It's good that you came.
Come over here.
"Ha Ni ah, the thing that you were talking about - the 'timing'"
The timing of the kiss
"I keep practicing this at home, but It seems there's a problem."
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me."" this is 4.3 seconds..."
"During that time, what if Hae Ra leaves before then."
You'll have to do it before she leaves.
"Of course, I have to do it before she leaves."
"But you see, that timing doesn't really work out."
"Oh, well, what if you were... stand right here for me."
EH?!
"No, I don't want to"
"I did it for you that day, what's the need to do it again?"
"Please, do it for me."
I'll do it instead.
"Ok, then you do it."
Stand right here.
It worked well for Seung Jo.
"When I put my hand like this, the head that was facing down, tilt it up ."
If you can forget me...
"You saw that just now, right?"
The timing wasn't right
"Before the conversation is over, he already came it."
"It's too long, this 4.3 seconds."
"Sunbae, do you want to try it holding a racquet?"
"When you hold a racket, you turn into a completely different person."
"Confidence, and burning eyes."
Hae Ra!
Oh my god!
You startled me
"Oh, what do we do"
Think logically.
"Because logically.. - Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa."
What is this?
You were supposed to explain to Bunty about marriage and not logic.
"Don't change the topic, Tanya."
"Sir, you were saying something extremely important."
Please go ahead.
"We can.. - Yes, yes."
We can see the alpha Changeli.. ..which is four light years away from us.
We don't look at it the way we should.
But we look at it just as it looked four years ago.
Correct?
- Correct.
The star called Turios that we see.
We see it like it was nine years ago.
We don't watch it..
By the way.. do you look at your face in the mirror?
Yes!
Every hour.
That isn't fresh either.
Its 10 nanoseconds old.
Tell me.. if you get an opportunity to go back into the past.. ..which mistake would you rectify?
My mom and dad's marriage.
"Yes, Grandpa, this is the topic."
Marriage.
Now ask him why refuses to marry me.
"Yes, why don't you want to get married?"
I am scared.
It's just an excuse.
If you have the courage to fall in love.. ..then you should be prepared for marriage as well.
Logically you should marry Tanya.
Stop saying that.
What do you think she's makin'?
Looks like a dress.
"Well, that makes sense."
Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.
Is there something I can help you with?
"Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor."
Could you please fix the button for me?
It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.
"Oh, no, no, no!"
You can't wear this... old thing.
You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala.
And I'll make it for you.
No problem at all.
It will be my pleasure!
"Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that."
It would be so much work.
This dress is fine.
Twilight Sparkle.
I insist on making you a new dress.
-But...
"-No no, not a word!"
I won't take no for an answer.
"Well, in that case..."
"Thank you for your generosity, Rarity."
"Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful."
"Let me guess, Applejack."
You don't want a new gown either.
Gown?
Shoot.
I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
"You can't possibly be serious, Applejack!"
You absolutely must wear formal attire.
Two months.
He says the kid hugged you.
So?
Nothing but a lousy gardener.
But he's alive.
Pryor might not want a dead man on his conscience.
"Yeah, what does he care?"
What he did to me.
He sits on his pennies.
"Yeah, what have we got to lose?"
Some money is better than no money.
All you gotta do is make another phone call.
"Well, if you won't do it, I will."
"All right, all right."
"You're in luck, Frank."
We're gonna trade you in.
"Ordinarily, I wouldn't have asked you to drop by, Lieutenant."
Probably just a crank call.
Something else happened this morning that disturbed us.
"Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Pryor."
What was it that disturbed you?
"Well, we found one of our cars down the road."
"It was abandoned, the key still in the ignition."
Stolen?
"No, nothing like that."
Our gardener was bringing it back from town.
"Look, it's probably just a false alarm."
I think he got bored with this job and took off.
Frank would have told us.
He's a responsible man.
"My wife has great faith in human nature, lieutenant."
She should have been a social worker.
Sorry.
I gotta tell it where to do this on the negative one.
Sorry.
There we go.
"So I put down a C2, look at that. . See that?"
"So, what Spy's powerful per-say boom, boom, boom."
Zero.
"Boom, boom, boom."
Zero.
"Boom, boom, zero."
Got it.
"Now, the other one is interesting, cuz it's up here, and it's Up this, it's this one here."
For the zero set.
"So, it's like P2, but just shifted up by one."
Okay?
So I could take this E2 vector and just shift it all.
Okay.
Which I'm going to do.
Alright.
"And then for the, but, but first let's build the occasional, the 0's with the occasional one."
So let's make a vector called P4.
Which will be just a bunch of zeroes.
"And now what I'm do on this one, is put an occasional one, so E4."
Just like this guy.
Equals one.
"So now, there's the occasional one, there's the occasional zero."
"And I put this E4, actually this one here, interestingly enough."
"And, we won't have time to talk about everything yet."
"But, I'll show you where it goes, it actually goes over there."
Occasional one.
Now the thing is when I put this one over here I have to shift it by one.
This one here is shifted down.
I have had enough of doctors and hospitals..
"I certainly hope God doesn't get rid of them, but... ..I don't have the strength to see them.."
I don't know what to do.
"Don't worry about me, I will be fine."
You take care of your son.
- Save my Mustafa from all this.
"- God, look at this!"
"You don't have any strength in your limbs or tongue, but you are still nagging at me!"
Seher...
Take your lady to her room so she can rest..
I know what I need to do.
"I know what I need to do, as well, Duriye!"
Go to your room and lie down!
Seher!
"God, give me patience!!!!"
"Are you happy, Ms. Narin?"
Asiye?
We went to see Mustafa a little bit ago...
"But, he didn't see us."
"Do you know, my husband, a mountain of a man, has become almost vegetative?"
"You will celebrate, now!"
"Our new work place is here, Pasa."
"Ah, Doctor?"
Isn't this the place where we had the situation with the picnic?
"Yes, it is."
"If we can provide not just for the farmers, but for the social needs of the community, then we will have won, Pasa."
Yes...
"Actually, a astro turf would be great here."
Really... no...
"No, that won't be enough for you!"
"For you, hopefully, we will build an Olympic stadium."
It will be the Ali Olympic Stadium.
"That'll be ten marks, about t---"
"This scoudrel took off without paying,"
He just upped and left.
Sacramentum what a redhead.
He didn't take off.
I was just trying if your powder is the real thing.
Here's your money.
"Thank you, thanks a lot!"
"Just like that, excellent!"
Would you like anything else.
"Nothing else, thanks, except that you stop calling me a redhead behind my back."
"Goodbye, I'm off."
Goodbye
Come back again.
"Hey, redhead!"
"Here, take this suitcase to the teacher's apartment."
Now I'm out of breath.
"Oh my god, where did this brat disappear to."
That must have been a stone from under a car tyre.
The doorbell is ringing.
The doorbell is ringing.
"Oh how long I was waiting for you, darling."
Dear teacher.
My master dear.
Why do we meet so rarely.
How nice it is that school has breaks.
We can spend the entire break together.
"When we'll be together all the time for all our lives, we'll bear the good and the bad things together."
Take a seat on the sofa.
What a lovely sofa.
And now we'll have a cup of hot coffee together.
Are you tired from the long winter
"I wrecked my familyfor nothing, absolutely nothing."
I don't have the face to say anything.
But what happened has happened.
I did it again.
Forgive me.
Forgive me and go.
As if you left me anywhere to go.
Who would accept me now?
Who would forgive me?
"If you spoil those men's game...Maybe, your husband will get soften."
Go girl...
I'll buy your plane ticket.I'll put some money in your pocket as well.
Go and testify.Be their doom !
"Offf, days and weeks have passed here."
But these minutes feel even longer.I'll loose my mind.
- What if we come back here.- Stop being a merchant of doom.
We'll end up here againif you keep attitude.
Stop it!
"- What's wrong, man?- Don't touch me!"
- He is just shaving you.- I don't want him to.
Fuck off then.
- I'm not dying to touch your face.- Ibrahim...
- If it wasn't for the orders I was given...- Just do your job.
Sit down.
Don't piss him off.
"- Sit down!- Come on, man."
We need a shave as well.
I feel dizzy.Must be because of high blood pressure.
"- Perihan, please get a grip on yourself.- Can we find some water?"
My mouth is also dry.
I told you not to come hereand go directly to the courthouse.
I will be the only one to see them anyway.
"I'm sorry to have offended you, please forgive us."
Sorry.
Let's go.
"Old man, do you know what Xiang Yaocha is?"
What did you hit me for?
"Who are you, kid?"
Don't you have any manners?
How dare you call Miss Mu by her nickname?
You want to get yourself killed?
"Old man, what's going on?"
"Lucky for you that you've met me, or you'll die."
I don't understand.
"Let me tell you,"
"Xiang Yaocha is the alias of Mu Wanqing, a martial arts expert of great reputation."
"Oh, so it's a person!"
"She's as pretty as a peony, she is ruthless, can be quite scary, that's why she's also known as Xiang Yaocha."
Where does she live?
A deserted valley ten miles away.
"There have been many who went there, but none of them return."
Is she a very good host?
"No, she killed them all, peeled off their skin to block the sun."
Please sit down.
"What would you like to eat, master?"
Just a few dishes.
Right away.
Should I go or not?
"If I don't, then Miss Zhong's life is in danger."
"If I do, she might skin me alive to block the sun."
Difficult decision.
"I wanted to rush over, and kill that bitch, Xiang Yaocha."
"Be careful,"
"I heard her ""Bone cutting sword"" is lethal."
Send me the case files and tell me when to be in court.
"Thank you, doctor."
We need this.
"Before he was arrested, Father Moore sent this to me."
He asked me to take care of it.
It's your burden now.
One more thing.
When you saw Emily... ...did Father Moore ask you to give her any medical help?
He was already trying to stop her from injuring herself and urging her to eat.
"And I told him, as a doctor, I couldn't help her."
Dr. Cartwright's going to testify.
Don't you get it?
He's not just an eyewitness to the exorcism.
He can also refute the prosecution's medical case.
This is huge for us.
When do I get to testify?
I don't know.
Let's take this one step at a time.
No.
"What matters most is Emily's story, which only I can tell."
I understand.
Have you thought about what I said before?
About dark forces and demonic attacks?
"Yes, I have."
"That day, after Briggs testified... *..."
I was feeling awful. *
*And I went out for a walk* *just to clear my head... *
*... and I was thinking about* *what you said to me.
Thinking:*
"*""What if demons really do exist?""*"
And wondering what that would mean if I believed that.
"Because God knows, I have my own demons."
And her fiancé isn't  happy with this at all.
His mother is being a bitch about it as well.
- I'm really sorry about it.
"- It's okay, thank you."
"- Thank you, usta."
- Take your share and let us part ways.
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.
"Don't let anyone inside, son."
"How can I not, abla?"
They say they are customers.
- They're camping outside.
- Don't answer their questions.
- Come let's wash your face.
- I tell them I don't know anything... ... and I don't even know you.
"It makes the other shops uneasy, too."
I understand.
We'll talk to Kadir Bey first and then see what we can do about it.
You close to door.
"And tell anyone who comes, we're closed today."
"Okay, abla."
- The shop is swarmed with the reporters.
- What do we do?
It's a public restaurant.
"You can't say ""the reporters can't come in""."
"- But they have no rights to bother you, of course."
- But that's what they exactly do.
"- They are getting to our nerves, aren't they?"
- I'm most concerned about the Yaşarans.
I fear that they'll send someone to make a scene... ... in front of the cameras and we won't be able to prevent that.
"Abla, can you answer it please."
"Hello, Sinem."
You don't know him.. but..
"If his hand stayed still, his arm would not.."
"If his arm didn't work, his mouth would.."
Look at his condition...
I understand.
"It is difficult for you all, too."
"But, Mustafa Bulut has given up on the real world, even without the effects of the medication."
"This is the most difficult time for us, as well."
He will heal faster if those close to him come and spend time with him here.
"What are you saying, Doctor?"
"Of course, we will come!"
We are childhood friends!
"Everything we eat, drink has been together."
Do you think I would abandon my brother?
Why don't you sit down?
Why are you acting like a stranger?
Of course she is not a stranger!
Gulengul is our daughter.
Our big family... ... this is all we have...
"Ah, my son... look at us.."
My beautiful Mother... don't worry yourself so.
He is going to be happy again...
He is going to mess with us when he returns..
Just wait...
Hasan...
"Aslan Bey ordered somethings, Yasar Abi."
Enjoy your food.
"Come, sit with us..."
"No, my mother wanted somethings..."
I am going to go home.
The poor woman is by herself.
Let me help Hasan.. With your permission..
Nooooooo.... of course not!
"We like people with big hearts, not big houses..."
Like you all....
"But, we can't continue like this..."
"Yes, yes, you can... and, you are company for my mother, as welil..."
Don't let anyone trouble themselves for now...
"I am leaving, Mom."
"- If you need anything for this evening, call, okay?"
"- Okay, my dear."
"See, how well she is talking???"
She got her voice back!
"Bravo, Doctor, Bravo!!!"
"You couldn't take my son's life, but you took away his mind."
"Did you hate us, this much, eh?"
Mustafa doesn't even know his own mother!
Is your conscience clear?
It is normal.
"How can this be normal, Doctor?"
"It has only been a week, and my brother doesn't recognize any of us!"
"Right now, he is going through an intense treatment and medication program."
"Because, he refused to eat, we have hooked him up to an I.V."
We need time to see the results of the medication.
"So, what are we to do, then?"
"Don't worry, and be patient."
He is going to get well.
Don't reduce your visits.
Come often as possible.
Spend time together.
It will be good for him.
"Would you like to go to a doctor, Duriye?"
No..
I don't want to..
All of you please go out.
I want to talk to my son.
"You too, go outside."
Sir!
- Please go.
I understand how it will be when death comes near.
I know I am not going to heavens.
Being a gangster I killed many people and now I am suffering.
You dont repeat my mistakes.
And dont ever hurt any woman.
I did that with Parvati.
I never told anybody that I am the father of her son Kasi.
Now I want to do justice to him.
I want to give half of my property to her son.
Promise me you will fulfill my wish.
Why dont you talk?
Will you do it?
Do you equate me with the son of your mistress ?
Your dad is very great.
He lived and died like a king.
He died like a dog.
I became home minister because of your father.
From now I will serve you as I used to serve your father.
I know I will have your support.
Just a phone call is enough for any work.
By the way 17 of our people are in central jail.
If you ever need them I will release then on parole.
I have an urgent meeting with collector.
Bye.
You stay here.
She is the your fathers mistress and he is her son.
"Mother, he is my brother and he will be with me from now."
He came to talk to me.
He claims that Barış hired a man to go into jail for him.
"Come on, really?"
He made himself believe in that.
He thinks the man got himself caught on purpose.
That's why this happened after we confronted Barış.
He believes this story in his mind.
I think we shouldn't go deep on this.
We should just leave the rest to the police.
True.
"I just don't want to be suspicious of anyone around me, anymore."
And I made some spinach börek.
Kuzey's favorite.
It hasn't cooked yet.
It will be in 5 minutes.
Will you be okay while I am not here?
"Don't worry, I'll be home all day today."
But our girl is doing well.
She's getting better everyday.
"She'll be even better, inshallah."
Her face is getting more colorful as well.
The weather is fine today.
I'll go out in the yard with her.
"Careful, don't let her get cold."
- We'll be careful.
- Really though...
You sure you don't need to be at work?
"I'll feel so bad, if you have to stay here because of me."
No.
I don't have anything important to do at the company today.
I scheduled today to spend some time with my daughter.
Great.
I will consider later.
SlR I felt like..
"Hey, you are starting a song when you are asked for a story."
You got your money.
Now leave.
What did he see in me to lend me this money?
If he gave you money without a mortgage.. ..then you must have something as valuable as gold.
What do I have?
I have a golden heart.
Gali Ganna Rao speaking.
Where is the rain?
We dont have rain in stock.
It is out of stock.
"How can rain the out of stock, you fool!"
You idiot!
Everyone calls me a fool.
But you have.. ..lovingly called me and idiot.
Who are you?
You said that there would be rain after 48 hours.. .. six minutes and eight seconds.
Where is the rain?
"Is it you, seed of love?"
Rain is not a wife to come as soon as it is called.
"Of course, my wife does not come even when I call her."
Then whose call will she respond to?
Are you talking about the rain or my wife?
At present we are talking about your wife.. ..tell me about the rain.
The rain was supposed to come.
"But the low pressure.. ..crossed Orissa, West Bengal and then moved over to Bangladesh."
Then what are you doing here without going to Bangladesh.
I do not have a passport.
"What passport, you anthrax......!"
"My boy, you are inventing new words to swear at me."
"Poor man, they'll give him a stroke one of these days."
Selim!
But I'll get that newspaper shut down.
That'll teach them.
"Of course, you have the power to do anything."
You wouldn't move a finger in the first place if the Yaşarans weren't also in it.
"- You're the one cleaning up their mess, aren't you?"
- Look mister...
I told you a thousand times already...
"I went to help the girl, because the town folks asked me to."
And I helped her without expecting anything in return.
"Unlike you, I didn't turn my back on her."
"And if this news was right then you'd be the one  who really abandoned her, am I wrong?"
You did the right thing though.
Everyone went their own way now.
And that chapter's over.
"It was that girl, wasn't she?"
She was there at the night of engagement.
You're talking nonsense.
I am Fatmagül Ketenci's yenge.
Was her yenge there to ask about her?
You were acting so weird all night.
"For God's sake Selim, just tell me, is it true?"
Are you crazy?
How can you believe that rubbish?
This is how much you trust me?
Are you serious?
I can't believe you.
No...
This is unacceptable.
You can't ask me that.
"Look, Meltem...This is over, if you don't believe me."
He????
Who am I???
"I am your husband, Narin!!!"
"Even if you won't do your wifely duty, I still acted as a husband towards you."
Don't touch me!
What's my fault?
Eh???
What's my fault?
It's been over two months since we got married.
I did whatever you wanted.
Whatever you wanted.
"Get up, get up... sit.. sit..."
It's enough!!!!
"What do you think I am, eh???"
What do you think I am?????
"I am supposed to shut up over everything, accept everything, and you all twist me around your fingers, eh???"
"There is no such world, Narin."
There is no such world.
"From now on, we are going to live as man and wife."
Everyone is going to know their place.
I am your husband.
"Mustafa... you can fool everyone, but.."
"I won't fall for your act, son..."
"I understand you.. if you have anything you want, tell me... relax.."
Don't worry yourself over it..
"If he needs anything, Neco is here.."
"But, when one sits around all day like a potato, they don't have any needs, right?"
It's enough to give a little fertilizer...
"Ah, now I believe you!"
If you won't stuff this man's words back into his mouth.. ... you are not aware of anything...
"If I wasn't too embarrassed, I swear to God, I would cry."
It troubles me so much.
Shall we marry with out any delay
let us recreate history and show that.. ..our union is a proof of real friendship
I will never remove you from my heart . ..and this ring from my finger.
You should also promise me one thing.
Whenever it rains you should come and hug me like this.
My God!
From where did you get that heroine?
Shall we watch the shooting?
Why not?
Let us go.
"Sir, see this girl!"
How beautiful she is!
If we make her the heroine in our movie.. ..it will definitely go on to celebrate a silver jublee.
You are right director.
She looks wonderful.
Hey photographer!
Take a few snaps .. ..of that girl in the pink dress.
Look here Mr.Ranga Rao!
We never know when luck will smile on someone.
For example Simran became a heroine.
Her mother is moving around in a Benz car.
Roja also became a heroine. - Her brother too has a Benz car.
Same thing with Rambha too.
Her mother is moving around in Benz car.
You are talking only about brothers and mothers.
What about fathers?
- He is there.
And you are that person if you agree.
Listen to me and make your daughter a heroine.. ..then you will get not only Benz cars .. ..but you can enjoy all other luxuries.
You can earn some crores of money.
Crores!?
Yes believe me.
I'll go already...
I'm tired...
You have to take a look to the future plans with your lover once more
Come on..
"You were in class A, I was in B"
I'm saying...
"This is why I don't remember you ,..."
But i remember you..
I remember of my all primary school friends.
It means there is a problem in my memory card.
"You were not interested in anyone, you didn't play with the other kids."
"Even during the breaks when everyone was running, you were sitting in the edge and reading books."
So that no one would mess with me.
"Actually, I was like you too.."
Did you study a lot?
I did not have many friends. friend..
"In fact, no friend at all."
Oh snap!
Why?
"First I was very tall, I looked older next to them , and I had dental braces until the end of junior high school."
"It's beautiful to be tall, I wanted to be tall too."
But your height is good.
Thank you!
"Your dental braces served the purpose, your teeth are very beautiful &amp;gt;Thank you!"
No one cares about Mira.
And it's understandable why Eylul left us.
Life goes on...
Thanks for the beautiful moments tonight !
Don't mention it.
"Good night, &amp;gt; The same to you."
Mom?
"I struggled a lot to reach this Mira,"
- Yeah.
You were so hilarious in that olive costume.
"But, Jas, you said boys don't rate girls for funniness."
"Well, I just meant that they rate other things more."
"Oh, yeah."
What do they rate then?
Skinny-Minnie blondie boobie girly girls like Slaggy Lindsay?
"Well, she does have that cover-girl look that boys die for."
"So, are you saying I have to be more like her?"
Thong alert!
I always knew she was from Vulgaria.
- Now that's what boys like.
- But they just go up your bum.
- Nah.
- Do you think you should try one?
No way.
I'm not gonna injure myself just because boys like it.
And Slaggy Lindsay should know that all those ancient women did not burn their bras and give women the vote so she could wear a thong.
What a swiz!
- That is just diabolical.
"- No, that is shocking."
Bet you Robbie doesn't know about that.
At least I sort of fill up my bra when I wear one.
Even though it does bunch up when I run for the bus.
"So, she has false boobs, a massive bum and a blank personality."
You would score more in all of those areas.
Defo.
But she's got Robbie and I haven't even kissed a boy.
I can't.
"You want to move up on the maturity scale, right?"
I'm not that desperate.
You have to step up to compete.
Kerim.
Thank you.
Thank you.You did a lot of preparation since the morning.
It was tiring.But it was worth it.
Everything was great.
Yes.
I worked hard for it.
But you see.I didn't think about setting off fireworks.
"- Kerim, don't say this.- God damn him."
- I'll make him pay for this.- Kerim please...
It's obvious why he did it.Don't do anything please.
- Listen to me at least this once.- Don't you see how he provokes me.
Should I pretend that nothing happened?
"A wrong step you take with anger, may affect the whole lawsuit badly."
Please don't do somethingthat would put our case on danger.
- This is what he exactly wants.- He is doing it out of desperation.
"Because, he is so lonely, so helpless.He is well aware that he lost everything."
He is actually taking revenge of himself.He's trying to hurt himself.
I could very well help him get hurt...
He's showing off.
Trying to impress you.
He is nobody for meeven if he pulls down the stars from the sky.
You think he could impress me by showing off with the Yaşarans' money?
He is a poor soul.You don't need to be jealous of him.
"I am not jealous, Fatmagül."
I am afraid.
Bastards as low and dirty as them...
I am afraid of what they are can do.
I'm afraid to loose you.
Don't be.
I love you so much.
Good night.
But I'm still curious.
Chang Hui that boy...
I wonder how he will look when he shows up.
I was afraid of how you were wavering when you were with her.
Attendant Noh.
I am not wavering.
I am searching for the right path.
Your Highness!
"If I don't do that now, I will lose my way forever if I am lost later in the future."
"Right now, I want to look within myself rather than move forward."
"When I look at myself through Yi Nok's eyes, I can see the things I've been hiding."
And Hong Gil Dong gave me some advice as well.
He told me to protect the people if I wanted to be king.
Realize it?
Yi Nok!
- Try this on.
- What is this?
I borrowed this from Mae Hyang.
You should wear this next time you go to Yongmun.
How can I wear something like this?
You should learn to wear skirts now.
"You should dress like noble ladies do, and act like them."
"What's wrong with you, old man?"
"I'm a medicine peddler, Heo Yi Nok!"
The Moonlight Warrior can't wear a skirt!
"And besides, does this look noble to you?"
"Well, I suppose it is a bit sexy for a noble lady to wear."
I'll go bring something more conservative.
How am I supposed to wear this?
How embarrassing!
My colored glasses...!
We crushed the glass and used it to cut our binds.
"Well, I..."
Save it for your performance.
"Well, phony's not quite the right word, but it's more like a show off."
A show off?
-Like you know all the answers.
-Yeah.
"And I want you to be more human, and that doesn't seem very human to me."
To know all the answers is not very human?
"Yeah, and right away find out how"
"I'm kicking my feet, and why am I doing like this."
Why are you doing like that?
"Oh dear, I've got eyes."
I can see you kicking your feet.
I don't need a scientific computer to see that you're kicking your feet.
What's big about that?
You don't need to be wise to see that you're kicking your feet.
"I know, but it seems like you're trying to find some reason for it."
I don't.
It's your imagination.
"Okay, I know what I'd like from you."
Can I tell you what I'd like from you?
Yeah.
"I'd like you to be aware that I'm kicking my feet, and to be aware that I'm giggling when I'm really nervous, and accept it instead of putting me on the defense of having to explain it."
I don't want to have to explain why I'm doing these things.
Did I ask you to explain?
You said why am I?
Or what am I doing?
No --
"Well, what am I doing, you said."
"That's right, kicking your feet."
I didn't ask you to explain.
It's your imagination.
- And she knows we're Kerim's friends...
"- Please, I don't want to hear anything."
Thank you.
He should be here soon.
Our phones kept ringing since the morning.
Everyone who saw it on the Internet dialed our number.
You can imagine how difficult a situation it was for us.
"It's indeed difficult, having to defend ourselves against such a groundless and ugly claim."
- I can't believe we're even talking about it.
- Exactly...
Exactly.
I'm disgraced before all my friends.
I have been believing your lies closing my ears to what others said...
But I don't know how I am going to deal with this!
I've never lied to you.
Even if it's denied and refuted... ... the question marks in people's heads will remain.
"Even today, my best friend told me  ""There's no smoke without fire""."
To hell with their smoke and fire!
You'll keep hearing such things if you don't shut them up!
After all I've told you...
Is this how much you trust me?
Do you think I could possibly do something like this?
Meltem...
That girl was Kerim's girlfriend.
"Would she marry him, if she wasn't?"
Meltem...
That news are set up by my father's rivals.
Everyone in that town knows that.
It's OK.
Leave it.
"Welcome, dad."
Welcome dear.

Deal is done!

You both are the most beautiful girls in the world!
"What""s wrong with you?"
Are you angry?
"No, I am not angry!"
What do you think you are?
I have heard that Tiger singh and you studied together in England.
And I have also heard that shekhar is your best friend.
We're going to film the first Las Vegas scene.
We suffered a lot until now in the U.S. because of the weather.
But I think it'll be okay in Las Vegas.
Although I am quite sleepy and that's not good.
What time is it now?
I couldn't fall asleep so I read a book instead.
There's nowhere to film here.
There should be a lot out there.
"For Las Vegas,"
This is where everything really starts.
None
None
None
It's a song about us B.A.P.
We wanted a song that matched Las Vegas.
It's a very fancy city.
"Since we are singers, we look the most splendid when we're up on stage."
It's a song about us and how we'll go to many cities in many countries to perform on stage.
There are many countries we want to go to
And there are many countries we will go to.
So it's a song that contains our greatest aspirations.
It's so pretty since the streets are so extravagant.
I'm not sure I did well.
There are too many people.
I'm nervous because too many people are watching.
None
I'm embarrassed.
It's crazy.
lf I were good at dancing then I would at least do something.
Singing is more embarrassing than dancing for some reason.
People are all staring...
So it's kind of hard to be confident.
She didn't talk about it for 20 years.
Her face-muscles were motionless.
"Everybody treat her and her mother well in Taiwan, because her father sacrificed himself."
But she says:
I'm not him.
Memory is the selection of images.
"Some elusive, other's printed indelibly on the brain."
"Daddy loves you, so much!"
I know we'll dance at every party.
Each image is like a thread. each thread woven together to make a tapestry of intricate texture. when I first met Louis I said to myself
"He is a healer, he will take care of me."
Do you still love her?
Men fought each other for the privilege of speaking her name.
And the tapestry tells a story.
And I find out he's just a man.
"You're in trouble, they're really mad."
Who them?
They always mad!
And the story is our past.
I'll never forgive you.
If you drive him away.
"The summer I killed my father, I was 10 years old."
"I saw daddy,"
Daddy and Mrs Munroe.
That's a lie!
What's wrong with her?
"Oh, she'll be alright."
Have you told anyone?
Cos if you tell I swear I'll do you harm.
You know i love my sister but she's not unfamiliar with the inside of a mental hospital.
"It's sunday, which one of your patients you gonna see Louis?"
What was wrong with that lady?
Everyone's looking fancy after shopping yesterday.
"Zelo, that's a very unique hat."
- I got it yesterday.
- Where'd you get it?
"I found it off the street, some US brand..."
Your hair color is very artistic
- My hair color?
- It really stands out.
- What color is it?
- It's purple.
Those sunglasses are very unique too.
"Yes, they are unique."
Your facial features are unique.
"I hear that a lot. oh, really?"
I have to buy things suitable for my age and pockets...
"I was surprised, to be honest."
They had everything I was looking for but they were all very costly.
- Limited editions are really expensive.
- The first thing that caught my eye was about 1400 dollars.
With 1400 dollars I can drink Nesquik 6000 times.
I couldn't sleep much but I came out because I wanted to shop.
"Actually, we were all washed up and ready to go to sleep."
But we all came out as soon as we heard we're going shopping.
We can only stay here for about 2 weeks.
There's no time to be sleeping.
At least one more hour...
Shopping helps a singer express more.
"Shoes too, styling for our album"
It helps us to discuss with the stylists.
We would be able to make suggestions and use those items.
I think it's a big help.
This is Hollywood.
"I said, ""I don't know."
"Why?"""
"And they said, ""It's really important."
"You gotta get it out of here."""
"So they talk to the pilot and aircraft commander and he came over and he said, ""Brian what do you think?"""
"Or, BJ, they called me."
"""Can you haul that thing?"""
"I was looking at it and there was a master sergeant there and stuff and said, ""What is it?"""
"He said, ""I can't tell you what's in it."
"But it has to be out of here, because they've having trouble..."""
That's that real hard area in Pakistan right now.
All the troubles and everything.
There were troubles back then.
"So, there was an old"
CG marked out with the circle and an X in it for
Center of Gravity.
"So, I said, ""Well, is that accurate?"""
"He said, ""Well, I don't know."""
"I said, ""Hey, listen, if you want me to haul it, I have to know pretty close because... the plane is big and touchy on this, you know."""
"He said, ""There's probably weight on both ends."""
"I said, ""What's it weigh?"""
"There was like 20-22,000 pounds on it."
"He said, ""We probably added a couple 3,000."""
"I said, ""Okay, I don't care what's in it."
You can have sugar in it.
I don't care what's in it.
"But I do have to know if it can hold it."""
"So he says that, so I said I can fly it - I can haul it."
We had a load of stuff.
We ran that stuff back down to
Karachi and then they'd ship it out there in boats and stuff like that.
Flew back up to
"I would be on Facebook, or worse,"
MySpace.
The volume of a cube is equal to its length times its width times its height.
"A cube with side x has length x, width x, and height x."
"So its volume is equal to x times x times x, or x to the third."
Shane takes a big cube of butter with side length 5 from the fridge.
"So I'm assuming-- well, they're not giving us the units."
Maybe it's 5 centimeters.
With side length 5 from the fridge.
Maybe I'll go with 5 centimeters.
That seems reasonable.
Then he cuts out a little cube of side length 2 from one of the corners of the cube.
Write an expression that describes the volume of butter left.
So let's think about it.
The original volume of butter that was-- they're saying side length 5.
I'm visualizing it as 5 centimeters.
"Its volume is going to be 5 times 5 times 5, which we could just write as 5 to the third power."
And then he takes out a little chunk from that.
And the volume that he takes out is the volume of that little cube.
And that little cube has side length 2.
So its volume is going to be 2 times 2 times 2.
Or another way of writing that is 2 to the third power.
So it's going to be 5 to the third minus 2 to the third.
Why are we doing this?
Where are we going?
Why?!
What?!
Oohh!
We're in Paris!
"Yes, exactly, why don't we just stop and enjoy it?"
Just look.
It is dropping down...
"Oh, thank God..."
"Yasar, could you please buy these drugs immediately?"
"Look at us, Serdar Bey..."
"I am trying to keep my family together, but..."
"But, I can't."
And mother's heart can bear upto some point.
"Whatever prescription you give me, whatever you tell me..."
Useless...
My only medicine is Mustafa's health... his goodness...
When I see Asiye pregnant and in despair...
When I think about the innocent baby yet to be born...
I am losing my mind...
Be patient...
He is being treated.
"Believe me, the things being done is for Mustafa's benefit."
Tell Narin... ...to see Mustafa.
Help us.
We are falling apart...
We are breaking into little pieces..
This mansion is collapsing onto us.
We are getting burried under its weight.
It broke my heart to see the woman in that condition.
She was begging so desperately that
"It broke my heart...She said ""This mansion is collapsing onto us."""
"""We are getting burried under it."""
We.. stayed burried a lot under those walls...
Nobody heard our voice.
She was about to have a stroke because of high blood pressure...
"Luckily, you were there on time, Serdar."
Mustafa didn't recognize anyone of them.
He doesn't communicate with anybody.
They were selling them by the road.
You don't like it?
It's the same?
"Then, it's couple t-shirts?"
Hamburger!
I was so hungry. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's really good. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Better than the delicious French or Italian food. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I won't be able to eat such a delicious hamburger again. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I wish time would stop right here.
Eat!
Don't just look at it
"But, why did you take my hand and run earlier?"
You were with Hae Ra. . .
That's because. . .
You were the one closest to me.
Thank you.
I keep causing trouble all the time.
I haven't really experienced something that was difficult for me.
But after you showed up...
I feel like I'm living in a completely different world.
I feel like I'm solving a sudden problem without an answer.
That may be an ordeal that I should get over.
"Something I can't avoid, something I have to solve."
Is the ordeal...possibly me?
"At first, I wondered about how to react to it and just wanted to avoid it."
"But now, I won't run from it."
"If the problem is not wrong, then there has to be an answer."
I'm going to approach it head on.
Huh?
You're going to face me head on?
If you don't get it then forget it.
"No, I get it."
"So, I am an ordeal to you and you were only trying to run away."
"But you changed your mind, and now, you are with me."
Are you proposing to me?!
How is it?
Isn't it a good name?
Would you guide me to where you first entered this park?
It would be tough if another animals enters.
This is a place for repairing hunted robots.
"Anyhow, Doctor Ochanomizu, please take a look at that."
It's a very aggressive elephant called Zora.
Very aggressive?
All animal robots here are designed not to take people's lives.
"However, this Zora is different."
It kills people ruthlessly.
Why did you build such dangerous thing?
It's thrilling.
There wouldn't be any thrill if there weren't a crazy beast.
But this one is too dangerous.
I need your help.
My help?
Please rebuild this Zora to listen to what workers here say at least.
Do you think I'm going to help you?
"Please, Doctor Ochanomizu."
Visitors are also expecting a lot from Zora.
It sure leaves me some profit as well.
This is not right.
You are doing this for the sake of money...
That's right.
I became a scientist to earn money.
A man like you is not suitable for the world of science.
"Doctor Hura, a real elephant is shot dead near the spring."
What?
Is that true?
"There are real animals outside this park, right?"
Then there must be some place where they enter through.
You've heard of that?
"No It's quite alright, but a bit cold in...from October and into November."
So...
"""I like to pull pranks so much, tjomfallera, tjomafallera, hey!"""
I remember when
"I remember, I remember when I lost my mind"
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space
And when you're out there without care
"Yeah, I was out of touch"
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice
"Come on now, who do you"
"Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?"
"Ha ha ha, bless your soul"
You really think you're in control?
"Well, I think you're crazy"
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart
To live their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
"Is thinking, I want to be like them"
Ever since I was little
"Let's go, aunty."
I welcome you on behalf of the Delhi Citizens Committee.
And I request the chief guest to start the function.
In today's function we have gathered to congratulate... ... those brave young pilots... ...who have risked their lives for their country.
And in the process they have set such standards of bravery... ... that every citizen of India is proud of them.
The State has already honoured them and will continue to do so.
But I believe that there is no greater award... ... than the love and good wishes of the people.
The first name in the list of award winners is...
You're surprised because you've seen flight lieutenant Arun Varma.
You look like Arun Varma.
I am his son.
Arun Varma died...
I shall tell you everything after the function.
But permit her presence here when I receive the medal.
You mean...
The person because of whom this day is a part of my life.
She's responsible for what I am and for the award that I'm receiving.
Please permit her to be a part of this happy moment of my life.
I would consider it the greatest honour.
I would also like to meet this person.
Please call her.
Mother...
"Come here, mother."
"Go, Vandana."
Suraj is calling you.
Me?
"- Yes, mother."
I am calling you.
Did you tell Suraj everything?
"No, a son has recognised his mother."
Go.
"Come, mother."
Is me.
Sing your song at the beep.
"Hi, M.J."
This is Peter.
I was on my way to your show and...
"Well, I was on my bike..."
Are you there?
I really was planning on it all day.
And... ...I know you predicted I'd disappoint you.
Bingo.
"Is amazing, isn't it?"
How complicated a simple thing... ...Iike being someplace at 8:00 can become.
"Actually, there was this obnoxious usher."
"Somebody has to talk to that usher, M.J."
Your time has expired.
Please deposit 50 cents for the next five minutes.
I wanna tell you the truth.
Here it is.
I'm Spider-Man.
"Weird, huh?"
Now you know why I can't be with you.
"If my enemies found out about you... ...if you got hurt, I could never forgive myself."
I wish I could tell you how I feel about you.
Ladies and gentlemen... ...my wife Rosie and I would like to welcome you this afternoon.
"But first, before we start... ...has anybody lost a large roll of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?"
Because we found the rubber band.
Is a terrible joke.
But thank you for coming.
Today... ...you will witness the birth of a new fusion-based energy source.
"Safe, renewable energy and cheap electricity for everyone."
And now let me introduce my assistants.
These four actuators were developed and programmed... ...for the sole purpose of creating successful fusion.
"Needless to say, camel blood is different."
The red blood cells are oval-- not round like a human's.
When water rushes in... the cells of most species rupture if they swell past 150%.
Camel cells can increase 240% without bursting.
A camel may drink more than a third of its body weight as it rehydrates.
In lands barren and inhospitable as any on the planet... camels do more than survive.
They race.
[gunshot]
[camels groaning]
Camels can hit speeds of 25 miles an hour.
The races are big business in the Middle East.
Racing stables in search of breeding stock import wild camels all the way from Australia.
"When it comes to survival in the desert, the camel wins by a nose."
Our first two animals survive storms at sea... and on land.
But flash floods can be fatal to anyone.
[thunder]
NARRATOR:
A storm in the desert.
Short.
Violent.
Sand soaks up rain slowly.
So water falls off hills.
Flash flood!
You can run... but you can't hide.
"In the desert, floods soon subside."
"For the animal crawling into number 8, the water is both life and death."
Desert ants make the most of the flood.
Drinking heavily.
It could be years before the next rains.
[thunder]
"In the Amazon, there are two seasons."
Wet... and wetter.
On my wife's advice.
Look.
My first premium was for 1501 rupees..
There's a well-known temple in the South.
I paid it there.
"Then, I've been paying 1000 rupees every year.. ..at Lord Ganesha's stall."
It's called a mandap.
"And, your honour, my mother-in-law used to be very sick."
"So, the temple authorities said, "" Pay us 11,000.. """
""" ..perform a veneration and watch the miracle "" ."
We performed the veneration and my mother-in-law passed away.
"That was a good thing, but I also lost 11,000."
And they didn't refund a single rupee.
"And then, donation at the mosque.. ..blanket at the shrine, candle at church, alms for beggar.. ..incense sticks, veil for Mother Goddess."
ln total I've paid around 10 lakhs in all these stores.
Enough!
Enough!
Don't call it a store.
It's called a temple.
And people donate willingly at the temple.. ..for the peace and prosperity of their family.
Even I gave this amount.. ..for the peace and prosperity of my family.
And not for fun.
But your God snatched all the peace from my life.
Because only God can cause earthquakes.
Humans cannot do it.
"So tell me, don't I've a right to ask God for compensation?"
Mr. Kanji.
"You've a tiff with God, don't you?"
- Yes.
So why don't you ask Him directly for compensation?
Why are you asking the temples?
Which company supplies electricity to your home?
Tanning accelerator for the pastiest inner thighs on a planet?*
They don't make that.
Guess I'm standing here.*
"Mom, do you trust me?"
"Right I mean you think I have a good judgement, right?##"
"Well, you're smarter than I'm."
You've been telling that since your 4th grade.
"Great, can I get a tattoo"
No.
I'm not a totally square.
"Alright, last year when you wanted the magenta stripe in your bangs"
We've got this stripe.
"Yeah, and I hated this stripe because it turned on me."
I thought it was so daring and cool.
I showed up last year and everyone had color hair even the special-ed kids##
"No tatoos, Sam"
"No bikers named Satan showing up here asking for date, no Sam."
No
It's been two years mom.
You have to let go.
Dad wouldn't let you carry him around like this.
"You and your father having that discussion about tattoos, that's something I would like to have seen."
Yeah
"Come on, let's zip this sucker up"
You'll have a great time
Are you ready?
"Dear Diary, How many calories are in grape*?"
I gained 1.7 pounds this weekend.
"It was a box of rasin nuts, that Josh brought on Friday that did it."
I know it.
"He just stopped* holding my hand halfway through the movie and I crashed into into this total panic thinking he's disgustedby me, he's dumping me"
This is so stupid.
"Now the kids get all excited and say ""Alright, I am going vegan!"""
And just God knows what they are telling the parents.
"If your diet consists of nothing but Oreos, Skittles, Airheads, Fritos,"
"Sour Patch Kids, and Big League Chew you are going to die."
This is not healthy.
I do not know if kids hear that.
"""I am going to live."""
"On a healthier note you have your scrambled eggs, I have my scrambled tofu."
Pancakes.
"You don't have to use cow's milk, use soy milk, oat milk , rice milk, almond milk, coconut milk, hemp milk."
Fruits and vegetables.
Spaghetti.
Pasta.
Refried beans.
"Even have vegan sour cream,"
"Guacamole, comes from the avocado."
Soy cheese.
Rice cheese.
They even have this magical cheese I'll get to in a sec.
Veggie burger.
Veggie dog.
"Cupcakes, they have egg replacer."
I think I got them here.
"So you can replace the eggs with bananas, applesauce even."
"You can use soy milk, oat milk, more flour, water."
Coconut milk ice cream.
One of the best ice creams in the world.
"Again, it's not healthy, but healthier than cow milk ice cream."
"I've always said to people, ""Wait a minute, if you can put a man or a woman on the moon, how hard is it to make a cheese that doesn't come from a cow, or a goat?"
"How is it hard to make a vegan cheese?"""
"Well, they heard me."
"This is called a Daiya cheese actually, and it's great thing."
You know what I'm saying?
We're going by the lyrics.
"Although you may want to wrench your fingers from embarrassment, you have to."
"Now we'll be filming the scene of where I reminiscence about a ""Coffee Shop"""
I say this a lot but acting is very difficult and it doesn't match well with me...
I think that's what it is.
But today's weather is great.
"Wait, no it's not."
I didn't realize because of my sunglasses.
Anyway I have to film the scene where I'm reminiscing about an ex-girlfriend.
But people are staring so I'm embarrassed.
"Still, I gotta try my best."
"Today is the day before the last day of filming for ""Coffee Shop""."
Tomorrow is the last day and today is the day before that.
Many passerby's are taking photos of us.
It feels strange and interesting.
I like it.
I like it a lot.
There isn't much time until we go back.
Tomorrow is the last day of shooting and we leave the day after that.
I want to enjoy NY more while I'm here.
There hasn't been enough time to look around.
What do you want to do?
Me?
Just walking around here a little bit would be fantastic.
"You have a lot of time, walk around."
I'm done filming.
I feel down.
I'm wearing my own gear today
These are the most recent pair I purchased.
I got to dance in a battle with great dancers.
Rainy New York morning.
"Shalu, give me a kiss, please!"
No ki. .ss.
"All this has to be done after marriage, not before marriage."
"Neelambar, neither are you married, nor I.Then what are you talking about?"
You openly express love in the garden.
Don't you feel ashamed?
Why should I feel ashamed?
- Why are you quiet?
Answer me.
Why don't you speak?
- I'm speaking so loudly. . . and you say I'm not speaking?
You have fallen in love.
- Wish what you are saying was true.
"But no, I have not fallen in love."
"Pitambar, he is not telling you, but me and Shalu."
"Oh, so you were talking to these two and I was interrupting . . . and adding to the confusion?"
But what were they doing?
"We have never done it, so how do we know? and reached the garden so soon."
- And will reach marriage stage soon.
"But remember, no kiss, no risk."
"Sir, the information is confirmed."
The diamond dealing will be done in Hotel Blue Diamond's swimming pool.
"Sir, the diamonds are worth 100 million rupees."
Which police officer has been given the responsibility of such a big case?
"Sir, a very capable officer, Inspector Gorpade."
Gorpade?
The one who could not attend the meeting of his own case. . . how will he nab the culprits?
"Sir, agreed that you and Gorpade don't share a good relationship."
That doesn't mean you don't consider him capable of any job.
Even he has solved many big cases.
Is it?
"Gentlemen, what time was this meeting scheduled?"
David:
"Over 6,000."
Elisabeth:
"Over 6,000?"
"So, there are plenty of people, um, experiencing this as well, like you do"
"So, can you just explain for everybody exactly what being an asexual actually means and how it is to live that way?"
David:
An asexual person is someone who doesn't experience sexual attraction.
David:
"So, the way that, you know, most sexual people walking down the street and you see someone or you're in a relationship with someone at some point, you feel like introducing sexuality into that."
That just never happens to asexual people.
Joy:
And is it a problem?
David:
"No, it's not a problem."
Joy:
"So, then, why do you need to organize?"
[laughter]
David:
There's a lot of things that are not a problem that you can organize around.
"We need to organize, well, partially, because it's not getting talked about."
"Because, um-"
Star:
"If you're not talking about sex, what's there to talk about?"
[laughter]
Joy:
Thank you!
[laughter]
Star:
"I mean, I don't understand."
[laughter]
David:
It depends what this bx term does.
"But if we look at the choices, the only choice that intercepts the y-axis below the x-axis at a negative y-intercept and opens down is choice A."
"There's only three choices that open down, and only choice A intercepts in the negative area, so the answer is A."
"It actually looks eerily like what I drew, just out of the blue."
Next question.
Problem number 12.
"OK, so they drew a square."
"And I will draw a square, because they drew a square."
"And they say this is A, this is B, this is C, D."
And this is P.
This is Q.
And out here is R.
"I don't know where this problem's going, but it looks interesting."
"Figure not drawn to scale, of course."
"In the figure above, ABCD is a rectangle, with"
BC is equal to 4.
AB is equal to 6.
"P, Q, and R are different points on a line, not shown, that is parallel to AD."
"So P, Q, and R are apparently all on the same line that is parallel to AD."
"Well, I guess that is the way they drew it."
So let me erase.
Let's just say this is Q.
That R is down here.
This isn't R.
So they're all on the same line.
"And they say the line isn't shown, but it's parallel to AD."
So let me draw that line.
So that line looks something like this.
Let me draw it straight.
"And on that line, you have P, Q, and R, and it is parallel to AD."
Good enough.
Points P and Q are symmetric about line AB.
So let me do that.
So let me connect the dots as best as I can.
"This should be a line, not a curve."
"My hand isn't 100% steady, but I think you get-- let me do it a little bit better than that."
I think I can do a better job than that.
Let me draw-- that's even worse.
All right.
Last attempt.
That's throwing me off.
So last attempt right here.
There you go.
So that's that first line right there. y is equal to 3x plus 1.
So let me do the second one now.
"So it's written in standard form right now, 2y plus 4 is equal to 6x."
"We want to get this in slope-intercept form, y is equal to mx plus b."
So a good place to start could be to subtract this 4 from both sides.
So it goes on the other side.
So let's subtract 4 from both sides of this equation.
"The left-hand side, we're left with just a 2y, and then the right-hand side becomes 6x minus 4."
So 2y is equal to 6x minus 4.
"And then to get everything in terms to solve for y, we just have to divide everything by 2."
"So let's divide everything by 2, and we get y is equal to 3x minus 2."
So that's the second equation in slope-intercept form.
So same drill here.
The y-intercept is negative 2.
"So we go-- that's negative 1, negative 2 right there, and its slope is 3."
And notice its slope is the same as the other line.
So it's going to have the same inclination.
"If we move 1 in the x-direction, we move up 3 in the y-direction."
"1, up 3."
Just like that.
"If we go back 1 in x, we go down 3."
"So, the search and rescue team...?"
"No, this was the astronauts."
"Oh, the astronauts themselves -"
Yes.
They were in with us.
We'd fly out to Houston...
The astronauts fly...
"We just spent like a week, 4 or 5 days or whatever it would be at the time."
And we'd go out and then we'd make changes.
"And back in, and back out."
"There were always 4 or 5 of them or 3 or 4 of them on the plane with us, just..."
And there was that original 8 or 10 astronauts.
Do you recall any of their names?
No.
"We were on missions, you know."
Because that's who the ones were.
So that was -
"I wish we had gotten autographs or something, but then again, you do stuff like this, and it's your job."
Never gave it a thought that it was anything other than a job.
"They were flying on the plane with you, to help you get acquainted with how to rescue them?"
"Yeah, just to see."
"And it was probably to reassure them too, you know, because"
"like I said, the Navy primarily was in the Pacific and then they had another alternate route over there north of the Canaries."
Like between the Canaries and [?]
Someplace in that area.
If I remember right.
"But anyplace in the world, we had a"
C-130 that could reach them within 4 hours.
Any place.
"And our plane was over by Singapore, Hong Kong."
But we had one in Chile.
"And, I don't know, we probably had one wherever the..."
The ice is melting.
But the frog is dead.
Unless it can kick start its heart.
Blood flows.
Nerves twitch.
The frog is back from the dead.
"There's no frostbite, no damage."
The spring ponds of the north are free from competition.
No other frog can survive life in the deep freeze.
NARRATOR:
The next incredible story of survival comes from down on the farm.
[rooster crows]
"It's September 10, 1945."
Farmer Lloyd Olsen is having chicken for dinner.
He selects a five-month-old rooster called Mike.
The headless chicken carried on as though nothing had happened.
A blood clot prevented him from bleeding to death.
"Mike's head was gone, but most of the brain stem and one ear was intact."
And a brain stem provides all the thinking power a chicken needs to survive.
Mike the headless chicken became famous.
Feeding was a problem.
Farmer Lloyd dropped water and grain down what was left of Mike's gullet.
Mike not only survived-- he thrived.
Mike the chicken struts into number 4 because he lived for 18 months without a head.
"Unfortunately, Mike had a mucus problem and needed an eyedropper to clear his airways."
"One day, Lloyd couldn't get to the eyedropper fast enough... and his headless chicken died."
But Mike's legend lives on.
The animals crawling into number 3 thrive in the underworld.
Rats.
We think they're dirty.
Disgusting.
Diseased.
"And this holiday season, let us reaffirm our commitment to each other, as family members, as neighbors, as Americans, regardless of our color or creed or faith."
"Let us remember that we are one, and we are a family."
"So on behalf of Malia and Sasha and Michelle and our grandmother-in-chief, Marian -- (laughter)"
"-- I wish you all the happiest holiday season, the merriest of Christmases."
"God bless you all, and may God bless the United States of America."
(applause)
"And with that, I'm going to invite the entire Obama clan up here to light the Christmas tree."
"I need some help, and there's a lot of technical aspects to this."
(laughter)
"Come on, guys."
(applause)
All right.
"Okay, we're going to start counting down here."
We've got the switch right here.
The First Lady:
"All right, come on."
The President:
Everybody ready?
And this is the new tree.
"I know it's not quite as big as the old tree, but it's going to take time to grow."
But we're going to fill it up with some spirit and start a new tradition right now.
"All right, everybody ready?"
We're going to start counting down.
"Five, four, three, two, one -- (applause)"
There you go.
That's a good-looking tree.
"Thank you, everyone."
Now I have come to the crossroads in my life
I always knew what the right path was.
"Without exception, I knew."
But I never took it.
You know why?
It's fantastic every step of the way.
Dorm life is great.
"I love, love living here."
It's a great way to meet new people.
It's alot of fun.
You make so many new friends.
I have a big room.
That's nice.
Living in the dorms is probably where I've met the most diverse group of people.
"Here at U.R.I., we have this thing called the Living and Learning Community."
I lived in the Living Learning Community at Morrow.
"If you need help, you'd go to your neighbors."
"If you have some kind of random question, all you'd have to do is poke your head out the hallway and ask someone, which is so convenient."
Chances are somebody else will understand it.
The food's phenomenal I really like how we have a variety of food.
The grilled cheese.
I have never had onion rings like I have at home.
Well I'd definitely say that my favorite food in the stir fry.
The stir fry.
"They're crispy, the onions are soft."
I like to get the omelettes at Butterfield.
"On weekdays, there's omelettes."
All you can eat buffet.
"Its alot of variety, there's alot of options here on campus."
I like to put yogurt and granola and banana in a bowl and mix it up.
It's healthy if you're trying to eat healhty.
"Usually every Friday, it's nacho night."
"There's plenty of pizza and chicken nuggets, everything a college student needs."
I love the campus.
I fell in love with the campus.
A ton of nice people here.
"You can't help but smile, it's so nice here."
SO its 2 times 2 minus 3 times 4
SO that's 4 minus 12.
"So its -8i minus, remember we have to swap signs, plus-minus-plus when you are taking the determinant."
"So you ignore the j, so its 4 times 2 = 8 minus 3 times 3 which is -1."
So this would be a -1 here but there is already a negative here so its a +1j.
"And then finally the k, you cross out that column."
4 times 4 is 16.
16 -6 =10.
So plus 10.
Let me be sure I got that correct.
"So the first one, I always have to make sure, so i I got yup, 4-12 = -8 and negative j ... 4 times 2 is 8 minus 9 = -1 but j has a negative so that's right."
"And then k, 4 times 4 is 16."
16 -6 = 10.
So that looks right.
So plus...plus 10k.
So this vector right here is the vector d.
I just figured it out.
"Now if we take the cross product of d with vector a the vector that was....you can kinda view it as lying along this line over here, then we will get a vector that is normal to this plane."
"We can call that vector n, for normal, that is normal to this yellow plane that will actually sit on this white plane."
"So lets figure it out, we will see in a few steps, probably in the next video why is that actually useful."
"So lets take, lets find what is d cross a... this is equal to our normal vector which is = same thing. i..j...k."
"We are gonna take d which is -8, 1, 10 and take the cross of that and vector a which is 2,3,4. and we will get, actually, I will continue this in the next video so that I do not make these videos too long."
- Her Grace is gone.
Find her.
- My lady.
"- You men, with me."
- Sir.
"So, she's definitely left the palace?"
"Yes, sir."
We saw her guards ourselves.
Get me more details.
Sir.
"Here it is, here's the two seconds."
-Balls to you!
"-Yeah, that's it."
Ballz to you!
"Yeah, now that clip's been floating around, it was posted like three days ago and suddenly it's everybody's catchphrase."
-Balls to you!
-Now I don't know why she said it.
I don't know the context.
"I can't imagine what the interviewer could've asked her to get her to say,"
-Balls to you!
-But everyone told me the rest of the interview went normal and that...
-Balls to you!
"-Was just one soundbite and she wasn't yelling, ""Balls to you"" to everyone."
"I mean, I would've yelled it to everyone, but she didn't."
But I'm on board.
Balls to you is hilarious.
"It's probably the best video that you've ever watched, you just don't realize it yet."
"Don't worry, you'll get it in like a week."
"You'll wake up in the middle of the night like,"
"""Oh, balls to me."""
And I sincerely hope that one of those YouTube guys makes a Balls To You remix.
"-Balls to you, b-balls to you"
"-Yeah, or something like that."
"Come on, balls to you doesn't have to be insulting."
It could be a term of endearment.
"Balls to you guy, sir."
[chuckles]
"Balls to you, sir."
Now I remember you guys sent me this video like a year ago and I thought it was funny but I didn't get time to review it.
"But now suddenly the video's blown up, which suggests that it aired on TV somewhere."
Now the concept of the video is simple.
"A couple of stoners roll up to Taco Bell and order their food, but you know, as Elmo."
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
For the longest time
"Oh, oh, oh"
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for
Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Let me see.
Copy and paste it.
Let me copy and paste the next several problems.
We could just move-- be streamlined about it.
"OK, they all fit."
Good enough.
What is the equation of the line that has slope of 4 and passes through the point 3 comma minus 10?
"So if the slope is 4, we know that the line-- so just rewrite it in slope y-intercept form again. mx plus b."
They're telling us that the slope is 4.
So we know the equation of the line is y is equal to 4x plus the y-intercept.
And then we could figure out the y-intercept by substituting in this point that they say it goes through.
So it goes through the point 3 comma negative 10.
So y is equal to minus 10 when x is equal to 3.
So 4 times x. x is equal to 3.
Plus b.
So what is that?
That's minus 10 is equal to 12 plus b.
"We could subtract 12 from both sides of this equation, and we get minus 22."
Minus 10 minus 12 is minus 22.
This 12 obviously goes away.
Is equal to b.
"So the equation of our line is y is equal to 4x plus b, which we just figured out is minus 22."
4x minus 22.
That's choice A.
Problem 30.
"The date in the table show the cost of renting a bicycle by the hour, including a deposit."
"If hours, h, were graphed on the horizontal axis-- let me see if I can draw that."
"So that is on the horizontal axis I have hours, h."
So this is h.
"And costs were graphed on the vertical axis, so let me draw the vertical axis."
So cost is on the vertical axis.
What would be the equation of the line that fits the data?
And if I'm offered to drive in a
Ferrari I don't ask questions.
I just drive it.
The problem with this situation is that I'm now at
least a year late to reviewing the Spider.
You've all read about it and watched the video so you need to see something different.
"Now I've searched YouTube and there are lots of beautiful shoots and factual films, but there isn't much bad behavior."
"I've, therefore, decided in the interest of original programming that I'm going to drive this car"
like a complete idiot.
[CAR ENGlNE]
[TlRES SQUEALlNG]
[CAR ENGlNE]
[TlRES SQUEALlNG]
[CAR ENGlNE]
"Well, I have to say, it's dead impressive for a car with a conventional construction that's got no roof."
"570 horsepower, at about 1550 kilograms, at"
"little bit less, actually."
It's just as fast as you ever wanted a car to be.
Very direct steering.
I've got the suspension in full firm at the moment.
But I might just try and soften it off a bit and see what it does.
[TlRES SQUEALlNG]
It might make the car a bit lazier.
[CAR ENGlNE]
I hope you can get some of this noise.
Because it's--
[CAR ENGlNE]
That's the defining aspect of the 458.
It's normally aspirated.
It makes a noise that the McLaren just can't hope to match.
[CAR ENGlNE]
The problem with these flippin' Spiders these days is they kind of undo my argument that you have to have a hard top on the driving front.
I was struck that these students knew more than I did.
I was in med school and was one of the best in my class in Uppsala.
But these Indians knew more than I did.
"I was thinking, ""This can't be right."
"They're Hindu!"""
"""They have caste marks and limited schooling."" But they were brilliant."
The first day I attended a course in internal medicine.
The instructor questioned us on renal cancer.
"After the fourth question I couldn't answer any more, but they knew more."
It was a strange experience.
Stockholm City Hall - Have you lectured here?
"- No, but I've eaten dinner here."
This ceiling is Stockholm's best big screen.
"It'll be like ""divine truth""."
Rehearsal Knowledge Gala 2008 Let's see how close we can get...
- Hi!
Hans Rosling.
- We're testing your equipment.
"So, that's it?"
"Wow, that's gorgeous!"
So you take care of this machine?
And then you project from here...
Doesn't that cause distortion?
"It creates a nice feeling, like the ceiling tilting."
Our presentation comes from page...
Here!
This is a great picture.
Mom and Dad are in our basement in SvartbŠcken with the box for us in Mozambique where Agneta and I worked.
Food was extremely scarce in communist Mozambique.
"They packed crispbread, fish balls, spaghetti and raisins."
The kids loved it when the box from home arrived.
"In autumn 1967 I helped arrange a meeting in Uppsala for Eduardo Mondlane, first leader of Mozambique's liberation front."
Janelle I'm so sorry.
I should've talked to you first
You're nervous.
I understand.
Let me make it up.
We're going to that Italian restaurant we saw
I'll get you a nice-a table by the fireplace-a.
"Hey Ross, Rachel."
"Hi, I just wanted to come in and say that I think it's great."
Two peopel who work together are having an open and honest relationship
"Well, I think that relationships that could potentially ruin people's professional careers should be left confidential."
For how long
Five months
"So, what do we do now"
"Well, sir, it's not like we can just make it go away."
"I mean, let's face it."
You let the genie out of the bottle.
We only kissed
What's up Carter
James.
Romantic complications.
The guy I'm seeing is a boxer.
"Yesterday, I was overcome with emotion and I accientially outed### him."
"Personally, I think bennet should be proud of who he is, but, uh, I may have irreparably damaged his career."
"Bottom line is, I care about the guy."
He's not returning my calls
I'm here for you buddy
It was an awkward moment and somehow it led to a kiss
But we're both single consenting adults and if we choose to move forward as a couple
Ms Cooper would undoubtedly take a different job here in city hall.
"I however, would still be the mayor"
Why are you being so upfront with us
Thank God.
"It would have been sad if I wasted two videos and ended up with a careless, negative number."
Anyway.
"So now we have s squared plus a squared, over s squared, times y is equal to this."
Multiply both sides times s squared over-- s squared plus a squared.
"Divide both sides by this, and we get y is equal to 1 over s squared-- And actually, let me make sure that that is right."
"It's 1 over s squared. y is equal to 1 over s squared, times s squared, over s squared plus a squared."
And then these cancel out.
And let me make sure that I haven't made another careless mistake.
Because I have a feeling I have.
Yep.
There.
I see the careless mistake.
And it was all in this term.
"And I hope you don't mind my careless mistakes, but I want you to see that I'm doing these things in real time and"
"I am human, in case you haven't realized already."
"Anyway, so I made the same careless mistake."
"So I factor out an e to the minus st here, so it's plus."
But it was a over s squared.
So this is an a.
That's an a.
And so this is an a.
And so this is an a.
And so this is an a.
Right?
This was an a.
And this is the correct answer. a over s squared plus a squared.
So I hope those careless mistakes didn't throw you off too much.
These things happen when you do integration by parts twice with a bunch of variables.
"But anyway, now we are ready to add a significant entry into our table of Laplace transforms."
"And that is that the Laplace transform-- I had an extra curl, there."
That was unecessary.
"When they got back to [?] and found out about three days later, the nun gets a letter from the - the nun that was the principal there and she'd never want to see us here at Beaver"
Island again.
"All we did was, they had Lloyd's cabin out there"
A bunch of the cabins like that.
And the chaperones are in one and the kids are in one.
So Gary and I and a couple of - we just showed up and we went and had refreshments for them until about 5 in the morning.
"Poor kids get on the boat, and Dad was on the boat going over to Charlevoix at the time."
He was the manager.
I had to go over for some reason or other.
I forget what the reason was.
It was rougher than hell.
So I just called the airplane.
I flew.
I wasn't gonna take the boat.
So I get over there and get cleaned up and everything.
I hadn't had enough sleep either.
You had to hollow them all down.
Now you got them all partied up and we had to take them all down to the boat.
The students at the party we went to all night.
"So, your high school class was hollowing what students now?"
The students from [?] that were over here - going back and forth to visit.
So then I got to Charlevoix because I'm down at the dock.
The old man was catching the line and stuff.
I'm looking up and here they are.
And they are green.
Some thought it was the greatest thing that ever happened.
I ... at a cattle sale.
A restaurant there.
Because they're working in the restaurants and stuff like that.
It was - I thought I was in love with this one but she was pretty rich so that didn't help any.
For the night.
We had a dance you know.
"Good, so, I'm not gonna write it out, but you can write this out, ok?"
I'm gonna put dot dot dot there which means you finish the argument.
Ok?
"The other thing, of course, to check is that q and q are not zero."
Are they not zero?
"Well, by the ordered pair... the set we defined, it's not."
So you don't have to worry.
"Ok, great."
What is the second thing that you might check?
Symmetry!
"Ok q... is p coma... ok, what does that mean?"
"If p q tilde m n, does that imply, m n tilde p q?"
"First of all, do you agree that this is what we have to show?"
Good.
"Secondly, do you... can you see how you write this out?"
"Which, I won't bore you with."
"Yeah... this condition mean p m equals q n and this condition means this this equals this this, m q equals n p, is that the same thing?"
"Yes, Adam says it's the same thing, so, again, I'll let you finish that argument."
"Now, the third one is perhaps the most interesting one."
The third thing to check.
"Because if you look at it, it's actually not so obvious."
"Oh, I realize I could have used that board, but that's ok."
"Ok, this one says if p q tilde m n..."
"I gotta check that this... and if m n tilde... give me another pair of letters, maybe a b, then, is it true that p q tilde a b?"
There is a question.
Is that true?
"Ok, so this actually where it is very important to just be a little careful, ok?"
"So I'm gonna give you a hint as to how one goes, and you can verify this, ok?"
For a little bit of homework for next time.
"So one thing that you'll have to use... so try this... so, you'll have to use a property of the integers, which is the cancelation law."
"You don't have division, but it's the next best thing to division."
Ok?
"I like the white, white pages."
"White, easy to read white stuff."
We get some people in here that like to work too much.
"White on the dark, and making him really dizzy. ,, ."
"I used to, um, I used to be in charge of a lot of the websites for a university."
And I imagine that dealing with academia is very similar to dealing with the government. .
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, science is academia, science at Stanford."
"Exactly, it is."
"Really challenging, and I feel your pain. ,, ."
"Yeah, but it's, it's, it's, yeah."
"It's a, it's a challenge.'Cause I do want done."
"And, you know, it is hard to work on a team."
"Because everyone has a different, uh, view of what a website should look like."
"Well, and I think that the biggest challenge for me was getting, getting."
People to understand that the website isn't about them and it shouldn't be what they want.
"It should be for the audience, who is going to the website and how do they consume information in, in the easiest, most efficient way."
Yeah.
Right.
And that's what the content management system department.
"Exactly. , can be the other way around."
"But um, I, like I said, you're side is very helpful, I, you guys have so many good programs I wish I had more time to just sit and just watch some of them."
And then I got this new DA 100 camera but there's really not much happening there for that one. .
"But uh, we do have some digital uh reflex uh, it's at least for the moving piece, um, that's the part I. Used to."
"I mean, I bet my constant was a negative 79."
"I mean, forever."
"But uh, there's digital ones that are, they, they have a lot more stuff, they're a"
little more complicated.
They do.
"I have um, a 90, a D 90."
"The, oh yeah, yeah, the"
D 90.
So
I think kids are going to push my buttons.
"And that's the thing that scares me the most about going back to school, just the other kids."
"After three short months, Adam is starting again at Boston High."
His brief success in the jail classroom is a stark contrast to what he is about to face.
It's like asking a baby to read.
And I said it was like to trying to make gold out of straw like Rumpelstiltskin.
And mom said it was like trying to make silk purse out of--
Adam is still well below grade level and Doctor Andrea Weiss worries that there is nothing in place to help him.
"When I went back to test him, he hadn't made any progress."
But he shouldn't have.
There was no way for him to make progress because he needs specialized instruction.
He's not going to get it by osmosis.
"He's not going to stand in a room and it's going to, you know, kind of go through his pores."
It's not going to happen.
"He needs somebody to say, look, this is the way to do it."
This is the structure.
This is the recipe.
It works every time.
And then he'll own it.
What's that called?
Food chain.
Exactly.
Food chain.
Adam has been placed in two Special Ed classes.
"But the kids here have such a wide variety of learning problems, that, ironically, Adam appears to be doing better than he really is."
An element in all organisms is--
Carbon.
"Carbon, exactly."
"Academically, he's probably at the top of my classes."
"I have the whole gammut, you know."
"I have real low level, acting out kids."
I sat freeze
I heard some poor guy standing near the candy machine got hit
"When I bite into a York peppermint Patty, I get shot"
"Okay, people, here is our problem."
The mayor was caught handing money to a known prostitute
You lost me my job
My lawyer says I have an open-and-shut case.
"See you in court, Sonny."
You cannot believe what I have been through tonight.
"I have spent the whole night, scouring the city, searching for the mayor"
"Hey, is that breakfast?"
There he is
Good morning people
"Alright, I'm sure we are all focused on the same problem, so let's get right down to it."
Mr Fluffy
"The children's zoo mascot, has recovered from mange..."
"And he's now available for petting, However, until he's completely out of the Woods, there is a 2-stroke maximum.**"
Mr Scruffy's speedy recovery is notwithstanding
"Mr Fluffy, Carter"
"I've seen him, Mike."
His fluffy days are way behind him
Don't we still* have that tiny problem of the photo of the mayor with the prostitute?
That's over with.
"I found the mayor, he's not with the prostitute last night. so our strategy in#### dealing with this is straight denial."
What do I say if somebody asks me about this
Tell theem you don't know anything.
But I don't.
But I don't know anything
Very good.
Hope you all learn from James
Learn what?
Will you stop showing off?
Thank god
"Most importantly, calm this man down because he's shocked"
Thief!
You thief!
You shorty!
"Dad calm down, it's no big deal that he's short egyptian singing"
"Excuse me, prove what happened now at tomorrow's case"
Luck was on our side this time
"Mahmoud should be with you tomorrow morning at court and you're ready, right?"
Ofcourse!
Today's case will really help us and I've made a deal with the officer
"I'd love to know, where has he been for 2 weeks"
"It's just like you see it, his actions are odd"
I'm very worried for him
What's the reason for this confusion?
Let's hope he stays that way till tomorrow!
What if he doesn't get confused tomorrow at court and told him everything?
How would we solve that?
We're ready for everything Mr.Sameh
"Medical statements, the guy who got hit yesterday."
Everything!
These will really help us
As long as he's at court tomorrow
"Mr.Mahmoud, what do you have to say for what's being said about you?"
Mr.Mahmoud
Yes?
What do you have to say about this 'Alzheimer's' case
I don't know
How don't you know?
This is a statement from your doctor
With a list of medications you used to take
"Also, a court case from yesterday"
And then decide what you want to do.
*I saw your eyes today in court when* *I explained the significance of 3 a. m.*
*It's not going to stop* *until Emily's story is told. *
Are you gonna make a statement?
Do you believe it was the devil?
Is the defense ready to proceed?
"Yes, Your Honor."
The defense recalls Father Richard Moore.
The witness is reminded that he is still under oath.
- When did you last see Emily alive?
- The night before she died.
"Her mother, Maria, called me and said that Emily had asked for me."
- Why did she ask to see you?
- To give me this.
Did Emily explain to you the letter's significance?
Yes.
She said she'd written it the morning after the failed exorcism... ...and that it was important for me to share.
"Father Moore, was Emily a good person?"
I believe that one day Emily will be recognized as a saint.
- So she loved God.
- Yes.
She was very devout.
"Father Moore, if Emily loved God... ...if she was so good and so devout, why do you think God... ...allowed this to happen?"
- Objection.
What is the relevance of that question?
Father Moore's belief in this matter is crucial... ...in establishing his and Emily's understanding of her condition.
"And that mutual understanding is paramount in determining... ...whether Father Moore was, in fact, negligent."
I'm going to allow it.
"Your Honor, you're not really gonna let someone testify... ...about why God would allow the death of a young girl?"
The objection has been overruled.
"Again, Father Moore:"
Why did God allow Emily to become possessed by demons and then die?
"OK, so they just want to know cost as a function of hours."
So let's see.
It's a linear relationship.
We could treat this just like any other line.
So if we write it as y equals mx plus b.
I didn't even have to do this.
So y is equal to mx plus b.
"So m, or the slope, is equal to change in y over-- or let me write it differently."
Because we want it in terms of-- so we could write c is equal to the slope times the hours plus b.
"Instead of x, we have hours, and instead of y, we have the cost."
So what's the slope?
"Slope is equal to change in the dependent variable, change in cost, divided by change in the independent variable, divided by change in hours."
So let's see.
"If when our hours increased by 3, how much did our change in c go by?"
"When we go from 2 to 5, so if we say 5 minus 2, that's how much we changed in hours."
That's delta h.
Then how much did we change in cost?
Well it's 30 minus 15.
So it equals 15 over 3. which is equal to 5.
So we figured out the slope.
Slope is equal to 5.
Now we just have to figure out the y-intercept.
"So this equation, we could rewrite it as cost is equal to the slope, which is 5, times the hours plus whatever our y-intercept is."
"And then we just have to substitute one of the points in to solve for b, just like we did in the previous video."
"So let's substitute the point when h is equal to 2, c is equal to 15."
So the point 2 comma 15.
"So when h is equal to 2, c is equal to 15. c is equal to 15 when h is equal to 2."
And now we can just solve for b.
So you get 15 is equal to 10 plus b.
"Subtract 10 from both sides, you get b is equal to what?"
5.
"So the equation of this line is cost is equal to 5 times h plus our y-intercept, or plus our c-intercept we could say."
"Emily Rose's condition, in fact, was demonic possession."
An exorcism was her only hope for a cure.
Some of you may find yourself unable to reconcile Emily's beliefs... ...or those of the defendant with your own.
You may not believe demons exist.
You won't have to.
"Because you will see that after the utter failure of doctors to help Emily... ...Father Moore simply tried to help Emily in a different way... ...using an approach that he, Emily and her family firmly believed... ...was her only chance for relief."
And we will show that despite his greatest efforts... ...and his sincere love for Emily... *... there was nothing he could've done* *to prevent the death of Emily Rose. *
Are you okay?
Aren't you gonna eat anything?
*She said it was terrible to hear* *the clinking of spoons and forks. *
"She was always hungry, but she said they wouldn't let her eat."
"Who did she mean by ""they""?"
The forces that were in control of her.
That were inside her.
"You know, the demons."
Tell us what else happened that night.
I walked her back to her dorm... ...and she seemed really nervous and scared.
"*So I held her for a while,* *trying to calm her down. *"
"*I fell asleep, but when I woke up,* *she wasn't beside me. *"
Emily?
Hey.
Can you hear me?
"*I called her father, and he told me* *to bring Emily home. *"
*Jason and I put Emily to bed... *
*... hoping she would sleep. *
And when did Father Moore become involved?
Emily stayed home after that.
"She didn't return to school, and she kept getting worse."
"Eventually, when she didn't get better, we called our priest, Father Moore."
"When he arrived, I sent my daughter Alice upstairs..."
*... to see if Emily was awake. *
Emily?

There is one place you must never ever find yourself.
"Whatever you think you're doing, don't."
[soft music plays]
"I guess love to me... is meant to be, you know, that warm feeling inside."
"Love is meant to make everything right, and everything complete, and everything whole."
"Love is meant to be, you know, as you see in the movies, the guy that pops into the screen, and steals your heart, and then never wants to leave."
"It's meant to be that white picket fence, that happy home."
"Like, I've looked for love... but I can't say I've found it in any one person or in any thing."
The first thing I think about is pain.
"You know, it's... to me it's scary."
It's vulnerable... and love really really hurts I guess.
"I don't want to feel loved by them, I don't want to love them. 'cause it just hurts and I guess I've been hurt one too many times by people and,"
"I've gone there too much, that it just scares the hell out of me, so when I get close to feeling love, I'll run."
"look, pray for us.."
You too pray for me go don't worry come on woman.. where is your drum? oh shit I forgot it.. never mind she brought it thank you Balçiçek.. how do you take this microphone out?
Ok.. go now are you ready?
"1,2,3000 hello dear guests.. welcome all..."
Tonight we will have a lot of fun.. me and my aunt oh I mean me and Mrs Kadriye will entertain you tonight although we are new to show bizz
Tonight we will dance and sing.. oh aunt kadriye stop thumping that drum..
I cannot hear myself talk..
I will give you time to play solo at the end of the program..
Why are you laughing?
She was always like this even when we were kids.. she didn't play the drum then but she used to hold it and hit our heads with it she's a real witch.. she is..
let's hear the drum aunt Kadriye..
"""Hoppa"""
Oh Great!
Why are you laughing?
Hey blondie why are you laughing???
You!! how can you laught with only 1 tooth in your mouth.. yeah you!.. they laugh a lot at everything..
Are you ready? we're ready
Ok let's start
We will start with a song
It was a wonderful concert.. thank you so this means you forgot last night
At one moment I began daydreaming and forgot everything
Who am I.. and where am I.. and what is this place
I just went with them and started daydreaming
Excuse me.
"I had to speak politely as the last time don't worry, be at ease.. it suits you more"
Aunt Kadriye it seems we have succeeded
I'll close my store and go on with show bizz from now on you're right
Get up girl and dance.. such a fool it seem they perfected the job
I hope they finish before they face any problems
God willing
"The food was extremely delicious when it comes to cooking, Nakiye is excellent"
Shewket what do you do?
So this is going to be 9 plus 27 is 36.
So that is 36.
"And if we want to add it to negative 81 over 4, we just have to find a common denominator."
"So all of this business is going to be equal to 2 pi times-- and so our common denominator can be 4, times something over 4."
"We have negative 81 over 4, and then 36 times 4 is 144."
Is that right?
"Yeah, that's 144."
"So 36 times 4, so it's plus 144."
30 times 4 is 120 plus another 24 is 144.
"So you have 144, essentially, minus 81."
"So this is going to be equal to 2 pi times-- and actually, I can even simplify it"
"little bit more, because we have a 2 here and a 4 there."
So divide the numerator and denominator by 2 so you get it over 2.
So you're going to have pi times-- this is going to be 44.
Let's see.
"If this was an 80, this would be 64."
So it's going to be 63.
Let me write it this way.
It's going to be 63 pi over 2.
Did I do that right?
60 plus 81 is 141.
"Add another 3, you get a 144."
Yep.
And we're done.
We figured out the volume of our front of jet engine-looking shape.

"""Blanksy's Beauties."""
No?
I've never even heard of that show.
"""Blanksy's Beauties"" aired only three months in 1977, and she was just 11."
Today she works as an administrator at a religious school.
"Her job history, as unsettled as her life."
She says she was 12 when she realized she had begun to live two lives at once-- the present and the past.
"Her mother, Roz."
She was not easy.
"And that's because everything that was going through her head, she couldn't explain."
"Her brother, Mike."
"There were things I would think to myself, why don't you just get over that."
She doesn't.
It was hard for them because they didn't really know what to do for me.
My brother is totally opposite of me.
"I'm screaming, and yelling, and crying, and they didn't really know what to do for me."
You can see the toll it seems to have taken on her year-by-year.
"This profound lesson she teaches about our memories, our lives."
"Is it possible our happiness and survival come from what we choose to edit, to forget?"
Because you said at one point that we have no idea how much of ourselves is created by editing our memories to shape ourselves.
Right.
And I don't do that.
"Like, I still feel bad about stuff that happened 30 years ago."
But we all do.
We can all remember one or two things.
But not one or two things.
Everything.
And I really live it and feel it.
"And I think, God, if I just done this, then I wouldn't have done this, and I wouldn't be here, and I'm always constantly doing that."
"Her father, Len, a Hollywood agent, looks back."
Most of us are like that oyster that has that little grain of sand.
I graduated from high school and went to college and business school.
"So, you know, it's important to get ahead in life."
"Sarah Lee keeps up the family tradition by attending the children's storefront school in Harlem, where at first she is a standout student."
"And to everybody who knows her, Sarah Lee is a leader, highly motivated, and highly verbal."
She can really hold a conversation.
She will talk to you.
"You say, alright,"
Sarah just a minute.
Just take a break for a minute.
"Go get you something to drink or get a fruit or something, just to hush her up for just a few minutes."
"[INAUDlBLE] been in the store, right?"
Yeah.
For a long time.
Told you.
"Feelin' it, feelin' it."
But in the fourth grade something changes.
She got real shy in history.
She wouldn't participate in classroom activities in history class.
She wouldn't come with the answers.
She would do her homework but it would take her a little longer.
So she got tired of being slower in the work.
"And she kept saying, mom, something is not right."
"Like, I couldn't understand."
My comprehension wasn't well.
And my vocabulary wasn't well.
And my reading skills wasn't well.
Her teacher also notices a puzzling difference between Sarah Lee's personality in class and out.
By nature she's very energetic and outgoing socially.
"But in class, a lot of time, it's the opposite."
She'll listen and she's not a behaviour issue.
And she'll sort of look at you and focus right at you.
"But I always wonder, you know, how much she's really absorbing."
Uht-oh.
That brought us to seventy.
We want to show fifty two.
What happened was we weren't paying attention to the scale or the units.
The value between each of our numbers is ten because this number line counts by tens.
What we really want is two jumps of one and that will bring us to fifty two.
Be very careful to pay attention to the unit marks on the number lines.
Let's model forty five on a number line.
As we see these numbers come up we're watching our scale and see it counts by ones.
"It starts with thirty five, goes to thirty six, thirty seven, thirty eight, and so on."
We have four tens in forty five.
We can start at forty.
"Five ones, we can do one jump of five."
Forty to forty five.
If we model eighty nine on the number line
"-again let's look at our scale- eighty, eighty one, eighty two, eighty three, and so on."
I see this is counting by ones again.
Eight tens is eighty.
"And, we have nine ones."
We could handle this in a couple of different ways.
Let's think about doing what we did last time.
A jump of five; eighty to eighty five.
"Then we need to do one, two, three, four more jumps of one and we're at eighty nine."
Let's try a three-digit number.
One hundred thirty two.
"Ninety, ninety five, one hundred, one hundred five."
Our number line counts by fives  so we need to think about that as we're working.
"We have one hundred, three tens, so let's jump three tens."
"I have to do five and five is ten, twenty, thirty (three tens) and two ones."
"One, two, and that brings us to one hundred thirty two."
Let's model two hundred fifty three on a number line.
"Two hundred, two hundred ten,  two hundred twenty, two hundred thirty."

And so the students take full advantage of those opportunities.
The learn a lot from it also.
Beth Seaton:
"You have a lot of international type of things going on in the department also, don't you?"
William Bailey:
We certainly do.
"For many of our students, they have not had the opportunity to go overseas."
"Some of them, frankly, have not even been to Chicago or on an airplane."
But we take them and have taken them to China.
"Last year, was to Australia."
We have a trip to Brazil coming up.
"A trip to Russia, which was very successful."
"And the students understand that it opens up a whole new world for them, which they were not aware of before."
Beth Seaton:
I remember reading in the newspaper about the trip you took to Australia.
You were on that trip.
William Bailey:
Yes.
Beth Seaton:
I was surprised at how many students you were able to take with you.
William Bailey:
"It's always a concern, because the students pay for it themselves."
"We keep the cost as low as possible but at the end of the day, it is a wonderful experience, and the students uniformly get their moneys' worth."
And we have many students who will go on every trip we offer.
Beth Seaton:
Thanks for taking the time to talk with me today about some of the things going on in the School of
Agriculture at WlU.
William Bailey:
"Thank you very much for dropping by, Beth."
We enjoy sharing all of our activities with you.
Beth Seaton:
And he's in the seventh grade.
"So what happened to the fourth grade, the fifth grade, and the sixth grade?"
"I mean, something's wrong."
"At that point, I did think I was dumb."
"I was stupid, like, why can't I read?"
"All my friends go to Latin, Boston Latin, one of the best schools-- probably the best school in Massachusetts, like, an exam school."
They read fine.
Why can't I read?
Adam was too old for the early intervention remedies and the school's solution to help Adam sounded better on paper that it was in reality.
They said Adam needs a small classroom setting.
And where did they send him?
It's like going into prison.
"He's down in the cellar, in a little room about this size with 12 other kids."
"So instead of working on ways to make it in school, Adam started working on ways to get out of school."
I went to the school and went room to room to room to his teachers.
Some of his teachers had never seen Adam.
And this is two months into the school year-- had never seen him.
"You take school out of that age, you take it away, you take it out of the picture, what else is there?"
"There's marijuana, there's stealing cars."
"I mean, what else is there for a kid?"
So you run the streets.
"And you run the streets, you get in trouble."
You make bad choices.
Adam was so-- he was mad.
He can't read.
Adam's parents knew it was time for professional help.
At the Boston Medical
"Center, Doctor Andrea Weiss, a clinical psychologist, gave Adam a new battery of tests."
What we're going to do first is I'm going to give you some reading lists.
And what I'd like you to do is just read down the list out loud.
And if you come to words you don't know--
Doctor Weiss's tests provide a kind of road map to when Adam's learning skills hit the wall.

Now we are going to look at the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and it's role on heart health.
The Mediterranean diet has certainly been around for millennium and yet there is no one Mediterranean diet.
"It refers in general to the way the people in the countries of the Mediterranean diet, have traditionally eaten foods."
"There's a hypothesis that there are differences among these populations, for whatever reason."
The way that these populations have eaten for centuries has actually lead to lower rates of heart disease that you might see in other parts of the world.
So the first person to really study this relationship and to scientifically prove that eating a certain way impacted your heart health was an individual known as Dr. Ancel Keys.
Dr. Ancel Keys lived to be 100 years old from 1904 to 2004.
"Granted it's not something that a normal person should do, and it is dangerous, but you have that awesome rush that  you get to brag to your friends afterwards."
Even if they don't get it.
When people lie and then you learn  about the facts of a story there's also change.
Like the 5 guys everybody believed  raped a girl at Hofstra University.
Oooh the hate they got.
A buncha black guys raped a girl.
Time to go crazy.
I think it's Crazy O'Clock.
"Oh shit, it is."
Then you find out that the girl was lying.
That it was consensual.
And this was from her lawyers mouth.
"Her statement also coincided with a video that was taken of the incident, that showed it was definitely consensual."
I know what you're thinking.
"""I can't believe the girl that was willing to have sex with 5 guys at the same time would lie."
"My world is upside down."""
But congratulations to that girl  because she is definitely our
"Douchebag of the Day for announcing to the world that she was gangbanged by 5 guys in a bathroom by saying that they raped her and later sayings,"
"""Whoops, I lied about it."
"It was just a gangbang."""
Kudos.
"There's also my favorite form of change, which is Photoshop."
"Or as I like to call it, lying."
And we're gonna talk about Jennifer Love Hewitt.
Because Jennifer Love Hewitt had  some photos taken of her and a lot of people were saying that she was fat.
"She went off, ""I'm not fat!"
I'm beautiful.
You don't have to be impossibly skinny.
"Be happy with who you are."""
Which I think is a great message for women.
"On the cover of the new Shape Magazine,  she is Photoshopped."
Oh the hypocrisy gets me so hard.
A function allows us to do that.
Expressions and statements don't do that because they just get done at 1 time when they're executed.
Functions allow us to package up computation that we want to do later.
"Hi,Lee"
"Sup,Vovan"
"Lee ,you're one eyed Pterodactyl"
And I was riding on you
And you're an goat
"So, what do you want from me"
I ...
I insulted you
And you should be upset
And I beat you!
LOL
I'm bad!
I came to one simple conclusion
Insults are only hints who is the offender and not much more
"Well, suppose if you analyze what Volodya said about me"
First.
I'm one eyed Pterodactyl...
"First of all.It's a obvious lie,and inconsistencies"
And as a our friend suggests us
I have two eyes and I'm a human
"Second of all,my system of values does not see anything wrong with one eyed Pterodactyls and even if it saw something wrong with it"
I I know anyway that I'm not a Pterodactyl
I think
It also refers to Volodya allegedly riding on me
Did not happen and that I'm am an goat
"I'm not a goat ,and there nothing wrong with goats"
"Put in Volodya sentence harsher words, witch you will not hear on our show"
But you can hear everyday in the neighborhood and nothing will change
"Insults are fantasy, fears and complexes of the offender all and nothing more"
"An image I quite like is that of being a Trojan mule, if you excuse my metaphor."
"What we are trying to do, is to get into schools, universities anyhow."
"Then the process does the work, really."
But I'll just finish with the story about how off-putting mindfulness can be to some people.
"I have a lovely colleague, very eminent professors of University of Exeter, called Willem Kuyken."
His daughter said to him after he  came back after one of these dos saying how well it went.
"She said, ""You do know dad,  that mindfulness is for losers."""
(Laughter)
"He said, ""Okay, you are sure about that?"""
"She said, ""Yup."""
Then she phone him later.
"She said, "" I just want to clarify that a bit."""
"He thought, ""She is going to say, 'I don't really mean it, dad'""."
"She said:""I just want you to know that it is not just me that thinks that."""
(Laughter)
And this is a girl's experience  in home and so on.
"She is a teenager, anything her parents  do is automatically awful."
"It is important really to start where people are, and to make sure that we do this in ways that appeal to people and don't just gratify our own egos."

"And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time."

"And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done, and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen, and suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno, and I'm like ... (Laughter)"
"Melanie picks up the lamb, puts it on the post, opens it up."
Albert hands me the knife.

"And I'm like, ""What is this jacked-up metaphor?"

"If everyone in the class is a different height, how many students are there in the class?"
And these are the type of questions that I just like to make sure that I'm not miscounting.
So she's the 12th tallest.
So what does that mean?
That means that there are 11 people taller than her.
So let's say from shortest to tallest.
So this is Stacy right here.
"And so, if she is the 12th tallest-- let me put it this way."
"If I said that she was the first tallest, that means there's no one taller than her."
"If she's the second tallest, that means there's one person taller than her."
"If she's the third tallest, that means there's two people taller than her."
"And likewise, if she's the 12th tallest, that means that there are 11 people taller."
"Similarly, if she's the 12th shortest, well, that must mean that there are 11 shorter than her."
So this is really just making sure that you parse the words correctly and count properly.
"So if there's 11 shorter, 11 taller, and then there's"
"Stacy, well, that's 22 plus her."
There's 23 students in the class.
"And this is just to make sure that you don't say, oh, 12 taller, 12 shorter, and say 25 or something like that."
"It's just to confuse you really, I think."

"The quadratic function g is given by-- this is just the general way people write quadratic functions-- is equal to ax squared plus bx plus c, where a and c are negative constants."
Which of the following could be the graph of g?
So I'm not going to even look at the choices.
"I'll just show you how I would-- if someone didn't even give me any choices, and say, well, if a and c are less than 0, what's this going to look like?"
So let's draw the x and y.
Please take good care of her.
Dong-Yi!
"You see this symbol, right?"
Don't forget this symbol.
"If you leave this symbol, this older brother will come find you."
You have to come and get me.
All right!
"Dong-Yi, I promise."
I'll come and get you
Brother Chun-Soo!
"I'm super excited for Family Fest, I actually just found out that my mother is coming which is really nice."
"She'll also be bringing my dog and my little brother, hopefully."
My mom is actually coming up for the first time since she came up first week of orientation.
"My parents have never been to Mac, so it'll be like ""here's my new home!"""
It'll be nice to have them here when I kind of know my way around a little bit more and I can sort of tell them about Macalester.
My grandparents are probably coming out.
"I didn't know they were still mobile, so that should be interesting."
"I'm running the 5k with my mom, and ""running"" is a loose term."
I'm betting my dad will attempt the 5k and then just not want to do it about halfway through.
And then he wants to go to a Wild game so we're going to try to hit that.
"Last year I did the 5k, which was pretty awesome."
Probably we'll be going to a play in Minneapolis hopefully and cooking dinner for her.
She's the best.
I'm also running the 5k with one of my roommates.
"Running, walking the 5k with one of my roommates."
I'm really looking forward to getting some nice meals in good restaurants.
"I don't run, I stand there and watch people run around."
I think we're going to explore Minneapolis because I've pretty much stuck to campus so far.
My mom says she wants to see my apartment.
We'll see how that goes.
I definitely have to clean my dorm room before then.
"I just want to see them, I don't know, they're nice people."
"You don't have to talk to me, just wave if you are gonna give me a ride home?"
"And I realized I should be the one to take that hit, not Carla"
"Hey, Lindsay, don't worry, he is not allowed to talk"
Is that true
You may nod*
"You know, when I was 15, I cut my own bangs**"
"Oh that's right, Percival, it's a highschool hair story"
"Anyway, Judy Keenan told me that she would also cut her hair off, it was like a suicide pact, only with bangs"
"I cut off my hair, and of course, she backed out, but even though my bangs looked horrible"
"I kept them that way, mostly because those stupid bangs were the only thing in my life that I felt I had control over"
"I'm so tired of everyone telling me what to do, when to be home##, what to wear, when to take my medication"
"I mean, I'm the one who's sick, right."
I can handle my own life
"How about if I tell your parents from now on, prescriptions for your medicine will be given directly to you, you'll be in charge of getting your Dilantin taking it."
Thank you.
Great
"I don't have a ring, but you can kiss my ass"

"I'm gonna grab a fry, some ketchup."
"Ah, it's cold"
This is
I'm back
That was weird
"No, that was weird"
What were you doing
"That's all it was, and if you still need someone to blame, why don't you try blaming yourself"
You're absolutely right.
It's my fault you kissed my wife.
"Oh man, I'm going home"
"And the sharpest rock on the wildest shore can never break that ocean apart, they can never wear that ocean down, because it's the ocean that shapes the shore."
That's what we're starting to do here today.
That's what we're starting to do here this week.
"With wave after wave after wave crashing against that shore, we shape it to our vision."
Thank you all for being a part of that.
[People shouting:
"""Thank you!"", cheering]"
"Well, how should I...?"
"I don't actually think I've ever given a talk on the history of Mozilla to a large set of people, which is pretty shocking..."
Ok!
So...
I'm gonna give it a try.
I'm not sure if I've actually given a talk on the history of Mozilla to this many people.
So that's probably an indication that I need to do more of it.
"Mozilla's been around for a long time, since 1998."
And I thought when we got started...
I'd like to ask:
"Of the people here, how many have been in Mozilla for three months or less?"
Can you raise your hand?
"Ok, excellent."
How many have been here a year or so?
That's a pretty good group too.
"Ok, how about the five year?"
Pretty good and I'm gonna say the ten year.
How many people?
"Who's around, though?"
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine..."
So there's nine people in this room that have been working on Mozilla for ten years and more.
And there's probably another nine or ten people in this gathering today who have been here that long as well.
And so I'm gonna explain the different roles that we had in the early days.
"I'll try to name some names as we go along, I won't get all of those names, but if you see this people and have questions about Mozilla or Mozilla's history, find a good time and ask them, because we all have many memories."
"So, Mozilla started in 1998."
You may see on the right side
"Casentino and Murlo, two small villages, once Etruscan settlements, closer to South West Asia than to Europe, while in Volterra this ancient signal is now too diluted to be detected."
"Human and bovine mitochondrial DNAs indicate that Etruscans and bovines docked to Tuscany, sailing from S-W Asia."
This also confirms how the Italian wisdom
"""take wife and cattle from your homeplace"" is now totally implemented."
"Since domestication, animals always accompanied humans during migrations, wars and conquers."
"They have been silent witness of human history, but until recently they have been impossible to query."
"Now, thanks to DNA analysis, they can tell us their story."
Thanks for your attention.
(Applause)
Elaborate a plan
So team... are we Formula One or are we driving a clapped out old banger?!
Oh no is that the fire alarm?
Quick everyone out!
Quick!
Quick!
Pathetic....
Susan?
SUSAN?!
Ok this could be a plan to end the meeting but you can find a better one:
Elaborate a media plan
Elaborate a plan
Right gang.
Are we in top gear or have we stalled in the pits?
What have you got for me?
Adding YouTube to the TV media plan!
Bravo!
World champions!
A big bottle of bubbly on me!
Mojito?
"Episode 2 - Conclusions:  an integrated plan YouTube + TV allows to get a higher brand awareness among consumers exposed to the campaign in YouTube and TV, versus those exposed to it in TV only."
For more informations visit the Case Study section on the brand channel.
"Both - Martin Luther King, a baptist pastor -"
"- and Ku Klux Klan, movement led by white people, protestants in the USA. -"
"And so, you will find the catholic church, with a moral, well, it is a conservative society."
"Like, the prohibition of marriage to the priest."
To forbid the use of condoms.
"And you might find too the episcopal church, in the USA, the anglican church in the USA, that allows gays pastors."
They live in union with those pastors.
There are specific denominations for homosexuals.
Like a contemporary church in Rio.
A few brothers here have heard of that church.
There is the metropolitan church too.
Those are communities to the homosexuals.
You might find people with totally different opinions.
There is no way you can join them.
As an example:
Obama and Bush.
Both are christians.
Obama was a member of the United Church of Christ.
A tradicional denomination in the USA.
I don't know if until today.
"Spiritualistic, catholics, protestants, mormons, Yehovah-witnesses, all of them declares themselves christians."
And there are many other groups!
"But...Well, everybody seems to be christian, huh?"
"So, depending on what christian is, in the head of a person,"
Jesus really doesn't want christians.
What christian means?
What the word christian is?
"If you search for the origin of that word, it arises in the city of Antioch."
"Before that, the church of Jerusalem, the church of Judea, was serving the Lord."
Then came the persecution.
"They had to flee and establish in Antioch, Syria."
"And there, it was the first time the disciples were called ""christians""."
So we're going to add 5 again and get to 16.
Let's do 4 just for good measure.
"So the fourth one, we're going to add another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"So the fourth one, we're going to add another 5 gets us to 21."
"Now, I want to think about, can we, using this pattern, figure out how many toothpicks it would take for us to, say, make 50 of these townhouses or even 500 of these townhouses, or even 5,000 of them?"
Now we just have to look at this pattern here and see can we come up with an equation for each of these actual values?
"So, for example, we see a pattern that-- well, we already recognize that we started with 6, and we're adding 5 every time we add a house."
"So when you add the second house, you add 5 once."
"The third house, you start with 6, and you add 5 twice."
"The fourth house, you start with 6 and you add 5 three times."
So let's actually write that down.
"So 21 is equal to-- you start with 6, you start with this 6 here, and then you add 5 three times, plus 5 times 3."
"When you had the 3 houses, once again, you started with 6 and you added 5 two times."
Let me do that same color.
And you added 5 two times.
Plus 5 times 2.
"When you had 2 houses, you started with 6 again."
"This is equal to 6 and you added 5 once, so plus 5 times 1."
"And then when you had 1 house-- and it'll fit the same pattern-- you started with 6, and how many times did you add 5?"
"Well, you didn't add 5."
You could say that you added 5 zero times.
So you might see a little pattern here.
"However many houses you needed, you take one less than that and multiply it by 5, add that to 6, and you get the number of toothpicks."
"And actually, let me rewrite this."
So I could rewrite this as 6 plus 5 times 4 minus 1.
I could write this as 6 plus 5 times 3 minus 1.
You could write this as 6 plus 5 times 2 minus 1.
You could rewrite this as 6 plus 5 times 1 minus 1.
And maybe that makes a pattern a little bit clearer.
This 4 is right over here.
This 3 is right over here.
This 2 is right over here.
"This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use, that allows me to convert numbers into words."
"I store them as words, and later on retrieve them as numbers."
I know it sounds complicated; it's not.
"I don't want you to think you're seeing something out of ""Rain Man."""
(Laughter)
"There's definitely a method to my madness -- definitely, definitely."
Sorry.
(Laughter)
"If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then."
"By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here."
"If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is; just say, ""you're close,"" or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty entertaining in itself."
"If, however, I am right, whatever you do, don't keep it to yourself, OK?"
(Laughter)
"Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK."
"So, without any more stalling, here we go."
"I'll start the problem in the middle, with 57 times 683."
"57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931."
"38,931; double that to get 77,862."
"77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822."
"That seems right, I'll go on."
"Cookie fission, OK."
"Next, I do 57 squared, which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion."
"Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK, finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489."
Audience:
Yeah!
AB:
Good.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I hope you enjoyed mathemagics.
Thank you.

"We've already gotten used to the world of vegetation and are no longer amazed,but truthfully what does it resemble from a real viewpoint?It's just like if someone would ask you how many cellphones you would like for free,from the new generation phones,how many would you like for free?So you say if it's free give me 300."
I have people to give them out to.
"So he tells you,no problem."
"Buy this phone,which costs 30 Shekels."
"Go to your yard,dig a hole,plant the phone in the ground,cover it,water it and wait till it rusts,before it turns rusty it won't work.But afterwards..."
"You're looking at him shocked but he continues and tells you that after it rusts,you will suddenly see that an antenna will grow from this  phone and many phones will grow at the head of the antenna."
How will this sound?
"Totally strange,right?If you take a person from the North Pole who doesn't know what planting and growing is."
All he ever saw was ice.He never heard or knew of such a thing.
"If you tell him that a seed is planted in the ground,goes through a process and grows a stem which has tens of grains on its head."
How will that sound to him?
Totally strange!
He will say that it's not true!
It's like a phone that grows.
It's not logical.We've already gotten used to it so we are not amazed.
"God tells man,are you surprised that I will resurrect the dead in the future?"
"Look,I do it now in the world of vegetation."
This is the tale of Mister Morton
Mister Morton is who?
"He is the subject of our tale, and the predicate tells what Mister Morton must do."
Mister Morton walked down the street.
Mister Morton walked.
Mister Morton talked to his cat.
Mister Morton talked.
"(""Hello, cat."
"You look good."")"
Mister Morton was lonely.
Mister Morton was...
"Mister Morton is the subject of the sentence, and what the predicate says, he does."
Mister Morton knew just one girl.
Mister Morton knew.
Mister Morton grew flowers for Pearl.
NCATS is going to do.
[Applause]
"The last thing, just to illustrate how NCATS is going to do things differently and, may I say, better,"
"I'm going to show you what real music is, and so let's take it away."
"I should say, how did I choose this?"
"Glen and I chose this in a somewhat whimsical way but somewhat with a serious note, and it gets to what I started saying."
"This is an aria from The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart and, as some of you may know, Mozart died at the age of 37 of causes which aren't entirely known, but there was some sort of infectious disease, perhaps a urinary tract infection or tuberculosis."
Just imagine if Mozart had not died at age 37.
What could he have created that our world would have to enjoy?
"That didn't happen, and it doesn't happen for so many patients now, and we can change that."
[Applause]
I want to make little townhouse shapes with toothpicks.
So this would be my first townhouse.
"I've used 3 toothpicks so far-- 4, 5, and 6."
So that is my first townhouse.
"Now, let me make a little table here keeping track of things."
So I'll do that in white.
So here's my table to keep track of things.
"So this is the number of houses, and then this is the toothpicks that I'm using to make that house."
"So this first house here, took me 6 toothpicks-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6."
Now let's make our second house.
And these are going to be townhouses.
They're going to share common walls.
"So I'm going to add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks for my second house."
"Now, why did I only have to add 5 and not 6?"
"Well, they shared a common wall here so I didn't have to add another toothpick here for this left-hand side wall."
"So starting with the first house,"
I really just had to add 5 toothpicks.
I had to add 5 toothpicks to get to now 11 total toothpicks if I want two houses.
I think you see the trend here.
What about 3 of these?
"Well, this is going to be another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks."
"HerO, you know, I mean this is what happened, and this is what?"
The third game in a row now?
ZeneX Life is just really trying to kill him in about this time in the game and it hasn't worked out.
He is slowly building up a Corruptor count and kinda slowly moving towards that Hive tech.
But he is still on three bases.
"He needs to start taking more bases, it is obviously not working."
"-	There is 41 kills, 42 kills between the Immortals now, his micro has been so good with those, picking them up once again!"
"HerO, this is legendary!"
-	Unbelievable play by HerO.
Look at that!
These Immortals are living up to their name for the first time in Starcraft 2 history.
- 47 kills now and ZeneX Life continues to ride in.
"Still saving those Immortals, keeping those at the back."
"HerO, you are so good!"
"-	Ohh and he get one finally, but man!"
"This is a huge mistake here, ohh, Liquid HerO is getting a little bit far down the ramp, but he has got enough."
Nice micro with the Warp Prism again.
"Ohh, he gets the Warp Prism before the Colossus got down."
- And he kept the Immortal alive!
Just at the very last instant!
A 45 kill Immortal now.
- Target fire down these Probes to make sure that HuK cannot mine anymore.
"If NaNiwa can make sure that HuK has no more Probes left and no ability to make any more, the Stalker will be able to out micro the two Zealots all day long."
"With that being said, the Stalker is getting dangerously low on health."
"NaNiwa are still trying to target fire down those Probes, will it be enough?"
"The Probes getting so low on health, only two remaining!"
But the Stalker is getting so low on health.
NaNiwa has to be extremely careful if he wants to win this game.
"- This is coming down to the hit point bars, we can't let them go."
- Oh no!
The Stalker could get surrounded!
"- It is down to just seven hit points, three hit points."
"Okay as usual, are there any questions or comments about the talk this evening on emotions?"
"Yeah, okay."
Man 1: ...[difficult to hear]
"(if we point one finger at someone, three point back at us)..."
Ajahn Brahm:
"Yeah, you're talking about that one."
That's the old story.
"See three, you don't know what the thumb is doing, but one's pointed that way."
Man 1:
[difficult to hear]
Ajahn Brahm:
"Yes that's right, so if you criticise somebody else.."
This was actually a saying of the Emperor Ashoka.
"Who was a Buddhist, was it it 200 years before the birth of...about 22 hundred years ago or something."
"And he wrote in stone, we know what he said because those stone monuments are still there."
"Usually in museums now, some are in their original place."
He said this wonderful thing that anybody who criticises another person's religion thereby criticises his own faith.
"That's a wonderful thing to say 22 hundred years ago, what a beautiful way of tolerance."
"You criticise somebody else's religion, then you're showing that your own faith is not really up to scratch."
It's not just religion - if you criticise somebody else then you're showing your own understanding of life is lacking.
How can you criticise others?
"How much do you know about them, why they did that?"
How many times have you been criticised - unfairly?
So why do you go criticising others?
Give them the benefit of the doubt.
And you have a happy life.
And there's much doubt to give people the benefit of.. [laughter]
Okay thank you for that Eddy.
"We've got a question there, and then over there, yes"
Man 2 [hard to hear]:
"Your Holiness, I was intrigued by your labelling of grief as a negative emotion."
The way I see it negative emotions are destructive.
"And when I add them, I get 0."
"That must mean that a plus minus b is equal to 0, or that a is equal to b, that we're dealing with the same number."
"We're essentially dealing with the same number, the negatives of each other."
So what can it be?
"Well, if we're doing the same number and they're negatives of each other, 64 is exactly 8 squared."
"But it's negative 64, so maybe we're dealing with one negative 8, and we're dealing with one positive 8."
"And if we add those two together, we do indeed get to 0."
So this will be x minus 8 times x plus 8.
Now you don't always have to go through this process I did here.
"You might already remember that if I have a plus b times a minus b, that that's equal to a squared minus b squared."
"So if you see something that fits the pattern, a squared minus b squared, you could immediately say, oh, that's going to be a plus b-- a is x, b is 8-- times a minus b."
Let's do a couple more of just general problems.
I won't tell you what type these are going to be.
Let me switch colors.
It's getting monotonous.
Let's say we have x squared minus 24x plus 144 is equal to 0.
"Well, 144 is conspicuously 12 squared."
And this is conspicuously 2 times negative 12.
Or this is conspicuously negative 12 squared.
So this is negative 12 times negative 12.
This is negative 12 plus negative 12.
"So this expression can be rewritten as x minus 12 times x minus 12, or x minus 12 squared."
We're going to set that equal to 0.
This is going to be 0 when x minus 12 is equal to 0.
"You can say either of these could be equal to 0, but they're the same thing."
Add 12 to both sides of that equation and you get x is equal to 12.
"And I just realized, this problem up here, I factored it, but I didn't actually solve the equation."
So this has to be equal to 0.
Let's take a step back to this equation up here.
And the only way that this thing over here will be 0 is if either x minus 8 is equal to 0 or x plus 8 is equal to 0.
So add 8 to both sides of this.
You get x could be equal to 8.
"First, these men steal all the pillows... ...and then the dogs steal the mattresses."
The dogs float their mattresses to the candy shop.
WOW!
CANDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[music starts]
When I was a young man I carried my pack
And I lived the free life of a rover
From the Murrays green basin to the dusty outback
I waltzed my Matilda all over
Then in nineteen fifteen my country said Son
It's time to stop rambling 'cause there's work to be done
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun
And they sent me away to the war
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As we sailed away from the quay
And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the cheers
We sailed off for Gallipoli
How well I remember that terrible day
When the blood stained the sand and the water
When how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
"Johnny Turk he was ready, he primed himself well"
"He showered us with bullets, and he rained us with shells"
And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As we stopped to bury our slain
And we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs
And it started all over again
"Now those who were living, did their best to survive"
"In that mad world of death, blood and fire"
And for seven long weeks I kept myself alive
Boon
"Pick for me from your hair, a quaff"
That coats me
My whole poem and words aren't sufficient for you
Your depiction needs special language
Spun from my blood
With my last call from my mouth
With my dream paste
Guarded with my pall
And the dialect of your depiction
Come out in one word
"O girl, gypsy girl"
Put your wound over me like tattoo or Henna
Fall over me as tidings
Blessed from heaven
"If death came to me,"
I swear I wouldn't hide
"Because I gained from life everything I want a quaff, a song , and a bead against envy,,"" (audience clapping)"
"At the end,"
"I want to tell that women,"
I really miss you
It was my mother's death that stopped me from traveling
I miss her very much
I failed to write something about you.
Thanks
So Ghost Ship.
Now Ghost Ship is a movie that gets better with every subsequent viewing and one thing about a Val Lewton film is it's generally very short.
"So you could watch this thing a couple times in a day, and start to really unpack its poetry."
"The sur, surface story of the film is quite simple."
"You have a young officer who comes on board a boat, finds that the senior officer is crazy."
"The senior officer tries to kill the young officer, and the senior officer dies instead."
"In fact, it's a story that's so thin, Frank Borzage might like it."
There is a book called  'Buddhism Boys'.
It's about a teacher who taught mindfulnes to high school football players.
"I think, boys particularly can see the relationship to sports."
That's a big inroad.
(R. Brady) I don't think we will have time to answer more questions right now.
"But, there are going to be a lot  of opportunities to raise questions of various kinds  throughout the rest of the week."
"And after you leave here,  there is a worldwide community of over 1000 people who are interested in mindfulness in education, who are all part of the Mindfulness and Education Network listserv."
How many people are already  on this list?
"Please, raise your hand."
"We don't have too many Canadian members yet, but it would be wonderful to have a large Canadian presence."
The flyer is downstairs in the bookstore.
"If you have questions such as the ones you have been asking, you can just put them out on the network and you would get very thoughtful answers."
"It's not a very busy web service, you do not need to worry about being flooded with emails. but it's very thoughtful."
"So, I want to encourage all of you  to pick up a flyer."
We also have a conference annually.
"We have Canadians who come to our conference, that gets announced."
It will be March 14 to16  in Washington D.C. this next year.
There is a lot of resources on our website that you will find also listed here.
(J. Bell) I'd like to do one plug for a book that I found very nourishing.
It's called 'Teaching With Fire'.
"Two teachers asked teachers to sent them poems to guard them through hard times,  to remind them why they taught."
They talk about courage.
There are about 100 poems in here.
On one side is the poems sent by the teacher.
On the other is the teachers' own story about why this poem is important.
"I have used this in my teaching, in my training work and for my own personal use."
"I've used poem to cry through, beautiful collection of poems, some of them written by famous people, some by teachers themselves."

I dropped out of high school  with a baby on the way.
"I had no home, no money  and no help."
I put my hope in the crime on the streets.
"At the time, that scene  was my only option."
Crime on the streets eventually led me to jail.
I came close to death many times.
The lost that changed ...
"The lost that changed my life was the violent death of my younger brother."""
"It was 1967, Mike found his way into Youth Build program in Columbus, Ohio."
"And today, 14 years later, he is the director of his own Youth Build program, he is a minister of his own congregation, he is the owner of his own  construction company."
He has a family and 4 children  and he owns his own home.
"There are millions of young people who have this aspirations, they want  the same thing that you and I want."
"They want to know their true nature,  they want to know their value, they want to make a contribution, and they want to be able to support their families and be happy and safe, right?"
"Yet, because of poverty and racism,  they have been denied that opportunity."
And the schools have failed them.
You all who worked in some of those school have tried your best to counteract that.
Youth Build is developed  as a place for them to land.
"We started,my wife and long-time partner,  Dorothy Stoneman, who is right here, started Youth Build in 1978  at East Harlem, New York."
We as young people had some adult  back-up and some money to do.
"So, I stared across the street and said, ""I would like to fix up that building""."
It took us 5 years to do that first building.
"Starting there step-by-step,  there are now 273 Youth Build programs in the country's poorest communities and 16 other countries like South Africa,"
"Serbia, Haiti, Mexico."
"They asked us to come  by Afghanistan lately, I said:"
"""Wait!"
"Get your things together first, then we'll think about that."""
"They spent about a year in the program,  going to school, getting the GED diploma."
"Half the time they add and had the time building affordable houses for lower income people, learning leadership skills."
In this process they reclaim their lives.
Here are some elements that I think will work and we know about them here.
One is caring and love.
They come in pretty beat-up  by racism and poverty.
"Sharifa: "" He said, i'll kill myself """
"Sharifa: "" Then I turned to Samia, and asked her, If Lady Gaga died, what would you do ? """

"Sharifa: "" I told her, i don't want to you kill yourself even if I died """
"Sharifa: "" I love to be really close to my daughter that's why I care about everything """
"Thank you so much Sharifa, and Samia"

We've got enough to worry about with the illness; that's not counting what the government is trying to do to cut our money down.
"I thought this was a really good stunt, if you like, to highlight the difficulties faced by people with MS in walking 20 metres."
It doesn't look like a vast distance to have to walk but it depends on the day.
"If you've got MS, you can't pin down that you're going to be that well all the time."
It's different every day.
I think it's gone really really well.
It's nice to see that there's a lot of people on our side.
I think it's very good that we had an MP with us.
Stephen Lloyd (off camera):
"""I think a really good piece of campaigning from the MS Society."""
It's really nice that there's several different news people here.
Well I hope it's made people aware of what the problems are that people like us have.
I'm a bit more positive now than what I was earlier on.
I think today more than anything I felt proud; proud of what we're doing a proud of people with MS.

Students at Western illinois are trying to get drunk drivers off the road.
The university's emergency medical services hosted it's 16th annual Mock DUI project.
College volunteers show people what a drunk driving accident looks like.
"With prom and graduation right around the corner, officers say it's important to stop drunk driving."
Officer:
The numbers related to DUI accidents and fatalities is pretty staggering.
Everybody has somebody that they know or a loved one that knows someone that has been involved in a DUI accident or been killed in a vehicle accident of this nature.
Anchor:
"Local hospitals, police and fire departments help set up the event."
All emergency officials respond to the accident as if it was real.
"Cubs fans sing ""Go, Cubs, go"""

What's all this for?
"OH, IT'S BECAUSE IT'S A BlRTHDAY PARTY!"
YAY!
HAPPY BlRTHDAY TO GENGHlS KHAN'S DESCENDANTS!
"How do I know it's your birthday, Genghis Khan's descendants?"
Because every day is your birthday.
"Because, right now, on the planet Earth, there are 16 million direct descendants of Genghis Khan, meaning that every day is the birthday of 43,000 of them."
"So, good news, Genghis Khan."
"Your empire might be gone, but your progeny lives on, and on, and on, and on."
HAPPY BlRTHDAY!
"Best wishes, John Green."
"Unfortunately for the Mongols, those guys weren't always working together, because Genghis Khan failed to create a single political unit out of his conquests."
"Instead, after Genghis' death, the Mongols were left with 4 really important empires called the Khanates: the Yuan Dynasty in China, the Ilkhanate in Persia, the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, and the Khanate of the Golden Horde in Russia."
"If you remember all the way back to the Hellenistic period, this is similar to what happened to another good general who wasn't much for administration,"
Alexander the Great.
"Also, neither of them ever conquered India."
"The Mongols succeeded, primarily, because of their military skill."
"Genghis Khan's army, which never numbered more than 130,000, was built on speed and archery, just like this guy."
"Mongol mounted archers were like super-fast tanks, compared to the foot soldiers and knights they were up against."
"""But, wait,"" all the military history nerds are saying,"
"""Once people knew the Mongols were coming,"
"""why didn't they just hole up in castles and forts?"
"""It's not like the Mongols had flying horses."""
EXCEPT THEY DlD.
They didn't?
"Stan, why are you always making history boring?!"
"So the Mongols apparently didn't have flying horses, but they were uncommonly adaptable."
"So even though they'd never seen a castle before they started raiding, they became experts at siege warfare by interrogating prisoners."
"And, they also adopted gunpowder, probably introducing it to Europeans, and they even built ships so they could attack Japan."
"That might have worked, too, except there happened to be a typhoon."
"Also, people were terrified of the Mongols."
"Often, cities would surrender the moment the Mongols arrived, just to escape slaughter."
They used to dream  about cacao beans all night and talk about them all day.
"You had only to mention the word ""cacao""  to an Oompa-Loompa and he would start dribbling  at the mouth."""
Listen closely:
"""The cacao bean,""  Mr Wonka continued,"
"""which grows on the cacao tree, is the thing that all chocolate is made from."""
"Roald Dahl knew,  and it was in the book, the great book  ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."""
Remember the Oompa Loompas.
This is an elf with a cacao pod but the sculpture is 3000 years old.
It is intrinsic to the magic of chocolate.
"In Mexico, this is where the great cuisine was innovated, it was always served as a drink,  but today we have blenders."
It makes it so much easier.
"You can upgrade your smoothie, your protein shake  by adding a dash of raw cacao and bringing forth the magic and wonder, just as they did in Ancient Mexico."
"On the Mexican 100 peso note,  if you look closely, right there next to Xochipilli are actual cacao recipes, iconically represented."
"We've innovated and brought forth now  an entirely new cuisine, brought to the greatest chefs  in the world, revive some of the great additives  of chocolate, creating these wonderful  and delightful recipes."
"The one question that I get more than any other, after all of this is:"
Is it possible to o.d. on chocolate? and the answer is:
Yes.
Thank you so much.
I am David Wolfe.
Have the best day ever.
We continue our Education in America series this morning with one man who is turning the learning process upside down.
"In his series of really simple videos, it's being called revolutionary, as CBS News correspondent"
John Blackstone reports:
It would be music to the ears of any educator what ten-year old Megan Tsern has to say about her favorite teacher.
He makes math really easy in a really kind of conversational way.
He is Salman Khan.
Negative seven dollars?
It's like saying that
I own seven dollars!
"Khan is the voice and the brain behind the Khan Academy, the free educational website that some believe is leading a revolution in teaching!"
"There's no nonsense, no defocusing on the material."
It really is what it is.
Google are among the big donors that have allowed the Khan Academy to add nearly a dozen software engineers.
It's really smartly done on the computer.
And I love being on the computer!
"With more than 2,000,000 users a month, many others seem to love Khan's lesssons, too!"
"I've already taught 70,000,000 lessons!"
And he will be happy to teach millions more.

"Mountainview, California."
We launched our own Open Culture Data competition in June 2012... ...after the succes of winning the Apps for the Netherlands competition.
We set up our own competition with three goals for developers.
"Firstly, use Open Culture Data to increase the audience reach and use of this data - online, offline and on site."
"Secondly, connect different datasets."
"Many of are separated, even though they have related information."
"Thirdly, make innovative new apps or websites with Open Culture Data."
There were four awards for the developers... ...three Open Culture Data prizes and one special Dutch National Archives prize.
"We promoted... ...the competition during two large-scale hackathons in June and October, and a smaller one in December... ...and by giving presentations at developer gatherings and at conferences."
"The competition closed on December 31, 2012."
And on 1 January it turned out 27 apps were submitted for the competition.
The Open Culture Data award ceremony took place in January.
The jury consisting of a mix of heritage professionals and copyright specialists chose the four winners.
The winner was the Muse app by No strings.
It's an iPad app in which you can rearrange parts of paintings to make a new artwork.
The second prize went to Histagram by Richard Jong of Frontwise.
On this website you can personalize press photos of the Dutch National Archives and send them to friends.
Bronze was won by SimMuseum by Hay Kranen.
In this game you are a museum director and can trade artworks with other museums.
The Dutch National Archives award was won by Tijdbalk.nl from Arjan den Boer.
With this app you can make your own timeline by combining different data sources on the same subject.
My drive to use open source and open cultural data is that it forces you to think outside the box.
You open up to the unexpected by letting others in on your projects.
If you work closed source you stay on your own island.
But the corpses around me piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit
And when I awoke in my hospital bed
"And saw what it had done, Christ I wished I was dead"
Never knew there were worse things than dying
And no more I'll go waltzing Matilda
To the green bushes so far and near
"For to hang tent and pegs, a man needs two legs"
No more waltzing Matilda for me [instrumental]
"So they collected the cripples, the wounded, the maimed"
And they shipped us back home to Australia
"The legless, the armless, the blind, and insane"
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay
I looked at the place where me legs used to be
And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As they carried us down the gangway
"But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared"
Then they turned their faces away
And now every April I sit on my porch
And I watch the parade pass before me
"And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march"
Reliving the dreams of past glory
And I see the old men all twisted and torn
The forgotten heroes from a forgotten war
"And the young people ask me, ""What are they marching for?"""
And I ask myself the same question
And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
And the old men still answer the call
But year after year their numbers get fewer
Hello
"Again, I conversed with myself"
"Until dawn, just a little"
"See, in my hands I still held hope"
It wouldn't have been stardust
"Wavering Sleep, fully clothed"
"""Seeya, sometime."""
These two words I placed on top of each other.
"If I follow this wakened dream, a gentle song evolves"
Lulling in my ears
When I rub my sleepy eyes it becomes a definite day
"And for some reason it seems as though I'm about to forget,"
So I call your name
I called your name
I simply wished
For my gloominess to leave
There's been no result though
I want to be admitted
To the hospital of the moon
I already lack a tomorrow
"If I follow this wakened dream, a gentle song evolves"
Lulling in my ears
When I rub my sleepy eyes this definite day is over
"And for some reason, not wanting to forget,"
I call your name
I called your name
"If I follow this wakened dream, a gentle song evolves"
Lulling in my ears
When I rub my sleepy eyes it becomes a definite day
"And for some reason it seems as though I'm about to forget,"
So I call your name
I called your name
After the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games the UK government said it hoped to see Chinese people come to the 2012 Olympic Games
I wanted to go.
"People have travelled from China to London by motorcycle and car before but I thought going by rickshaw is more unique, and, of course, it's a traditional mode of transport in my country."
I really loved France.
"It had beautiful beaches, and really friendly people."
"After the Olympics is over I will go to the US by boat, travel around there, and then cycle to South America for the next Olympic games."
"Canon 6D, Nikon D600.."
We decided to make a battle between these two
"Hello, this is Digital TV and I'm Nadezhda Bakharova."
"These cameras appear to be in the same weight category, but if you like to count gramms and millimeters, you'll notice that Canon is slightly lighter and smaller."
The texture is quite similar on both of the cameras.
The bodies are made of magnesium alloy and polycarbonate.
"When you look at the basic features, Nikon makes a huge leap in front of Canon."
It's slightly faster with the burst rate of 5.5 frames per second compared to Canon's 4.5 fps ...more precise with the full-frame CMOS sensor of 24.3 MPS against Canon's 20.2 MPS... ...more accurate.
It has 39 focus points against Canon's 11... ...and Nikon's viewfinder coverage is 100% compared to Canon'ts 97%...
There's even more pros regarding Nikon - it has 2 SD card slots against 1 in the Canon 6D.
And one built-in flash against zero in the Canon 6D.
And it's a complete knockout.
"Still, Canon makes up with wider ISO range with a maximum at ISO 102400 against Nikon's ISO 25600"
"Also Canon's battery life is longer - it can take up to 1090 shots, while Nikon's battery allows it to take only 900 shots"
But the main advantages of Canon 6D are the built-in Wi-fi and GPS features
You can send photos to social networks and to print queue directly from the camera and also remotely manipulate it.
Travelers might find GPS coordinates quite useful in their journeys.
And that's how Canon can match Nikon's features.
"So, who's winning this battle - Canon or Nikon?"
You decide.
"Write your opinions below, in the comments."
See you soon!
"These cameras both come from the same family, but compared to his elder brother 6D is much more compact and weighs less."
All of the main buttons are placed on the right side of the back panel while 5D Mark ill has them near both sides of the display
There is certainly something strange happening.
"5 years ago, TED was something that was enjoyed by a 1,000 people once a year."
A lapse can lead to a relapse ... but it doesn't have to.
Use what you learned from your slip-up to fine-tune your quit plan and commit again to being smoke-free.
"Remember why you quit, and keep on quitting."
Gorillaz and the Boss Dogg Planet of the apes
"The revolution will be televised And the pollution from the ocean Now with devotion Push peace and keep it in motion Kids, gather around, yeah, I need your focus I know it seems like the world is so hopeless It's like Wonderland Now fascinate me Picture and animate me Cause I'm rollin', deep holein' Click clacking, crack-a-lacking Full packing (Hey!), mo' stacking Acting a fool when I teach Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach, yeah Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach Mirror mirror on the wall Boss Dogg, give it to 'em, get involved Turn it up, speed it up Slow it up, underground where the under us undercut Shipped up, shipped out, swimmin' with the sharks put my gills up Turn the wheels up real tough Drinkin' lemonade in the shade Getting blazed with a gang of pilgrims Yeah, just like that Belly floppin' lockin' while I'm rockin' in the bubble bath And I'm just like math Fozo's added up that get you more cash So quick, so fast All the kids say they love it when I make 'em laugh Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach, yeah Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach, yeah Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach"

WARREN:
"Hi, I'm Charles Warren."
I'm a User Experience Designer on mobile and welcome.
Thanks for coming.
"I want to introduce Laura Allen, who for many years has been a champion of Greywater out of Oakland."
She was the founder of Greywater Guerillas.
"You may be aware that it used to not be strictly legal to use Greywater for irrigations, so she led a lot of the work to cut those policy changes and things done."
We're very happy to have her.
And Greg Bullock is a contractor and installer who build these systems.
He's going to talk about some of the ways you can go about and thinking through whether a Greywater system makes sense for you.
And I think they've got us--they're going to lay down the gauntlet for us Googlers.
"So, without further ado, take it away Laura and Greg and thank you so much for being here. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:"
Thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Thanks for having me.
I'm Laura.
"I'm a co-founder of Greywater Guerilla's, now known as Greywater Action."
"Before we start talking about Greywater, I want to think about--first thing, think about water for a sec."
So I have a couple of cups of water over here and I want you to--so the first one represents a country.
It's totally full; it's got 156 gallons of water in it.
"Anyone want to guess what country what might use this amount per day, as per capita use? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The U.S.? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:"
"Yeah, the United States."
"This other cup, this represents a continent now and this is representing about 88 gallons per person per day."
"So it's just residential use: cooking, drinking, watering their landscape, not agriculture, not industry."
Anyone want to guess what continent might use this much? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Europe. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Yep.
Europe.
That dish belongs to...
Felix. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Congratulations.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Great job.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Bring your dish down please, darling."
(Felix) It's a huge validation.
This is definitely one of the proudest moments that I've had in my life. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Come and stand over here.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I'm trying to just be humble and, like, you know, keep my composure, but I don't think that Felix deserved to win."
Which sucks.
I'm so bummed.
Great job.
Really good job indeed.
"(Felix) I did a Chinese five-spice seared duck breast, and I did a sauce for it, and eggplant and sweet potato chips."
Phenomenal execution.
Very nice.
"The sauce and everything on the plate really worked. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe) We recognized it immediately as being&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; restaurant-quality, and the flavor &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is fantastic.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Felix)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you so much.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Felix is now a frontrunner.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The competition is on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"So, Felix, for winning today's mystery box challenge, you're coming with us to find out your huge advantage &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in the next challenge.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let's go."
"Well done.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Announcer) As the winner of the mystery box challenge,"
Felix is now the first home cook to enter the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; pantry.
"Here, Felix is in control of the first elimination test."
Each elimination test will see at least one person
leave the competition.
(Felix) I'm surrounded by the most amazing fresh produce.
It was the most beautiful pantry I had ever seen in my life.
(Announcer) Felix now gets to choose the style of food or the dish that everyone must cook.
"However, the one thing she cannot control is the theme of the challenge."
That is in the hands of the judges.
"Today, you'll be cooking one of our three most intimidating dishes."
I'm down.
"Even though I was practically raised on it, it's a dish that intimidates me because it's so difficult to execute."
And it's a dish that takes me back to my grandmother's kitchen and my mother's kitchen. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It is Italian risotto.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"And risotto refers not only to rice, but the technique involved in making it."
"Because, as opposed to steaming it or boiling it, we saute it."
"There is one dish that always gives me the chills, because you can't hide behind adding different little touches &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and ingredients&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and garnishes.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Let's pour some drops of methylated spirit in a bottle and spread them on the inside wall so that the methylated spirit well vaporise.
"Blow a lot of cigarette smoke into the bottle by using a straw, until the content becomes opaque."
"Light a match, and throw it in the bottle containing smoke and alcohol vapours."
Alcohol vapours burn instantly.
"Right after, there's no more smoke inside the bottle."
Alcohol combustion produces very hot gases which expand and escape through the bottle opening.
Smoke particles are carried away by gases that escape.
Smoke disappears instantly from the bottle.

TV FROM ANOTHER PLANET
TV FROM ANOTHER PLANET-OLEFOGH KRlKEBY-PHlLOSOPHY
"Welcome to ""TV from another planet""."
"My name is Martin Spang Olsen and yes, I'm from another planet."
"I am an alien sent on a ""mission impossible""."
I have in fact until 21.12 2012 to awaken the slumbering inhabitants of the earth and get them to take care of their self-made crises.
"21.12 2012 is, as you know expectence of the transition to the big change, the change of paradigm, in knowledge vision, as the ancient Mayan Indians talking about and it may well be the beginning of a new era, scary and a little exciting, especially for you perhaps, and I will therefore every week until 21.12 get visits by an expert in earth and space, and together we must try to identify and solve the world crises and today's crisis in the studio is philosophy."
Wisdom was a very popular concept in ancient greece.
"It was so popular that a man named Pythagoras said that he was ""Filosofía"" infact that he loved the goddess of wisdom, Sophia."
"So the philosophy was born and it was the beginning of a large number of schools from which all science stems from, but in time science was parted from philosophy and then personal development and spirituallity was parted from philosophy, and final death blow the philosophy got in the present which means we know all philosophers by heart but completely we forget to think for ourselves."
"People forgot that philosophy means ""love of wisdom"" and not just knowledge itself."
It would be devastating.
"Scott, one step forward, please."
"Yes, chef."
We're disappointed.
"Luckily for you, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;there were two dishes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;worse than yours.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Back on your station, please."
"Yes, chef. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Ryan, Samantha,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;one of you has just cooked&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; their last dish in this competition."
My dish looks ten times better than his dish.
How is this even possible?
"Even though my dish might have been uglier in presentation, it was still edible."
"The person leaving the competition &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that cooked the worst dish...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I just wanted to say&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that I am definitely not ready to go home yet, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and you were right.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The hero of this dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; was the duck, and, out of the two of us, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I would say that the duck&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; was better executed by me."
I don't care. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And you guys can't eat&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;raw duck.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
No begging.
"You're in this competition competing, not judging."
Let's get that right.
Have some respect for your fellow contestants.
The person leaving the competition &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that cooked&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the worst dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; in our first mystery box challenge &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;belongs to...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Announcer) The judges have already singled out the two worst dishes.
"Out of the two of us,"
I would say that the duck was better executed by me.
No begging.

Courson
"The fight or flight response lets animals respond quickly to threats. This system is universal in vertebrates. That shows it is ancient in origin, and very important."
"Humans have some problems with the system, because though they share the physiology with other animals, they rarely face a clear-cut fight or flight choice. Humans can try to talk their way through various problems and semi-threats, but they may suffer stress when the issues are not easily solved."
Other responses.
Animals respond in many ways to situations which threaten them. The fight/flight choice is just one alternative. At one extreme is the way mother cats with kittens will defend them to the death if necessary. Another situation is the way many animals keep still when a predator is nearby. Their camouflage is often effective.

SIMATIC is the name of an automation system which was developed by the German company Siemens. The automation system controls machines used for industrial production. This system makes it possible for machines to run automatically. Depending on the needed function of the machine you have to upload the right program on your Simatic unit. This unit is kept in a control cabinet near the machine.
Function.
Simatic is similar to a digital computer which can store and run programs. The Simatic also has some inputs and outputs. The running program on the Simatic controls these inputs and outputs. Both are connected by electrical wires with the machine. That makes a communication between the Simatic and any machine possible. As the case may be the inputs and outputs are set on a “High” signal or on a “Low” signal by the program. These are different electrical definitions. Finally these signals are important if an action in the machine happens or not.

The Germans could not do much to stop the final Allied attacks in Europe."

"Kesselring had shown he was good at defending land in the Italian Campaign. But in Germany, he did not have the troops or weapons to make a good defense."
"During the fighting west of the Rhine up to March 1945, the German Army on the western front had only 26 divisions. Most of the troops were used against the Soviet forces. The Germans had 214 divisions on the eastern front in April."
Eisenhower's plans.
"After capturing the Ruhr, Eisenhower planned to have 21st Army Group go east to Berlin. Eisenhower began to change his plans toward the end of March. He found out that Soviet forces held a bridge over the Oder River, from Berlin. He was worried the Soviets would capture Berlin before the western Allies."
"In addition, he was worried about the Ruhr. The Ruhr had many Axis troops and a lot of industries. He was also worried about the ""National Redoubt."" Some people said Hitler's most loyal troops were preparing to"
defend themselves in the mountains of southern Germany and western Austria.
"American forces in the south were really fighting hard to win. On 7 March, Lt. Gen. Courtney H. Hodges's 1st Army had captured a bridge over the Rhine at Remagen."

Mis-association.
"Béarnaise sauce is often wrongly called ""Bernaise sauce"", as if it were from ""Bern"", the capital city of Switzerland, which is in no way connected with this sauce or its origins."
"Some assume Béarnaise refers to the Béarn region, a former province now in the ""département"" of Pyrénées-Atlantiques, in southwestern Franceto refer to the region of Béarn However, the sauce has no tradition in the cooking of the area, and Larousse has the name honouring Henri IV of France, a native of Béarn, and for whom the restaurant where the sauce was first shown was named. Henri IV was often known as le Grand Béarnais"
A la béarnaise.
Some recipes are called à la béarnaise even when they are not accompanied by a Béarnaise sauce. This is because the recipes themselves are linked to the Béarn region. This added to confusion over the naming of the sauce.

Indian music
"There are lots of different varieties of Indian music. Most of the different types of music are similar to Western music types. Pop, classical, and folk are all included. India’s classical music has a history originating hundreds of years back and is still popular in India today, as religious inspiration or pure entertainment. Like Africa, India has many different ethnic groups, speaking their own languages, and having very distinct cultural traditions."
"The tal, or tala, is a repeating rhythm pattern usually played by the tabla. It usually has between six and sixteen beats. The beats are grouped into small sections in the pattern. The first note in the pattern is called a ‘sam’. It shows the beginnings and ends of improvisation, so it is often emphasized."
"The Raga is also a pattern, but it differs from Western scales or melodies. Ragas are sort of a mix of scales and melodies. They have particular ascending and descending patterns. Ragas are used to symbolize the time of day, season, mood or special occasion."
"A drone is a note that’s either held or repeated throughout a piece of music. It’s usually the tonic note, the starting note. Nowadays, the drone is played by an electrical box, but traditionally, it is played using the tanpura, which is also known as the Tambura."
"Improvisation is when the player does not have a prepared piece or an incomplete piece of music, and they make up notes as they play. Improvisation is recognized as a form of composition."
"There are 4 types of structure in Indian Music, Alap, Jhor, Jhala and Gat/Bandish. Each of these has different roles in a piece of Indian music."
Alap is the name for the opening part of a piece of classical music from North India. It is a type of melodic improvisation that includes a Raga in it. Only the singer and the drone can be heard at this point.
Jhor is a more elaborate version of the Raga that is included in the Alap. It forms the beginning of the performance. This comes after Alap and before Jhala.
Jhala indicates the fast-paced ending of the Raga. It is often distinguished by the overcoming of the melodic component by the rhythm.
"The Gat, or Bandish is a permanent composition set in a specific Raga. It is accompanied by the Tabla, a drone and melodic accompaniment by a sarangi , violin or harmonica."
Marriage.
"At 18, she married Daniel Parke Custis, a wealthy tobacco planter 20 years older than her. She bore him four children. Only two, John ""Jacky"" and Martha ""Patsy"", survived to young adulthood.

Her commitment to the welfare of the veterans of the Revolution would remain lifelong. They addressed her as ""Lady Washington."""
First Lady.
"Washington was unanimously elected president in 1789. Martha served as First Lady from April 30, 1789 to March 4, 1797. She found the job unpleasant.

She belonged to a famous family of Massachusetts (the Quincy Family)."
"In 1801, the couple retired and lived in Quincy. Abigail died in 1818, at age 74 of typhoid fever."
Early life.
"Abigail Adams advocated for an equal education in public schools for boys and girls. In her earliest years, she was often in poor health. She spent most of her time reading. In addition to that, she corresponded to family and friends before getting married."
"Adams did not get any formal education in any school or college. Her father had a big library, so she studied many books and became smart that way. She married John Adams in 1764. In the next ten years, she had five children (a sixth was stillborn). One of her children was John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the United States."
Political involvement.
"Adams was a vital confidant and adviser to her husband John Adams. She opposed slavery and supported women's rights. In 1776, her husband participated in the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. There, Adams wrote her most famous letter to the Founding Fathers ""remember the ladies."""

"Shakespeare's sources include works by Plutarch, Apuleius, Ovid, Geoffrey Chaucer, and Edmund Spenser. He found a description of Puck in Reginald Scot's ""The Discoverie of Witchcraft"" (1584). It is generally believed that the play was written for the festivities surrounding the aristocratic marriage of either Elizabeth Vere, Lord Burghley’s granddaughter, in 1595, or Elizabeth Carey, daughter of Sir George Carey, in 1596."

They used everything from Bauhaus designs to things that were really otherworldly.” Angelynn Grant adds, “When people think of Blue Note covers they think of Frank Wolff”s photography and Reid Miles design. But John Hermansader laid the groundwork that got them going along that path.” Richard Cook, who wrote Blue Note Records: The Biography states, “Hermansader in particular balanced the twin issues of photography and type in a way that would mirror the concerns of the Blue Note of the years ahead.”"

Stolen base
"In baseball, a stolen base is when a baserunner advances to the next base while the pitcher is throwing the ball to home plate. In baseball statistics, stolen bases are displayed as SB. It is possible to steal second base, third base, or home plate, but not to steal first base."
"If the defense does not try to put the baserunner out (for example, if the catcher does not even look his way), the play is called defensive indifference (also called fielder's indifference). No stolen base is credited to the runner in this case. Defensive indifference is usually only scored instead of a stolen base when the game is in a late inning and the team with the stealing baserunner is down by more than one run. MLB Rule 10.07(g) defines defensive indifference."
Strategy.
"A player who is good at stealing bases needs not just running speed, but also good base-running instincts, quickness, and split-second timing. The scoring and guidelines for awarding a stolen base to a runner are covered by rule 10.07 of the Major League Baseball rule book."
"If a player is good at stealing bases, his manager may let him try to steal a base whenever he thinks he can. A player who is allowed to try to steal whenever he wants is said to have the ""green light"". Players who do not have the green light may only be allowed to steal when a coach or manager tells him to."

Cradle of Humankind
"The Cradle of Humankind is a World Heritage Site. It was first named by UNESCO in 1999. The site is about 50 kilometres northwest of Johannesburg, South Africa in the Gauteng province, and occupies ."
"The site's limestone caves, including the Sterkfontein Caves, were where fossils were found. A 2.3-million year-old fossil ""Australopithecus africanus"" (nicknamed 'Mrs. Ples') was found in 1947 by Robert Broom and John T. Robinson. The find followed the 1924 discovery of the juvenile ""Australopithecus africanus"" skull, 'Taung Child', by Raymond Dart, at Taung in the North West Province of South Africa, where excavations still continue."
"The name ""Cradle of Humankind"" reflects the fact that the site has produced a large number, as well as some of the oldest, hominid fossils ever found, some dating back as far as 3.5 million years ago. Sterkfontein alone has produced more than a third of early hominid fossils ever found."
Recent work.
"The remains of several partial skeletons of a previously unknown Australopithecan species were found in 2008 near Johannesburg. They have been dated to about two million year ago (mya). A recent re-examination of two partial skeletons of ""Australopithecus sediba"" has led to its identification as close to the origin of the genus ""Homo"". Not all palaeoanthropologists agree this is a new species."
"A new analysis shows this species had a human-like pelvis, hands and teeth, and a chimpanzee-like foot. In six separate research reports, palaeontologists reported on the anatomy of a juvenile male skeleton, MH1, a female skeleton, known as MH2, and an isolated adult tibia or shinbone, known as MH4. The findings suggest that some species of australopithecine climbed trees, some walked on the ground, and some did both."
"Colleagues in England investigated the teeth. Like other parts of the skeleton, the teeth are a mosaic of primitive and human-like features."

"The short-tailed albatross or Steller's albatross (""Phoebastria albatrus"") is a large seabird from the North Pacific. With a wingspan of up to , it is the largest of the Albatrosses of the northern hemisphere. While breeding occurs in large colonies, the adult birds prefer a solitary life. It is a good flyer. 1949, almost all birds were thought to be extinct. When a few were re-discovered in 1951, they were protected. Since then, their numbers have increased, so that in 2022, they are no longer seen as ""endangered"", but as ""vulnerable"". Short-tailed albatrosses feed on cephalopods, fish, and crustaceans. They are oportunists, and will also feed on the organic waste ships throw overboard."
"Although related to the other North Pacific albatrosses, it also exhibits behavioural and morphological links to the albatrosses of the Southern Ocean. It was described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas from skins collected by Georg Wilhelm Steller (after whom its other common name is derived). Once common, it was brought to the edge of extinction by the trade in feathers, but with protection efforts underway since the 1950s, the species is in the process of recovering with an increasing population trend. Its breeding range, however, remains small.It is a part of the albatross family."

After the call, Squidward quickly assembles a marching band with the people of Bikini Bottom."
"Squidward has one week to prepare a concert for the Bubble Bowl. The band plays badly through the training. On the first day, Patrick and Sandy get into a fight. On the second day, two flag twirlers are killed when they spin their flags too fast and crash into a blimp. On the third day, Plankton tries to play the harmonica, but the holes are bigger than he is and he gets tired of running to each hole. On the fourth (and last) day, the band plays too loudly, breaking the windows of the building. All of the band then gets into a fight. When class is over, Squidward goes over to the doors and says that he is disappointed in the band for fighting and no longer wants his band to play in the Bubble Bowl. Once Squidward leaves, SpongeBob tells everyone to go through and perform at the Bubble Bowl to make Squidward happy."
"On the day of the concert, Squilliam finds Squidward at the Bubble Bowl entrance to see his band play poorly. Squidward says that his band died, but all of the band show up behind Squidward and say they are ready to perform. They enter a dome which takes them to the Bubble Bowl field. Squidward starts conducting with fear that the band will play poorly, but they play successfully. The band performs a song called ""Sweet Victory.""

Glenn Miller
"Alton Glenn Miller (March 1, 1904 – missing in action December 15, 1944) was an American big band musician, arranger, composer, and bandleader in the swing era. He was the best-selling recording artist from 1939 to 1943, leading one of the best known big bands. Miller's notable recordings include ""In the Mood"", ""Moonlight Serenade"", ""Pennsylvania 6-5000"", ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"", ""A String of Pearls"", ""At Last"", ""(I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo"", ""American Patrol"", ""Tuxedo Junction"", ""Elmer's Tune"", and ""Little Brown Jug"". During World War II, he led bands in the U.S. Army. While he was traveling in France during World War II, Glenn Miller's airplane disappeared over the English Channel."
Early life and career.
"Miller was born in Clarinda, Iowa. His parents were Mattie Lou (née Cavender) and Lewis Elmer Miller. In 1915, Miller's family moved to Grant City, Missouri, and he started playing in the town orchestra. At first, he played cornet and mandolin, but he switched to trombone by 1916. In 1918, the Miller family moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado, where Miller went to high school. During his senior year, he started a band with some classmates. They played ""dance band music"". By the time Miller graduated from high school in 1921, he had decided to become a professional musician."
"In 1923, Miller entered the University of Colorado at Boulder, but he spent most of his time away from school. He played auditions and gigs. He did not do well in school. He dropped out of school, and decided to start a career as a professional musician. He later studied under Joseph Schillinger and composed ""Moonlight Serenade"". In 1926, Miller toured with several groups, eventually landing a good spot in Ben Pollack's group in Los Angeles. While playing with this band, Miller wrote several musical arrangements and also co-wrote his first composition, ""Room 1411"", with Benny Goodman. In 1928, he married Helen Burger in New York City. At first, he was the main trombone soloist of the band. But when another trombone player joined, Miller was given fewer solos. At this point, he decided he should mainly be a composer. In the late 1920s, he wrote and published a songbook."
"In the early 1930s, Miller was a trombonist, arranger, and composer in The Dorsey Brothers. Miller composed the songs ""Annie's Cousin Fannie"", ""Dese Dem Dose"", ""Harlem Chapel Chimes"", and ""Tomorrow's Another Day"" in 1934 and 1935. In 1935, he started an American orchestra for British bandleader Ray Noble. In this band, he featured a lead clarinet over four saxophones. He later used this arrangement in his own bands."
"Glenn Miller formed his first band in 1937. The band broke up after playing its last show at the Ritz Ballroom in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on January 2, 1938."
Success from 1938 to 1942.
"Miller was discouraged and returned to New York. He realized that the band needed to have a ""sound"" that was different from other bands. He decided to make the clarinet and tenor saxophone play the melody together, while three other saxophones played harmony. Miller hired a saxophonist named Wilbur Schwartz, but instead had him play lead clarinet. This was unique because it did not rely on repeated motifs, like other bands."
"Miller had a staff who wrote and arranged songs for the band. They were Jerry Gray, Bill Finegan, Billy May, and George Williams."
Bluebird Records and Glen Island Casino.
"In September 1938, the Miller band began making recordings for Bluebird Records. Cy Shribman, a prominent East Coast businessman, began financing the band. In the spring of 1939, the band played at the Meadowbrook Ballroom in Cedar Grove, New Jersey and at the Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle, New York. At Glen Island, 1800 people attended Afterwards, the band became much more popular. The band's recording ""Tuxedo Junction"" sold 115,000 copies in the first week."
"On February 10, 1942, Miller received a gold record for ""Chattanooga Choo-Choo"". ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" was performed by the Miller orchestra with his singers Gordon ""Tex"" Beneke, Paula Kelly and the vocal group, the Modernaires. Other singers with this orchestra included Marion Hutton, Skip Nelson, Ray Eberle, Kay Starr, Ernie Caceres, Dorothy Claire and Jack Lathrop."
Motion pictures.
"Miller and his band appeared in two films. The first one was ""Sun Valley Serenade"" (1941) The second was ""Orchestra Wives"" (1942)."
Army Air Force Band: 1942–1944.
"In 1942, Miller decided to join the war effort because he was too old to be drafted. At first, he volunteered for the Navy but was told he was not needed. Miller then wrote to Army Brigadier General Charles Young. He asked to lead an army band so he could entertain the Allied Forces, and was accepted this time. He earned the rank of captain and he was soon promoted to major by August 1944."
"He was placed in the United States Army at first, but was then moved to the Army Air Forces. Captain Glenn Miller served as an officer at the training center at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1942. He played trombone with the Rhythmaires, a 15-piece dance band, both on the base and in the town."
"On May 21, 1982, RKO General lost the license to broadcast and Channel 7 was taken over by New England Television on May 22. The channel was renamed WNEV-TV. New England Television bought a radio station known as WHDH in 1989, and in January, 1990, channel 7 was renamed WHDH-TV. On January 2, 1995, Channel 7 stopped showing CBS programs and began showing NBC programs. Before then, NBC programs were shown on WBZ-TV, Channel 4, which now shows CBS programs. The reason for this switch is because WBZ-TV's owners merged with the CBS network."
"In 1993, the station was sold to Sunbeam Television. In July, 2010, Channel 7 officially dropped the -TV from its name, becoming just WHDH."
"In 2017, the station stopped carrying NBC programming, losing the affiliation to WBTS-CD, and became an independent television station."
Lawrence Welk
"Lawrence Welk (March 11, 1903 – May 17, 1992) was an American musician, accordionist, bandleader, and television impresario, who hosted ""The Lawrence Welk Show"" from 1955 to 1982. His style came to be known as ""champagne music""."
"In 1996, Welk was ranked #43 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time."
Early life.
"Welk was born in Strasburg, North Dakota. Most people there spoke German, but also knew English. His parents were Ludwig and Christiana (Schwahn) Welk, who were ethnic Germans from Russia. They emigrated to America in 1892 from Selz, Kutschurgan District, in the German-speaking area north of Odessa (now Odessa, Ukraine, but then in southwestern Russia). In North Dakota, the family lived on a homestead."
"Welk decided on a career in music and got his father to buy him an accordion from a mail order for $400 (equivalent to $ in ) He promised his father that he would work on the farm until he was 21, to pay his father back for the accordion. Any other money he earned during that time, by doing farmwork or performing, would go to his family."
Early career.
"On his 21st birthday, Welk left the family's farm to start his career in music. During the 1920s, he performed with the Luke Witkowski, Lincoln Boulds, and George T. Kelly bands before he started his own orchestra. He led big bands in North Dakota and eastern South Dakota. These included the Hotsy Totsy Boys and later the Honolulu Fruit Gum Orchestra. His band also played for radio station WNAX in Yankton, South Dakota. In 1927, he graduated from the MacPhail School of Music in Minneapolis, Minnesota."
"During the 1930s, Welk led a traveling big band that played dance tunes and ""sweet"" music. At first, the band traveled around the country by car. They were too poor to rent rooms, so they usually slept and changed clothes in their cars. At an engagement at the William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh, a dancer said that Welk's band's sound was as ""light and bubbly as champagne,"" which is where the term ""Champagne Music"" came from. Welk described his band's sound, saying ""We still play music with the champagne style, which means light and rhythmic. We place the stress on melody; the chords are played pretty much the way the composer wrote them. We play with a steady beat so that dancers can follow it."""
"Welk's big band performed across the country but mostly at ballrooms and hotels in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas. In the early 1940s, the band started to play at the Trianon Ballroom in Chicago, where they played for 10 years. His orchestra also played at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City during the late 1940s. Welk recorded a version of Spade Cooley's ""Shame on You"" with Western artist Red Foley in 1945. The record (Decca 18698) was #4 on Billboard's September 15 ""Most Played Juke Box Folk Records"" listing. From 1949 through 1951, the band had its own national radio program on ABC."
Recordings.
"Sometimes, Welk's band made recordings in Richmond, Indiana and in Grafton, Wisconsin for the Gennett and Paramount companies. In November, 1928, he recorded for Gennett and in 1931, he recorded for Paramount. These records are very rare."
"From 1938 to 1940, he recorded in New York and Chicago for the Vocalion label. He started with Decca in 1941, and recorded for Mercury and Coral before starting with Dot in the early 1950s."
"In 1966, his orchestra recorded an album on the Ranwood Records label, with Jazz saxophonist Johnny Hodges, featuring a number of Jazz standards, including ""Someone to Watch Over Me"", ""Misty"" and ""Fantastic, That's You"". The album has been out of print for many years."
"""The Lawrence Welk Show""."
"In 1951, Welk moved to Los Angeles. The same year, he began hosting ""The Lawrence Welk Show"". It was broadcast from the Aragon Ballroom in Venice Beach. The show became a local hit and was picked up by ABC in June 1955."
"The show had a ""bubble machine."" Whenever the orchestra played a polka or waltz, Welk himself would dance with the band's female singer, called a ""Champagne Lady"" on the show. His first Champagne Lady was Jayne Walton Rosen (her real name was Dorothy Jayne Flanagan). Rocky Rockwell would usually sing novelty songs. Welk would also have one song each show where he would play an accordion solo."
"Welk's show would rarely play current music, except as a novelty. On the December 8, 1956 show, the show did play two current songs. They were ""Nuttin' for Christmas,"" and Elvis Presley's ""Don't Be Cruel."""
"The songs on the show were mostly popular music standards, polkas, and novelty songs. Welk often danced with women from the audience."
"Welk had very high quality musicians, including accordionist Myron Floren, concert violinist Dick Kesner, guitarist Buddy Merrill, and New Orleans Dixieland clarinetist Pete Fountain. He paid his regular band members very well, and it was common for them to stay with the band a long time. For example, Floren was the band's assistant conductor throughout the whole time the show was broadcast."
"The show didn't only play big-band era music. During the 1960s and 1970s, for example, the show played music that was originally by The Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Hal David, The Everly Brothers and Paul Williams and others, but in a style his older viewers would like. The show was originally in black and white. It changed to color in fall 1965."
"While it was on network television, ""The Lawrence Welk Show"" aired on ABC on Saturday nights at 9 p.m. (Eastern Time), but changed to 8:30 p.m. in fall 1963. From 1956 to 1959, it was also known as ""The Dodge Dancing Party"", because Welk was also hosting another show called ""Top Tunes and New Talent"" on Mondays. ABC canceled the show in 1971, but it continued on 250 stations across the country until 1982."
Personal life.
"Welk was married for 61 years, until he died, to Fern Renner (b. August 26, 1903, d. February 13, 2002). They had three children."
"Welk was an excellent businessman. He had investments in real estate and music publishing, and was a general partner in a commercial real estate development."
Welk had four US design patents:
Welk was a Roman Catholic and a daily communicant.
Later years.
"Jacqueline Onassis returned to the United States after her second husband died. She lived in Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard, and the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port. In 1975, she became an editor at Viking Press. She worked there for two years."
"Jacqueline Onassis went to the 1976 Democratic National Convention. This was her first political event in almost ten years. She quit Viking Press in 1977. This was after Viking had published Jeffrey Archer's novel ""Shall We Tell the President?"". The story happens in a fictional future presidency of her brother in-law, Ted Kennedy. The book was about a plan to assassinate him. Two years later, she went to Boston to support Ted Kennedy's 1980 presidential campaign."
"After she left Viking Press, Onassis worked for Doubleday. She was an associate editor. Some of the books she edited for the company were Larry Gonick's ""The Cartoon History of the Universe"", the English translation of Naghib Mahfuz's ""Cairo Trilogy"", and autobiographies of ballerina Gelsey Kirkland, singer-songwriter Carly Simon, and fashion icon Diana Vreeland."
"In the 1970s, she supported a campaign to save Grand Central Terminal from demolition and repair it. A plaque inside the terminal talks about her role in its preservation. In the 1980s, she supported protests against a planned skyscraper at Columbus Circle that would have created large shadows on Central Park. She also supported saving Olana, the home of Frederic Edwin Church in New York."
"Jacqueline Onassis had a lot of press attention. Paparazzi photographer Ron Galella followed her around and took pictures of her without her permission. From 1980 until her death in May 1994, Onassis had a close relationship with businessman Maurice Tempelsman."
"In the early 1990s, Jacqueline Onassis supported Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton for president. She donated money to his presidential campaign. After the 1992 presidential election, she met with First Lady Hillary Clinton. They talked about raising a child in the White House. Mrs. Clinton later said that Jacqueline Onassis was an inspiration for her."
Illness and Death.
"In November 1993, Jacqueline Onassis was thrown from her horse while she was fox hunting in Middleburg, Virginia. She was taken to the hospital. Doctors found a swollen lymph node in her groin. They thought it was an infection at first. The fall made her health worse over the next six months. In December, Onassis had new symptoms such as stomach pain and swollen lymph nodes in her neck. She had non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She began chemotherapy in January 1994. By March, the cancer had spread to her spinal cord and brain. By May, it had spread to her liver. Her condition was terminal."
"Jacqueline made her last trip back home from New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center on May 18, 1994. The next day on May 19, she died in her sleep at her Manhattan apartment, aged 64. Her two children were by her side. Her son John F. Kennedy, Jr. announced her death the next day. He said that she died with her family around her."
"On May 23, 1994, her funeral was held and was short and small. Fewer than 100 people were at the 11 minute long funeral. She was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, next to her husband President Kennedy, their son Patrick, and their stillborn daughter Arabella. President Bill Clinton spoke at her graveside service. At the time of her death, her children Caroline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr., her three grandchildren, Rose, Tatiana and John Schlossberg, and sister Lee Radziwill were her living relatives. Her estate was worth $43.7 million."
Honors.
"In 1994, the Municipal Art Society of New York started the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal. It is given to a person whose work has greatly helped New York City. The White House's East Garden was renamed the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden soon after her husband died. The Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School for International Careers was opened in 1995. The main reservoir in Central Park was renamed in her honor."
Legacy.
"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is seen as one of the most popular first ladies. She was named 27 times on the annual Gallup list of the top 10 most admired people of the second half of the 20th century. This was more often than any president of the United States listed. In 2014, she came in third place in a Siena College Institute survey as the best first lady. She was behind Eleanor Roosevelt and Abigail Adams in the survey."
"In 2020, ""Time"" magazine included her name on its list of 100 Women of the Year. She was named Woman of the Year 1962 for her White House restoration works."
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is seen as an important first lady in United States history. Many historians feel that First Ladies since Kennedy Onassis have either been compared to or against her.

Hurricane Earl (2010)
"Hurricane Earl was an intense and long-lived hurricane that was also the first such storm to threaten New England since Hurricane Bob nineteen years earlier. The storm's center passed eighty six miles east of North Carolina on September 3, 2010. The storm then moved northeast, eventually being downgraded to tropical storm status and then becoming a hurricane again shortly before the storm made landfall in Nova Scotia. Before lashing the eastern United States, the hurricane passed extremely close to the Leeward Islands; the damage there totaled $40 million (2010 USD)."

Iași
Iaşi is a city in the northeastern part of Romania. It is the second largest city in Romania as of the year 2007. Iaşi used to be the capital of Moldavia.
History.
Alexandru Lăpuşneanu changed the capital of Moldavia from Suceava to Iaşi in 1564. One of the first churches to be built in Moldavia was built by the Greek adventurer Prince Ioan Iacob Heraclid.
The Tatars burned the city down in 1513. The Ottoman Empire also burned the city down in 1538 and people from the Imperial Russian army did so again in 1686. The plague spread throughout the city in 1734.
The Russo-Turkish War of 1787 was stopped when the Peace of Iaşi happened. Alexander Ypsilanti and the Filiki Eteria came into the city and took it in 1822.
"Iaşi was the capital of Moldavia from 1568 to 1859. When World War I happened, Iaşi became the capital of Romania. This happened when the Central Powers took Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Bucharest became the capital again when Imperial Germany was defeated."
Geography.
"Iaşi can be found on the Bahlui River, which is a tributary of the Jijia. Forests and uplands are very common. These woods and hills include the monasteries of Cetăţuia, Frumoasa, and Galata. People have thought that Iaşi was built on seven hills (Cetăţuia, Galata, Copou-Aurora, Bucium-Păun, Şorogari, Repedea and Breazu in Romanian)."
Population.
The population of Iaşi has changed a bit over the years:
"In 1910, Emil Kraepelin named the disease 'Alzheimer's disease'. Alzheimer's disease usually beigins affecting people between ages 60–65, in Ms. Deter's case - who was 55-years-old when she died - she had a form of what is now known as ""Early-onset Alzhiemer's disease""."
Famous cases.
"Anyone can get Alzheimer's disease, rich people or poor famous people and unfamous people. Some of the famous people who have gotten Alzheimer's disease are former United States President Ronald Reagan and Irish writer Iris Murdoch, both of whom were the subjects of scientific articles examining how their cognitive capacities got worse with the disease."
"Other cases include the retired footballer Ferenc Puskás, the former Prime Ministers Harold Wilson (United Kingdom) and Adolfo Suárez (Spain), the actress Rita Hayworth, the Nobel Prize-winner Raymond Davis, Jr., the actors Charlton Heston and Gene Wilder, the novelist Terry Pratchett, politician and activist Sargent Shriver, the Blues musician B.B. King, director Jacques Rivette, Indian politician George Fernandes,"
"and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics recipient Charles K. Kao. In 2012, Nobel Prize writer Gabriel García Márquez was diagnosed with the disease. Former Finnish President Mauno Koivisto died of the disease in May 2017. Country singer Glen Campbell died of the disease in August 2017."
Elaine Paige
"Elaine Paige OBE (born Elaine Jill Bickerstaff, 5 March 1948) is an English actress and singer. She was born and raised in Barnet, Hertfordshire, in 1948. She is known for her roles in musical theater."
Life.
"She worked in the theatre from a young age. She quickly became famous in the role of Eva Perón in the musical ""Evita"" in 1978. She studied acting at the Aida Foster stage school in London and then played roles in the British tour of the show ""The Roar of the Greasepaint, the Smell of the Crowd"" and the first London production of ""Hair"". She played Sandy in the London production of ""Grease"" and appeared as one of Michael Crawford's girlfriends in ""Billy"". She has since said she was about to leave the world of acting, possibly to become a teacher, but then the role in ""Evita"" was offered to her."
"After ""Evita"", she did not have any work for a period. She thought that her musical career had seen its best. When the actress Judi Dench had an injury during rehearsals for ""Cats"", the producers asked Paige play the role in stead of Dench. They stated that the role ""was not another ""Evita"""" and that her role only had one and a half songs. Fortunately, the song was ""Memory"", which was a top 10 hit for Paige and has become her signature song."
"After ""Cats"", she appeared in ""Abbacadbra"", an ABBA compilation, and ""Chess"", also written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA but with lyrics by Tim Rice, co-writer of ""Evita"". Paige then scored a number 1 single, ""I Know Him So Well"", a song from ""Chess"", as a duet with Barbara Dickson."
"In 1989, she co-produced and starred in a production of Cole Porter's ""Anything Goes"" in London, which made a star of John Barrowman. In the early 1990s, her term relationship with the lyricist Tim Rice stopped and Paige tried an image change by recording an album with a California-based producer in the Bette Midler torch singer vein entitled ""Love Can Do That"". Her solo albums had so far been a variety of songs, including the very successful ""Stages"" in 1983, with songs from musical theatre. In 1993, she returned to the United States to work with Peter Matz on an album called ""Romance and the Stage"" featuring songs from earlier days of musical theatre. The following year, she recorded, ""Piaf"", which had music from the role she was playing in the Pam Gems play, also called ""Piaf"". Critics were impressed by her acting skills in that play."
"However, in 1995 she had a role in another musical, playing Norma Desmond in Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Sunset Boulevard"". She had always wanted to perform on Broadway and ""Sunset Boulevard"" now made this possible. For more than a year she played the role. She later had another role in 2000 with the ""King and I"". She has recently moved more into television and radio work."
Paige was awarded an OBE in 1995. Now she is hosting a Sunday afternoon BBC Radio 2 show which plays music from the stage and film.

He had a long-term relationship in the 1980s with the actress Elaine Paige.
"In 2018, Rice became one of fifteen people to win an Oscar, Grammy, Tony and Emmy Award."
Evita (musical)
"Evita is a musical. The lyrics were written by Tim Rice. The music was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The musical is based on the life of Eva Perón (1919-1952), the wife of Argentine President Juan Perón, which Che is telling."
"The dance is thought to have come from about 5,000 years ago when the Koreans believed that the Sun, Moon, and Earth controlled the world. The people (almost always girls in hanboks) would dance under the brightest full moon of the year in order to bring a good harvest."
"In the 16th century, when the Japanese were attacking Korea, Korea's Admiral Yi Sun-sin ordered women to do this dance. He told them to do this because he wanted to trick the Japanese into overestimating them. The women were said to have worn military uniforms and danced on Mount Okmae (옥매산)."
"On February 15, 1966, ganggangsullae was included in the list of the ""Important Cultural Properties of Korea"" #8."
Description.
"Traditionally, this dance performed without any instruments. Young and old women dance in a circle at night under the moonlight. They go outside in hanbok, traditional Korean clothing, hold hands, make a circle, and start rotating clockwise. The lead singer sings a line. Then, the rest of the people all sing, 'ganggangsullae'. Then the lead singer sings another line, and the rest of the people reply, 'ganggangsullae'. This is probably where the name of the song came from. As the dance continues, the tempo of the song can get faster. They sing about their personal hardships, relationships, and wants. During the dance, the women also play some games. The ganggangsullae can last until dawn."
Easter Bilby
The Easter Bilby is an Australian alternative to the Easter Bunny. Bilbies are an endangered species of Australian marsupials. Bilby shaped chocolates are sold in many Australian shops to raise money to help protect the bilbies.
"Author Rose-Marie Dusting wrote a book in 1979 called ""Billy, the Aussie Easter Bilby"". Some of the money from each book sold goes to helping the bilbies."
"The Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia began to use the Easter Bilby concept in 1991. They wanted to show the damage that rabbits do to the Australian environment. The ideas was taken up by an Easter egg company, Darrell Lea. They give a portion of their profits to the foundation."
"Australian children's book author and illustrator Irena Sibley produced three Easter Bilby books between 1994 and 2000 including the best selling ""The Bilbies' First Easter""."
John Richard Hicks
"Sir John Richard Hicks (8 April 1904 – 20 May 1989) was a British economist. He contributed to the fields of consumer demand theory in microeconomics. In 1937, he developed the IS/LM model which summarizes a Keynesian view of macroeconomics. His book ""Value and Capital"" (1939) significantly extended general-equilibrium and value theory. The compensated demand function is named the Hicksian demand function in memory of him."
He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1964.
In 1972 he received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (jointly) for his pioneering contribution to general equilibrium theory and welfare theory.
Hicks died on 20 May 1989 at his home in the Cotswold village of Blockley at the age of 85.

The track had a special problem. The track was located in the middle of a desert. There were concerns that sand would blow onto the track and disrupt the race. Organizers (the people who run the race) were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive (glue) on the sand around the track.
The surface of the track has a high level of grip. The same surface is used at the Yas Marina Circuit for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Interquartile range
"In statistics, the interquartile range (IQR) is a number that indicates how spread out the data are, and tells us what the range is in the middle of a set of scores."
The interquartile range IQR is defined as:
"That is, it is calculated as the range of the middle half of the scores. The scores are divided into four equal parts, separated by the quartiles formula_2 and formula_3, after the scores have been arranged in ascending order (becoming bigger as one goes further). The second quartile formula_4 is also known as the median."
"The interquartile range is not sensitive to outliers (scores that are much higher or much lower than the other scores). In fact, it eliminates them."
Example.
Given the following 20 scores arranged from the smallest to the largest:
We can put them into four different groups of five numbers each:
The groups are thus separated by:
Hence the interquartile range is:
"If the observation 29 has accidentally been written down as 92 instead, then this number is an outlier. Notice that the interquartile range is not affected in that case."

Chinese Civil War
"The Chinese Civil War (Chinese ; 中国内战) (Russian ; Гражданская Война в Китае) was a civil war fought from 1927 to 1949 because of differences in thinking between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang (KMT, or Chinese Nationalist Party). The war was a fight for legitimacy of the government of China. The war began in April 1927 because of the Northern Expedition (國民革命軍北伐) and mostly ended in 1950. Some people say the war has not ended, but no large battles have started since that year. Relations between the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) are still poor because both claim to be the legitimate sovereign government of all of China. The Chinese Civil War was the third-largest war of all time, after World War 1 and World War 2. It was part of the Interwar period in the aftermath of the Great War from 1918 to 1939 and was also part of the Cold War in the aftermath of World War 2 from 1945 to 1949 . The war is usually divided into two parts: 1927-1937 and 1946-1949 . It started and stopped several times before the Second Sino-Japanese War and there was less fighting after the Empire of Japan had invaded. The war between the CCP and the KMT started again in 1946 after Japan's defeat in World War II. The CCP took control of most of China, and the KMT had only islands left. About two million Chinese fled to Taiwan in late 1949. In 1950, no large battles were started. The loss of the KMT in Mainland China is said to be for several reasons:"
"No agreement was made between the two governments and so some say that the war has not ended. Both governments have many military weapons to be used against only against each other, both still say they are the legitimate government of China, and both seek diplomatic relations with other countries as the only legitimate government."
Background and Prelude 1894-1911.
"In 1894 Japan invaded the Qing Dynasty in Manchuria and Taiwan and as well as Korea . In 1899-1901 the Boxer Rebellion happened and Japan invaded China again but allied with Russia, Germany, Austria, France, Britain and America to support Yuan Shikai to stop Empress Dowager Cixi. This led to the fall of the Qing dynasty in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, the country was thrown into turmoil. In the ensuing power vacuum, a large number of warlords seized control of different parts of the country. To defeat them and unify the country, Sun Yat-sen and his KMT sought help from foreign governments."
"He made pleas to several Western democratic nations, but none offered help cats. It was only after he turned to the Soviets in 1921 that Sun found aid. The communist Soviet Union agreed to help the KMT if the smaller Chinese Communist Party be allowed to join. In 1923 the Soviet Union, the KMT, and the CCP made an agreement, the Sun-Joffe Manifesto, which said the Soviets would help China have only one government. Mikhail Borodin traveled to China in 1923 to help change the KMT to make it similar to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The CCP and KMT were joined in the First United Front."
"In 1923, Chiang Kai-shek travelled to the Soviet Union to study military and politics with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1924, he became the leader of the Whampoa Military Academy in China. Most of the help from the Soviet Union was for that school, which taught Soviet political and military ideas to the KMT and the CCP. The Soviets gave books and guns to use for teaching about war and military things. With Soviet help Sun made an ""army of the party"". Members of the CCP were also in the school and some were teachers. Zhou Enlai was a teacher in the school."
"The KMT then agreed to let some communists join the KMT, when the CCP was small compared to the KMT. The CCP had 300 members in 1922 and only 1,500 by 1925. The KMT in 1923, however, had 50,000 members."
The First Chinese Civil War 1927-1936 and the Second Civil War 1945-1949.
In 1927 the civil war in the Republic of China began when the Kuomintang (KMT) became rivals with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and both parties led by Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong were fighting against each other. The Chinese Nationalists got support from the Weimar German Republic and Nazi Germany by buying German Weapons from Europe until the Nazi’s started to support the Japanese Empire in 1937 when the Second Sino-Japanese War began which is the start of World War 2 in Asia .

It also broke Hirst's own record with £10.3 million for ""The Golden Calf"", an animal with 18-carat gold horns and hooves, preserved in formaldehyde."
"Since 1999 some of Hirst's works have been claimed to be plagiarised. It was discovered that his sculpture ""Hymn"" was closely based on a child's toy. Hirst was sued by the original creator of the toy, and the case was settled out-of-court."

Freddy West Tjakamarra
"Freddy West Tjakamarra (previously Tjukurti Tjakamarra; born around 1932 – died 1994) was an Australian Aboriginal artist. He was a leader of the Pintupi people during their return to traditional lands in the 1980s. He was one of the founders of the Kiwirrkurra settlement in 1983. As a painter, West was part of the Western Desert movement, and was one of the very first painters of the Papunya Tula school."
Early life.
"Freddy West was born in the Great Sandy Desert sometime in the early 1930s. He was born in the Pollock Hills, north of where Kiwirrkura is today, and lived a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle for the first half of his life. He and his family were mostly based along the western shore of Lake Mackay. They often travelled with another group, led by a man named Waku Tjungurrayi. These families became some of the last nomadic groups left in the desert – most other families having been settled in government stations since the 1950s. In 1962, West decided that he would go and join his relatives, who were living at Papunya. This is traditionally Luritja land, but the Pintupi had become displaced here because of weapons tests being done at Woomera. He met some officers of the Territory's welfare department in the area of Dovers Hills, and arranged for them to take him and his family to Papunya in a year's time. In August 1963, West and his family began to walk to Papunya and met the welfare officers on the way. West had two wives: Parara and Payu, who were sisters of the Napaltjarri skin grouping."
"At Papunya, West started to paint with Geoffrey Bardon. He became one of the first members of the Papunya Tula school, and a shareholder in the company. In the late 1970s, West campaigned strongly within the Pintupi community for them to leave Papunya and return to their traditional country in the west. He moved back west with other Pintupi in 1981 and set up the community of Kintore. He was later an important person in the establishment of Kiwirrkurra, in 1983. He lived there for most of the rest of his life. He married a third wife in October 1984, Takariya Napaltjarri. She was the daughter of Waku Tjungurrayi, and had only come out of the desert a few days before they were married. They soon separated, and Takariya remarried. With his two other wives, West had 15 children. He died in 1994."
Painting.
"West did not paint much compared with many other early Papunya artists. His early works depicted abstract scenes of men's ceremonies, and were very decorated. His later works depicted stories from the Pintupi dreamtime (""Tingari""), using a motif of circles and lines. He has works in the Australian Museum in Sydney, the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, and the Art Gallery of South Australia in Adelaide."

He painted mythological events that happened around his homeland, including around Winparrku, Lake MacDonald and Lake Mackay."
"Pinta Pinta was from Western Australia. He was born at Yumari, a place in the Great Sandy Desert. He was probably born sometime in the late 1920s (around 1927 or 1928). Before contact with White society, he lived a nomadic way of life in the desert. In the 1950s, he walked with his family to stay at Haasts Bluff, a government rations outpost. This was his first contact with modern Australian civilisation. His was one of the last groups in the country to come out of the desert."
"Pinta Pinta began painting in the mid-1970s, at Papunya. He moved to Kintore after it was founded in 1981. In 1984, Pinta Pinta and his family set up an outstation at Winparrku (Mount Webb), between Kintore and Kiwirrkurra. The family moved here shortly after. In 1988, he had a small part in the move ""Evil Angels""."
"His paintings mostly stick to black, white and ochre in colour. The most obvious motif seen in them is the circles and lines, which depict dreaming tracks. Some of his works are in the Australian Museum, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory."
"He had two sons, Matthew (born early 1960s) and Nyilyari (born about 1965). Nyilyari also became a famous artist."

"Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve (15 April 1793 – 23 November 1864 (Julian calendar: 11 November)) was a German-born Russian astronomer. He was born in Altona (now an area of Hamburg), Germany, but later lived in Russia. He was an expert on double stars and one of the first astronomers to measure stellar parallax (closely related to the work by Friedrich Bessel)."
"While director of Dorpat Observatory (1817–39) he wrote ""Stellarum Duplicum et Multiplicum"" (1837), which proved that double stars are not exceptional and that star systems are governed by the laws of gravity. Struve added a lot to the study of galactic structure and also engaged in notable geodetic operations such as the triangulation of Livonia and the measurement of an arc of the meridian. In 1839 he became director of the new Pulkovo Observatory and was one of the first three astronomers who almost simultaneously obtained an approximate stellar parallax. (One of the others being Bessel)"
"In 1822 he published the first of many double-star catalogues, the identifying numbers of which are still used today. Struve's stars, however, are now often named in his honor (for example, Struve 2398), whereas the original catalogue prefix was the Greek letter sigma. In 1833 he moved to Russia to set up the Pulkovo Observatory near St. Petersburg, of which he was director until his retirement in 1862, when his son took over in the post. In total, Friedrich Struve produced 272 astronomical works and 18 children; his great-grandson Otto, by contrast, produced 907 works but zero children."

Mexico
"Mexico (; official name: United Mexican States , ) is a country in North America. Mexico is south of Texas, California and other American states. Guatemala and Belize are south of Mexico. Mexico is between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico."
"People living in Mexico or who are from there are called Mexicans. Most Mexican people speak Spanish. There are also Mexicans who speak Native American languages, like Nahuatl, Mayan, and Zapotec. Most modern Mexicans are descended from Native Americans such as Aztecs and Mayans and mostly have native blood. They are Catholic. The capital of Mexico is Mexico City."
History.
"Before the Europeans came, many Native American cultures existed in Mexico. The earliest was the Olmec culture in the south. The Olmecs are famous for the large stone heads they made. On the Yucatán peninsula lived the Mayans. The Mayans lived in city states ruled by kings. The Mayans were most powerful between 200 and 900 A.D. Another powerful empire belonged to Teotihuacan. Teotihuacan was a very large city, one of the largest at that time. After Teotihuacan declined the Toltecs became powerful. Things made by the Toltecs have been found from the southern parts of the U.S. all the way to Costa Rica. A famous Toltec god is Quetzalcoatl. The Toltec culture declined too, and it was succeeded by the Aztecs. The Aztecs called their own empire Mexico. A famous Aztec king was Moctezuma II."
"In 1519 the Spanish explorer Hernán Cortés came to Mexico. The Aztecs thought he was the returned Quetzalcoatl, so they did not want to fight against him. Cortes allied himself with the enemies of the Aztecs. In 1521 they conquered the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan. The Aztec Empire became part of Spain. It was called New Spain."
"In 1810 the Mexican priest Miguel Hidalgo started the Mexican war of independence. In 1821 the Spanish finally retreated and Mexico became independent. The first leader of independent Mexico was Agustin de Iturbide. He set up the First Mexican Empire and became emperor. But the Mexicans were not happy with him, and in 1823 the country became a republic."
"A man who was very important in Mexico in the early 19th century was Antonio López de Santa Anna. He was the president of Mexico 11 times. When he became a dictator, Texas declared independence (1836). The Battle of the Alamo was part of this Texas Revolution. Between 1846 and 1848 there was war between Mexico and the United States. In this war Mexico lost its large northern areas, which became the southwestern United States. After this war Santa Anna was sent away to Venezuela."
"Between 1858 and 1861 there was war again, between liberals and conservatives. The liberal Benito Juárez won the war and became president afterwards. Juarez stayed president until France invaded Mexico and made Maximilian of Habsburg emperor of the Second Mexican Empire. But Maximilian was very unpopular. After more war he was executed in 1867, and Juarez became president again."
"Conservatives thought Juarez had too much power. In 1876 they ousted him, and made Porfirio Díaz, a general who had won a battle against the French, president. Porfirio Díaz made the country wealthier, but the poor people became poorer. Franciso I. Madero started the Mexican Revolution in 1910."
"The next 10 years the country was in chaos. There were many presidents who ruled for a short time and all kinds of people fought against each other. Famous people from this period are Emiliano Zapata, Pancho Villa and Francisco I. Madero. When Álvaro Obregón became president in 1920 the fighting calmed down."
"In 1929 President Plutarco Elías Calles founded the National Mexican Party, PNM. The party was later renamed Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI. The party would rule for a very long time. Most PRI presidents were not popular, it was said that they were only president to become richer themselves. An exception was president Lázaro Cárdenas. He was president between 1934 and 1940."
"After several decades more and more people became unhappy with the PRI. In 1968 security forces shot at protesters, this caused several hundred deaths and became known as the Tlatelolco massacre. Another uprising was in 1994 when Zapatistas rebelled in the province Chiapas."
"Mainly through ballot box fraud the PRI managed to stay into power until 2000, when Vicente Fox of the National Action Party, PAN, was elected president. In total the PRI had governed Mexico for 71 years."
Politics.
Mexico is a constitutional federal democracy ruled by a president. The president is elected every 6 years. The current president is Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Parliament has a Senate and House of Deputies.
Geography.
"Mexico is in the southern part of North America. It is roughly shaped like a triangle. Mexico is more than 3000 km (1,850 miles) long from northwest to southeast. Mexico is between two large seas: the Pacific Ocean in the West and the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea in the East. Mexico has two large peninsulas. Baja California in the northwest, and Yucatán in the southeast. In central and western Mexico are the Sierra Madre mountains. In the Sierra Madre is the Pico de Orizaba, the highest mountain of Mexico. In central Mexico there are also a few volcanoes like the Popocatépetl and the Iztaccíhuatl. The Pico de Orizaba is also a volcano. In the north of Mexico are deserts. In the south are tropical rainforests. Some rivers in Mexico are the Río Bravo (known in the US as the Rio Grande), the Río Balsas, the Río Pánuco, and the Río Yaqui."
People.
"Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world. It is also the second most populous country in Latin America (after Brazil). 60% of Mexicans have Native American and European forefathers (mostly Native American); these are called mestizos. Almost 30% of Mexicans are pure Native American and 10% are European. Most Mexicans (90%) speak Spanish. 10% of the Mexicans speak a Native American language, like Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, Maya or Zapotec. Non-indigenous ethnic groups in Mexico speak another foreign language such as Arabic or Japanese. Most people in Mexico are Catholic (89%) Christians."
Atlantic Ocean
The Atlantic Ocean is the world's second largest ocean. It covers a total area of about . It covers about 20 percent of the Earth's surface. It is named after the god Atlas from Greek mythology.
Geologic history.

British Armed Forces
"The British Armed Forces are the armed forces of the United Kingdom. The British Armed Forces are officially called Her Majesty's Armed Forces, and they are sometimes called the Armed Forces of the Crown. The British Armed Forces is made up of three parts: the British Army, the Royal Navy (and the Royal Marines) and the Royal Air Force."
"The Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces is the British monarch. Members of the British Armed Forces must swear that they will obey the orders of the monarch (swear allegiance). Under the constitution of the United Kingdom, the armed forces controlled by the Crown, however, because of the 1689 Bill of Rights, the UK cannot have an army during peacetime unless the British Parliament allows it. Nowadays, the British Parliament passes an Armed Forces Act every five years, which means the UK can keep its military. The British Prime Minister is the ""de facto"" commander of the British Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=""United Kingdom 05/06""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The armed forces are managed by the Ministry of Defence."
"The British Armed Forces protect the United Kingdom, the British overseas territories and the Crown dependencies. They also take part in United Nations peacekeeping missions. The British Armed Forces often take part in NATO missions. The most recent wars the British Armed Forces have fought are the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Operation Palliser, peacekeeping in the Balkans and Cyprus, and defending the no-fly zone over Libya. The British Armed Forces have bases in the following places: Ascension Island, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya, Qatar and the Sovereign Base Areas (Cyprus)."

Christina Onassis
"Christina Onassis (December 11, 1950 – November 19, 1988) was a Greek-Argentine businesswoman and socialite. She was the heiress to the Onassis family fortune. She was the only daughter of Aristotle Onassis, a wealthy shipping businessman, and Athina Livanos."
"Onassis was born at LeRoy Sanitarium in New York City, United States, but she gave up her American citizenship. She had a brother, Alexander Onassis. Her daughter, by Thierry Roussel, is Athina Onassis Roussel (named after Christina's mother). Christina died in Buenos Aires from a heart attack. She was aged 37. Her heart attack was caused by pulmonary edema."
Athina Onassis
"Athina Onassis Roussel (alternate: Athina Onassis de Miranda; born 28 January 1985) is a French-Greek heiress. Her grandfather was Aristotle Onassis, a wealthy shipping businessman. She is his only living descendant. Her mother was Christina Onassis. Athina inherited her grandfather's fortune when her mother died in 1988."
"Roussel was born at American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. She is the eldest of Thierry Roussel's four children. She is a horse rider."
Arrogance
"Arrogance (also called hubris) indicates strong pride or acting extremely self-important. In particular, a loss of contact with reality and overestimating one's own competence or capability."
It is when you try to reason out or state your case over a traffic violation to an enforcer - only in the Philippines.
Arrogance is also associated with lack of humility and love toward oneself. Examples include making oneself far more important than others or superiority. Children raised around arrogance may be arrogant themselves.
"Arrogance is usually detrimental and fosters a negative-minded culture. Some sources, however, also indicate arrogance means taking and receiving pride with one's work."
Arrogance is different from confidence. Arrogance may be associated with insecurity. Confidence has an association with improving and examining one's own weaknesses.
"Hubris is the ancient Greek concept. It is similar to arrogance, but is usually translated as ""pride"". Because their societies were more concerned with honour, it works out as somewhat different from arrogance. To understand it fully one needs to work through the Greek passages where it is used, which is beyond our scope. For example, the use of force to shame someone would have been considered hubris."
Steven Yeun

Sleeping problems.
"A good night’s sleep is extremely important for one’s quality of life. People may have trouble going to sleep, staying asleep or getting enough sleep. This usually means that they are too sleepy in the daytime."
"There are many things that influence sleep. Also some substances, called stimulants – coffee is an example – can cause poor sleep. When people have just eaten something, the body is busy digesting what they have eaten. This can cause poor sleep, too. Worrying and stress can also cause poor sleep."
There are many diseases that cause poor sleep. Fever can lead to bad dreams. Poor sleep can be a side effect of some medications.
"Sleep disorders directly influence how a person sleeps. Examples of sleep disorders are narcolepsy, sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep disorders."
The four most common sleep disorders are:
"Sleep specialists - doctors specialized in sleeping problems - often suggest better sleep hygiene to people with sleeping problems. Sleep hygiene means things people can try, such as:"
North Macedonia
"North Macedonia ( - Severna Makedonija) officially the Republic of North Macedonia ( - ""Republika Severna Makedonija""; ) is a country located on the Balkan peninsula and in Southeastern Europe. It was part of Yugoslavia. North Macedonia borders Serbia to the north, Albania to the west, Greece to the south, and Bulgaria to the east. The country's currency is the Macedonian denar (MKD)."
"The capital and largest city is Skopje, with more than 500,000 residents. It has many smaller cities. Some important ones are Bitola, Prilep, Tetovo, Kumanovo, Ohrid, Veles, Stip, and Strumica."
"North Macedonia is often called ""a land of lakes and mountains"". Three large lakes are on the borders of Albania and Greece, and there are many smaller ones. Sixteen mountains are higher than 2000 meters above sea level."
"North Macedonia is a member of the United Nations and World Trade Organization (WTO). It joined NATO on 30 March 2020. Since December 2005, it is a candidate for joining the European Union."
"The language spoken by the majority of the population is Macedonian. Albanian is also spoken by the Albanian minority (25%) living in the country. North Macedonia has two official languages, Macedonian and Albanian (since 2019)."
History.
"Ethnic Macedonians are Slavic peoples. The Slavs invaded and settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. What is now North Macedonia used to be the Bulgarian occupation zone of Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Vardarska Macedonia became a Communist state in 1945 and called itself the Socialist Republic of Macedonia in the southeastern part of the country of Yugoslavia. When that country broke up in 1991, North Macedonia became independent."
In past centuries the territory which today is the Republic of North Macedonia was ruled by many different states such as Bulgaria and many other empires.
"During the Yugoslav Wars, Macedonia was mostly peaceful. However in 2001, fighting broke out between ethnic Albanians and Slavic Macedonians. The fighting ended with the Ohrid Agreement."
Earliest residents.
"People have been living in North Macedonia for thousands of years. Neolithic people lived in Macedonia from 7000 to 3500 BCE. The Iliad mentions the Kingdom of Paeonia in Macedonia. From 1000 to 1 BCE, Dacians, Thracians,Illyrians, Celts, and Greeks lived in Northern Macedonia."
Alexander the Great's empire.
"The Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia was just hundreds of small, independent, city-states. One example of a city state is Illyria. They sometimes merged together, but not often. One city-state that grew over time was the kingdom of Macedon. The Greek kingdom of Macedon is best known for Alexander the Great. He invaded and controlled the Middle East (excluding Arabia),Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Gujarat state of India. However, when Alexander died in 323 BCE, at the age of 33, he lost his vast empire. The empire was divided into 5 countries, Lysimachia (Macedon), Cassander (Northern Greece), the Antigonid Empire (Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Southern Greece), the Ptolemaic Empire (Egypt), and the Seleucid Empire (Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan)."
Roman rule.
"Towards the end of the 3rd century BCE, the Romans invaded the Balkan peninsula. Illyria was taken over in 9 CE. The North and East of Macedonia were taken over by the Roman Empire in the year 29 CE. They became the Roman province of Moesia. Starting in the 3rd century CE, the borders of Macedonia were being attacked by the Goths, Huns, Bulgars, Avars, and others. In 395 AD, the Roman Empire split in two. They were the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire)."
Byzantine rule.
"Although, Macedonia was part of the Byzantine Empire, there was little Byzantine influence. In the mid-6th century, Slavic tribes started to settle in Macedonia. From the 7th century to the 13th century, Byzantine Macedonia was governed by local princes and kings, allied with the Byzantine Empire. In the 9th century, the Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to Macedonia. The people who brought Christianity to Macedonia were saints Cyril and Methodius. Their goal was to bring Christianity and the Cyrillic alphabet to Slavs in Europe."
Ottoman rule.
"The Ottoman Empire was originally a small city-state in Turkey. The city-state grew, and it invaded Adrianople in 1354. From there, it expanded and took over Turkey. Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, did not get invaded by the Ottomans until 1453. After the Battle of the Maritsa River, the Ottomans conquered southern Serbia and Macedonia. Macedonia was under Ottoman Rule until 1913."
Yugoslav rule.
"After the Ottoman Empire dissolved, Macedonia became a part of the newly formed country Yugoslavia. From 1914 to 1941, Yugoslavia was a monarchy. During WW2, the Axis Powers took over Yugoslavia. Macedonia was taken over by Bulgaria. The Axis powers left Yugoslavia after WW2. After WW2, Yugoslavia became a communist state. Josip Broz Tito was the leader of Yugoslavia from 1944 to 1980. In 8 September 1991, Macedonia became an independent state."
Naming dispute with Greece.
"Greece and the Republic of North Macedonia were arguing over the name Macedonia. The United Nations calls the Republic of North Macedonia, ""the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"" (FYROM) (Macedonian: ""Поранешна Југословенска Република Македонија - ПЈРМ"" - ""Poranešna Jugoslovenska Republika Makedonija -PJRM""). The north and northeast part of Greece has been called Macedonia for ages and officially since 1912, just like Kent, the southeast county of England, has been called Kent for a long time. 'FYROM' is also used by NATO and many other international organisations. But, many countries now call the country 'Republic of Macedonia'. The United Kingdom, for example, uses Republic of Macedonia in the diplomatic list."

Game of Death Redux
"Game of Death Redux (死亡遊戲 Redux) is a 2019 special features distributed with the movie ""Game of Death (1978 movie)"""
Background.
"In 1978 the ""Golden Harvest"" has released ""Game of Death"" (""死亡遊戲""). The 1978 version uses portions of the original footage married to an entirely new plot. The revised version of the film uses only 11 minutes and 7 seconds of the footage from the original ""The Game of Death (1972)""."
Creation of special feature.
"But on 2019 producer ""Alan Canvan"" edited ""Game of Death Redux"". The edit only uses footage shot during the original production of ""The Game of Death"". The movie was released as a special feature in ""The Criterion Collection's"" Blu-ray box set of Bruce Lee films, on July 14, 2020."
"It was presented closely the way Bruce intended. While at the same time, keeping in-tact some of the stronger as aspects of the universally panned, pieced together 1978 movie (known to fans as Game of Death ’78), such as John Barry’s acclaimed score, as well some of the film’s strong audio design."
New Version on 2022.
"There is a second version of ""Game of Death Redux"" on 2022."
"With the first version Alan Canvan had concentrated entirely on the flow of the piece. But he was not satisfied to how the shots were cut and how the music drove the narrative artistically. Canvan wanted a complete visual and sound restoration. So he got help from a new team. After a year the new Redux has been fully restored with a brand-new color grade and audio mix. Additionally, Chris Kent, who looped Bruce’s war cries for Robert Clouse’s Game of Death movie, lent his voice once again to match the audio portions from 1978. Finally, reworking a dozen sequences resulted in a much more concise and dramatic presentation of the narrative."
Legacy.
"Canvan’s Game of Death Redux was the latest project that focused on Bruce Lee’s original 1972 storyline, a subject that was previously explored in John Little’s 2000 documentary, and Artport’s Bruce Lee in G.O.D 死亡的遊戯 (released in Japan the same year), not to mention a series of fan edits that have been circulating the internet. All aforementioned edits use 1972-era The Game of Death footage that was initially discovered by Hong Kong film expert Bey Logan, who stumbled upon the footage in the now-defunct Golden Harvest studio vaults back in 1999."

He died on December 17, 1999, two weeks before his 79th birthday."
"William K. Everson judges, the film suffered ""under the extrovert and plenty of covered play by Alexander Granach [...] and virtually all other members of the cast out fear."" Also, Lotte H. Eisner criticized the cumbersome play, the actors performances were ""not significant"", which they impute to the fact that Murnau not experienced at this time in the lead actor had been enough."
In other media.
"Aaron Copland's 1922 ballet ""Grohg"" (unpublished and unpremiered until 1992) used ""Nosferatu"" as the physical model for the lead character and roughly follows the storyline."

"Werner Herzog's 1979 homage to Nosferatu, ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" starred Klaus Kinski as Count Dracula, not Orlok. A sequel to Herzog's film called ""Vampire in Venice"" starred Kinski, this time as Nosferatu, and Christopher Plummer as Paris Catalano."
"The 1979 television movie ""Salem's Lot"" modeled the appearance of Mr. Barlow on that of Count Orlok. In 1998, Wayne Keeley released """", in which the original film was remastered to a soundtrack by Type O Negative and hosted by David Carradine."
"The 2000 Hollywood movie ""Shadow of the Vampire"" told a secret history of the making of ""Nosferatu"", imagining that actor Max Schreck (played by Willem Dafoe) was actually a genuine vampire and that director F. W. Murnau (John Malkovich) was complicit in hiring the creature for the purpose of realism."
"Similarly, the short film 'La duodécima hora' by Rodrigo Plaza and film critic Juanma Ruiz, suggested a hidden plot orchestrated by Nosferatu director and producer, F. W. Murnau and Albin Grau, to hide an elixir of the eternal life. Shot as a mockumentary, the film starred horror icon Paul Naschy and Nosferatu film restorer Luciano Berriatúa."
"Viper Comics's 2010 graphic novel ""Nosferatu"" by Christopher Howard Wolf retold the original 1922 film's storyline with a modern setting and cast."

After working at ""Vogue"", she worked for the ""Washington Times-Herald"" as a part-time receptionist. In 1952, she was briefly engaged to a young stockbroker named John Husted but broke-off the engagement."
Marriage to John F. Kennedy and Children.
"Jacqueline Bouvier first met United States Representative, John F. Kennedy at a dinner party in May 1952 after journalist, Charles L. Bartlett helped the two meet up. The two had many things in common. They were both Catholic, they both wrote, both liked reading and both had lived outside the United States during college. John was busy running for the United States Senate in Massachusetts when they first met. Their relationship became more serious and he asked her to marry him after he was elected Senator. Bouvier took some time to accept, because she had been asked to report on the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London for The Washington Times-Herald. After a month in Europe, she returned to the United States and accepted Kennedy's marriage proposal. Their engagement was officially announced on June 25, 1953."
"They were married on September 12, 1953 in Newport, Rhode Island by Boston's Archbishop Richard Cushing. In the first years of their marriage, the couple had many problems. John F. Kennedy was diagnosed with Addison's disease and back pain caused by a war injury. In late 1954, he had surgery on his spine which almost killed him. Jacqueline Kennedy had a miscarriage in 1955 and in August 1956 gave birth to a stillborn daughter, Arabella Kennedy. They lived in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. and Boston, Massachusetts."
"Jacqueline gave birth to their daughter, Caroline Kennedy on November 27, 1957. During his Senate re-election campaign, John F. Kennedy began to see how popular his wife was. He asked her to campaign with him for his re-election. In November 1958, Kennedy was re-elected to a second term in the Senate and he thanked his wife for her role in the campaign."
1960 United States presidential election.
"On January 3, 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for president. In the early months of the election year, Jacqueline traveled with her husband to campaign events. Shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant. So, she decided to stay at home in Georgetown during most of her husband's campaign. She helped her husband's campaign by writing a weekly newspaper column, Campaign Wife. She answered questions and gave interviews to the media."
"Jacqueline had a large amount of media attention because of her fashion choices. While this made her popular, some criticized her for being rich. To stop the criticism, Kennedy talked about the amount of work she was doing for the campaign. She also did not want to talk about her fashion choices."
"When her husband was at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Mrs. Kennedy did not go to the convention because of her pregnancy. She was in Hyannis Port where she watched the September 26, 1960 debate between her husband and Republican candidate Vice President Richard Nixon. On November 8, 1960, her husband was elected the 35th President of the United States. A little over two weeks after the election, on November 25, she gave birth to their first son, John F. Kennedy Jr."
First Lady of the United States (1961 – 1963).
"John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as the 35th President of the United States on January 20, 1961. Mrs. Kennedy did not want her children to be unprotected around the media at an early age. She stayed with them in Middleburg, Virginia for a short time because of this. She was the first presidential wife to hire a press secretary. She hired Pamela Turnure. The media saw Mrs. Kennedy as the ""perfect woman"" and she became popular across the world. She also helped get support for the White House and her husband's Cold War policies."
"At first, Jacqueline said that her main focus as the first lady was to take care of the President and their children. She later spent her time to support American arts and preservation of its history. The historical restoration of the White House was her well known work. She also hosted many social events at the White House. She wanted to create a Department of the Arts; however this did not happen. She did help create the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities."
White House restoration.
"The First Lady thought that most of the White House needed more historical artifacts and old furniture. Her first major project was to restore the White House. She helped create a family living area by adding a kitchen on the family floor and new rooms for her children. She created a fine arts committee to find the money for her restoration of the White House. She also wanted to redesign and replant most of the Rose Garden and the East Garden. Mrs. Kennedy helped protect historic homes in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., because she thought these buildings were important."
"Before she became first lady, presidents and their families had taken furniture and other items from the White House when they left office. This was why the White House had few historical items. She wrote letters to find the missing furniture and other historical pieces. Kennedy supported a Congressional bill saying that White House furniture and other items would be the property of the Smithsonian Institution. She also started the White House Historical Association, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, a Curator of the White House, the White House Endowment Trust, and the White House Acquisition Trust."
"On Valentines Day, February 14, 1962, the First Lady took American television viewers on a tour of the White House on CBS News. 56 million television viewers in the United States watched the tour. Kennedy won a special Emmy Award in 1962. She is the only first lady to win an Emmy."
and then it doesn't sell
and then the bank's  holding the bag.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well.
Huh.
"As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?"
That's right
Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple."
It's designed to be added on to.
Uh-huh.
That's good.
Yeah.
"Well, I figure it's just me and my wife"
"but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,"
so I want  to have a shop.
Yeah.
How big a lot do you got it on?
Ten acres.
Wow.
That's nice.
That's real nice.
"Well, yeah."
It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor.
He's on the other side of a hill.
Oh.
And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.
Seriously.
God.
"Are, are you a T I-er?"
"No,"
"no,"
I work there as a temporary.
"Oh, really."
"But, are you at T I?"
Oh yeah.
So you have to do the random drug testing.
"Oh, yeah,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"In fact with me, this is, it's not much to talk about,"
I'm so much for it.
I don't really have much to comment about it.
There've been some interesting subject that they've called about.
"How many times have you called,"
or have you been participating in this?
"Oh, about ten or eleven calls."
"Oh, you got ten,"
"well you, you've passed me up."
Right.
This is about six times.
Oh.
"As contract person we have to do random drug testing, too."
Yeah.
It doesn't bother me.
I don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything.
"No,"
I think it's good.
"In fact, I don't know what the statistics were,"
but I think that they were surprised to find it so low.
"I think they were expecting to find, uh, like the national average at T I."
Right.
"It's just, it's, it's ridiculous."
"She, She's an emotional victim"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"it, it's terrible, you know"
"and,"
"And, you know, the, like you say, the cops are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work, basically go out the window."
Yeah.
"Oh, that,"
"oh, man, I, I couldn't be a cop for that, for that very reason, you know, because they do."
"The, the criminal gets right back out"
"and, you know, the cop's just got to go back and, and do his thing all over again, because so many of the crimes are, are done by repeat offenders."
"Yes,"
they are.
"It's,"
"Well, that's about five minutes,"
"so unless you've got something else, well,"
Yeah.
No
It's a pleasure talking with you.
"All right,"
"Ron, we'll see you later."
"Okeydoke,"
good-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
Tell me about your home.
"Well, it's an older home."
It was made back in the early sixties.
It's a pier beam house.
Huh-uh.
"Designed,"
"so we could pour concrete and support it with a, a nice firm four by four posts."
"And, uh and then the rest of it I just did."
Yeah.
"A, a contractor friend helped me, uh, with some of the, uh, foundation work"
"but, uh, it was pretty,"
it was about four or five hundred square feet.
The same size as the addition that I just put on
so.
Yeah.
"That's pretty, that's a good size deck."
Yeah.
"So, yeah."
"That's,"
"It's, uh, not that expensive."
"I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, uh, you know, no less than that."
Yeah.
"That's not,"
"cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together."
"Yeah,"
that's good.
That's not bad at all.
"Didn't  have to,"
Yeah.
the wood may
"it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is, you know."
"To get, to get good lumber it costs,"
"I don't know about Dallas, but even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all."
I was surprised.
"I'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, cheaper where you are."
It's probably more there.
"Well, yeah."
"and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to,"
and I never did.
I just went back and signed the papers
and I knew nothing about my car when I got it.
Nothing.
I didn't know how anything worked.
"Well, so it was a completely new experience for you."
And I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it.
Yeah.
"And I've had it,"
it's almost three years actually.
"And I've, I still love it."
I put the top down everywhere I go.
I timed it when I first got it
and it took twenty I mean twenty seconds
"and so, I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds."
Right.
So.
"And, and you couldn't get,"
how long does it take to go back up? About the same time.
"Twenty seconds,"
yeah.
That's all it takes.
"I mean, it's just a button, that's it."
"You  release it right at the top,"
"Yeah,"
so
so you don't have to  get out or anything.
"So you won't get,"
Yeah
and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial.
"Well I did, actually."
"it's,"
the lines in there were just perfect.
"I mean, it was classic TREK."
"Now, does the old STAR TREK guys meet the new guys?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"No,"
it's just the old guys still.
"Yeah,"
it was just a rumor that that would happen this time.
"However, the rumor is, is that it will happen next, happen next time"
"so,"
"You know, that I read in PEOPLE or somewhere, no, it was U S A TODAY"
Uh-huh.
that they said they weren't going to do anymore.
That was it.
Uh-huh.
"But,"
"Yeah,"
"uh, except that the rumor is, is that they still might,"
but it may not include the entire crew
and it will be a next generation meets this generation
Huh.
"So,"
"I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the, the old guys was."
I think it's a hundred years.
Huh.
Somewhere in that range.
"Considering that Spock was on an, uh, you know, couple weeks ago and that the, the very first episode of NEXT GENERATION, they had McCoy."
"Oh, that's right."
Is that right?
He was a doctor still?
yeah
"I, I felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until I realized they would be thrown away,"
so.
"Right,"
"right,"
"I thought, well I was doing them a favor by taking them."
"I found about five, uh, about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes, that were in the dumpsters."
Yeah.
"Oh gosh,"
"so many people need, so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes, when, you know, these are perfect,"
Uh-huh.
so.
"Yeah,"
"the ones at the grocery store, half the time, they've pulled the lid off"
so you can't use it anyway.
"Right,"
"and he had a bunch of computer stuff,"
"and, you know, I bought it all."
It was two hundred bucks for everything he had.
You got a buy.
"Well, some of it wasn't worth anything, you know."
Sure.
"You know, a lot of the, uh, diskettes were just totally unusable."
"Melted, or Just wet"
"or,"
"Well, yeah"
", or wet"
Okay.
"But I did get out of there with, uh, Vermont Views, which is a huge,"
"Okay,"
"Cindy, you there?"
Yeah.
"I mean, those people, they'll call you any time of the day or night with, try to solicit"
Yeah.
"and that's an invasion of my privacy, I think."
"They call late,"
"now, I mean, now there's, I heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or"
"Oh, they do already."
"See, that's"
I would be so mad
"Well,"
"and I've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays, too."
Really.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
But I do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls.
How?
"Don't answer your phone, Hello."
"The computer's geared to, to start talking to you on the, on the word Hello."
Really?
Uh-huh.
Huh.
"I don't know,"
"I think like things that, that"
"I think's like privacy is like, just like, not going through my stuff, like going through, just like my clothes or my drawer, just going through my stuff, basically."
"Oh, yeah."
That drives me up a wall.
Are you and your roommate a similar size.
"No,"
"see, we're not,"
"and, uh."
And she still goes through your clothes?
"Yeah,"
"she'll take all my shirts and stuff,"
"It's just,"
Yeah.
"like, you know, you go say okay, we can't bring up this point because then they're going to, you know,"
"the opposition will say this, this and this and"
Uh-huh.
"And it's like, boy, the stuff that they can twist around is,"
Yep
it's pretty amazing.
"And it's like the, the truth isn't really important anymore."
"It's,"
"Yeah,"
it's not.
"And then you get people who, who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because."
Yep.
"Like this, this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious"
and he really gets into suing people.
"And so he'll, he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court, and argue his case you know, It is. It's, it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else. *aa,sv"
"but,"
"But, uh,"
Yeah
"but it's for the more general,"
people don't want to take responsibility.
Yeah.
"You know, it's,"
"And, and most of the time they're looking to place blame. Uh  and stuff."
Yep
"See, you're from California,"
is that right?
"Uh, yeah."
Well originally from Chicago
"but,"
"Oh, okay."
"and if they get too close to that perimeter, it it zaps them."
Oh.
Boy.
Yeah
I'd be afraid to walk around if I was that dog
"Yeah,"
"well, a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog"
and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to
so he held on to the collar
and he walked out to the perimeter.
He said it was a good jolt.
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"and so, I, I don't take too well to, to those sorts of training techniques."
Um.
I don't think they're always necessary.
"If you put enough patience into,"
"Yeah,"
just be consistent and diligent with it
Uh-huh.
"and, um,"
"It's, uh, is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat?"
Yeah
"he's indoor and all declawed because I know the, uh, average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months."
Somebody just told me that
Yeah.
because of the leukemia?
"Yeah,"
"that and also just, uh, getting hit, I guess, or getting beat up."
And the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years
Wow.
"So,"
because she can't wear like my pants
Uh-huh.
but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff.
Ooh.
"Man, I'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses, you know."
"Oh, yeah."
"But still, she'll just take them,"
"and she won't even think about it,"
"and then, I'll like see her that day,"
"and she'll be wearing my clothes,"
"and I'll be like, you know, I don't like to borrow my clothes out, you know,"
I really don't.
So I prefer that you just not go in and get them
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
because she doesn't even ask me.
Stuff like that really
"like that's an invasion of my privacy, I feel like."
"Oh, yeah,"
I agree.
"Stuff like that,"
"when you have your door closed, people just walking in and stuff like that."
Uh-huh.
I was thinking like my mom.
"I know this,"
"she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy, is like going through her purse, like if you ever needed money and stuff"
"Oh, yeah."
"we always just give her her purse, you know,"
and she'll get it out or whatever.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"I was trying to think,"
"and, uh, course this,"
"grant it,"
"that's, you know, it's been four years ago,"
"but it's remarkable that the, that the bigger vans, uh, they're, uh,"
"my boss just bought a, a pick up truck,"
"and, uh, he only gets seventeen miles a gallon."
Yeah.
"But it, it has a big engine,"
"and it, it, pulls a boat and stuff,"
"but it's, and it, it's got the seats"
"that, and the other thing that is interesting, is it has, uh, rear air conditioning."
Uh-huh.
"And that, that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates."
Yeah.
"Well, now, this one that we went in,"
it did
to baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in?
Ford.
A what?
Ford.
A Ford?
"Ford what,"
you remember?
"conversation with He was trying to think of what the name of it was,"
"Well, the big, you know, the big vans are all, real nice,"
this was a big one.
"I mean it was a big one,"
"yeah,"
oh those are
"it has the front and the back and you know, it has the uh, back seat let down into a double, I mean a queen size bed"
yeah.
Yeah.
I've caught it a few times
"and they, they do some pretty good news."
"Uh, seemingly unbiased news broadcasts."
"Uh uh, the, the title of the network is sort of surprising."
Uh-huh.
You'd think it would carry mostly religious
"but it, it doesn't seem to."
"So I'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too, uh, and catch something maybe a little different than, than C N N might be covering."
"Uh, some more interest type topics in, in other countries."
"But it's kind of world, world, uh, network too."
Yeah.
"Uh, I, I guess I've never seen the T V show."
"I used to get the, uh,"
"A, uh, Golden Retriever."
"Ooh, that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs."
Yeah.
Is it really?
How long have you had it?
"We've had him for,"
"let's see, he just had his fourth birthday."
Fourth birthday.
"Yeah,"
and we got him when he was about eight weeks old
"and, uh, he's pretty okay,"
we like him.
Does he shed a lot?
He does.
That's the one thing we don't like about him.
"In fact, we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off."
He'd probably look pretty funny if we did that.
How much does he weigh now?
"He, actually, he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything,"
"I would, that's ideally the where, where I would like to be."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"and like I said, once, once it, it happened I couldn't because my son's tuition came due,"
"and I guess I had, you know, not really counted on it quite at that point"
Uh-huh.
"but, um, yeah,"
I didn't like it at all.
I was very uncomfortable.
"So,"
I can imagine.
"You know, and, and I mean, it was, I thought a lot,"
"sixty dollars interest or something for, for just a couple of months,"
"and I'm going jeez, that's outrageous,"
Yeah.
"but in, in, you know, retrospect it wasn't all that much,"
I mean a lot of people pay a lot more
"and and, you know, but still, I mean, I figured I didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them."
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
Think about what you can buy for sixty dollars.
Exactly
Groceries for a week.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah.
"I, I think about all, all the money that, that we've spent on interest on all of our credit cards,"
Uh-huh.
and it's just incredible.
But now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax?
We've never been able to take it off our income tax.
Oh
and so then she crawls on the carpet
"and, oh, the smell I mean it's just really awful"
Uh-huh.
"and that's, that's one real drawback,"
but you know I guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough
"Yes,"
you will.
You will.
"You know, we were trying to decide to, you know, about putting him to sleep."
"He was just, you know, he was getting so old and had a, other problems too."
"And, and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier. You know,"
"and, and again going through that because our, our animals are almost like our kids in some ways, you know,"
"and, and you grieve just as much over them when they go you know, as you would a child."
Uh-huh.
"And, and, you know, our son and, and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say, get a dog, get a dog, you know."
Little thing.
"Be quiet,"
be quiet.
"And I can tell my husband, you know, deep down he, you know, he"
"Brian in Plano, Texas. How are you doing today?"
"Hi,"
"fine,"
I'm Nancy.
How are you?
"Great, Nancy."
I'm in Plano also
"You're in Plano also, huh?"
"Yes,"
we're not too long distance today.
"Well, good to hear."
I was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania.
"really,"
especially in Texas
"Oh, I know it"
"The last gubernatorial race was, oh it was awful."
"It really was,"
yeah.
"So I don't know,"
"I, I,"
"it'll be interesting to see how the next, uh, few years go."
Yeah
Did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote.
"Yeah,"
"I think, well, it's, it's definitely a problem,"
and I think it could get worse.
Yeah.
"You know, we get this lackadaisical attitude,"
"and say, huh, you know, why should we vote,"
"then, you know, it could, uh, it could lead to some serious things."
Yeah.
"It also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if, you know, not enough people are voting."
Uh-huh.
"Right, uh,"
"yeah,"
"we can get, uh, yeah, if we get someone in there like that, then, you know, they could make all sorts of changes that they were, you know, had enough pull."
"Yeah,"
"it's kind of like in Louisiana where that, uh, guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected."
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Kind of scary when you think about that.
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, who's the other guy, LaRouche that, uh, is sort of the, uh, socialist, not socialist but"
"he's so off the wall that, uh, he's gone in and tried to get into city elections"
and my father works in films
"and such,"
"and I tend to, tend to be hypercritical of these things,"
"and then, perhaps, perhaps it's unfair, because I, I, I must admit I enjoy these movies"
"Yeah,"
right.
"and that's what they're for,"
"but I don't, don't remember them,"
"and I think it's, I think, I can think of movies I have less fun during"
"and then after the movie's over, I remember it so terribly well because it, it had some, some meaning to me or something."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"exactly,"
"yeah,"
"there, there, there are several movies that hit home like that."
"Of course the ones I always remember are the, the older ones"
Uh-huh.
"I always like the musicals, and uh,  those ones, that just stick in your head."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"they leave,"
"yeah,"
"they leave, they leave some songs with you,"
I don't know what it is
Uh-huh.
"but it just,"
"I mean, I don't know if this is old fart talking here or something, because I'm not that old"
"No,"
it could be.
"you know, those old movies seemed to have had something that, uh, that was memorable somehow,"
Uh-huh.
I don't know what it was.
"Well, maybe this year you can find a more central location."
"Well, but the majority of them are in, like, just like how you said in close, close quarters."
So it is easier for us few stragglers to go home.
"Oh, okay."
Then the majority of them are still in the Missouri area.
Yeah.
Okay.
"You know our family right now, uh, the most of it, there is only a few stragglers, uh, with any distance."
"There is one cousin out in Colorado, uh, uh, some cousins over in Phoenix, uh,"
"I got a sister over in, in, uh, Washington State"
"Uh, the rest of them are within, you know, a couple hours drive."
"Well, uh, how do you all communicate? Like to plan it and every thing."
"Do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we are going to do it,"
or do you all like mail out stuff?
That is pretty much it.
Yeah.
"It is going to be such and such, uh, weekend"
"and, uh, you all come."
Yeah.
That is about it
And you know this is the standard pattern.
"It, uh,"
everybody brings their favorite dish
"and, somebody brings the volleyball net,"
somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon
"and,"
"Well, uh, uh, I guess probably the last one I went to I met so many people that I had not seen in probably ten, over ten years."
"It was like, don't you remember me."
And I am like no
Am I related to you?
Yeah.
I know.
and then he goes home
"and, and, uh, you know, in the, in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or, or something like that,"
Right.
or they don't care.
"You know, mamma, guess what I did in school today,"
"well who cares, you know."
"An a lot of it, a lot of the parents now are so young."
True.
"You know, that they're, they still, they still don't know what's going on"
"and how are they supposed to, you know, teach their kids that are coming up, you know, what's going on."
"I mean it's just, it's a vicious cycle, that we're, you know, dead, smack dead in the center of"
Yeah.
and we have to try to swim out.
"You know, kind of like the Bermuda Triangle,"
we're just sinking
and it's almost impossible to swim back up.
Yeah.
"But, um, yeah,"
"there's definitely problems,"
Yeah
"I'm,"
"its just the solutions that, you know, they're going to be in our political system,"
"they're going to be on everyone's mind for quite a while, too long."
"I don't know if you've ever had too much to do with, uh, oh, especially Asian, Japanese families coming,"
"here in Plano we've got, uh, quite a few."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Uh, engineering types, people who have come from Japan,"
Right.
and they put their kids in the U S schools
and they're appalled.
Uh-huh.
you can just go and vote
Right.
"and the polls are open, what was it, a couple of weeks,"
the hours are good
and they're even open on Saturdays and a couple of Sundays.
Uh-huh.
"And so we've got plenty of time to go, because down here in Houston, it's, uh, the lines are long."
"Yeah,"
"I'm in Dallas,"
and they're long here too.
"So, uh, but, uh,"
"Yeah,"
I voted absentee one year.
I really was going to be gone.
"So, I did it,"
"but, uh, it was nice."
I would be tempted to do it again.
"Well, uh, I recommend it, because you just walk right on in, and there's usually not anybody in line"
Right.
"and, uh, you know, that vote's just as good as, you know, the one on election day."
Yeah.
I think they should change the whole system so that it's easier
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
I think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle.
"Um, yeah,"
"I've been involved with, uh, some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the, of the Republican party."
"And it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the, uh, how the, uh, the not the ballots,"
"but, uh, my mind has gone blank."
"I've been all evening How they develop, uh, what the candidate stands for"
"Uh-huh,"
"you know, the views, and, uh, you know, everybody gets to vote on, you know, well, should he be for this and on and on and on,"
And  I love it.
Ah.
And I would get another one in a minute.
"Unless I could afford what I really like which would be a red Ferrari or, you know, a little Corvette or something like that."
And that's what would influence my decision to change because I like a really sporty car.
And I'd love an expensive one
"but I probably,  can never afford it"
so
"Uh, well I understand and can sympathize with that because I also enjoy driving performance automobiles."
"Uh, I currently have an eighty-seven, five liter Mustang G T that I've done a bunch of modifications to, to make it, uh, handle and perform better,"
Uh-huh.
"and I suspect if I were to be able to get another car where object was, uh,"
"the best car I could get regardless of money, uh, I probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, I'm a nurse here"
and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari.
"A, a three twenty-eight G T S?"
And I couldn't tell you
but it's just beautiful.
And I go out and I love to touch it
but I can't even do that because of the alarm.
You just go hunting?
"So, I just look at it a lot"
Go out and lust after it.
Really
Exactly.
But it sure is a pretty thing
So have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari?
No.
I'm working on it
"No,"
Uh-huh.
It's got some pretty strong competitors.
"Some of them have reviews that are better than D Base,"
"so, I, I think by now, it's a matter of, uh, personal taste."
"Yeah,"
people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use.
I can understand that very easily.
"I've used, I've had a class on, um, R Base and also in Paradox"
Uh-huh.
and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base.
Uh-huh.
Do you think you D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more.
Or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days?
"Um, I wouldn't say compatible, but certainly comparable."
"But, uh"
"yeah,"
"I didn't mean compatible,"
I meant comparable.
My brain is going to mush.
Uh-huh.
And what do you work on at T I?
I'm a computer programmer on the I B M main frames.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I do, uh, mainly business data processing."
Uh-huh.
I also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility.
Uh-huh.
"Um, sometimes I get called late at night at home because there's a production problem,"
"and that gives me the opportunity to, uh, come in to work and fix it, if I can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone."
Right.
"Um, I also, uh, handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected,"
"you know, I, I listen to D C area and the WASHINGTON POST, you know,"
I mean the most they'll give it is the back of the A section.
Yeah.
"Uh, you know."
"I'm, I'm currently living in Dallas"
"and it, it won't even give it the back section <laughter>."
"You just, never see, you just never see anything about it,"
"uh, which is a shame because you go to other countries, uh,"
"and, and they carry quite a bit about the U S on the other hand."
"And if you go up to, uh, Canada, those people are usually pretty, uh, familiar with the politics going on and and the news U S"
Uh-huh.
"and we're pretty, uh, limited in our understanding of, of leaders up in Canada or Mexico."
"Yeah,"
definitely.
You just don't know what's going on.
Yeah.
"I'd, I,"
"every once in awhile, I have to travel overseas"
"and lately I've taken the, taken a little shortwave radio, uh, around and picking up the B B C"
"and it's sort of like, uh, a C N N too."
You you can tune into some stations
Uh-huh.
"and you get some, like thirty minute summaries of, of news events."
"Uh, I occasionally get into some of the middle eastern, uh, area"
and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all <laughter>.
There's not much in the way of television in some of those places.
Right.
"Uh, but that's a good point about, about the neighboring countries."
I hadn't really thought about it
but I guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it.
Right.
Exactly.
"it wasn't forty-eight,"
"it was, it was, uh, let's see, yeah, it was forty-eight."
I was in the Air Force.
Uh-huh.
"We did an air show out at, uh, out at, uh, Boone Greene, no out at, uh Andrews,"
Andrews?
yeah.
So what's it been like up there?
"Well, for the past week or two it's been cold and wet"
Uh-huh.
"but before that, for most of the year, it's been hot and dry."
Yeah.
"Uh, like September was hot and dry,"
October.
"Um, September really was,"
I'm not sure about October.
"I think for about twelve months through September the, the average temperature has been higher than normal each month. Um, lots of ninety degree days during the summer."
Really?
Huh.
"It really has been strange here this year,"
"I mean, this whole course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, we had, uh, you know, all these, we have all these, uh,"
"somebody said, you know, you're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict Texas weather,"
"but. Well, always, they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever,"
Uh-huh.
"and we had all this rain,"
"and it really is not a bad summer at all, really cool."
"But all of a sudden, in, in, uh, in October, uh, September, October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time."
"And, uh, then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping, just pouring down, you know."
"There were flash floods everywhere, that kind of deal,"
"and then uh, into of November, the first, like the second week, uh, you know, the first week actually, we had, we had a freeze,"

"""White Lies"", released in July 2007, is the first single from Paul van Dyk's album ""In Between"". It features vocals from Jessica Sutta, former member of the Pussycat Dolls."
"""I had a lot of fun working with Jessica. Her lascivious voice and sexy attitude reflects the theme of the single perfectly."" said Paul van Dyk via press release."
Jessica also spoke about working with Paul Van Dyk:
The single received positive reviews.
"""Paul Van Dyk makes a grand return to the club scene with his new single ""White Lies and Jessica Sutta also proves that Nicole Scherzinger isn't the only Pussycat Doll who can sing lead. The combination of these two results in a great song with some great remixes. While only one mix is what you'd expect from Paul Van Dyk, all of the mixes are excellent and worth checking out."""
"""Paul Van Dyk and Alex M.O.R.P.H do the Berlin Mix"" - It showcases all of the elements that make up a great trance mix. Synthesizers and pumped-up drums and beats zoom around frantically with the only vocals being that of Jessica singing the title of the song. It's a perfect choice for those late night punters who don't need a lot of singing with their music."
"If you want to actually hear the vocals, go directly to the ""L.A. Mix"". This mix uses all of the vocals and is actually not as euphoric-sounding as the first mix. The beats are rougher and the trance element is essentially missing. It almost sounds like a Dave Aude remix. Perhaps his influence rubbed off on Van Dyk for this particular version. The added elements of flamenco guitar and punched up drums make this mix a stellar one. This sound is a refreshing change to what we are used to from him."
"""The Dave Spoon Mix"" continues in the same direction as the previous mix. The keyboards are the main attraction here, though during most of the mix they overpower Jessica's vocals."
"Finally, the ""Aural Float Remix"" is a dreamy electronic mix, not at all good for dancing to but perfect for a chilled out evening at home. The song moves along lazily and feels very atmospheric, never attempting to do anything related to a dance floor."
"The video shows Sutta performing suggestive dances in burlesque outfits in two different locations: on a bed in a white outfit, being watched by people through the windows; and on stage dancing around a chair, in a black outfit while Van Dyk plays the DJ."
"The video closely resembles Madonna's video for ""Open Your Heart"" as well as Bob Fosse's choreography for his ""Mein Herr"" routine from Cabaret. The video was directed by Steven Antin and produced by Looking Glass Films in Hollywood, California."
"The track has been a success on the American dance charts, peaking at #3 on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in August 2007, becoming Paul Van Dyk's highest charting single. On Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart, it debuted in the top 40 in late August 2007, since then it has also hit the #3 spot. It has reached #80 on the UK Singles Chart in August 2007."
"On Billboard's Hot Dance Singles Sales chart it has been #1 for four weeks. It has also reaching #38 in Germany's pop charts, #4 in Turkey's top 100, #14 in Finland and #8 in Canada's top 40 charts."
The album has reached #115 on The Billboard 200 and #2 on the Top Electronic Albums and Top Heatseekers charts.

= = = Pavane (Fauré) = = =
"The Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50, is a pavane by the French composer Gabriel Fauré written in 1887. It was originally a piano piece, but is better known in Fauré's version for orchestra and optional chorus. Obtaining its rhythm from the slow processional Spanish court dance of the same name, the Pavane ebbs and flows from a series of harmonic and melodic climaxes, conjuring a haunting Belle Époque elegance. The piece is scored for only modest orchestral forces consisting of string instruments and one pair each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns. A typical performance lasts about six minutes."
"The original version of the ""Pavane"" was written for piano and chorus in the late 1880s. The composer described it as ""elegant, but not otherwise important."" Fauré intended it to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its more familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than 100 quarter notes per minute. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the ""Pavane"" was not a piece of German romanticism, and that the text later added was ""clearly a piece of light-hearted chaffing between the dancers""."
"Fauré composed the orchestral version at Le Vésinet in the summer of 1887. He envisaged a purely orchestral composition, using modest forces, to be played at a series of light summer concerts conducted by Jules Danbé. After Fauré opted to dedicate the work to his patron, Elisabeth, comtesse Greffulhe, he felt compelled to stage a grander affair and at her recommendation he added an invisible chorus to accompany the orchestra (with additional allowance for dancers). The choral lyrics were based on some inconsequential verses, ""à la"" Verlaine, on the romantic helplessness of man, which had been contributed by the Countess's cousin, Robert de Montesquiou."
"The orchestral version was first performed at a Concert Lamoureux under the baton of Charles Lamoureux on November 25, 1888. Three days later, the choral version was premiered at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique. In 1891, the Countess finally helped Fauré produce the version with both dancers and chorus, in a ""choreographic spectacle"" designed to grace one of her garden parties in the Bois de Boulogne."
"From the outset, the Pavane has enjoyed immense popularity, whether with or without chorus. With choreography by Léonide Massine a ballet version entered the repertoire of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1917, where it was alternatively billed as ""Las Mininas"" or ""Les Jardins d'Aranjuez"". For Massine, the music had ""haunting echoes of Spain's Golden Age"" parallelling the formality and underlying sadness he found in the paintings of Velázquez. Some critics found the ballet pallid, but Diaghilev retained a fondness for the piece, and kept it in the company's repertoire until the end of his life."
"Fauré's example was imitated by his juniors, who went on to write pavanes of their own: Debussy's Passepied in his ""Suite bergamasque"" and Ravel's ""Pavane pour une infante défunte"", and ""Pavane de la belle au bois dormant"" in ""Ma mère l'oye""."
"The lyrics, which are optional in the orchestral version, were written by the French Robert de Montesquiou."
"C'est Lindor, c'est Tircis et c'est tous nos vainqueurs!"
"C'est Myrtille, c'est Lydé! Les reines de nos coeurs!"

"It staged lectures and performances for a distinguished audience of aristocrats, grand bourgeois and intelligentsia."
Charles Bodinier (1844–1911) was Secretary-General of the Comédie-Française from 1882 to 1889.
"From 1888 he was director of the Théâtre d'Application, a small theater for students of the Conservatory on rue Saint-Lazare."
"In 1890 he opened a theater called ""La Bodinière"", which staged performances until 1902."
La Bodinière's audience including members of the Parisian upper class and the intelligentsia.
"Starting in 1890, Bodinier began to put on ""matinées-causeries""."
"Speakers at these events included literary figures such as the poet Maurice Bouchor, the poet and ""conteur"", Paul Armand Silvestre, the writer and critic Ferdinand Brunetière, the poet and novelist Anatole France, the poet and novelist François Coppée, the dramatist Maurice Donnay and the journalist and critic Francisque Sarcey."
The historian and feminist Léopold Lacour gave well-attended talks on fashionable subject of feminism.
"Charles Bodinier invited the poet and dandy Robert de Montesquiou to give a lecture on 17 January 1894, assisted by Sarah Bernhardt."
"The event attracted an audience that included aristocrats, professors, actors, poets and artists,"
including Paul Verlaine and the sculptor Édouard Houssin.
La Bodinière had a varied program.
"The Société Théâtrical with Émile Goudeau staged the play ""Le Gardénia""."
"Bodinier put on shadow shows such as ""La Marche au Soleil"" based on the poem by Léon Durocher with music by Georges Fragerolle."
The popular singer Yvette Guilbert was engaged by the theater in January 1891 for five performances where the journalist Hugues Le Roux gave lectures and Guilbert performed.
"Yvette had huge success with this audience, who would not have wanted to be seen at the more low-brow venues where the singer usually performed."
"Bodinier staged a series of similar combined lectures and recitals after the success of Guilbert's performance,"
"including Félicia Mallet, the well-known pantomime artist and singer."
The poet and playwright Maurice Lefèvre introduced Mallet at these events.

= = = Belmont railway station (Harrow) = = =
"Belmont was a station in Belmont, north-west London on the Stanmore branch line. It was opened on 12 September 1932 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as the only intermediate station on a short branch line (opened in 1890) running north from Harrow & Wealdstone to Stanmore, in anticipation of the Metropolitan Railway opening its own branch line to a new Stanmore station (now served by the Jubilee line) the same year."
Belmont station was rebuilt with a central island platform and a passing loop. The rebuilt station opened on 5 July 1937. The station was located on the north side of Kenton Lane to the west of Belmont Circle.
"From the perspective of the branch line, the connection to the main line was north-facing, i.e. away from central London. Hence the branch line could not take direct commuter services from the city, limiting its operation to a shuttle service."
"The direct service provided by the Metropolitan offered strong competition to the L&NWR station at Stanmore and passenger services beyond Belmont were ended on 15 September 1952, though a daily freight train served the goods yard at Stanmore. The passing loop was removed in 1955. The line to Stanmore was closed completely on 6 July 1964, as part of the railway cuts implemented under the Beeching Axe. Passenger services from Belmont to Harrow were withdrawn on 5 October 1964."
The track was lifted in 1966 and the station site is now occupied by a car park.

"Desábato began his professional career in 1997 playing for Estudiantes de La Plata. In 2001, he joined Olimpo and after one season with the club he moved on to play for Quilmes. With both teams he won promotion from the Primera B Nacional (Argentine second division) to the Primera División (first)."
"In a 2005 Copa Libertadores match, Desábato allegedly racially insulted São Paulo's player Grafite. Desábato was arrested after the match. Following his night in jail, Desábato was defended by columnist and former Brazilian international footballer Tostão who stated that the insults were not racist, simply the kind of provocation that has always existed in football."
"Desábato left Quilmes in 2006 to join Argentinos Juniors and after a successful season with the club he returned to Estudiantes de La Plata. During the second half of 2008, he was a regular first team player for Estudiantes in their Copa Sudamericana campaign, where they reached the final."
"Desábato was a key figure in Estudiantes' 2009 Copa Libertadores championship. He was the only outfield player on the team to play in every minute of every game during the team's run through the tournament, even as his center-back partners changed around him (from Agustín Alayes to Cristian Cellay to Rolando Schiavi)."
"In 2009 Desábato was chosen in a traditional journalist poll conducted by ""El País"" in the South American Team of the Year."

= = = Moog Little Phatty = = =
"The Little Phatty is a monophonic analog synthesizer manufactured by Moog Music from 2006 to 2013, preceded by the Voyager and succeeded by Voyager Old School. Its design was conceived, in part, by Robert Moog himself, and is the last instrument to have that distinction, although the primary engineer was Cyril Lance. It is also the first Moog product to be produced following his death. Jordan Rudess of the band Dream Theater also assisted with the design of the product."
It is one of the few Moog synthesizers to utilize MIDI from the factory (the others being the Minimoog Voyager and the earlier Memorymoog+). This allows for better integration in the modern studio and for live performance.
"On 9 September 2013, Moog Music announced the discontinuation of the Little Phatty analog synthesizer."
"There are currently four versions of the Little Phatty. Aside from a few cosmetic differences (and price), all units have nearly identical sound generation circuitry."
"The earlier 'Tribute Edition', a limited run of 1200 units, featured blue LED lighting, wooden side panels and Bob Moog's signature decaled onto the convex back panel."
"The later 'Stage Edition' featured orange and red lighting, grey rubberized panels and the classic Moog logo replacing the signature."
"The third version, called the Stage II, had some minor mechanical and electrical tweaks as well as adding a USB interface, a new arpeggiator and tap tempo."
There is also a rare limited edition with blue LED lighting that came in a purple aluminum case. This version also has the USB interface. It has the regular Moog logo on the back panel and shipped in a custom flight case with the Moog logo on the case. This was a limited run of 100 units.

"Olivia FitzRoy, born Olivia Gwyneth Zoe FitzRoy, (May 27, 1921–December 24, 1969) was a British author of children's books. She was the granddaughter of Muriel FitzRoy, 1st Viscountess Daventry, raised to the peerage as widow of Edward FitzRoy, the Speaker of the House of Commons from 1928 until his death in 1943; her mother was a member of the famous Guinness family. Olivia FitzRoy was one of five sisters."
"The family spent their summers in Scotland, the setting of her books. They were there in 1939 when her father, a naval officer, decided that they should remain in Inverewe for the duration of World War II. The area was remote; FitzRoy wrote her first book, ""Orders to Poach"" (which told the story of the Stewart children receiving unusual instructions from their overseas father) to entertain her two younger sisters, Barbara (now Ormrod) and the late Amelia (now Jessel). It was published by Collins, as Billy Collins was a friend of the family. The second, ""Steer by the Stars"" and the third ""The House in the Hills"", were based in the same location."
"FitzRoy carried on writing when she began service in the Women's Royal Naval Service, though she was stationed as far away as Ceylon. After the war, she travelled with the 'Chipperfield Circus', which was the inspiration behind ""Wagons and Horses""; she then went back to live in Scotland."
Olivia FitzRoy married Sir Geoffrey Bates in 1957 and they had two daughters. She died aged only 48 of cancer in 1969.
"Her books are being reissued by Fidra Books: the first became available in June 2006, the second in March 2007 and the third in 2009."

"Shrubland Hall Anglo-Saxon cemetery is a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon burial site discovered at Shrubland Hall Quarry near Coddenham, Suffolk. The cemetery contains fifty burials and a number of high-status graves including ""the most complicated Anglo-Saxon bed ever found."" Bed burials, in which a female body is laid out on an ornamental wooden bed, usually accompanied by jewellery, are rarely found, and are considered of national importance. Only 13 bed burials have been found to date in the UK. The bed burial was one of two graves at the cemetery which were found within wooden-lined chambers. The second chamber contained a male skeleton with grave goods including a seax, a spear, a shield, an iron-bound wooden bucket, a copper alloy bowl and a drinking horn."
The site was uncovered by Suffolk County Council's Archaeology Service in 1999 during exploratory excavations prior to gravel extraction by the quarry operators. Evidence of Iron Age and Roman activity had previously been identified in the area.

"Neapolitan Way (Foaled January 27, 1971) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse. A son of Barbizon and a grandson to Polynesian, he was out of a Bold Ruler mare named Bold Majesty. Neapolitan Way is best remembered for placing second in the second jewel of the American Triple Crown, the $250,000 grade 1 Preakness Stakes, to Little Current."
"Neapolitan Way's race history is very sketchy and vague, but he won 14 races during his career. It is also known that he placed in the top three finishers in 43% of his starts, a total of 36 out 84 in-the-money races. At age two, he finished third in the Miami Beach Handicap at Calder Race Course. At age three, he won the grade three Woodlawn Stakes (now renamed the James W. Murphy Stakes) at a mile on the turf at Pimlico Race Course and placed third in the Japan Racing Association Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse. At age four, he placed third in the grade two Dixie Stakes at Pimlico."
"In mid May 1971, Neapolitan Way's trainer Lawrence W. Jennings decided to take a step up in class and run him in the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The Preakness Stakes is run at a mile and three sixteenths on dirt at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Neapolitan Way was listed as one of the longest shots on the board at 24-1 on the morning line in a field of thirteen colts. The prohibitive favorite was the Kentucky Derby winner, Cannonade, at 2-1. Neapolitan Way broke slowly in tenth place out of thirteen and was outrun early under jockey Herb Hinojosa. Going into Pimlico's famous ""Clubhouse Turn,"" he fell further back into dead last. The fractions were moderate on the front end, with the first quarter in :231/5 and the half in :47 seconds. Going into the final turn, Neapolitan Way lugged in and collided with Hudson County, causing a severe cut high on his left rear leg. After the move inward, Hinojosa applied steady left handed whipping, straightening Neapolitan Way out at the top of the stretch. In the lane, he moved up quickly from 13th to 11th to 7th and then hit another gear. He started picking off horses, including Cannonade. In deep stretch, he moved into second place but was no threat to the winner, Little Current, who finished between seven and 21 lengths in front of the rest of the field. Cannonade finished one length behind Neapolitan Way in third with Jolly Johu three quarters of a length back in fourth. Neapolitan Way took home the 20% runner-up's share of the purse, equalling $30,000."

= = = Mount (heraldry) = = =
"In heraldry, a mount (also mountain, hill, hillock) is a representation of a hill or mountain as a curved terrace in base. When the mount is included in the lower part of the shield, it may be considered an ordinary rather than a charge."
"A trimount, also described as ""a mount mounted"", or ""shapournet shapourned"", is a representation of a mount with three tops. For mounts with more than three tops, the number of tops is blazoned as ""coupeaux"" (e.g. ""a mount with six coupeaux"")."
"The trimount (in German, ""Dreiberg"") can be found in all heraldic traditions (Gallo-British, German-Nordic and Latin), but it is especially common in Switzerland."
"A design of six hills (""Sechsberg"") can also be found in Swiss and Italian heraldry. In medieval German heraldry, mounts could have ten or more tops. Mounts with more than three tops are blazoned as a ""mount of N coupeaux"", e.g. German ""Sechsberg"" would be a ""mount of six coupeaux"", German ""Zehnberg"" as a ""mount of ten coupeaux"". A mount with more than six tops can also be blazoned as ""Schroffen"" in German heraldry."
"A ""terrace in base curved"" is blazoned ""mount"", ""hill"" or ""hillock"" when represented in vert; sometimes as ""a mount vert"" for clarity. Sometines, a ""terrace in base curved"" may be blazoned as ""mount"" even when not tinctured vert. This is mostly found in cases where the base represents a hill for one or several of the charges in the coat of arms. Classification either as an ordinary or, in many cases, as a charge, is a matter of interpretation."
"The coats of arms of Hungary and Slovakia depict a trimount, first used in the seal of Stephen V of Hungary (r. 1270–1272)."
"1990 also saw the first international tournament—""RugbyFest"" held in Christchurch, New Zealand. As well as a variety of club sides, including teams from Japan (but not the Japanese national team), were four ""national"" teams—USA, New Zealand, USSR, and the Netherlands—who played a round-robin tournament. The winner was New Zealand, who then played—and beat—a combined ""World XV""."
"""Rugbyfest 1990"" pointed the way to the next big leap forward—the first women's rugby world cup, which took place in Wales the following year. Timed to coincide with the second men's world cup being held in England it did not meet with official approval from World Rugby (then known as the International Rugby Football Board), a decision which threatened the competition and was a factor in the New Zealand RFU not supporting their entry. However, this did not stop the New Zealanders from taking part—nor Wales, the United States, England, France, Canada, Sweden, USSR, Japan, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands."
"The competition was run on a shoestring. Russian players sold souvenirs before and during matches to raise funds to cover their expenses, while four England administrators re-mortgaged their houses to cover the expenses of attending the competition. But after fifteen matches the first world champions were crowned—the United States, who beat England in the final. Despite the lack of support from the men's game, and very little media coverage, the competition had been a success, and the women's game continued to grow."
"In 1994 a second world cup was awarded to the Netherlands, but constant prevarication by the IRFB about whether they would (or would not) give the tournament official status caused huge problems for the hosts. Without IRFB support there was a fear that many unions would not send teams which would threaten the tournament (and even the Dutch union's) viability. In fact the IRFB went so far as to threaten sanctions against any unions did take part—thus ensuring that New Zealand, Sweden and Germany withdrew. Faced with this the risk of major losses was as too great and the Dutch withdrew both as hosts and participants with barely weeks to go."
"It was Scotland who stepped in to save the event with only 90 days to organise it. The second world cup was in the end a purely northern hemisphere affair with 11 remaining teams (consisting of the four home nations, France, the United States, Japan, Sweden, Russia, Canada and Kazakhstan) joined by a Scottish Students XV. The final was a repeat of 1991, but with this time England overcoming the United States 38–23, the final being played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. Despite everything, the tournament had been a success, and the game continued to grow."
In 1996 the IRFB established a Women's Advisory Committee which produced a five-year development plan for the game. One of its main targets was a 100% increase in player numbers by 2001. Elsewhere in the world...
"Widespread acceptance of the game led to women's versions of other major rugby union tournaments (the women's Five Nations begins in 1999), and growing numbers of headlines. In 2000 the Irish WRFU affiliated fully with the IRFU—but there were still set-backs. In 2002 the Australian RFU dropped support for the women's team's entry to the World Cup. The decision was seen as a factor in IOC rejection of rugby as an Olympic sport, and was reversed two years later."
But this was unusual. Women's teams were now being accepted on the main stage. In 2002 Scotland played their first women's match at Murrayfield and in 2003 England staged the first women's international at Twickenham.
"In 2006 the RFU devoted the rugby museum's main annual exhibition to the history of women's rugby—""Women's Rugby—A Work in Progress"", and the same year saw the Women's Rugby World Cup broadcast live on the internet."
"The growth in popularity among women attracted women in both developed and emerging nations, being the fastest growing sport in the world. The participation rates in both rugby sevens and rugby unions (with 15 players) has close to 500,000 new players joining every year globally. According to World Rugby, women's rugby is growing faster (if not as fast) as men's rugby and it is estimated that by 2026 40% of the total number of rugby players will be female. The game remains an amateur, minority sport—but a fast-growing one played in over 80 countries worldwide. Cost and player numbers mean that, in many of these nations, sevens tends to dominate, but 15-a-side championships have now been established in all regions."
"The highest profile women's rugby tournament is the Rugby World Cup, historically known as the Women's Rugby World Cup. The women's World Cup began in 1991, and has generally been played every four years. The most recent World Cup was held in Ireland in 2017, where New Zealand were the winners. In 2019, World Rugby announced that sex/gender designations would officially be removed from the title of the World Cup; the first tournament affected by this policy will be the next women's World Cup in 2021, to be hosted by New Zealand."
"The most successful nations in the World Cup have been New Zealand, which has won it five times, and England, which has reached the final seven times."
The primary annual global competition for women's rugby sevens is the World Rugby Women's World Series. The Women's Series was launched in the 2012-13 season. It features 4-6 tournaments each year.
"Women's rugby sevens at the Hong Kong Sevens has been dominated by New Zealand, with either the New Zealand team (1999–2001) or the Aotearoa Maori team (playing as New Zealand) winning the annual tournament from 1997 until 2007. The United States won the Hong Kong Sevens in 2008 by defeating Canada in the final (New Zealand failed to send a team)."
The inaugural Women's Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament took place in Dubai together with the men's tournament in 2009. Australia defeated New Zealand 15–10 in extra-time to become the first to win the Women's Rugby World Cup.
"Women's rugby sevens was included in World Rugby's successful bid to reintroduce rugby to the Olympics in 2016. At the 2016 Olympics, Australia defeated New Zealand in the final to win the gold medal."

= = = Samuel Richardson (Baptist) = = =
"Samuel Richardson (fl. 1646) was an English layman and religious controversialist of the 1640s and 1650s, of Baptist views."
"From Northamptonshire, Richardson was probably an army preacher in the early part of the First English Civil War. He became a leading member of one of the seven Baptist churches of London: in the three confessions of faith put forth by these churches in 1643, 1644, and 1646, Richardson's signature stands beside that of John Spilsbury, minister of the congregation at Wapping."
"Richardson supported the action of the parliamentary army and the government of Oliver Cromwell, to whom he had fee access. For a time he had scruples as to the title of ""Lord Protector"", and told Cromwell so to his face; then, becoming convinced, he tried to reconcile Vavasor Powell and others to the protectorate."
"Richardson defended Baptist practices and held strongly monergistic beliefs about justification similar to those of Tobias Crisp before him, and later John Gill. Salvation is exclusively by the grace of God and never depends on human faith or works, as justification is fully achieved on the cross as a result of the eternal decree of God to save the elect."
"Richardson, as Tobias Crisp, held that the law is not necessary to bring persons to saving faith, and that the Puritan emphasis on the individual believer's consciousness of sin makes subjective sentiments the object of faith, rather than Christ: ""We have made a Christ of our works, tears, and crying long enough"", Richardson notes."
"Human works as well as faith can only be considered results of God’s work in Christ as the Holy Spirit works in those who are justified. When Paul talks of justification by faith, he by “faith” simply means Christ. We are justified by Christ alone and not by our believing, Richardson claimed. Faith is an evidence of “interest in Christ but not a joint-partner with Christ”."
"Richardson, in his Justification by Christ Alone from 1647, argued that the work of Christ alone is the means of justification:"
"“[W]e grant God has decreed the end and the means, and whatsoever God has decreed shall unavoidably come to pass. But we deny that faith is any means of our Redemption, Justification, or Salvation. Nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ is the means of our salvation. There are means that are necessary to the revealing and enjoying the comfort of it, as the Holy Spirit and ministers to reveal it and faith to receive it; also, there be fruits and effects of the love of God, as faith, love, and obedience to Christ…yet these are no means of our salvation.”"
"Though holding a position in most of his works that can be described as clearly Particular Baptist and thus Calvinistic, Richardson in his last work expressed a form of eschatological universalism."
Richardson wrote:
"To Richardson have also been ascribed tentatively ""An exact and full Relation of all the Proceedings between the Cavaliers and the Northamptonshire Forces at Banbury"", January 1643–4, signed R. S.; ""The King's March with the Scots, and a List of the 3 Lords, … that submit to the Parliament upon the surrender of Newark"", London, May 1646; and ""Oxford agreed to be surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax"", London, June 1646."

According to the 2011 UK census, the parish had a population of 377, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 197; the parish covers an area of ."
"Local points of interest include Sledmere House, a Georgian country house. Built in 1751 by Richard Sykes, the house has remained in the Sykes family since then. It is now the home of Sir Tatton Sykes, 8th baronet."
"The Sledmere Monument is about south-east of the village, along the B1252 road, on top of Garton Hill. It is tall and is a tribute to Sir Tatton Sykes, 4th Baronet, built by his friends in 1865."
"The Wagoners' Memorial in the village, designed by Sir Mark Sykes, 6th Baronet, is dedicated to the Wolds Wagoners Reserve, a corps that Sir Mark raised from the local population to fight in the First World War. It is noted for its unusual shape and its graphic scenes of war and country life."
"The memorial was designated a Grade II listed building in September 1966, but upgraded to Grade I in March 2016."
"Sledmere is also the site of the Eleanor Cross, Sledmere, a replica Eleanor cross designated a Grade II listed building in September 1966, but upgraded to Grade I in March 2016."
The 'Sledmere Cross' takes the form of an Eleanor Cross and is a true 'folly' that was 'converted' in 1919 to a War Memorial by Sir Mark Sykes (of the Sykes–Picot Agreement) who added a series of brass portraits in commemoration of his friends and the local men who fell in the war and also notably himself in crusader armour with the inscription “Laetare Jerusalem (Rejoice Jerusalem)”.
"East of the village is Sledmere Castle, a folly built around 1790 by John Carr for Sir Christopher Sykes, the 2nd baronet, to enhance the view from Sledmere House."
The church of St Mary is one of the churches on the Sykes Churches Trail. In 1966 the church was designated a Grade II* listed building.

"Biscotasing, often referred to as simply Bisco, is a community in the Unorganized North Part of Sudbury District in northeastern, Ontario, Canada. It was founded on the shores of Lake Biscotasi on the Spanish River in 1884 by Canadian Pacific Railway as a railway construction town, and the first divisional point west of Sudbury. The rails of westward track laying gangs reached this area in October 1884."
"Biscotasing is an access point for canoeists, fishermen, and back-country campers to the area including Biscotasi Lake Provincial Park. It has one general store that functions as the post office, tackle shop, grocery store and Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) outlet; a community centre; a church; and the one-room Biscotasing railway station served by Via Rail. The town also is accessible by floatplane and by a long drive on the Sultan Industrial Road. Although the year-round population is only 22, during the summer season, the population swells to around 300, mostly tourists."
"The early development of Biscotasing was dictated solely by the needs of the railway. The CPR acquired a parcel of land at Biscotasing in 1884 and by November had cleared . A frame station the size of 30 × , was constructed, with offices upstairs, a large freight shed 40 × , a telegraph office, several residences for company officials and a number of boarding houses were completed before the end of that year. A wye track had also been installed to allow work trains to turn around prior to returning to the east. Later a roundhouse was built to service the locomotives."
"In his book ""The Last Spike"" historian Pierre Berton wrote about Biscotasing, as it was 1885-04-01, when the first soldiers on their way to the North-West Rebellion passed through."

= = = Phileine Says Sorry = = =
"Phileine Says Sorry () is a Dutch/American 2003 comedy-drama film directed by Robert Jan Westdijk. It is based on the novel ""Phileine zegt sorry"" by Ronald Giphart."
"The story is about Phileine (Kim van Kooten) and her actor boyfriend Max (Michiel Huisman). He goes to New York City to improve his acting skills. Later on, without Max knowing it, Phileine also travels to New York."
"On the plane, she meets an American couple, Fabian and Lena, who offer to bring her to Max's house. Fabian gives Phileine his phone number to call him during her stay for a tour. Inside Max's house, Phileine meets his friends: the bespectacled Jules, the sick Leonard, the Flemish Gulpje, the terrible Joanna and weatherman LT (Louis Theodore). That same evening, a welcome party is held, but because of all the new impressions, drinks, and fatigue, Phileine goes to bed early."
"In the morning, she finds a note from Max that he had to leave early for rehearsal but that the two of them will have dinner together in the evening. Phileine goes to the living room and meets Gulpje. Soon, they decide to be best friends and have lunch. After lunch, Phileine calls Fabian for a tour. During that tour, Fabian gets a little bit too personal so she reminds him that he has a wife."
"Max can’t make it to diner because his rehearsal runs out. Phileine spends that night with the friends of Max. Together with Gulpje, she stirs the group up because they both like to joke around at the expense of others."
"On day two, Phileine attends the premiere of Romeo and Juliet. The play shows the sexual side of society, so it is played naked and shows sex and masturbation scenes. Part of the audience is so shocked that after the break, they call out their displeasure and leave the theater. Phileine is astonished but remains still in her seat until the end."
"At the after party, she tries to obtain explanations about what had happened on stage. She asks Max and the director Reginald, but neither gives her an answer. She quarrels with Max but settles the matter later in a pub. The next day, she goes with Gulpje to the restaurant where the scene from “When Harry Met Sally"" was filmed. Phileine and Gulpje get the attention of two men and they invite them to their table. They want to show off their tricks and begin gently with panting and moaning. Initially the men find it funny, but when Phileine and Gulpje start screaming, the whole thing gets embarrassing and they run out the restaurant."
"A little later the women run into Jules and start a conversation about sexual harassment from men. After an insulting remark by Phileine, Jules departs. Only then does she discover that Jules is not female but male. Phileine goes to meet LT, the boyfriend of 'terrible Joanna', on his boat on the water. They have sex in 'revenge' for the escapade between Joanna and Max on stage."
"The next day, they decide to go to the last performance of the show. From the back of the theater, they see that Max is about to penetrate Joanna on stage. This time, Phileine will not let this happen and makes a huge scene by disrupting the play. Max tries to defend his action by explaining it as art. Phileine doesn’t accept this and gets the audience on her side in the argument."
"The day after, the newspapers are filled with what happened in the theater and Phileine is requested for a number of TV shows. She goes to David Letterman's show where she takes control over the show and wins the support of the audience. She is provided with money so she can stay the night in a hotel. The next day, Max is at her door to take her to an AIDS Gala of his friend Leonard. She doesn’t want to go with him, so he lifts her up over his shoulder and takes her to a taxi."
"The atmosphere between Phileine and the other people is hostile at the Gala. Except for Gulpje, Phileine has offended everybody else. Even Max is furious at her because he finds out she has slept with LT. Eventually Phileine realizes why everyone is mad at her. She gets on the stage and delivers a speech in which she says sorry for the first time in her life to everyone who she has treated rudely. She ends the speech with: ""Sorry that I exist."""
= = = Liuva II = = =
"Liuva II, ( 584 – June/July 603), youthful son of Reccared, was Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 601 to 603. He succeeded Reccared at only eighteen years of age."
"In the spring of 602, the Goth Witteric, one of the conspirators with Sunna de Mérida to reestablish Arianism in 589, was given command of the army to repulse the Byzantines. From his position of power at the head of the army, he surrounded himself with people in his confidence. When it came time to expel the Byzantines, Witteric instead used his troops to strike at the king in the spring of 603. Invading the royal palace, and deposing the young king, he counted on the support of a faction of nobles in opposition to the dynasty of Leovigild. Witteric cut off the king's right hand and later had him condemned and executed in the summer of 603."
= = = William Howard Taft National Historic Site = = =
"William Howard Taft National Historic Site is a historic house at 2038 Auburn Avenue in the Mount Auburn Historic District of Cincinnati, Ohio, a mile (1.6 km) north of Downtown. It was the birthplace and childhood home of William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States and the 10th Chief Justice of the United States. The two-story Greek Revival house, built circa 1835, is a reminder of the elegant era when wealthier people here could escape the dirt, heat, smoke and crowded conditions of the lower city."
"William Howard Taft's father, Alphonso Taft, came to Cincinnati from Vermont in 1838 to establish a law practice. He moved his family to this house a little over a decade later. Alphonso Taft became an early supporter of the Republican Party in Cincinnati. He lived in this house with his family and parents. He would eventually serve as the 31st United States Secretary of War and the 35th United States Attorney General."
"The house is believed to have been built in the early 1840s by a family named Bowen. Alphonso bought the house at 60 Auburn Street (now 2038 Auburn Avenue), with its accompanying 1.82 acres, for $10,000 on June 13, 1851. Mount Auburn was once a popular area to live for upper-class Cincinnatians, as it allowed those of higher incomes to escape the sweltering heat and humidity of downtown Cincinnati summers. The Taft residence, a Greek Revival domicile, was relatively modest compared to other nearby residences, which were a mix of Second Empire, Italianate, and Georgian Revival."
"Alphonso's wife Fanny Phelps Taft died a year after the family moved to the Mount Auburn residence, in June 1852. In December 1853 Alphonso remarried, choosing a schoolteacher from Massachusetts named Louise Torrey. Louise Taft would give birth to their second child, William Howard Taft, in the house on September 15, 1857, presumably in the first-floor nursery in the rear ell. (The first child had died at age fourteen months from whooping cough.) Alphonso had six children living in the house, two by Fanny (three others had died beforehand) and four by Louise."
"The house was used for social events. Visitors included many local and state dignitaries, including future President James A. Garfield. Rugs in the parlor were often rolled up for dancing. Family activities took place in the library; Alphonso was an avid book collector."
"William would live in the house until he went to Yale University in 1874. Afterward, the Taft family would spend less time in the house, starting when Alphonso served in the Ulysses S. Grant administration. In 1877 a fire damaged the second floor and roof. Alphonso and Louise would lease the house in 1889, moving to California because the climate was thought to be beneficial for those with declining health. William had married in 1886, and the rest of the Taft sons had moved out by this point as well. In May 1891 Alphonso died in San Diego, California, and was buried in Cincinnati; the tenants of the Auburn house allowed the mourners to gather at the house for the funeral. Louise eventually was able to sell the house outright, after ten years of trying, in 1899 to Judge Albert C. Thompson, after returning to her home town of Millbury, Massachusetts, to live with her sister."

"Tony Lynn Brackens, Jr. (born December 26, 1974) is a former American college and professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons. He played college football for the University of Texas, and earned All-American honors. A second-round pick in the 1996 NFL Draft, he played for the Jacksonville Jaguars for his entire pro football career."
"Brackens was born and raised in Fairfield, Texas. He attended Fairfield High School, and played for the Fairfield Eagles high school football team."
"Brackens attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he played for the Texas Longhorns football team from 1992 to 1995. He developed a reputation as a ferocious hitter as a defensive end. As senior in 1995, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American and was also a first-team All-Southwest Conference selection. He finished his career ranked eighth on the Longhorns' all-time list with 24 sacks. He was also a key contributor to the 1995 Longhorns team that went 10-1 and won the Southwest Conference and gained a berth in the 1996 Sugar Bowl against the Virginia Tech Hokies."
"He was taken in the second round of the 1996 NFL draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars, for whom he played his entire professional career. His lone Pro Bowl appearance came in 2000, after the 1999 season in which he had 12 sacks and 8 forced fumbles. As of 2011, he held the all-time Jacksonville Jaguars records for several categories: sacks (55), fumble recoveries (13) and forced fumbles (28). He is also the leading tackler (all-time) among Jaguars defensive ends."
"He was released in 2004, after a series of troubling leg injuries and operations. About his release, Brackens stated, ""Mentally and physically, I thought I could probably still do it, but I didn’t want to put up with all the rule changes. All the stuff they’re doing to players takes the fun out of the game."" The moment in which he was let go was captured by NFL Films in ""Jacksonville Jaguars: Inside the Training Camp"", an unofficial version of the Hard Knocks TV series."

Hughes was replaced successively by Adrian Workman and then by Tony Locke. They recorded three 12 inch extended plays for Red Eye before recording a studio album, ""Introversion"", in 1991 which was shelved due to record company disputes until July 1996. Meanwhile, they issued their first album, ""Hypnotised"", in May 1992 via Karmic Hit/Shock, and disbanded in 1998. The group reformed in 2008 to record a new album, ""Unfamiliar Places"", released in May 2011."
"The Bhagavad Guitars were formed in 1985 as Inner Circle in Canberra by Jeremy Butterworth on guitar, vocals and flute, John Underwood (a.k.a. John Kilbey) on guitar and vocals, Kynan Hughes on bass guitar and Matt Kerr on drums. As teenagers they had played together in a band while students at Dickson College. In 1987 they relocated to Sydney and renamed themselves, the new name, ""was derived from a pun on the title of the Hindu book ""Bhagavad Gita""."" Butterworth later reflected, ""We started off seriously interested in Eastern thinking, different philosophies, meditation... etc but now we're more cynical."""
"In July 1988 they released their debut five-track extended play, ""Foreverglades"", which was produced by the Church's Steve Kilbey (Underwood's older brother) for Red Eye Records. Its ""featured track, 'Just to Be Sure' became a radio hit in Sydney."" They followed in October with a six-track EP, ""Headland"", where Hughes had been replaced on bass guitar by Adrian Workman."
"Red Eye compiled the two EPs, leaving off ""Shrine"" from ""Headland"", into a full-length album, also titled, ""Foreverglades"", in July 1990. They followed with a third EP, ""Party"", with six tracks, in October of that year. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, observed, ""The band's brand of spacious, chiming guitar-based pop called to mind the likes of The Crystal Set, The Church and UK band Simple Minds."""
"The group's album, ""Introversion"", was recorded in 1991 but did not appear until July 1996 on Karmic Hit/Shock Records. It included, ""a bonus 14-minute CD EP ""Extraversion""."" In 1992 Kilbey formed a record label, Karmic Hit, which issued the group's single, ""Hypnotise Me"" in February. They followed with their first studio album, ""Hypnotised"", in May 1992 with Tony Locke on bass guitar and lead vocals for two tracks, ""Romeo Error"" and ""Accident""."
"After the Bhagavad Guitars separated, Kilbey released three solo albums, ""Nothing More Than Something to Wear"" (February 2003) as John Kilbey, ""Catching Some Z's"" (2004) as J.L.K. and ""Good Fortunes"" (March 1999) by the Penny Drops.

"Bryan Keith Cox (born February 17, 1968) is an American football coach and former player. His most recent position was as the defensive line coach for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Western Illinois University, a small college football program, but received attention for his aggressive style of play. Although Cox was a relatively late fifth-round pick by the Miami Dolphins in the 1991 NFL Draft, he rose to prominence as a standout linebacker during his twelve NFL seasons from 1991 through 2002. He was a three-time pro bowler with the Miami Dolphins, and was also a member of the New England Patriots club that won Super Bowl XXXVI."
"Cox was a member of the East St. Louis High School Flyers high school football team, where he was coached by Bob Shannon."
"Cox attended Western Illinois University and was a mass communications major and a letterman in football. In football, he was a four-year letterman and a two-year starter. As a senior, he was named as a first-team All-America selection by the ""Football Gazette"" and was a first-team all-conference selection. As a junior, he was named the Western Illinois Most Valuable Player. As a sophomore, Cox played in every game, and finished his sophomore season with 54 tackles, four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, two interceptions and three blocked kicks. As a freshman, Cox was a reserve nickel-back and finished the season with 30 tackles."
"Cox was drafted by the Dolphins in the fifth round of the 1991 NFL Draft, chosen 113th overall. As a rookie, Cox started 13 games as the Dolphins right outside linebacker, racking up a total of 61 tackles along with two sacks. Miami finished out the season 8-8. In his sophomore campaign, Cox blossomed and helped lead the Dolphins to an 11-5 record and the AFC Championship Game. He made his first Pro Bowl and was named to the All Pro team after recording 127 tackles, 14 sacks and five forced fumbles. Miami switched to a 4-3 defense in 1993 and Cox was moved to right linebacker. The team started out 9-2, but lost their last five to miss the playoffs. Cox again led the team with 122 tackles, four forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries. He also collected five sacks and an interception."
"Cox earned his second Pro Bowl selection in 1994, starting 16 games at middle linebacker, leading the team with 100 tackles. Miami finished the season 10-6, winning the Wild Card Game against the Kansas City Chiefs, 27-17 before losing the Divisional Playoff to the San Diego Chargers, 22-21. In 1995, Cox was selected to his second consecutive Pro Bowl, and third overall. He again started every game at middle linebacker, finishing the year with a team high 119 tackles, 7.5 sacks and three forced fumbles. The Dolphins went 9-7 before bowing out in the Wild Card Game to the Buffalo Bills, 37-22. The defense tied for the AFC lead by allowing only seven rushing touchdowns. Overall, Cox spent five years with the Dolphins playing both outside and middle linebacker, starting 75 out of a possible 78 games."
"Cox would go on to play seven more seasons in the NFL for the Chicago Bears, New York Jets, New England Patriots, and New Orleans Saints. In a career encompassing 165 games, Cox recorded 764 tackles, tallied 51.5 quarterback sacks, caught four interceptions and forced 22 fumbles. Among his most famous plays was a 27-yard interception-return touchdown against the Patriots in September 1999 while playing with the Jets; another famous play came with the Patriots in September 2001 in a game against the Indianapolis Colts; Cox hit receiver Jerome Pathon in the first quarter, a hit that briefly knocked Pathon out."
"Throughout his NFL career, Cox was easily recognizable on the field due to the unusual headrest- or ""surfboard""-style neck roll he wore and colored to match his uniform jersey."
From 2004-2005 he worked as an analyst for TVG Network. Cox also co-hosted an afternoon drive radio program for Fox Sports Radio in 2006 alongside Chris Myers.
"He was an assistant defensive line coach for the New York Jets for three seasons (2006–08) under Eric Mangini. After Mangini was fired and became the coach of the Cleveland Browns in January 2009, he brought Cox with him, where Cox was the defensive line coach."
"On February 21, 2011, Cox was hired by the Miami Dolphins as their pass rush coach."
"On February 17, 2012, Cox was hired to become a defensive assistant at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was hired the same day as Bill Sheridan."
"On January 11, 2014, Cox was hired by the Atlanta Falcons as their defensive line coach."
"In the 2016 season, Cox and the Falcons reached Super Bowl LI on February 5, 2017. Against the New England Patriots, the Falcons would fall in a 34–28 overtime defeat."
"On February 8, 2017, the Atlanta Falcons relieved Cox of his duties as the defensive line coach. He is now a football analyst on FS1."
"Bryan's son, Bryan Cox Jr., played football as a defensive lineman for the Florida Gators and was a member of the Carolina Panthers practice squad, but got promoted to the active roster in late September of 2017. He signed with the Cleveland Browns on November 13, 2019."

It differs from the pentagrammic antiprism by having opposite orientations on the two pentagrams.
This polyhedron is identified with the indexed name U as a uniform polyhedron.

"= = = Short, sharp shock = = ="
"The phrase ""short, sharp shock"" means ""a quick, severe punishment."" It is an example of alliteration. Although the phrase originated earlier, it was popularised in Gilbert and Sullivan's 1885 comic opera ""The Mikado"", where it appears in the song near the end of Act I, ""I Am So Proud"". It has since been used in popular songs, song titles, literature, as well as in general speech."
"John Conington's 1870 translation of the ""First Satire of Horace"" includes the following lines:"
"In Act I of the 1885 Gilbert and Sullivan opera ""The Mikado"", the Emperor of Japan, having learned that the town of Titipu is behind on its quota of executions, has decreed that at least one beheading must occur immediately. In the dialogue preceding the song, three government officials, Pooh-Bah, Ko-Ko and Pish-Tush, discuss which of them should be beheaded in order to save the town from ""irretrievable ruin"". Pooh-Bah says that although his enormous ""family pride"" would normally prompt him to volunteer for such an important civic duty, he has decided to ""mortify"" his pride, and so he declines this heroic undertaking. He points out that since Ko-Ko is already under sentence of death for the capital crime of flirting, Ko-Ko is the obvious choice to be beheaded."
"The three characters then sing the song ""I Am So Proud"". In the last lines of the song, Pooh-Bah, Ko-Ko and Pish-Tush contemplate ""the sensation"" of the ""short, sharp shock"" caused by being beheaded:"
"The phrase is particularly popular in music. For example, the phrase is used in the song ""Us and Them"" (from Pink Floyd's 1973 album, ""The Dark Side of the Moon"")."
"""Short Sharp Shock"" is also the name of a 1984 album by Chaos UK. It also appears in the title of an album, ""Short Sharp Shocked"", by Michelle Shocked and the EP ""Shortsharpshock"" by Therapy?. Short Sharp Shock is the name of a crossover thrash band from Liverpool, England. The phrase is used in the song ""East Side Beat"" by The Toasters, and in the 1980 song ""Stand Down Margaret"" by The Beat. It can also be found in the lyrics of a Billy Bragg song entitled ""It Says Here"" found on his 1984 album ""Brewing Up with Billy Bragg"" and of a They Might Be Giants song entitled ""Circular Karate Chop"" on their 2013 album ""Nanobots""."
"In literature, the phrase is used in the title of a 1990 fantasy novel, ""A Short, Sharp Shock"" by Kim Stanley Robinson. In the 1996 fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett, ""Feet of Clay"", police commander Sam Vimes is ""all for giving criminals a short, sharp shock"", meaning electrocution."

The new law is expected to bring a number of benefits to the country:"
"""Commercial production of ethanol from sugarcane, cassava or sorghum will help the island nation diversify its fuel portfolio and help to ensure its energy security. It could also generate employment, particularly in rural regions, as investors put up biofuel crop plantations and processing plants. Also, the shift to these plant-based fuels for transportation will help reduce pollution."""
"Four feedstocks—sugarcane, corn, cassava and sweet sorghum—were initially identified for ethanol production, but sugarcane is expected to be the predominant source of ethanol. The Philippines is a sugar-producing country, and sugarcane is grown mainly in the islands of Negros, Luzon, Panay and Mindanao. Despite growing demand for sugar, there are still an estimated 90,750 hectares (224,000 acres) of sugarcane available that can be used for ethanol production, and high-yielding varieties of sugarcane are available."
"In 2005, SEAOIL Philippines Inc. pioneered the use of ethanol as gasoline blend in the country, and the first to offer E10 Fuel in the market in their gasoline products. This was done even before the enactment of the Biofuels Act of 2006."

Donahue was born in Springfield, Ohio. He batted and threw left-handed."
"Donahue had his greatest success from 1904 to 1908, after switching to first base for the Chicago White Sox. Donahue's defensive skills were a key to the White Sox' 1906 World Series championship team, and he led American League first basemen in fielding percentage, assists, and putouts for 3 consecutive seasons, from 1905 to 1907. In 1907, Donahue had 1,846 putouts, which is still the major league record for putouts by a first baseman. He also holds the major league single season record for most chances accepted per game with 12.65 in 1907."
"Though known mostly for his fielding, Donahue was also a decent hitter from 1905 to 1907. In 1905, he was among the American League leaders in batting average (.287), on-base percentage (.346), RBIs (76), and stolen bases (32). In 1906, Donahue was among the league leaders in stolen bases (36) and sacrifice hits (36) and was one of only three White Sox starters to bat over .250 for the 1906 World Champion ""Hitless Wonders."" Donahue hit for a .278 average (5-for-18) with 2 doubles, 1 triple and 4 RBI."

The ""Oxford Dictionary of National Biography"" judged him ""arguably the most important businessman in India"" and quoted his obituary in ""The Times"" as ""one of the wealthiest men, if not the wealthiest man, in the country""."
"A later owner of the property wrote: ""In 1925 Sir David decided to build for himself a mansion on this 1200 acre [4.9 km²] estate, located only five miles [8 km] from the northwest edge of London. Prior to this he had built a 'modest' two-story house of some 14 rooms to live in during construction of the mansion. It was later to become the guest house."""
"Yule had married his cousin Annie Henrietta, oldest daughter of his uncle Andrew Yule of Calcutta. They had one child, Gladys. He died only three years after the construction of the house, and ""lies buried in an admirably designed carved stone tomb, covered overhead by a stone and wood canopy, enclosed by an ornate iron fence inside a small wooded park, the whole being encircled by another iron fence."" The Mausolea and Monuments Trust says that the sculpture itself is a draped chair with inscription from Kipling's ""Jungle Book"" and a box tomb showing his Indian jute mills and plantations."
"The two women lived the rest of their lives at Hanstead. The new main house became the home of the daughter, while her mother lived in the guest house (see dower house). They were world travellers who reportedly shared an interest in big game hunting and a love of animals. Hanstead House was said to have been adorned by a large stuffed bear which they had killed in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. On the grounds they kept a seal, penguins, and wallabies."
"In 1925 they expanded their interests to the breeding of Arabian horses. The two women used their considerable fortune to build stables, purchase breeding stock, and establish a stud. Despite its relatively late start, Hanstead was soon considered ""second only in importance to"" Crabbet Arabian Stud, whose founders, husband and wife team Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Lady Anne Blunt, had introduced the breed to England in 1878, and from whom the Yules bought and leased horses. A third stud, Courthouse, was also held up to be of the same level, and the three competed against each other at the annual show at the Roehampton Club"
"Gladys Yule died within a year of Judith Blunt-Lytton (Lady Wentworth), who had inherited Crabbet from her parents and run it for 40 years. The deaths of these two only children, at a time of high inheritance tax, meant that in 1957 a substantial number of British-bred Arabian horses left the country, improving the breed's bloodlines elsewhere. The Hanstead horses were appreciated in the United States and in South Africa."
"Following the death of Gladys Yule in 1957, Hanstead Park was put on the market, where it remained uncared for over a considerable period of time. Many country houses were being demolished at this time."
"In 1959 it was brought to the attention of the American evangelist Herbert W. Armstrong, who had arrived in England looking for a larger office for the British branch of his Radio Church of God. He bought the house and land as the site for his second Ambassador College campus. By the time of the purchase the guest house had already been sold separately to another buyer, who used the property as a private home like an island within the campus. Armstrong wrote in Chapter 72 of his autobiography that Trans World Airlines (TWA) had been considering Hanstead House as a school for stewardesses. ""Yet this mansion, with these outstanding gardens, the aviary, greenhouses, cedars of Lebanon, all finally came to us for £8,000 ($22,800) - the not uncommon price of a five- or six-room cottage on a forty- or fifty-foot lot in America, - and that on terms that gave us several years to pay."""
"In 1959 Hanstead House was renamed Memorial Hall in memory of Richard David Armstrong, Herbert's deceased son. The college at Bricket Wood began its first freshman year in 1960. (The first Ambassador College opened in 1947 at Pasadena, California; in 1964 a third college opened in Big Sandy, Texas which for a brief time became Ambassador University. All three colleges have since closed down.) From the radio studio of Ambassador College, daily broadcasts of ""The World Tomorrow"" were heard around the world on hundreds of stations. There was also a sizeable printing establishment on the site. Improvements were made to the grounds: tennis courts, track, gymnasium, and an Olympic standard (imperial measurements) indoor swimming pool."
"When Ambassador College closed its doors in 1974, the sports facilities were sold separately from the main buildings and eventually became part of a sports centre. The pool, one of the most modern in the area, became home to Verulam amateur swimming club in 1979."
"The college became a corporate training centre, first for the Central Electricity Generating Board and then, from 1993, to the banking group HSBC. In 2004 a volunteer-led community woodland was established on land given by the bank; Hanstead Wood has won a Green Flag Award."

= = = Israel B. Richardson = = =
"Israel Bush Richardson (December 26, 1815 – November 3, 1862) was a United States Army officer during the Mexican–American War and American Civil War, where he was a major general in the Union Army. Nicknamed ""Fighting Dick"" for his prowess on the battlefield, he was mortally wounded at the Battle of Antietam near Sharpsburg, Maryland."
"Richardson was born in Fairfax, Vermont. He was reportedly a descendant of famed American Revolutionary War general Israel Putnam. He was appointed from Vermont to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. He graduated 38th out of 52 cadets in the Class of 1841. He was one of 23 classmates who would become generals during the Civil War. After some routine assignments, Richardson served as a second lieutenant in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He was promoted to first lieutenant on Sep 21, 1846."
"He received two brevets for meritorious service during the Mexican–American War, to captain and major for the actions at Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. In Mexico while serving under General Winfield Scott in the Army of Occupation, he received his nickname, ""Fighting Dick"", which would carry over to the Civil War."
"He later served as a captain in the 3rd U.S. Infantry (a rank he achieved in 1851) at various frontier outposts in Texas and New Mexico Territory, San Antonio, Texas 1848–49, Post Opposite El Paso del Norte, 1849–1850; Fort Fillmore 1851–52, 1852–53; Fort Webster, 1852, 1853–54; and Fort Thorn, 1854–55. He then resigned his commission in 1855 and began farming near Pontiac, Michigan."
"When the Civil War broke out, Richardson was still farming in Michigan. He enlisted in the Union Army and recruited and organized the 2nd Michigan Infantry. He married Fannie Travor on May 18, 1861, in Wayne County, Michigan. When he reported with his regiment in Washington, DC, General Winfield Scott greeted him with ""I'm glad to have my 'Fighting Dick' with me again"". Richardson, promoted to colonel on May 25, 1861, was assigned command of the 4th Brigade, 1st Division, in the newly organized army of Brigadier General Irvin McDowell. His brigade saw limited action at the First Battle of Bull Run near Blackburn's Ford, and in covering the subsequent federal withdrawal to Washington. He was promoted to brigadier general, ranking from May 17, 1861."
"He commanded several brigades in the Army of the Potomac and then the 1st Division of the II Corps during the Peninsula Campaign in mid-1862. He was involved in the fighting at the battles of Yorktown, Seven Pines, and the Seven Days. He was particularly distinguished in sharp fighting near the Chickahominy River. Richardson was promoted to major general after the Seven Days Battles. His division was stationed in Washington, DC, during the Second Battle of Bull Run and did not participate in that engagement."
"Richardson's 1st Division played a key role during the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, attacking Confederate positions in the center of the Sunken Road in support of the 3rd Division of Maj. Gen. William H. French. After stubborn fighting, by 1:00 pm, Richardson had gained control of the high ground in front of the apex of the defensive line, and his men enfiladed the remaining defenders in the road, which would gain the nickname ""Bloody Lane"" for the carnage. Richardson pushed forward beyond the road and was directing the fire of his artillery and organizing another attack when he was struck by a shell fragment."
"Carried to the rear, Richardson was treated at a field hospital. His wound was not considered life-threatening, and he was given a room in Major General George B. McClellan's headquarters, the Pry House. President Abraham Lincoln paid his respects to the wounded Richardson during a visit to the battlefield in October. However, infection set in, and then pneumonia, which claimed the life of the popular general in early November. He was among six generals to be killed or mortally wounded at Antietam."
"His body was escorted to Detroit. Large crowds lined the streets during his funeral procession to nearby Pontiac, where he was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery."
"Fort Richardson, a Texas frontier fort active from 1867 to 1878, was named for him."
"The Israel B. Richardson Camp #2 of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War in Oakland, Michigan, was also named for the fallen general."
"Battery Richardson, a 12-inch coast artillery gun battery at Fort Hancock, New Jersey, was named for him."
= = = Jere Wood = = =
"Jere Wood (born c. 1949) is the former mayor of Roswell, Georgia, serving five consecutive terms. Mayor Wood defeated Democrat ""Pug"" Mabry, who served as mayor for over thirty years, in the election of 1997. During his election he ran on the platform of slow-growth, fighting urban sprawl and what he viewed as its negative side effects. At the time, he promised to only be a two-term mayor. He ran unchallenged and secured re-election in 2001. Wood is the son of Roy ""Splinter"" Wood, a Democrat, who was Undersecretary of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) during the Carter Administration in the 1970s. Wood won the mayor's race again in the election held in November 2005."
"Mayor Wood is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino."
"During the attempted merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, a number of politicians sent letters to the FCC expressing their support. Wood was one of these, stating the merger would help spur business growth. It was later discovered that Wood had actually submitted a letter that had been ghostwritten by Comcast. Wood was just one of a number of politicians exposed by ""The Verge"" to have participated in such a practice."
"In 2016, Roswell resident Michael Litton filed a lawsuit accusing Wood of violating the city of Roswell's charter by seeking a third term as mayor. Wood, who was first elected in 1997, advocated in 2010 for the Roswell mayor to have a term limit of three four-year terms. He has said the intent was that the clock would start for him when the law was passed, and not when he was first elected."
"Although Wood had enjoyed the support of State Representative Betty Price, she has since stated that she does not intend to amend the charter to allow Wood to run for a subsequent term. She had been willing to support a charter change that would allow the mayor to serve out his term, but no more. ""My goal has been to save the city the expense of a costly trial,"" Price said. Since the start of the controversy, the city of Roswell has spent $16,843 through city attorney fees on defending Wood, as of mid-2016. On August 3, 2017, Wood was removed from office after a judge finding he did violate city law."
"In October 2016, Wood filed suit in Fulton Superior Court against Roswell and the Roswell Council Members over whether he could renovate his home. Wood's home is located in the Roswell historic district, which requites prior approval when renovating. He was initially granted approval by the Roswell Historic Preservation Commission to build a 1.5 story, 3,000 square foot house on his property. However, the city council later overturned the decision in August 2016. Wood alleged in the lawsuit that council members acted improperly by deciding the council had the legal authority to reverse the commission's earlier decision. State historic preservation laws allow ""limited authority"" for the council members to ""approve, modify and approve, or reject"" the historic commission’s final decision, but only if it is found that the commission abused its discretion."
"Wood often mountain bikes, wind surfs or kayaks. He earned his Eagle Scout Award during his youth and has been active in the Boy Scout program in the North Fulton area."

""Consent involves submission, but the converse is not necessarily true...From the facts of case, all that is established is submission, and not consent...Is the taboo against pre-marital sex so strong as to provide a license to Indian police to rape young girls."" Later in January 1980 she formed the first feminist group against rape, ""Forum Against Rape"", widespread protests followed and eventually Indian Penal Code was amended."

"Due to the rapid development time, felt unable to cope ""Penambang"" vehicles wishing to cross the Muar River. Travel by ferry is quite time consuming and even dangerous especially during flood season. Therefore, the proposal was made to build a bridge that will connect to Tanjung Agas Muar Town and Malacca."
"Originally, the government planned to build a bridge across Sungai Batu Pahat alone. But after receiving pressure from Muar residents, the government added a proposal to build a bridge to Muar and Batu Pahat. Proposal to build two bridges that have been included in the Second Malaya Plan (1961–1966) by the Malayan Public Works Department (JKR) and it was announced by the Minister of Public Works, Tun VT Sambanthan."

"Initially, the government estimated allocation of RM8 million for the construction of both the bridge and the government finally succeeded in obtaining financing proceeds of RM9 million loan from Chase Manhattan Bank."
The government has allocated RM3.25 million for construction work. The work was initiated at the end of construction in 1965 and was completed in early 1967. They are built just 1.5 kilometres from the Tangga Batu Penambang Ferry Terminal.

"Begun in 1964 when Van Gasteren was 42 years old, ""Nema aviona za Zagreb"" finally premiered at EYE Film Institute Netherlands on the occasion of Van Gasteren's 90th birthday, 20 November 2012. Louis van Gasteren was present at the opening and afterwards was interviewed by journalist Raymond van den Boogaard. On November 30 there was a public interview with the author by television critic Hans Beerekamp from NRC Handelsblad."
"Vimeo.com called the film ""a journey in spiritual and geographical terms"" and Realtofilm.nl wrote, ""The film not only gives a peak into a fascinating era, it is a highly original autobiographical portrait."" Some reviews were negative. Yara Plasman of Filmtotaal.nl described the film as ""a veritable hotch-potch/jumble of various images, sometimes spontaneous while at other times obviously enacted, with or without a clear storyline . . ."""
"Principal photography for ""Nema"" began in 1964 in the Netherlands and lasted five years as Louis raised money as he went. Filming eventually covered ten countries. Jan de Bont was the cinematographer on the principal scenes of the film, including scenes in New York, Vancouver, San Francisco, Timothy Leary in Millbrook, and Meher Baba in India. Additional cameramen during the very long shooting period included Milek Knebel, Theo Hogers, Roeland Kerbosch, Olof Smit, Bert Spijkerman, Louis van Gasteren, and Kester Dixon (for final filming in 2012)."
"Van Gasteren worked hard to get an interview with Meher Baba for ""Nema aviona za Zagreb"". In 1967 Meher Baba was near the end of his life and in strict seclusion. Through the help of numerous contacts with people he met in his travels who had met Baba in the 60s, including Irwin Luck, Rick Chapman, and Robert Dreyfuss, Van Gasteren was at last able to reach Baba's secretary and arrange a meeting. Van Gasteren told Baba, ""The appearance of the Avatar in my film is more than functional, it is necessary, to give all the other happenings and sequences the final and right dimension."" The terms were that the shooting could only take place on September 20, 1967, during a short period when Baba would be coming out of seclusion for three hours in order to wash the feet of seven lepers, the last of such an occasion in Baba's life. Van Gasteren was told that if he was there on time, he could film and interview Baba. Van Gasteren arrived in Bombay on September 17, and at Meherazad at precisely 9:00 A.M. on September 19, accompanied by cameraman Jan de Bont and soundman Peter Brugman, and was shown around the location in preparation for the following day's shoot and met Baba. The following day, September 20, the crew filmed forty minutes of film footage of Baba and the surrounding area, including the interview seen in the film. About half of this footage was released in the 1997 documentary, ""Beyond Words""."
"Filming stalled in 1969. After two attempts to complete the film in the 70s and 80s, a final attempt to edit the film was begun in 2009 by filmmaker and editor Ilja Lammers who began to gather and assemble the material. The 35mm film was digitized by EYE Film Institute Netherlands in 2010. Completion financing was received from Netherlands Film Fund and EYE Film Institute and the film was finished in 2012, 48 years after principal photography began. The film premiered at EYE on Van Gasteren's 90th birthday. Gasteren was present at the opening."
"The film is in Dutch and English, with small amounts of French, Italian, Serbian, and Spanish. Available with Dutch or English subtitles."
= = = Hello (Kelly Clarkson song) = = =
"""Hello"" is a song by American recording artist Kelly Clarkson, from her fifth studio album, ""Stronger"" (2011). Written by Clarkson, Josh Abraham, Oliver Goldstein, and Bonnie McKee, with production by Abraham and Oligee, ""Hello"" is a midtempo rock song about searching for companionship in hopes of not being lonely, in which the singer asks, ""Hello? Is anybody listening?"""
"Upon its release, ""Hello"" was received with positive reception from music critics, who regarded it as a vocal highlight of ""Stronger"". Boosted by digital sales during the album's release, the song entered the South Korean Singles Chart at number 47. Clarkson has also performed it a limited live performance during her Stronger Tour in 2012."
"""Hello"" was written by Kelly Clarkson Josh Abraham, Oliver Goldstein, and Bonnie McKee, with Abraham and Goldstein (as Ollgee) handling the song's production. During the summer of 2011, Clarkson and McKee had collaborated on tracks such as ""Hello"" and ""Alone"", intending it to be recorded for Clarkson's fifth studio album, ""Stronger"", which was released on October of that same year. An acoustic version of the ""Hello"" was included as the opening track of her first extended play, ""The Smoakstack Sessions"" (2011)."
"Written in the key of E minor, ""Hello"" is a midtempo rock song with guitar chords and its hand claps. According to the sheet music published by Kobalt Music Publishing, Clarkson's voice range featured in the song spans from A to E. Jarett Wieselman of ""omg! Insider"" noted that its chord progression is similar to Katy Perry's single ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" (2011), a track also written by McKee."
"""Hello"" has received positive reviews from music critics. Jason Lipshutz of ""Billboard"" described it as ""a slightly more rugged track that finds its groove in the chorus. The handclaps on the bridge are a nice touch"" and added that the song ""is gonna be a killer in concert."" ""Seattle Post-Intelligencer""s Jason Scott described ""Hello"" as a ""Fun"" and ""cool"" track. He compared it to tracks recorded on ""All I Ever Wanted"" (2009) and noted that the track relies ""solely on the ""O"" vowel to tell a story. ""Ignorance isn't wise, but it beats being alone,"" Clarkson sings before asking if anybody is listening. We hear you loud and clear!"" Brian Mansfield of ""USA Today"" considered ""Hello"" as a vocal highlight of ""Stronger"", he wrote in his review: ""this rock tune sounds happier than its lyrics, which depict Kelly as feeling alone even when she's not by herself."" Sam Lansky of PopCrush compared it to ""Mr. Know It All"", and described it as a '90s throwback. He wrote, definitely works, especially with the hooky chorus and heartbroken ferocity of the bridge: ""Holding onto the memories of when I, I didn't know / Ignorance isn't wise but it beats being alone."" Ryan Pearson of ""The Huffington Post"" noted that ""there is an undertone of loneliness and sadness coursing throughout, including some downbeat lyrics co-written by Clarkson herself. ""Hello, is anybody listening? Won't somebody show me that I'm not alone,"" she sings on ""Hello""."""

"Potter Puppet Pals is a puppet show web series parodying the ""Harry Potter"" novel series by JK Rowling, created by Neil Cicierega."
"The first two episodes were animated, both released in 2003 on Newgrounds. On September 26, 2006, the series was re-launched on YouTube under Cicierega's page as ""Potions Class"". Six more episodes were released by Cicierega between 2006 and 2009. Approximately one year after the seventh episode was released, a new video appeared on Neil's channel announcing an exclusive ""Potter Puppet Pals"" channel. On the same day, three more videos were released on this page. The ""Potter Puppet Pals"" make appearances at some Harry Potter parties, such as Yule Balls 2007 and 2010."
"Both the original animated episodes, as well as the first seven live-action episodes, have been published to the official ""Potter Puppet Pals"" webpage."
"Much of the humor derived from the series originates from Cicierega's unique interpretation of the principal Harry Potter characters. Some characters are given personalities designed to contrast completely with their attitudes in the Harry Potter books. Cicierega's Harry is portrayed as an extremely brash, arrogant, and vain teenager who is ""rife with boyish attitude,"" while Dumbledore is a nudist. Other times, an aspect of the original stories is blown out of proportion for comedic effect, such as Hermione Granger's love of reading and matter-of-fact approach to problems. In the episode ""Snape's Diary"", Hermione remarks, ""I know a thing or two about books, and that's a book!"" Later in the same episode, she excitedly shouts, ""Here's one of the quills I carry with me at all times!"""
"""The Mysterious Ticking Noise"", released March 23, 2007, was the 22nd most-viewed video on YouTube as of January 1, 2013 with over 137.5 million views. The video was nominated and won in the Comedy category in the 2008 YouTube Awards with 61.6% of the votes in that category."
"In the video, Severus Snape hears a strange ticking and, noticing it has a catchy rhythm, begins singing to it, followed by Dumbledore, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Harry Potter. Towards the end, Ron discovers that the source of the ticking is a pipe bomb that explodes as they celebrate, letting Lord Voldemort sing his name by himself to the tune of ""Lollipop"" by The Mudlarks. At the New York premiere of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"", Alan Rickman was interviewed by MTV and quoted as saying “[Potter Puppet Pals] is very beautifully done, that little piece of work. Can you get rich from that? I hope they did."" Daniel Radcliffe also mentioned in an interview by MTV that the cast of the ""Harry Potter"" film series should do a live action version of ""The Mysterious Ticking Noise"" for a charity."
"On 23 March 2017, a 4K remake of the original video was posted to the Potter Puppet Pals channel to mark the 10th anniversary of the original."
"In his poetic anthology ""Al A'mal Ash-Shi'riyya"" (الأعمال الشعرية) and in preface to ""Blossoming Rose"" Tawfiq stated that he does not support poetry in prose, because it does not sound like a good verse, but at the same time Tawfiq insisted that he supported existence of this genre itself. Like other specialists of Arabic literature, Tawfiq knew the poetry of al-Mutanabbi. In his own verses Tawfiq appealed to al-Mutanabbi's qasidas and biography, using a lot of inter-textual elements. Also Tawfiq gave an estimate of al-Mutanabbi's panegyrics, raising the question of engagement of poetry and politics. Tawfiq compared al-Mutanabbi's panegyrics to Sayf al-Daula, with Mohamed Hassanein Heikal's essays to late Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser."

= = = Friedrich Carl Albert Schreuel = = =
"Friedrich Carl Albert Schreuel, also known as Frederik Karel Albert Schreuel and Jan Christian Aelbert Schreuel (14 June 1773 – 1853), was a Dutch-born painter."
"Schreuel was born in Maastricht, the Netherlands, on 14 June 1773. He joined the Dutch military at a young age. He is recorded as painting by 1788 and eventually left the military to begin studying art, first in Berlin then, in 1805, in Dresden. He spent some time studying under Josef Grassi of the Dresden Academy and soon made a name for himself by painting portrait miniatures. One of his portraits, known from an oval engraving by C. Bolt, was of Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. Schreuel would also copy works held at the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden. By 1840 he had been appointed a professor of painting by the King of Saxony."
"Schreuel is believed to have painted the portrait of the Javanese artist Raden Saleh, who was then studying in Europe, that is now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The painting dates to before 1841, because Saleh is depicted dressed as a European dandy, not as a Javanese prince, which was how he dressed beginning in that year. The painting was first recorded at the Dresden Academy exhibition, at which it was a critical success. However, it has also been attributed to Saleh himself; in 2005 the Rijksmuseum was still referring to the work as a self-portrait. The pose is one traditional in self-portraits, and no other portraits by Schreuel are known to have survived, while the style of his miniatures is different; however, this would be the only unsigned painting by Saleh, he knew Schreuel (whom he called 'Schruil'), and the brushwork is freer than is characteristic of his work. According to the Tropenmuseum, they have the only known self-portrait by Saleh."

= = = Robert Stephenson and Company = = =
Robert Stephenson and Company was a locomotive manufacturing company founded in 1823. It was the first company set up specifically to build railway engines.
"The company was set up in 1823 in Forth Street, Newcastle-upon-Tyne in England by George Stephenson, his son Robert, with Edward Pease and Thomas Richardson. The manager of the works between 1824 and 1825 was James Kennedy."
"The company's first engine was ""Locomotion No 1"", which opened the Stockton and Darlington, followed by three more: ""Hope"", ""Black Diamond"", and ""Diligence"". Their vertical cylinders meant these locomotives rocked excessively and at the Hetton colliery railway Stephenson had introduced ""steam springs"" which had proved unsatisfactory. In 1828 he introduced the ""Experiment"" with inclined cylinders, which improved stability, and meant that it could be mounted on springs. Originally four wheeled, it was modified for six and another example, ""Victory"", was built. Around this time, two locomotives were built for America. The first, a four coupled loco named ""America"", was ordered by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. The second, six-coupled and named ""Whistler"", was built for the Boston and Providence Rail Road in 1833."
"In 1829, the company built a new, experimental locomotive to enter in the Rainhill Trials. Rocket had two notable improvements — a multi-tube boiler and a separate firebox. Rocket won the trials and convinced the directors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway to use steam locomotives on their railway, and to order these locomotives from Robert Stephenson & Co. Rocket's cylinder were originally angled at an angle of 45 degrees, but were later moved to be horizontal."
"The ""Invicta"" was the twentieth Robert Stephenson & Co. locomotive, and was built for the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. Its cylinders were inclined, but moved to the front end. In 1830 came the ""Planet"" class with the cylinders inside the frames, followed by the ""Patentee"", which added a pair of trailing wheels for greater stability with a larger boiler. This 2-2-2 design became the pattern for most locomotives, by a variety of manufacturers, for many years."
"The locomotive ""John Bull"", built in 1831, was originally of the ""Planet"" type, but was later modified. It survives and is now in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and is claimed to be the oldest still functional self-propelled vehicle."
"The increased distance travelled by many trains highlighted problems with the fireboxes and chimneys. With the co-operation of the North Midland Railway at their Derby works, he measured the temperature of the exhaust gases, and decided to lengthen the boilers on future engines. Initially these ""long-boiler"" engines were 2-2-2 designs, but in 1844, Stephenson moved the trailing wheel to the front in 4-2-0 formation, so that the cylinders could be mounted between the supporting wheels. It was one of these, the ""Great A"" along with another from the North Midland Railway, which was compared with Brunel's ""Ixion"" in the gauge trials in 1846. In 1846 he added a pair of trailing wheels - the first with eight wheels. Another important innovation in 1842 was the Stephenson link motion."
"Robert Stephenson and Company built a number of Crampton type locomotives for the South Eastern Railway and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. These were all of 4-2-0 wheel arrangement with inside cylinders and indirect drive. The inside cylinders drove a crankshaft located in front of the firebox and the crankshaft was coupled to the driving wheels by outside rods. They were unsuccessful on the LCDR, and the five ""Echo"" class locomotives were rebuilt as conventional 4-4-0 locomotives after only four years of service."
"The first railway proposal in Egypt came about when Pasha Muhammad Ali asked the British engineer T.H. Galloway to design a railway in 1834. Instructions to make it followed in 1836. Materials were delivered but little real construction followed. No Ottoman ""firwan"" (permission) was issued and the French objected. Progress was really made when in 1849 Muhammad Ali died, and in 1851 his grandson Abbas I of Egypt contracted Robert Stephenson to build Egypt's first standard gauge railway. The first section, between Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast and Kafr el-Zayyat on the Rosetta branch of the Nile was opened in 1854. This was the first railway in the Ottoman Empire as well as Africa and the Middle East. In the same year Abbas died and was succeeded by Sa'id Pasha, in whose reign the section between Kafr el-Zayyat and Cairo was completed in 1856 followed by an extension from Cairo to Suez in 1858. This completed the first modern transport link between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, as Ferdinand de Lesseps did not complete the Suez Canal until 1869."
"At Kafr el-Zayyat the line between Cairo and Alexandria originally crossed the Nile with an 80 feet (24 m) car float. This was the single largest project of the South Street Works. However, on 15 May 1858 a special train conveying Sa'id's heir presumptive Ahmad Rifaat Pasha fell off the float into the river and the prince was drowned. Stephenson therefore replaced the car float with a swing bridge nearly long."
The Egyptian connections to Robert Stephenson were very considerable and a wealth of consequential artefacts are in Cairo Railway Museum. This includes what could well be the single most extravagant piece built by the Robert Stephenson Works. This is works number 1295 of 1862 whose artistic design was by Matthew Digby Wyatt. This 2-2-4T for the Egyptian Railways survives with all its fantastical marquetry in the Egyptian Railway Museum at Cairo. It is called the Khedive's Train.
"Over the remainder of the century, the company prospered in the face of increasing competition, supplying railways at home and abroad. By 1899 around 3000 locomotives had been built and a new limited liability company was formed, Robert Stephenson and Company Limited and the works was moved to Darlington, the first locomotive leaving the shop in 1902."
"Most railways in Britain were building their own rolling stock, so most of the output was for export, from 4-4-0's for the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway to GS (4-6-0) and HS (2-8-0) classes for the Bengal Nagpur Railway. These preceded the slightly larger BESA standard designs for the Indian railways. The works built the first British 2-10-0 for the Argentine Great Western Railway in 1905."
"During World War I, the company devoted itself to munitions work. However, between 1917 and 1920, a large batch of ROD 2-8-0 and SNCV type 18 0-6-0 tram locomotives were ordered by the War Office for use on the continent. From then on, business was slack, for various reasons. Notable were thirty 2-6-0 mixed traffic locomotives for the GWR in 1921, a batch of thirty 0-6-0 tank engines for the LNER and five 7F 2-8-0s for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. In 1936 and 1937, only forty six were built, including eleven B17 class (""Sandringham"") 4-6-0s for the LNER, and seven 2-6-4 passenger tank locomotives for the South Indian Railway Company."
"In 1937, the company merged with the locomotive interests of Hawthorn Leslie and Company to form Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns Limited. The company's shipbuilding activities continuing separately. Main line locomotives continued to be built at Darlington, while industrial engines were built at Hawthorne Leslie's works at Forth Bank, Newcastle. in 1938 the goodwill of the Kitson and Manning Wardle companies was bought."

"Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio (1902–1964) was an Italian painter, the formulator of industrial painting, and a founding member of the Situationist International. He was also a scholar of popular culture, archaeology, nomadism, and botany."
"Pinot-Gallizio was born in Alba, Piedmont, where he became an independent Left councilman and a chemist. In 1955, he met Asger Jorn, with whom he co-founded the Experimental Laboratory of the Imaginist Bauhaus in Alba, which was part of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, in opposition to the return to productivism by others in the Bauhaus school, in particular Max Bill. It was held in Pinot-Gallizio's studio, a monastery from the seventeenth century, and was attended by such artists as Enrico Baj who experimented with nuclear painting techniques, Walter Olmo, who experimented with musical interventions, Ettore Sottsass, Elena Verrone, and Piero Simondo."
"Pinot-Gallizio drew from his background as a chemist in developing new painting techniques. In 1956 he, along with Jorn, organized the First World Congress of Free Artists, at which a representative from the Lettrist International spoke, foreshadowing the foundation of the Situationist International in 1957 by members of both groups, including Pinot-Gallizio. At this conference the Italian artists withdrew from the Laboratory, and after the formation of the SI only Pinot-Gallizio and his son, Giors Melanotte, remained. He helped to make the SI known in the art world with an exhibition in Paris in 1959."
"He left the SI in 1960 as it became focused on political, rather than artistic, action. He died in Alba in 1964, and the laboratory continued its work until his death."
"Many of Pinot-Gallizio's works were industrial paintings. Rather than a small image to be interpreted, these huge canvases were intended to cover a large area. The first of these was the cavern of anti-matter, prepared in 1957 after the formation of the SI. It was composed of 145 meter canvases which were painted by hand or with the aid of spray guns and machines using resins invented by Pinot-Gallizio himself. It was displayed at the Galerie René Drouin in 1959, draped around the gallery and sold by the meter."

"The term ""Hop-tu-naa"" comes from a Manx Gaelic song traditionally sung during the festival which included the nonsense Hop-tu-naa as a refrain; such nonsense rhymes are common theme in Irish and Scottish Gaelic music."
"On the Isle of Man today, many groups of people continue the tradition of singing Hop-tu-Naa songs ""around the houses"" (which traditionally referred to waits going around visiting houses, especially those of the wealthy, and soliciting gifts; beggars going ""around the houses"" are featured in The Deemster) with turnip lanterns. In addition to this, many public Hop-tu-Naa events take place across the Isle of Man each year, most of which today include competitions for artistically carving turnips and the singing of traditional songs. As well as the many events run within local communities, the National Folk Museum at Cregneash hosts an event to teach the traditional Hop-tu-Naa song and to help people to carve turnips."
"At the modern Hop-tu-Naa, children dress up and go from house to house hoping to be given sweets or money, as elsewhere. The children carry carved ""turnip"" lanterns (which are known as ""moots"" by the Manx) and sing Hop-tu-Naa songs. There are regional varieties of how turnips should be carved for Hop-tu-Naa, with variations focusing on which way up the turnip is and the nature of the decorations. It is believed that turnip-lanterns do not date earlier than the start of the 19th century, as the vegetable had only been introduced at the end of the previous century. In the past children would bring the stumps of turnips with them and batter the doors of those who refused to give them any money, in an ancient form of trick or treat. This practice appears to have died out."
"A hop-tu-naa dance was collected by both Mona Douglas and Leighton Stowell. It was believed to have been danced through the streets on Hop-tu-Naa night by couples carrying their turnip-lanterns. It is a simple procession dance for pairs of dancers which involves the Manx reel step and a combination of arches only. This dance is taught in many schools on the Isle of Man during October each year, and it is danced at many of the Hop-tu-Naa events across the island."
"Some of the older customs are similar to those now attached to the January New Year. It was a time for prophesying, weather prediction and fortune-telling. Last thing at night, the ashes of a fire were smoothed out on the hearth to receive the imprint of a foot. If, next morning, the track pointed towards the door, someone in the house would die, but if the footprint pointed inward, it indicated a birth."

= = = Cherry Hill Park = = =
"""Cherry Hill Park"" is a song written by Robert Nix and Billy Gilmore, arranged by Buddy Buie, James Cobb, and Emory Gordy, Jr., and produced by Buie and Bill Lowery. Its original by Billy Joe Royal was a hit in 1969 reaching #15 on both the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart and the ""Cash Box"" chart, and #8 in Canada. It was on Royal's 1969 album ""Cherry Hill Park"". Buie also produced its cover version performed by the Classics IV which was released by United Artists Records in 1971. He and the Classics IV's manager Paul Cochran were two of the four owners of Studio One. The cover was actually marketed with its title combining the first two words of the original's (""Cherryhill Park"")."
"The subject of the song is one Mary Hill, a girl who has frequents the titular Cherry Hill Park. During days she acts as a tease to the boys in the park but at night when they return to the park she gratifies them, as noted in the barely disguised suggestive lyrics. However, she ""married away"" to a ""man with money"". As a result, she stopped coming to Cherry Hill Park."
"Royal came up with the song's title after a friend described seeing Cherry Hill, New Jersey on a visit to nearby Pennsylvania."
"Different mixes of this song exist, some with additional background vocals in the song's bridge, others in varying lengths, the longest version available being 3:17, with an extended finale running 33 seconds longer than the common single version."
= = = Tadao Yasuda = = =
"He made his professional sumo debut in March 1979 at the age of 15, after leaving junior high school. He was recruited by Kokonoe stable. In 1980 he adopted the ""shikona"" of Fujinomori, before switching to Takanofuji in 1984. He first reached ""sekitori"" status in March 1985 upon promotion to the second highest ""jūryō"" division, but could manage only 4 wins against 11 losses and was demoted back to the unsalaried ""makushita"" division. After winning promotion back to ""jūryō"" in January 1986 he made his debut in the top ""makuuchi"" division only two tournaments later in May 1986."
"Takanofuji was ranked in the top division for 33 tournaments, winning one special prize for Fighting Spirit. His two gold stars for defeating ""yokozuna"" were both earned against Futahaguro (who, as Koji Kitao, also turned to professional wrestling). Takanofuji had the advantage of belonging to a stable that included two ""yokozuna"", Chiyonofuji and Hokutoumi, which under sumo regulations meant he never had to face them in tournament play. However, his height of meant he had a higher centre of gravity than was ideal for a sumo wrestler, and he seemed to struggle when promoted above the mid ""maegashira"" ranks. Though he managed to reach the fourth highest ""komusubi"" ranking in July 1990 he could not maintain the rank, winning only two bouts there. He was demoted from the top division after the September 1991 tournament and announced his retirement in May 1992. His career coincided exactly with that of his stablemate Hokutoumi, who made his debut alongside him in March 1979 and also retired in May 1992. At Takanofuji's own request, it was the previous head of Kokonoe stable, ex-""yokozuna"" Kitanofuji, his long time coach, and not his successor, ex-""yokozuna"" Chiyonofuji, who performed the topknot cutting at Takanofuji's official retirement ceremony or ""danpatsu-shiki."""
"Takanofuji's most common winning ""kimarite"" were ""yori-kiri"" (force out), ""hataki-komi"" (slap down) and ""tsuki-otoshi"" (thrust over)."
"Reverting to his real name, he joined the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) promotion in June 1993, making his debut in February 1994. Yasuda spent the majority of the 1990s as an undercard wrestler, primarily competing in opening matches or as the fall guy in tag team matches with wrestlers such as Shinya Hashimoto and Kensuke Sasaki, achieving little success. In late 2000, Yasuda, along with Kazuyuki Fujita, became somewhat of a pet project for Antonio Inoki, and both of them were sent to the United States to train in mixed martial arts. Yasuda returned to Japan soon after, and was victorious in his first fight against veteran Masaaki Satake at Pride 13. Yasuda's win helped further legitimise him as a pro wrestler in the eyes of Inoki, and this was rewarded with Yasuda reaching the semi finals of the 2001 G1 Climax, where he lost to Keiji Mutoh. After earning one win and one loss in MMA throughout 2001, Yasuda earned the biggest win of his career in December by choking out veteran Jerome Le Banner. His defeat of Jerome led to Yasuda's stock in New Japan skyrocketing almost overnight, and Yasuda soon found himself elevated from over the hill veteran to top title contender in early 2002. Yasuda earned the biggest win of his pro wrestling career on February 16, defeating Yuji Nagata in a tournament to win the vacant IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Yasuda held the title for 48 days, before dropping it to Nagata in April. In August 2002, Yasuda and Kantaro Hoshino formed their own faction, the Makai Club, a group of wrestlers primarily with MMA backgrounds who worshipped Antonio Inoki like a god. Yasuda was viewed as the leader of the group, and in early 2003 he partnered up with his second in command Kazunari Murakami to enter the IWGP Tag Team Championship #1 Contender Tournament. Despite losing to Jim Steele and Mike Barton in the final, an injury to Steele would give the title to shot to Murakami and Yasuda who unsuccessfully challenged Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Masahiro Chono on February 16. Having retired from MMA, the aging Yasuda's position in the New Japan card began to fall again, and in late 2004 he left the promotion. After leaving New Japan, he started making sporadic appearances for ZERO-ONE and Hustle."
"In October 2007 he reportedly attempted to commit suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, using a yeontan. A friend however, interrupted the alleged attempt. He was hospitalized with fears of possible brain damage, but this proved not to be the case and he eventually made a return to wrestling. Speaking to ""Tokyo Sports"" Yasuda later denied attempting suicide, saying the poisoning was accidental. On January 11, 2011, Yasuda announced his retirement from professional wrestling. He wrestled his final match on February 4, 2011, in which he was defeated by Genichiro Tenryu."
"Though very past his prime physically, Yasuda made his transition to mixed martial arts as a NJPW representative in March 2001. He had his debut at the PRIDE 13 against similarly retired kickboxer and karate champion Masaaki Satake. Yasuda received damage and bled from his face, but he nullified most of Satake' attacks by rushing him through sumo techniques against the ropes every time they were separated. At the end, the unanimous decision was given to Yasuda for controlling the fight."
"Yasuda returned to MMA in the K-1 Andy Hug Memorial event, taking on Rene Rooze in a special rules match, but he lost via head kick KO at the third round. He would be more successful in December 2001, when he fought popular K-1 player Jerome Le Banner at an Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye event: Yasuda managed to take him down and submit him by pressing his forearm against Le Banner's throat, getting the biggest win of his MMA career."
"He would later lost to fellow NJPW wrestler Kazuyuki Fujita in an Universal Fighting-Arts Organization event. Yasuda then fought superheavyweight kickboxer Jan Nortje, but he had to retire from the match when he hurt a leg seriously. His last fight was a rematch against Rooze, losing the fight again, this time by TKO."
Yasuda's daughter Ayami was born in 1987 and is a model.
"Marjanović was born into a large working-class family with 7 children in Knin, in the Littoral Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (present-day Croatia). He had 4 brothers and 2 sisters. His father, Dušan, worked in the local factory, while mother Marija was a homemaker."
"After completing primary school and gymnasium in his hometown, Marjanović moved to Zagreb where he attended musical academy which he never finished."
"He then moved to Belgrade, where in 1960 he graduated at University of Belgrade's Faculty of Economics, more specifically at the department for microeconomics."
"Upon graduation, Marjanović came back to Knin since he found employment there as the supervisor in Tvik factory. From there, he advanced to the position of financial director, and eventually moving on to metallurgical factory in Zenica. In 1973, he transferred to the Moscow outpost of Progres - a state company that handled close to 80% of Yugoslav black metallurgy and other heavy industries."
"By 1976 he quickly advanced up the ranks to become one of the directors at Progres. He handled company's steel division in Russia quite successfully while developing an impressive network of influential friends and business partners such as Viktor Chernomyrdin (later to become Prime Minister of Russia), and Yuri Brezhnev, son of Leonid Brezhnev."
"In 1979, Marjanović was named as Progres' general director."
"From 1989 until 1994, he was the president of FK Partizan's executive board. One of his more notable moves while at the post was bringing Predrag Mijatović to the club in December 1989. Mijatović, at the time a young promising player from Titograd's FK Budućnost, was very close to signing with Hajduk Split when Marjanović stepped in and convinced him to come to Belgrade. Upon leaving the club, Marjanović was named Partizan's honorary president."
Marjanović officially commenced his PM term on 18 March 1994. He was widely regarded as little more than a puppet of then Serbian president Slobodan Milošević.
"After early parliamentary elections in late 1997, Milošević's SPS-led coalition (with Yugoslav Left and New Democracy) formed a government with far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS) led by Vojislav Šešelj. Marjanović was picked for another PM term that started on March 24, 1998."
"Naturally, Marjanović continued as a mere extension of Slobodan Milošević who at this time held the post of President of Yugoslavia. Here's how sources from the top levels of Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia described Marjanović's government modus operandi in ""Evropljanin"" magazine: ""Prime Minister Marjanović suggests something – ministers do not vote – and then Marjanović simply concludes the matter as agreed on. Of course Marjanović neither suggests nor concludes anything without first consulting Milošević"". (""Evropljanin"" issue #13, 19 October 1998, p. 15)"
"Even deputy PM Vojislav Šešelj indirectly confirmed this operating procedure when he said the government meetings are always well prepared, never lasting longer than 15–20 minutes. (""Srpska slobodarska misao"", Vol. I 2000, issue #1, p. 142)"
"This two-year period is widely seen as the most brutal whilst Serbia was led by Milošević. Marjanović's government (with Šešelj as its deputy PM), passed two of what critics consider to be the most draconian pieces of legislation in Serbian political history: the University Law that stripped the University of Belgrade of its autonomy, opening the way for the government to install professors, deans and rectors, as well as the Information Law, which aimed to restrict the activities of media financed by political enemies; despite this, the media played a prominent role in the 5 October 2000 coup d'état."
"Similarly to his first term in office, Marjanović again took a back seat, leaving the limelight to more aggressive members of his cabinet like deputy PM Šešelj and Minister of Information Aleksandar Vučić."
"On 21 October 2000, two weeks after the Bulldozer Revolution, Marjanović resigned to be replaced by a transitional government composed of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), and the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) until new parliamentary elections could be organized."
"Marjanović continued to lead Progres all throughout his six and a half years as Serbian PM, though he claimed his status at the company was frozen. The company, which during the 1990s started importing gas from Russia (deal personally negotiated by Marjanović) was still officially publicly owned."
"Although allegations of wrongdoing ran rampant for years, Marjanović was never prosecuted. No legal action was taken against him after the new authorities took office following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in October 2000. On 23 January 2002, Marjanović was re-elected as Progres' main board president."
"He died on 21 February 2006, in Belgrade, at age of 68, from undisclosed causes."

He is a two-time Atlantic 10 Player of the Year and went on to play in the Pittsburgh Pirates minor-league organization. Kingsbury was the first baseball player to earn back-to-back Atlantic 10 Player of the Year Awards, in 2001 and 2002. He went to school at Fordham where he set an NCAA record for stolen bases in a game (8), and was drafted by the Pirates in the 8th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft, but his excellent glove, a quick bat, an intelligent hitting approach, and his work ethic could have given him a third or fourth-round pick if he'd gone to a warm-weather college."
"During the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens, Greece, Kingsbury, who has a Greek grandmother, was given the chance to play for the host nation, Greece. Most of the players on the Greek baseball team were Americans with Greek heritage, including North Florida coach Dusty Rhodes, and White Sox scout John Kazanas, Clay Bellinger of the Orioles, outfielders Nick Markakis the Orioles and Nick Theodorou of the Dodgers, and catchers Mike Tonis of Royals and George Kottaras of the Padres."
"Kingsbury, an alumnus and 2008 Hall of Fame inductee of Fordham University and current member of the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, picked up one of the biggest hits of the tournament for Greece, an RBI triple, in their lone win, which came against Italy in the preliminary round."
"In the spring of 2006, Kingsbury was invited to the Pirates major-league camp in Bradenton, FL as a non-roster invitee. During the seventh inning of the first game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Kingsbury dove for a ball in right field and upon hitting the ground dislocated his left throwing shoulder. He fully tore his rotator cuff and labrum thus ending his 2006 campaign."
Bibi Amtus Salam (died 29 September 1985) was a social worker and disciple of Mohandas Gandhi who played an active role in combating communal violence in the wake of the Partition of India and in the rehabilitation of refugees who came to India following partition.
"Bibi Amtus Salam was born the daughter of Abdul Majid Khan and belonged to a conservative but aristocratic Muslim family of Patiala. She was denied an education owing to the family's observance of ""purdah"" which she shunned in 1925."
"Bibi Amtus Salam was a close associate of Gandhi's and he saw and addressed her as his daughter. Writing to Sardar Patel in 1934, Gandhi noted that the frail Salam's ""heart is gold, but her body is brass"". Salam was an advocate of Hindu-Muslim amity and channeled her efforts to attaining that goal."
"In 1947, as riots occurred throughout India, Gandhi toured Bengal to try and calm tempers. Amtus Salam accompanied him on that trip and fasted with him for 21 days at Noakhali to bring peace there. Gandhi left her there to continue with the efforts of re-establishing communal harmony in Noakhali and later observed that ""you are the moving spirit behind whatever peace has been achieved in Noakhali. It was and still is your most significant work. Only you can sustain it. Wherever you stand, you stand in the capacity of my daughter, do you not?"""
"Amtus Salam had wanted to stay in Patiala during the Partition and its accompanying violence, as a young and single Muslim woman, to further the cause of communal harmony. She opted to stay on India even as her brothers and most of her extended family chose to move to Pakistan and their action both dismayed and angered her. Gandhi arranged for their safe passage to West Pakistan."
"In his ""India Wins Freedom"", Maulana Azad notes that Mohammed Ali Jinnah's title of Quaid-e-Azam (Great Leader) was first popularised by Gandhi who had followed Amtus Salam's suggestion that he address Jinnah thus since the Urdu press referred to him by that title. Azad writes that in following Salam's advice without considering the consequences of his letter, which was published in the newspapers, Gandhi ended up legitimizing Jinnah's image as the Quaid before Indian Muslims."
"Amtus Salam was one of the women to take part in his controversial celibacy tests.. She used to sleep and bathe with him naked with another disciple, Sushila Nayyar also serving him."
"During 1947-48, she worked on the evacuation and rehabilitation of thousands of women kidnapped during the melee that followed Partition. Here she was assisted by Lajjawati Hooja, a member of the Congress and the All-India Women's Congress and Salam made several trips to Pakistan to help with the evacuation of refugees."
"She established the Kasturba Seva Mandir and settled down in Rajpura where she worked on the resettlement of Hindu migrants from Bahawalpur. When the Government of India began constructing a township at Rajpura for the rehabilitation of refugees, she was involved in the work there along with the Hindustani Talimi Sangh who worked on the education of the children in the refugee camps."
"In the 1980s, Amtus Salam served as a permanent invitee on the All India Committee on Jail Reforms. She died in September 1985."

"On January 4, 2013, Kid Ink has announced he had signed a deal with RCA Records and premiered the lead single for his debut project titled ""Bad Ass"" featuring Wale and Meek Mill. ""Bad Ass"" was meant to be a single to tide fans over for his first full-length. RCA associate director of marketing Shani Fuller said, ""We wanted to continue along the theme of being an indie and releasing music all the time,"" ""We just really wanted to feed his fans with new music and a new look as we approached his album later in the year."" Six tracks were selected from more than 140 possible cuts for the disc and a few songs were streamed ahead of release, including ""Sunset,"" a track that Kid Ink says ""really motivated the EP.

"Upon its release, ""Almost Home"" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Rick Florino of Artistdirect said ""Ink's got an undeniable ability to infuse that sharp sensibility into even catchier fare like the R&B-tinged goodbye ""Was It Worth It"" featuring Sterling Simms, while elsewhere ""Sunset"" coasts from video game-esque keyboards into a cinematic narrative cruising Cali with no cares."" DJBooth.net said ""Kid Ink knows what he does well and has it down to a fine science; he demonstrate his ability to put together a high-energy song and his hooks are top notch, while not without its flaws, the ""Almost Home"" EP is a good jumping off point for the emcee. I see a lot of talent, but there is room for growth."""
"Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush praised it saying, ""The collection boasts six anthemic tunes that should get you charged for the summer months ahead. Standouts include the bombastic song ""Money and the Power"", the inspiring track ""Sunset"" and the laid-back remix of ""Bad Ass""."" ""The Source"" said of the EP ""What makes this it appealing though is the balance Kid Ink found in allowing listeners into the carefree, TMZ lifestyle he’s caught up in due to his fame and also capturing themes the average person can relate to-grinding everyday to achieve goals."" NMB of ""XXL"" said, ""Throughout the EP, Ink shows confidence in his rhymes and a strong command of his hooks, slinging catchy boasts alongside A$AP Ferg and French Montana on “Bossin’ Up”. Walking the line between singing and rapping on songs like “Fuck Sleep” and “Sunset” Ink’s sound has a distinctly laid-back California feel on the whole."""

"Thomas Woodbine Hinchliff (5 December 1825 – 8 May 1882) was an English mountaineer, traveller, and author, from 1875 to 1877 the seventh President of the Alpine Club."
"After qualifying as a barrister, Hinchliff abandoned the law and took to a life of travelling and writing. His books include ""Summer Months among the Alps"" (1857), ""South American Sketches"" (1863), and ""Over the Sea and Far Away"" (1876)."
"Born at Southwark, Hinchliffe was the son of Chamberlain Hinchliff (1780–1856), of Croom's Hill, Greenwich, and Lee, both then in Kent, by his marriage in 1824 to Sarah Parish, a daughter of Woodbine Parish of Bawburgh in Norfolk, the sister of Sir Woodbine Parish (1796–1882), a traveller and diplomat. Hinchliff was educated at the West Ham Grammar School, the Blackheath Proprietary School, and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1849, when he became a member of Lincoln's Inn. Three years later he proceeded MA at Cambridge and was called to the bar, but did not pursue a career as a barrister."
"In 1856, his father died."
"Hinchliff was a minor figure of the golden age of alpinism, between Wills's ascent of the Wetterhorn in 1854 and Whymper's conquest of the Matterhorn in 1865. In 1857 he was a founding member of the Alpine Club, the club meeting in his Lincoln's Inn chambers before it leased rooms of its own at 8 St Martin's Place, Trafalgar Square in 1859. John Ball was elected the club's first President, with E. S. Kennedy as Vice-President and Hinchliff as Secretary. In 1857 Hinchliffe published ""Summer Months Among the Alps: With the Ascent of Monte Rosa"", a work which some twenty years later Mark Twain referred to as ""Hinchliffe's book"". In his ""A Tramp Abroad"" (1880), Twain's narrator advises his friend Harris to read this book to learn about mountain climbing, and a description in it of a fall influences the course of Twain's story."
With Leslie Stephen and the guide Melchior Anderegg Hinchliff made an early ascent of the Wildstrubel on 11 September 1858 and the first ascent of the Alphubel on 9 August 1860.
"In 1861, Hinchliff visited South America, staying with his cousin Frank Parish, the British Consul in Buenos Aires. He spent some months on extensive travels in Brazil and Argentina, with expeditions into the Serra dos Órgãos, Teresópolis, Petrópolis, and Juiz de Fora, and these were recounted in his ""South American Sketches"" of 1863. In 1873 he set off to travel around the world with a friend named William Henry Rawson, and in two years they crossed some 35,000 miles of ocean, while spending a further six months on land. Shortly after his return to England in 1875, Hinchliff was elected President of the Alpine Club, and in 1876 he published ""Over the Sea and Far Away"", an account of his journey around the world. Describing his sad thoughts on the view of Tupungato and Aconcagua from Santiago, Hinchliff reflected that"
"Hinchliff died suddenly at Aix-les-Bains, France, on 8 May 1882. A monument to him stands on the north-west side of the Riffelalp resort in Switzerland. His obituary in the ""Alpine Journal"" said he had had ""a kind of genius for friendship"", while the ""Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society"" noted that ""the Society loses a member who, if not an explorer, was an indefatigable traveller"". In 1910 a climbing anthology called him ""one of the first to penetrate the higher solitudes of the world of ice and snow""."
"He has worked for the Victoria and Albert Museum as Director of Development from 2002–2005, as a consultant to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People from 2005-6, and the National Museums of Scotland. He also established the University of Ulster's first Development Office in Belfast in 1993 and has worked for Guinness plc (""now Diageo"") as PR and as a director in Belfast of ABSA (now Arts and Business). His client list has included the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, Edinburgh College of Art, the Vatican Museums (of which he is a UK trustee), The Rosslyn Chapel, Worth Abbey and the World Monuments Fund (GB)amongst others. The Irish Episcopal Conference retained McCaffrey as their fundraising advisor for the International Eucharistic Congress which took place in Dublin in 2012. In 2010, he was the principal fundraising advisor for the Papal visit to the United Kingdom in September 2010. £6.5 million was raised towards the cost of the Papal Visit in 7 months."
"While working for Cambridge University, he played a major part in securing the UK's largest ever charitable gift, $230M given by the Gates Foundation to Cambridge University in 1999. He was involved in the first visit to Northern Ireland by President Bill Clinton and subsequent visits by Hillary Rodham Clinton, and helped to organise the second Millennium Lecture in the White House by Professor Stephen Hawking, hosted by the Clintons."
"In May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI recognised his service to the Roman Catholic Church by bestowing the Order of St. Gregory the Great on McCaffrey, with the title Knight Commander. He first met the then Cardinal Ratzinger while a student at Cambridge in 1988, interviewing the future Pope for the student paper 'Varsity'. The interview also appeared in The Irish Times and The Universe. In 2005, McCaffrey was a commentator for Sky during the period spanning the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II and the election of Pope Benedict XVI. In May 2019 Pope Francis bestowed a promotion on McCaffrey to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Gregory, the highest rank given to a layperson, carrying with it the title 'Excellency'.

It was originally intended to be the last episode of ""Stargate SG-1"".The episode was written by executive producer Robert C. Cooper and directed by Martin Wood. The episodes received an average Nielsen household rating and a low syndication rating compared to other season six episodes. The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide."
"""Full Circle"" follows the Ascended Daniel Jackson contacting Jack O'Neill and tells him that Anubis has located The Eye of Ra, an enormously powerful weapon that can defeat the combined forces of the Goa'uld System Lords. SG-1 then travels to Abydos to create a defensive position against the Goa'uld Army, Anubis then appears over the planet and threatens to destroy it if they don't give him The Eye of Ra."
"On Abydos, Skaara speaks with the Abydonian elders about Anubis, who will attack soon. In the middle of their council, Daniel appears, telling them that they will not fight alone. At the SGC, Col. O'Neill steps on an elevator, which malfunctions in the middle of the ride. Just as he tries to use the emergency phone, Daniel appears behind him and updates him on the situation with Anubis, who plans to get the ""Eye of Ra"" from Abydos, a key (along with five others) to using a super weapon. Jack demands to know why Daniel, with all the powers of the Ascended, can't stop Anubis himself, and Daniel tries to explain again what he is and is not allowed to do."
"Jack relays Daniel's intel to General Hammond and SG-1. When they ask where he got that kind of information, he reluctantly admits to seeing Daniel, and that it isn't the first time. No one seems terribly surprised to hear it, and Teal'c mentions that he, too, has seen Daniel. Hammond approves the mission, and SG-1 goes to Abydos where they meet up with Skaara, who brings them into an underground chamber, where they hope to find the Eye. While Sam and Jonas explore the chamber, Jack asks Skaara if he's seeing anyone, and Skaara tells him that he's betrothed. In the meantime, Anubis' mothership appears out of hyperspace and several ships fly to the pyramid, which is defended by Teal'c and a number of Abydonians. When the ships and ground troops attack, Teal'c radios Jack, who, irked by Daniel's absence, starts yelling for Daniel. Daniel appears and tries to say he still can't help, but Jack pushes him. Giving in, Daniel agrees to help Sam and Jonas figure out how to find the chamber while Jack and Ska'ara go above to assist Teal'c. Daniel, Major Carter, and Jonas open the chamber, full of artifacts, but not the Eye. In the pyramid, Skaara is mortally wounded while Jack and Teal'c fight valiantly to hold their ground. They are finally forced retreat to the underground chamber where Daniel concludes that the other ascended beings are Ancients. They discover a tablet, written in the language of the Ancients, which reveals information about a lost city of the Ancients. Daniel instructs Jonas to guard it with his life, then departs."
"Carter and Jonas find another secret chamber, which Sam shoots open, revealing the Eye. Jack and Teal'c, with Skaara, appear, bedraggled from the Jaffa onslaught. Their leader, Herak, confronts SG-1, demanding the Eye. Jack simply threatens to destroy the Eye. Herak returns to the ship and informs Anubis. As Herak departs, Daniel confronts Anubis, who reveals what he truly is, a partially ascended being. In space, a fleet of Ha'tak vessels appears and Yu contacts Anubis, threatening to destroy him. Daniel, on the other hand, offers Anubis a deal: he will bring him the Eye if Anubis promises to leave Abydos unharmed forever. The Goa'uld agrees. Daniel goes to SG-1, where he hears to his surprise that Skaara has died and ascended, realizing that Oma must be present. He advises the team of Anubis' partially ascended state: stuck between the mortal world and the ascended one. Anubis was thought dead but actually ascended. The Ancients, only accepting pure of heart among their ranks, de-ascended him but not completely. The shimmering energy that hides his true face keeps his form intact. He also informs them about his deal with Anubis because he wants SG-1 to find the lost city of the Ancients before Anubis can."
"O'Neill surrenders the Eye to Herak and the Jaffa leave. On the ship, Herak gives Anubis the Eye, and Anubis powers up a large weapon. It fires on Yu's ships and destroys many of them. The few left retreat, unable to penetrate Anubis' shields, with Lord Yu, also still alive. Anubis plans to destroy Abydos but Daniel appears and demands that Anubis stop. Anubis refuses, and goads Daniel into attacking him. Daniel attempts to use his ascended powers to destroy him. However, his attack is cut short, and he is spirited away by Oma Desala. Anubis, rid of his last obstacle, fires the superweapon at the pyramid on Abydos, where Jack is, and Jack slips through the event horizon of the Abydos Stargate and back to the SGC just in time. The planet Abydos is then destroyed."
"Back at SGC, SGC personnel attempt to dial back to Abydos, but they are unable to connect, and fear that Abydos has been obliterated by Anubis's superweapon. SG-1 continue to brief General Hammond about the situation and everything that transpired on Abydos. Carter and Walter continue dialing Abydos, as Carter refuses to believe that the planet is gone. Suddenly, after dozens of attempts, the Stargate establishes a wormhole to Abydos. Hammond allows SG-1 to return to Abydos to find out what has happened. SG-1 goes through the gate and discovers Skaara and his people. Astonished and yet relieved, SG-1 ask Skaara what happened. Skaara tells them that Oma helped all the Abydonian people around the planet ascend and that the people and the Stargate are only an illusion. Skaara sadly informs them that he has not heard anything about Daniel's fate. Suddenly, all the people disappear. Relieved that the Abydonians had not perished during Anubis's attack, SG-1 then returns to Earth."
"""Full Circle"" was written with the intention of being the last ""Stargate SG-1"" television episode, since the producers were already planning to release a ""Stargate"" film. When creating the Jaffa underlings for Anubis, the producers wanted to have something different. So, according to Joseph Mallozzi, they created ""Ninja""-like Jaffa."
"""Full Circle"" was originally intended to be the last episode of ""Stargate SG-1"". It is also the last episode to feature Corin Nemec (who portrayed Jonas Quinn) as a main cast member. It is also the last episode where Alexis Cruz (who portrayed Skaara) appears. Nemec was open to continue playing Jonas Quinn after season 6 or in a feature film or a spin-off series, but a new contract was reached with Michael Shanks for Daniel to return in season 7. The role of Jonas was therefore reduced to recurring status in season 7. Nemec welcomed the producers' openness for story pitches and offered several story ideas. He wrote the mid-season-7 episode ""Fallout"" and considered pitching more stories afterwards, but he became busy with other projects. Jonas is seldom mentioned in the series after this point but after Season 10's ""Counterstrike"" stated that the Ori conquered Jonas's homeworld, ""Stargate"" producer Joseph Mallozzi said in his blog that ""in [his] mind, Jonas went underground and is still alive somewhere, resisting the Ori army."""
"= = = Scatterville, Arkansas = = ="
"Scatterville is an unincorporated community in Clay County, Arkansas, United States, approximately 2 mi (3 km) northwest of Rector. All that is left of the community today is a cemetery. The community occupied a strategic location along Crowley's Ridge and was often referred to in the reports of Union and Confederate forces vying for control of Northeast Arkansas during the American Civil War."
"Scatterville was one of the first Clay County communities, defined by having five or six families settled in a five-mile (8 km) area. Scatterville received its name because:"
". . . one man put a store at the foot of a hill, another put one at the peak, still another put one at the foot on the other side. The few stores and cabins were scattered about over the hills in a careless way."
"The first families to locate in the Scatterville community were the McNiels, Allens, Copelands, Mobleys, Snowdens, Waddells, Nortens, Mitchells, Golbys, Whites, Bradshaws, Deans, Rayburns, Whitakers, and Simmons. They were mainly subsistence farmers; however, the Allen, Knight, Simmon, Bradshaw, McNiel, and Mobley families brought a few slaves with them when they emigrated from Kentucky and Tennessee. Cotton was grown during the antebellum period, but it was only used to make clothing for personal use. A gin in Scatterville eased this task somewhat by removing the seeds from the boll. After the war, cotton was raised as a cash crop. In 1855, the first horse-powered sawmill was brought to Scatterville, and a frame school building was erected in 1859. In that same year the town welcomed Major Rayburn's new steam-powered sawmill. Other industries in Scatterville included a tanyard for shoe making and a hand-powered sorghum mill. The community remained stable until the arrival of the St. Louis and Texas Railroad about two miles (3 km) to the south in 1881. The railroad company laid out a new town named Rector, and the population of Scatterville gradually migrated to the new and booming town."
"During the American Civil War, both Union and Confederate forces operated in the area."
"On March 23, 1862, Union Col. John McNiel reported that ""There are about 1,000 men at Gainesville and Scatterville, on Crowleys Ridge. They are badly armed and scattered, in order to subsist."""
"On March 24, 1863, Union Col. John McNiel reported that ""From 400 to 700 of Jeffers and Clarks men are scattered along from Chalk Bluff to Scatterville and Gainesville."""
"On March 28, 1863, a detachment of the 1st Wisconison Cavalry Regiment passed through Scatterville in pursuit of a Confederate force under Col Preston, said to be in the area with 400 men."
"On July 21, 1863, Confederate Colonel S. G. Kitchens of the 10th Missouri Cavalry reported that a Union force of 350 was camped three miles south of Scatterville."
"On July 22, 1863, Confederate Colonel S. G. Kittchens again reported that the enemy (Union) had appeared in force in the neighborhood of Scatterville."
"There is list of incumbents engraved on an oak board above the door to the old clergy vestry on the north wall of the chancel dating back to Henry of Kyrkeby, clerk in 1252."

"Construction of ""Sheehan"" was suspended before she could be completed. On 30 August 1945, she was assigned to the Atlantic Inactive Fleet in an incomplete state.

= = = State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5 = = =
"State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5 (), officially named Measures on the Management of the Reincarnation of Living Buddhas (), is an order from the State Administration for Religious Affairs, the People's Republic of China's agency charged with keeping religion under state control. Order No. 5 states that a Reincarnation Application must be filed by all Buddhist temples in that country before they are allowed to recognize individuals as tulkus (reincarnated teachers)."
"Tibetan Buddhists believe lamas and other religious figures can consciously influence how they are reborn, and often are reborn many times so they can continue their religious pursuits. These tulkus are referred to in sources translated from Chinese as ""living Buddhas"". In 2007, the Chinese government passed a decree, based on the prior Religion Work for Some Questions《中共中央、国务院关于进一步做好宗教工作若干问题的通知》published in 1991, that reincarnated lamas must be approved by the Central Government."
"On August 3, 2007, China's State Administration for Religious Affairs issued a decree that all the reincarnations of tulkus of Tibetan Buddhism must get government approval, otherwise they are ""illegal or invalid"". The decree states, ""It is an important move to institutionalize management on reincarnation of living Buddhas. The selection of reincarnates must preserve national unity and solidarity of all ethnic groups and the selection process cannot be influenced by any group or individual from outside the country."" It also requires that temples which apply for reincarnation of a living Buddha must be ""legally-registered venues for Tibetan Buddhism activities and are capable of fostering and offering proper means of support for the living Buddha."""
"Reincarnation Applications have to be submitted to four governmental bodies for approval, specifically the religious affairs department of the provincial-level government, the provincial-level government, State Administration for Religious Affairs, and the State Council."
"The regulations are composed of 14 articles, including the principle, conditions, approval procedures, the duties and responsibilities of religious groups for reincarnation as well as punishment for those violating the regulations. They allegedly guarantee normal religious activities of Tibetan Buddhism and protect the religious belief of Tibetan Buddhism followers according to law."
"The State Administration for Religious Affairs said, ""The government only administrate religious affairs related to state and the public interests and will not interfere in the pure internal religious affairs""."
"The official Xinhua News Agency said the new rules are ""an important move to institutionalise management of reincarnation of living Buddhas"". Tulkus are indeed an important element in Tibetan Buddhism, forming a clergy of influential religious figures. It is believed they are continuously reincarnated to take up their positions anew. Often there is more than one candidate competing to be recognised as the actual reincarnation, and the authority to decide who is the true claimant carries significant power."
"The decree was implemented in response to clergy's protests about the reincarnation of living Buddhas ""against religious ritual and historical convention"", according to the Chinese government. The most high-profile dispute about living Buddhas happened between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government about the selection of the 1995 Panchen Lama, whose influence in Tibetan Buddhism is second only to the Dalai Lama. Over 1,000 living Buddhas have been reincarnated through this legal channel in Tibet and other areas in China since 1991."
"The Golden Urn was established by the Qing Qianlong Emperor to allow the Qing dynasty Emperor of China to determine the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama in case of a dispute. There are two Golden Urns issued by the Qianlong Emperor. One is enshrined in Jokhang Temple in Lhasa for choosing Dalai and Panchen Lama reincarnations, the other is in Yonghe Temple in Beijing for choosing Mongolian Jebtsundamba Khutughtu reincarnations. The 7th Panchen Lama, Palden Tenpai Nyima, used the Golden Urn for the first time in 1822 to choose the 10th Dalai Lama, Tsultrim Gyatso."
"In 1936, Golden Urn was also institutionalized in the Method of Reincarnation of Lamas《喇嘛轉世辦法》 by Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Central Government."
"Most recently, in November 1995 the Golden Urn was controversially used to name Qoigyijabu (Gyancain Norbu) as the 11th Panchen Lama. This action was approved by the Chinese government, but opposed by the Government of Tibet in Exile. In May of the same year, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso had named Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the 11th Panchen Lama."
"The Khalkha Mongol nobles' power was deliberately undermined by Qianlong when he appointed the Tibetan Ishi-damba-nima of the Lithang royal family of the eastern Tibetans as the 3rd reincarnated Jebtsundamba Khutuktu Lama instead of the Khalkha Mongol which they wanted to be appointed. The decision was first protested against by the Outer Mongol Khalkha nobles and then the Khalkhas sought to have him placed at a distance from them at Dolonnor, but Qianlong snubbed both of their requests, sending the message that he was putting an end to Outer Mongolian autonomy. The decision to make Tibet the only place where the reincarnation came from was intentional by the Qing to curtail the Mongols."
"The 10th Panchen Lama Choekyi Gyaltsen was born Gonpo Tseten on 19 February 1938 in today's Xunhua Salar Autonomous County of Qinghai, to Gonpo Tseten and Sonam Drolma. When the Ninth Panchen Lama died in 1937, two simultaneous searches for the tenth Panchen Lama produced two competing candidates, with the government in Lhasa (who had selected a boy from Xikang) and the Ninth Panchen Lama's officials (who picked Tseten) in conflict. The Republic of China government, then embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, declared its support for Tseten on 3 June 1949. Guan Jiyu, the head of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, joined Kuomintang Governor of Qinghai Ma Bufang in presiding over Tseten's enthronement on 11 June as Choekyi Gyaltsen at Kumbum Monastery. The Dalai Lama's government in Lhasa still refused to recognize Gyaltsen."
"The Panchen Lama supported China's claim of sovereignty over Tibet, and China's reform policies for Tibet. Radio Beijing broadcast the religious leader's call for Tibet to be ""liberated"" into Tibet, which created pressure on the Lhasa government to negotiate with the People's Republic. In 1951, the Panchen Lama was invited to Beijing as the Tibetan delegation was signing the 17-Point Agreement and telegramming the Dalai Lama to implement the Agreement. He was recognized by the 14th Dalai Lama when they met in 1952."
"The 7th Dalai Lama Kelzang Gyatso was born in Lithang of Eastern Tibet, in the present-day Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of present-day Sichuan province. At that time, the Dalai Lama's throne in Lhasa was occupied by Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso, who had been installed by Lha-bzang Khan as ""the real 6th Dalai Lama"" in place of Tsangyang Gyatso. Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso still held this position (though most Tibetans did not consider him to be a legitimate Dalai Lama) when a monk at Litang monastery, spontaneously channeling the Nechung Oracle, identified Kelzang Gyatso as the reincarnation of Tsangyang Gyatso. Since this presented a contradiction of Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama, it was a controversial matter and potentially dangerous to the child. Subsequently, the Tibetan leader of a delegation from Lhasa covertly confirmed that the child was Tsangyang Gyatso's reincarnation. The child was quietly taken into Litang monastery for protection and training. In 1715, the Kangxi Emperor sponsored Kelzang Gyatso's entrance into Kumbum Monastery. This entrance was marked by formal ceremonies due to a Dalai Lama and thus signified a public challenge to Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama. He was ordained by Ngawang Lobsang Tenpai Gyaltsen. His reign started when he was 12."

= = = John Baker White (Virginia) = = =
"John Baker White (August 4, 1794 – October 9, 1862) was a 19th-century American military officer, lawyer, court clerk, and civil servant in the U.S. state of Virginia."
"During the War of 1812, White enlisted in the United States Army as a soldier and was promoted to the military rank of ensign. In 1815, White was qualified as Clerk of Court for both the county and circuit courts of Hampshire County, Virginia (now West Virginia) and he continued to hold these offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861. To date, White remains the longest-serving Clerk of Court for Hampshire County since the office's creation in 1757. As a prominent lawyer and court clerk, White taught jurisprudence. Many of White's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right, including Henry Bedinger, United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark."
"During the American Civil War, White was concerned for the safety of the county's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported for safekeeping. Because of White's efforts, Hampshire County land records survived the war, while those records that remained in the courthouse were destroyed. White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest because of his Confederate sympathies. White relocated to Richmond and served in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury."
White was a member of the White political family of Virginia and West Virginia and was the son of prominent Virginia judge Robert White (1759–1831) and the father of West Virginia Attorney General Robert White (1833–1915) and Hampshire County Clerk of Court Christian Streit White (1839–1917).
"John Baker White was born on August 4, 1794, near Winchester in Frederick County, Virginia. White was the third and youngest child of prominent Virginia General Court judge Robert White (1759–1831) and his wife Arabella Baker. Among his other relations, White was a great-great-nephew of United States House Representative Alexander White (1738–1804) and a great-nephew of another United States House Representative, Francis White (1761–1826)."
"During the War of 1812, White enlisted in the United States Army as a soldier and was promoted to the military rank of ensign."
"Following his service in the War of 1812, White settled in Romney, Virginia (now West Virginia) where he was appointed as deputy clerk for both the superior court and circuit court in Hampshire County in 1814. On March 20, 1815, White was qualified as Clerk of Court for both the superior and circuit courts of Hampshire County, and he continued to hold these offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861. To date, White remains the longest-serving Clerk of Court for Hampshire County since the office's creation in 1757."
"As a prominent lawyer and court clerk, White conducted the teaching of jurisprudence in both his Clerk of Court office and residence, where he allowed his law students to reside during their studies. Many of White's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right, including: Henry Bedinger, United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark; James Dillon Armstrong, Hampshire County Circuit Court judge and son of William Armstrong; Dr. Robert White, Presbyterian minister of Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Virginia lawyers Newton Tapscott, Alfred P. White, and Philip B. Streit."
"In addition to his law instruction, White was an active member of the Romney Literary Society. When the act of incorporation for Romney Academy was amended by the Virginia General Assembly on March 25, 1839, White was appointed as a trustee along with other prominent Romney area residents David Gibson, Angus William McDonald, Daniel Mytinger, and John Kern, Jr. The 1839 act authorized any of the five appointed trustees of Romney Academy to fill vacancies on the board ""occasioned by death, resignation, removal, or legal disability"", thereby preventing future prolonged vacant trustee seats."
"By 1839, White was serving on the board of directors of the Bank of the Valley of Virginia in Romney. During the absence of the board's president, David Gibson, White served as president ""pro tempore"" from November 29 until December 13, 1839. The Wirgman Building housed the Bank of the Valley of Virginia during White's tenure on its board of directors."
"Prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War, White was in support of preserving the United States. In the United States presidential election of 1860, White supported Constitutional Union Party presidential candidate John Bell and his running mate Edward Everett. The Constitutional Union Party was formed by former Whig Party members seeking to avoid secessionism over the issue of slavery. In 1861, White voted for Union candidates to serve as delegates from Hampshire County in the Virginia secession convention, one of which was his son-in-law Colonel E. M. Armstrong."
"White's national loyalties shifted following the Battle of Fort Sumter and other Union encroachments into the Confederate States of America, after which White supported the defense of Virginia's states' rights and of the United States Constitution. White's eldest three sons out of four joined the Confederate States Army, and White became active in enlisting and arousing support within Hampshire County for the Confederate States cause. Because of his Confederate sympathies, White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest."
"No court proceedings convened in the county between 1861 and 1864, and the Hampshire County Courthouse was utilized as a stable by Union soldiers stationed in Romney during the war. In 1861, Union Army forces under the command of Lew Wallace occupied Romney following a minor battle there during which White ""kept close watch over"" the county's record books so that they would not be destroyed by Union forces. Later in the fall of 1861, Union Army forces under the command of Benjamin Franklin Kelley advanced upon Romney."
"Upon learning of this, White was again concerned for the safety of the county's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported to Winchester for safekeeping. White selected for transport only the bound volumes of records which included ""deed books, wills, and settlements of estates"" and kept the unbound paper records in the courthouse, thus separating them so that the entirety of the county's records could not be destroyed by Union forces. White likely chose to transport the bound volumes of records, as the loose paper records would have been more cumbersome to keep together."
"In 1863, when Winchester was no longer a safe location for the storage of Hampshire County's records and they again risked destruction by Union Army forces, White's son Captain Christian Streit White took responsibility for the records and transferred them to Front Royal. When Front Royal became endangered by advancing Union Army forces, Captain White had the records moved to Luray Caverns where they remained for several months. In the fall of 1864, the county's record books were rescued by Captain White and his company as Union Army troops were in the process of destroying them. Captain White's company loaded about 150 record books into a wagon, and they were taken to North Carolina where they remained safely for the duration of the war. Hampshire County's land records survived and were returned to the courthouse following the conclusion of the American Civil War, likely by a soldier returning to the area from North Carolina. Had White not separated the records and sent the bound volumes away for safekeeping, Hampshire County would have lost all its records during the course of the war, as those that remained in the courthouse were destroyed."
"On the July 3 ""SmackDown"", Ziggler defeated Alex Riley to qualify for a spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match. On July 13, Ziggler, Zack Ryder and Justin Roberts were involved in a car accident in San Diego while driving from Comic-Con; none of them suffered severe injuries. Two days later at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Ziggler won the Money in the Bank ladder match to guarantee him the opportunity to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at a time of his choosing within the next year. Later that night, Ziggler attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus after Alberto Del Rio attacked him after their match, but Del Rio stopped Ziggler from cashing in. On the following episode of ""SmackDown"", Ziggler again attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus following a tag team match with Alberto Del Rio, but was laid out by Rey Mysterio and Sheamus before he could do so. During this time, Ziggler began a feud with Chris Jericho after claiming he had lost his touch, which resulted in Jericho attacking him on two occasions, and defeating him in a singles match at SummerSlam. The night after SummerSlam, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch; as a result Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated. Following this, Ziggler began feuding with Randy Orton on ""SmackDown"" four days later, after Orton hit him with an ""RKO"" when Ziggler tried to cash his Money in the Bank contract on a vulnerable Sheamus. The following week on ""SmackDown"", Ziggler faced Orton in a match that was won by Orton, Ziggler defeated him in a rematch on ""Raw"" by pinning him while holding his tights. Ziggler faced Orton again at Night of Champions where he lost again, ending the feud. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Ziggler captained the traditional 5-on-5 elimination tag team match opposite Mick Foley and won the match by last pinning Orton, making him the sole survivor of the match."
"Ziggler then began feuding with John Cena after he sided with Vickie Guerrero to help defame Cena and AJ Lee by alleging they had a romantic relationship. On December 16 at , Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank briefcase in a ladder match after AJ interfered and turned on Cena. The following night on ""Raw"", while trying to diffuse an argument between Vickie and AJ, AJ unexpectedly kissed Ziggler, leaving him confused. Ziggler then attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase on Big Show after Show was assaulted by Sheamus, but he was attacked by Cena before the match could start. Later, Ziggler teamed with AJ to face Cena and Vickie Guerrero, however, the match ended in a disqualification after the debuting Big E Langston attacked Cena, also starting an on-screen relationship between Dolph and AJ. Ziggler ended 2012 having wrestled the second most TV/PPV matches that year with 90; however, he had the most TV/PPV losses with 57. Ziggler ended his feud with Cena after losing to him on the January 7, 2013, episode of ""Raw"", in a singles match and in steel cage match the following week, despite outside interference from AJ and Langston in both matches. On the January 21 episode of ""Raw"", Ziggler won a Beat the Clock Challenge to earn the right to choose what number he can enter in the Royal Rumble match, first or second. Six days later at the Royal Rumble, Ziggler entered at number one and lasted nearly fifty minutes before being eliminated by Sheamus. During the match, Ziggler resumed his feud with the returning Chris Jericho whom Ziggler managed to eliminate.

He later started mocking, week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage.

However, after mocking The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event, Ziggler seemed to enter with his usual music and Titantron graphics, but the music was scratched off and the graphics turned off, and he simply entered with no music or Titantron (like a wrestler in the 1980s or prior).

A week later, general manager Daniel Bryan said that Ziggler was nowhere to be found and had indeed vacated his title, so that a tournament to crown a new champion would be held (which was won by Bobby Roode)."
"Ziggler returned at the Royal Rumble on January 28, 2018, as the surprise #30 entrant in the men's Royal Rumble match. After eliminating Goldust, however, Ziggler was eliminated by Finn Bálor.
