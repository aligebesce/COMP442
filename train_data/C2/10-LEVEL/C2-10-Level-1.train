"John said ` how ripping , ' but decided to have tea first ."
"He asked if there were many pirates on the island just now , and Peter said he had never known so many ."
` Who is captain now ? '
"` Hook , ' answered Peter ; and his face became very stern as he said that hated word ."
` Jas .
Hook ? '
` Ay . '
"Then indeed Michael began to cry , and even John could speak in gulps only , for they knew Hook 's reputation ."
"` He was Blackbeard 's bo ` sun , ' John whispered huskily ."
` He is the worst of them all .
He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid . '
"` That 's him , ' said Peter ."
` What is he like ?
Is he big ? '
` He is not so big as he was . '
` How do you mean ? ' '
I cut off a bit of him . '
` You ! '
"` Yes , me , ' said Peter sharply . '"
I was n't meaning to be disrespectful . '
"` Oh , all right ' ` But , I say , what bit ? '"
` His right hand . '
` Then he ca n't fight now ? '
"` Oh , ca n't he just ! '"
` Left-hander ? '
"` He has an iron hook instead of a right hand , and he claws with it . '"
` Claws ! ' '
"I say , John , ' said Peter ."
` Yes . '
"` Say , `` Ay , ay , sir . '' '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
"` There is one thing , ' Peter continued , ` that every boy who serves under me has to promise , and so must you . '"
`` Oh ! ''
"said he , quite loud , and offering his hand ."
`` I see .
You are our new cabin-boy ; pleased I am to see you . ''
And he took my hand in his large firm grasp .
Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door .
"It was close by him , and he was out in the street in a moment ."
"But his hurry had attracted my notice , and I recognized him at glance ."
"It was the tallow-faced man , wanting two fingers , who had come first to the Admiral Benbow ."
"`` Oh , '' I cried , `` stop him !"
It 's Black Dog ! ''
"`` I do n't care two coppers who he is , '' cried Silver ."
`` But he has n't paid his score .
"Harry , run and catch him . ''"
One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit .
"`` If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score , '' cried Silver ; and then , relinquishing my hand , `` Who did you say he was ? ''"
he asked .
`` Black what ? ''
"`` Dog , sir , '' said I. `` Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers ?"
He was one of them . ''
`` So ? ''
cried Silver .
`` In my house !
"Ben , run and help Harry ."
"One of those swabs , was he ?"
"Was that you drinking with him , Morgan ?"
Step up here . ''
"The man whom he called Morgan -- an old , grey-haired , mahogany-faced sailor -- came forward pretty sheepishly , rolling his quid ."
"`` Now , Morgan , '' said Long John very sternly , `` you never clapped your eyes on that Black -- Black Dog before , did you , now ? ''"
"`` Not I , sir , '' said Morgan with a salute ."
"`` You did n't know his name , did you ? ''"
"`` No , sir . ''"
"he cried , shrinking ."
"`` I will turn up the light , '' she said , `` and then you can see for yourself . ''"
"For almost the only time in his life that I know of , Peter was afraid ."
"`` Do n't turn up the light , '' he cried ."
She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy .
"She was not a little girl heart-broken about him ; she was a grown woman smiling at it all , but they were wet eyed smiles ."
"Then she turned up the light , and Peter saw ."
He gave a cry of pain ; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply .
`` What is it ? ''
he cried again .
She had to tell him .
"`` I am old , Peter ."
I am ever so much more than twenty .
I grew up long ago . ''
`` You promised not to ! ''
`` I could n't help it .
"I am a married woman , Peter . ''"
"`` No , you 're not . ''"
"`` Yes , and the little girl in the bed is my baby . ''"
"`` No , she 's not . ''"
But he supposed she was ; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised .
Of course he did not strike .
"He sat down on the floor instead and sobbed ; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him , though she could have done it so easily once ."
"She was only a woman now , and she ran out of the room to try to think ."
"Peter continued to cry , and soon his sobs woke Jane ."
"She sat up in bed , and was interested at once ."
"`` Boy , '' she said , `` why are you crying ? ''"
"Peter rose and bowed to her , and she bowed to him from the bed ."
"`` Hullo , '' he said ."
"`` Hullo , '' said Jane ."
"`` My name is Peter Pan , '' he told her ."
"`` Yes , I know . ''"
"And , by the way I feel , I fancy I 'll be stretched out here another week before I 'll be able to use my pins ."
Who are these Olivers anyhow ?
The old woman would n't talk about the family . ''
`` Do n't you know them ? ''
asked Alan in astonishment .
`` Is n't your name Harmon ? ''
"`` That 's right -- Harmon -- Alfred Harmon , first mate of the schooner , Annie M. '' `` Alfred !"
I thought your name was Frank ! ''
`` Frank was my twin brother .
We were so much alike our own mammy could n't tell us apart .
Did you know Frank ? ''
`` No .
This family did .
Miss Oliver thought you were Frank when she saw you . ''
`` I do n't feel much like myself but I 'm not Frank anyway .
"He 's dead , poor chap -- got shot in a spat with Chinese pirates three years ago . ''"
`` Dead !
"Man , are you speaking the truth ?"
Are you certain ? ''
`` Pop sure .
His mate told me the whole story .
"Say , preacher , what 's the matter ?"
You look as if you were going to keel over . ''
Alan hastily drank a glass of water .
`` I -- I am all right now .
I have n't been feeling well of late . ''
`` Guess you did n't do yourself any good going out into that freezing water and dragging me in . ''
"`` I shall thank God every day of my life that I did do it , '' said Alan gravely , new light in his eyes , as Emily entered the room ."
"`` Miss Oliver , when will the Captain and Lynde be back ? ''"
`` They said they would be home by four . ''
She looked at Alan curiously .
"`` I will go and meet her , '' he said quickly ."
`` Would ye fyle your hands wi ' crime ? ''
`` Hoot ! ''
"said Alan , `` they 're baith crime , whatever !"
"And the killing 's easier , and quicker , and surer ."
"Keeping the lad 'll be a fashious * job , a fashious , kittle business . ''"
* Troublesome .
"`` I 'll have him keepit , though , '' returned my uncle ."
`` I never had naething to do with onything morally wrong ; and I 'm no gaun to begin to pleasure a wild Hielandman . ''
"`` Ye 're unco scrupulous , '' sneered Alan ."
"`` I 'm a man o ' principle , '' said Ebenezer , simply ; `` and if I have to pay for it , I 'll have to pay for it ."
"And besides , '' says he , `` ye forget the lad 's my brother 's son . ''"
"`` Well , well , '' said Alan , `` and now about the price ."
It 's no very easy for me to set a name upon it ; I would first have to ken some small matters .
"I would have to ken , for instance , what ye gave Hoseason at the first off-go ? ''"
`` Hoseason ! ''
"cries my uncle , struck aback ."
`` What for ? ''
"`` For kidnapping David , '' says Alan ."
"`` It 's a lee , it 's a black lee ! ''"
cried my uncle .
`` He was never kidnapped .
He leed in his throat that tauld ye that .
Kidnapped ?
He never was ! ''
"`` That 's no fault of mine nor yet of yours , '' said Alan ; `` nor yet of Hoseason 's , if he 's a man that can be trusted . ''"
`` What do ye mean ? ''
cried Ebenezer .
`` Did Hoseason tell ye ? ''
"`` Why , ye donnered auld runt , how else would I ken ? ''"
cried Alan .
`` Hoseason and me are partners ; we gang shares ; so ye can see for yoursel ' what good ye can do leeing .
And I must plainly say ye drove a fool 's bargain when ye let a man like the sailor-man so far forward in your private matters .
` To tell the other boys . '
"` Do n't go , Peter , ' she entreated , ' I know such lots of stories . '"
"Those were her precise words , so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him ."
"He came back , and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her , but did not ."
"` Oh , the stories I could tell to the boys ! '"
"she cried , and then Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window ."
` Let me go ! '
she ordered him .
"` Wendy , do come with me and tell the other boys . '"
"Of course she was very pleased to be asked , but she said , ` Oh dear , I ca n't ."
Think of mummy !
"Besides , I ca n't fly . '"
` I 'll teach you . '
"` Oh , how lovely to fly . '"
"` I 'll teach you how to jump on the wind 's back , and then away we go . '"
` Oo ! '
she exclaimed rapturously .
"` Wendy , Wendy , when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars . '"
` Oo ! '
"` And , Wendy , there are mermaids . '"
` Mermaids !
With tails ? '
` Such long tails . '
"` Oh , ' cried Wendy , ` to see a mermaid ! '"
He had become frightfully cunning .
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` how we should all respect you . '"
She was wriggling her body in distress .
It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor .
But he had no pity for her .
"` Wendy , ' he said , the sly one , ` you could tuck us in at night . '"
` Oo ! '
` None of us has ever been tucked in at night . '
`` What kind of a Christmas did you have ? ''
`` We did n't have any . ''
`` No Christmas ! ''
"said Amy , quite overcome ."
"`` Oh , well , I suppose you are going to have a good time on New Year 's instead . ''"
Bertie shook his head .
"`` No 'm , I guess not ."
We never have it different from other times . ''
Amy was silent from sheer amazement .
"Edith understood better , and she changed the subject ."
"`` Have you any brothers or sisters , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No 'm , '' returned Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I guess there 's enough of us without that .
I must be going now .
I 'm very much obliged to you . ''
"Edith slipped from the room as he spoke , and met him again at the door ."
She held out a pair of warm-looking mittens .
"`` These are for William John , '' she said simply , `` so that you can have your own ."
They are a pair of mine which are too big for me .
I know Papa will say it is all right .
"Goodbye , Bertie . ''"
"`` Goodbye -- and thank you , '' stammered Bertie , as the door closed ."
Then he hastened home to William John .
That evening Doctor Forbes noticed a peculiarly thoughtful look on Edith 's face as she sat gazing into the glowing coal fire after dinner .
He laid his hand on her dark curls inquiringly .
`` What are you musing over ? ''
"`` There was a little boy here today , '' began Edith ."
"`` Oh , such a dear little boy , '' broke in Amy eagerly from the corner , where she was playing with her kitten ."
`` His name was Bertie Ross .
"He brought up the parcels , and we asked him in to get warm ."
"He had no mittens , and his hands were almost frozen ."
"And , oh , Papa , just think !"
I did but take a shot of the eye at Master Matcham . ''
"`` Sirrah , no more words , '' said Dick ."
`` Bend me your back . ''
"They were by that time at the mouth of the creek , and the view opened up and down the river ."
Everywhere it was enclosed with islands .
"Clay banks were falling in , willows nodding , reeds waving , martens dipping and piping ."
There was no sign of man in the labyrinth of waters .
"`` My master , '' said the ferryman , keeping the boat steady with one oar , `` I have a shrew guess that John-a-Fenne is on the island ."
He bears me a black grudge to all Sir Daniel 's .
How if I turned me up stream and landed you an arrow-flight above the path ?
Ye were best not meddle with John Fenne . ''
"`` How , then ?"
is he of this company ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Nay , mum is the word , '' said Hugh ."
"`` But I would go up water , Dick ."
How if Master Matcham came by an arrow ? ''
and he laughed again .
"`` Be it so , Hugh , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Look ye , then , '' pursued Hugh ."
"`` Sith it shall so be , unsling me your cross-bow -- so : now make it ready -- good ; place me a quarrel ."
"Ay , keep it so , and look upon me grimly . ''"
`` What meaneth this ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Why , my master , if I steal you across , it must be under force or fear , '' replied the ferryman ; `` for else , if John Fenne got wind of it , he were like to prove my most distressful neighbour . ''"
`` Do these churls ride so roughly ? ''
Dick inquired .
`` Do they command Sir Daniel 's own ferry ? ''
"`` Nay , '' whispered the ferryman , winking ."
`` Mark me !
Sir Daniel shall down .
His time is out .
said I. `` Is that to remind me you have been beaten on both sides ? ''
The air stopped on Alan 's lips .
`` David ! ''
said he .
"`` But it 's time these manners ceased , '' I continued ; `` and I mean you shall henceforth speak civilly of my King and my good friends the Campbells . ''"
`` I am a Stewart -- '' began Alan .
`` O ! ''
"says I , `` I ken ye bear a king 's name ."
"But you are to remember , since I have been in the Highlands , I have seen a good many of those that bear it ; and the best I can say of them is this , that they would be none the worse of washing . ''"
`` Do you know that you insult me ? ''
"said Alan , very low ."
"`` I am sorry for that , '' said I , `` for I am not done ; and if you distaste the sermon , I doubt the pirliecue * will please you as little ."
You have been chased in the field by the grown men of my party ; it seems a poor kind of pleasure to out-face a boy .
Both the Campbells and the Whigs have beaten you ; you have run before them like a hare .
It behoves you to speak of them as of your betters . ''
* A second sermon .
"Alan stood quite still , the tails of his great-coat clapping behind him in the wind ."
"`` This is a pity , '' he said at last ."
`` There are things said that can not be passed over . ''
"`` I never asked you to , '' said I. `` I am as ready as yourself . ''"
`` Ready ? ''
said he .
"`` Ready , '' I repeated ."
`` I am no blower and boaster like some that I could name .
Come on ! ''
"And drawing my sword , I fell on guard as Alan himself had taught me ."
`` David ! ''
he cried .
`` Are ye daft ?
"I cannae draw upon ye , David ."
It 's fair murder . ''
"`` That was your look-out when you insulted me , '' said I. `` It 's the truth ! ''"
"`` Nay , he would have me go !"
"If Sir Daniel slew him , when the hour comes this hand shall slay Sir Daniel ; but neither him nor his will I desert in peril ."
"And for mine oath , good Jack , ye shall absolve me of it here ."
"For the lives ' sake of many men that hurt you not , and for mine honour , ye shall set me free . ''"
"`` I , Dick ?"
Never ! ''
returned Matcham .
"`` An ye leave me , y ' are forsworn , and so I shall declare it . ''"
"`` My blood heats , '' said Dick ."
`` Give me the windac !
Give it me ! ''
"`` I 'll not , '' said Matcham ."
`` I 'll save you in your teeth . ''
`` Not ? ''
cried Dick .
`` I 'll make you ! ''
"`` Try it , '' said the other ."
"They stood , looking in each other 's eyes , each ready for a spring ."
"Then Dick leaped ; and though Matcham turned instantly and fled , in two bounds he was over-taken , the windac was twisted from his grasp , he was thrown roughly to the ground , and Dick stood across him , flushed and menacing , with doubled fist ."
"Matcham lay where he had fallen , with his face in the grass , not thinking of resistance ."
Dick bent his bow .
`` I 'll teach you ! ''
"he cried , fiercely ."
"`` Oath or no oath , ye may go hang for me ! ''"
And he turned and began to run .
"Matcham was on his feet at once , and began running after him ."
`` What d'ye want ? ''
"cried Dick , stopping ."
`` What make ye after me ?
Stand off ! ''
"`` Will follow an I please , '' said Matcham ."
`` This wood is free to me . ''
"I shall be sick , you know , ' Mr. Darling said threateningly ."
"` Come on , father , ' said John ."
"` Hold your tongue , John , ' his father rapped out ."
Wendy was quite puzzled . '
"I thought you took it quite easily , father . '"
"` That is not the point , ' he retorted ."
"` The point is , that there is more in my glass than in Michael 's spoon . '"
His proud heart was nearly bursting .
` And it is n't fair ; I would say it though it were with my last breath ; it is n't fair . '
"` Father , I am waiting , ' said Michael coldly ."
` It 's all very well to say you are waiting ; so am I waiting . '
` Father 's a cowardy custard . '
` So are you a cowardy custard . '
` I 'm not frightened . '
` Neither am I frightened . '
"` Well , then , take it . '"
"` Well , then , you take it . '"
Wendy had a splendid idea .
` Why not both take it at the same time ? '
"` Certainly , ' said Mr. Darling ."
"` Are you ready , Michael ? '"
"Wendy gave the words , one , two , three , and Michael took his medicine , but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back ."
"There was a yell of rage from Michael , and ' O father ! '"
Wendy exclaimed .
` What do you mean by `` O father '' ? '
Mr. Darling demanded .
"` Stop that row , Michael ."
"I meant to take mine , but I -- I missed it . '"
"It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him , just as if they did not admire him ."
"` Look here , all of you , ' he said entreatingly , as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom , ' I have just thought of a splendid joke ."
"I shall pour my medicine into Nana 's bowl , and she will drink it , thinking it is milk ! '"
"It was the colour of milk ; but the children did not have their father 's sense of humour , and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into Nana 's bowl ."
What would ye ?
"Ye run no great peril , man ; and these are in the way of death ."
Death ! ''
he added .
`` Think of it !
What a murrain do ye keep me here for ?
Give me the windac .
Saint George !
shall they all die ? ''
"`` Richard Shelton , '' said Matcham , looking him squarely in the face , `` would ye , then , join party with Sir Daniel ?"
Have ye not ears ?
"Heard ye not this Ellis , what he said ?"
or have ye no heart for your own kindly blood and the father that men slew ?
"` Harry Shelton , ' he said ; and Sir Harry Shelton was your father , as the sun shines in heaven . ''"
`` What would ye ? ''
Dick cried again .
`` Would ye have me credit thieves ? ''
"`` Nay , I have heard it before now , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` The fame goeth currently , it was Sir Daniel slew him ."
He slew him under oath ; in his own house he shed the innocent blood .
Heaven wearies for the avenging o n't ; and you -- the man 's son -- ye go about to comfort and defend the murderer ! ''
"`` Jack , '' cried the lad `` I know not ."
It may be ; what know I ?
"But , see here : This man hath bred me up and fostered me , and his men I have hunted with and played among ; and to leave them in the hour of peril -- O , man , if I did that , I were stark dead to honour !"
"Nay , Jack , ye would not ask it ; ye would not wish me to be base . ''"
"`` But your father , Dick ? ''"
"said Matcham , somewhat wavering ."
`` Your father ?
and your oath to me ?
Ye took the saints to witness . ''
`` My father ? ''
cried Shelton .
`` There now ! ''
he said in tearless despair .
`` That 's just what I expected .
"I did s ` pose if I could n't go you would , and tell me about it ."
You 're mean as mean can be . ''
"`` Come now , William John , do n't be so cross ."
"I thought you 'd rather have me home , but I 'll go , if you want me to . ''"
"`` Honest , now ? ''"
"`` Yes , honest ."
I 'll go anywhere to please you .
I must be off to the store now .
Goodbye . ''
"Thus committed , Bertie took his courage in both hands and went ."
The next evening at dusk found him standing at Doctor Forbes 's door with a very violently beating heart .
He was carefully dressed in his well-worn best suit and a neat white collar .
The frosty air had crimsoned his cheeks and his hair was curling round his face .
"Caroline opened the door and showed him into the parlour , where Edith and Amy were eagerly awaiting him ."
"`` Happy New Year , Bertie , '' cried Amy ."
"`` And -- but , why , where is William John ? ''"
"`` He could n't come , '' answered Bertie anxiously -- he was afraid he might not be welcome without William John ."
`` He 's real sick .
He caught cold and has to stay in bed ; but he wanted to come awful bad . ''
"`` Oh , dear me !"
Poor William John ! ''
said Amy in a disappointed tone .
But all further remarks were cut short by the entrance of Doctor Forbes .
`` How do you do ? ''
"he said , giving Bertie 's hand a hearty shake ."
`` But where is the other little fellow my girls were expecting ? ''
Bertie patiently reaccounted for William John 's non-appearance .
"`` It 's a bad time for colds , '' said the doctor , sitting down and attacking the fire ."
"`` I dare say , though , you have to run so fast these days that a cold could n't catch you ."
`` Who -- what was she ?
Did I dream her ?
Was she a phantom of delight ?
"No , no , phantoms do n't milk cows ."
She was flesh and blood .
No chilly nymph exhaling from the mists of the marsh could have given a kiss like that . ''
"`` Mollie has come to stay the rest of the summer with me , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` I hope to goodness my tribulations with hired girls is over at last .
They have made a wreck of me . ''
Murray rapidly reflected .
"This development , he decided , released him from his promise to tell no tales ."
"`` I met a young lady down in the pond pasture this morning , '' he said deliberately ."
`` I talked with her for a few minutes .
I supposed her to be your niece .
Who was she ? ''
"`` Oh , that was Miss Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` What ? ''
said Murray again .
"`` Mannering -- Dora Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer loudly , wondering if Mr. Murray were losing his hearing ."
`` She came here last night just to see me .
I have n't seen her since she was a child of twelve .
I used to be her nurse before I was married .
I was that proud to think she thought it worth her while to look me up .
"And , mind you , this morning , when she found me crippled with headache and not able to do a hand 's turn , that girl , Mr. Murray , went and milked seven cows '' -- `` only four , '' murmured Murray , but Mrs. Palmer did not hear him -- `` for me ."
Could n't prevent her .
"She said she had learned to milk for fun one summer when she was in the country , and she did it ."
And then she got breakfast for the men -- Mollie did n't come till the ten o'clock train .
Miss Mannering is as capable as if she had been riz on a farm . ''
`` Where is she now ? ''
demanded Murray .
"`` Oh , she 's gone . ''"
`` What ? ''
They would all have been glad to follow if he had done this .
But there was the arrow .
He took it from her heart and faced his band .
` Whose arrow ? '
he demanded sternly .
"` Mine , Peter , ' said Tootles on his knees ."
"` Oh , dastard hand , ' Peter said , and he raised the arrow to use it as a dagger ."
Tootles did not flinch .
He bared his breast .
"` Strike , Peter , ' he said firmly , ` strike true . '"
"Twice did Peter raise the arrow , and twice did his hand fall . '"
"I can not strike , ' he said with awe , ` there is something stays my hand . '"
"All looked at him in wonder , save Nibs , who fortunately looked at Wendy ."
"` It is she , ' he cried , ` the Wendy lady ; see , her arm . '"
"Wonderful to relate , Wendy had raised her arm ."
Nibs bent over her and listened reverently . '
"I think she said `` Poor Tootles , '' ' he whispered ."
"` She lives , ' Peter said briefly ."
"Slightly cried instantly , ` The Wendy lady lives . '"
Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button .
You remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck .
"` See , ' he said , ` the arrow struck against this ."
It is the kiss I gave her .
It has saved her life . ' '
"I remember kisses , ' Slightly interposed quickly , ` let me see it ."
"Ay , that 's a kiss . '"
Peter did not hear him .
"He was begging Wendy to get better quickly , so that he could show her the mermaids ."
"Of course she could not answer yet , being still in a frightful faint ; but from overhead came a wailing note ."
"` Listen to Tink , ' said Curly , ` she is crying because the Wendy lives . '"
"Then they had to tell Peter of Tink 's crime , and almost never had they seen him look so stern ."
"` Listen , Tinker Bell , ' he cried ; ' I am your friend no more ."
It is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly . ''
`` What is gay and innocent and heartless ?
I do wish I were gay and innocent and heartless . ''
Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something .
"`` I do believe , '' she says , `` that it is this nursery . ''"
"`` I do believe it is , '' says Jane ."
`` Go on . ''
They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in looking for his shadow .
"`` The foolish fellow , '' says Wendy , `` tried to stick it on with soap , and when he could not he cried , and that woke me , and I sewed it on for him . ''"
"`` You have missed a bit , '' interrupts Jane , who now knows the story better than her mother ."
"`` When you saw him sitting on the floor crying , what did you say ? ''"
"`` I sat up in bed and I said , ` Boy , why are you crying ? ' ''"
"`` Yes , that was it , '' says Jane , with a big breath ."
"`` And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid 's lagoon , and the home under the ground , and the little house . ''"
`` Yes !
which did you like best of all ? ''
`` I think I liked the home under the ground best of all . ''
"`` Yes , so do I ."
What was the last thing Peter ever said to you ? ''
"`` The last thing he ever said to me was , ` Just always be waiting for me , and then some night you will hear me crowing . ' ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But , alas , he forgot all about me , '' Wendy said it with a smile ."
She was as grown up as that .
`` What did his crow sound like ? ''
Jane asked one evening .
"`` It was like this , '' Wendy said , trying to imitate Peter 's crow ."
"`` No , it was n't , '' Jane said gravely , `` it was like this ; '' and she did it ever so much better than her mother ."
Wendy was a little startled .
"`` My darling , how can you know ? ''"
"`` I often hear it when I am sleeping , '' Jane said ."
"`` Ah yes , many girls hear it when they are sleeping , but I was the only one who heard it awake . ''"
"`` Lucky you , '' said Jane ."
"I thought you would want it back , ' he said a little bitterly , and offered to return her the thimble ."
"` Oh dear , ' said the nice Wendy , ' I do n't mean a kiss , I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
` It 's like this . '
She kissed him .
` Funny ! '
said Peter gravely .
` Now shall I give you a thimble ? '
"` If you wish to , ' said Wendy , keeping her head erect this time ."
"Peter thimbled her , and almost immediately she screeched ."
"` What is it , Wendy ? '"
` It was exactly as if some one were pulling my hair . '
` That must have been Tink .
I never knew her so naughty before . '
"And indeed Tink was darting about again , using offensive language ."
"` She says she will do that to you , Wendy , every time I give you a thimble . '"
` But why ? '
"` Why , Tink ? '"
"Again Tink replied , ` You silly ass . '"
"Peter could not understand why , but Wendy understood ; and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories ."
` You see I do n't know any stories .
None of the lost boys know any stories . '
"` How perfectly awful , ' Wendy said ."
"` Do you know , ' Peter asked , ` why swallows build in the eaves of houses ?"
It is to listen to the stories .
"O Wendy , your mother was telling you such a lovely story . '"
` Which story was it ? '
` About the prince who could n't find the lady who wore the glass slipper . '
"` Peter , ' said Wendy excitedly , ` that was Cinderella , and he found her , and they lived happy ever after . '"
"Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor , where they had been sitting , and hurried to the window ."
` Where are you going ? '
she cried with misgiving .
"`` By the powers , Tom Morgan , it 's as good for you ! ''"
exclaimed the landlord .
"`` If you had been mixed up with the like of that , you would never have put another foot in my house , you may lay to that ."
And what was he saying to you ? ''
"`` I do n't rightly know , sir , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Do you call that a head on your shoulders , or a blessed dead-eye ? ''"
cried Long John .
"`` Do n't rightly know , do n't you !"
"Perhaps you do n't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to , perhaps ?"
"Come , now , what was he jawing -- v ` yages , cap'n s , ships ?"
Pipe up !
What was it ? ''
"`` We was a-talkin ' of keel-hauling , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Keel-hauling , was you ?"
"And a mighty suitable thing , too , and you may lay to that ."
"Get back to your place for a lubber , Tom . ''"
"And then , as Morgan rolled back to his seat , Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering , as I thought , `` He 's quite an honest man , Tom Morgan , on ' y stupid ."
"And now , '' he ran on again , aloud , `` let 's see -- Black Dog ?"
"No , I do n't know the name , not I ."
"Yet I kind of think I 've -- yes , I 've seen the swab ."
"He used to come here with a blind beggar , he used . ''"
"`` That he did , you may be sure , '' said I. `` I knew that blind man too ."
His name was Pew . ''
`` It was ! ''
"cried Silver , now quite excited ."
`` Pew !
That were his name for certain .
"Ah , he looked a shark , he did !"
"If we run down this Black Dog , now , there 'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney !"
Ben 's a good runner ; few seamen run better than Ben .
"He should run him down , hand over hand , by the powers !"
"He talked o ' keel-hauling , did he ?"
` Is Wendy asleep ? '
they asked .
` Yes . '
"` John , ' Michael proposed , ` let us wake her and get her to make supper for us ' ; but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house ."
` Look at them ! '
he cried .
"` Curly , ' said Peter in his most captainy voice , ` see that these boys help in the building of the house . '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
` Build a house ? '
exclaimed John .
"` For the Wendy , ' said Curly ."
` For Wendy ? '
"John said , aghast ."
"` Why , she is only a girl . '"
"` That , ' explained Curly , ` is why we are her servants . '"
` You ?
Wendy 's servants ! '
"` Yes , ' said Peter , ` and you also ."
Away with them . '
The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry .
"` Chairs and a fender first , ' Peter ordered ."
` Then we shall build the house round them . '
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is how a house is built ; it all comes back to me . '"
Peter thought of everything .
"` Slightly , ' he ordered , ` fetch a doctor . '"
"` Ay , ay , ' said Slightly at once , and disappeared , scratching his head ."
"But he knew Peter must be obeyed , and he returned in a moment , wearing John 's hat and looking solemn ."
"` Please , sir , ' said Peter , going to him , ` are you a doctor ? '"
"The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe , while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing ."
"This sometimes troubled them , as when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners ."
If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles .
"` Yes , my little man , ' anxiously replied Slightly , who had chapped knuckles ."
"`` Fellow , '' he asked , `` were ye here when this house was taken ? ''"
"`` Let be , '' said the archer ."
`` A murrain !
"let be , or I strike . ''"
"`` Hark ye , '' returned Richard , `` two can play at that ."
Stand and be plain . ''
"But the man , flushed with drink and battle , struck Dick upon the shoulder with one hand , while with the other he twitched away his garment ."
Thereupon the full wrath of the young leader burst from his control .
"He seized the fellow in his strong embrace , and crushed him on the plates of his mailed bosom like a child ; then , holding him at arm 's length , he bid him speak as he valued life ."
`` I pray you mercy ! ''
gasped the archer .
`` An I had thought ye were so angry I would ` a ' been charier of crossing you .
I was here indeed . ''
`` Know ye Sir Daniel ? ''
pursued Dick .
"`` Well do I know him , '' returned the man ."
`` Was he in the mansion ? ''
"`` Ay , sir , he was , '' answered the archer ; `` but even as we entered by the yard gate he rode forth by the garden . ''"
`` Alone ? ''
cried Dick .
"`` He may ` a ' had a score of lances with him , '' said the man ."
`` Lances !
"No women , then ? ''"
asked Shelton .
"`` Troth , I saw not , '' said the archer ."
"`` But there were none in the house , if that be your quest . ''"
"`` I thank you , '' said Dick ."
`` Here is a piece for your pains . ''
"But groping in his wallet , Dick found nothing ."
"`` Inquire for me to-morrow , '' he added -- `` Richard Shelt -- Sir Richard Shelton , '' he corrected , `` and I will see you handsomely rewarded . ''"
And then an idea struck Dick .
"He hastily descended to the courtyard , ran with all his might across the garden , and came to the great door of the church ."
`` No ; but I 'm bothered .
"I want some money , and I do n't see how I can earn it , '' he answered , tumbling his hair about , and frowning darkly at the fire ."
`` How much ? ''
"and Jill 's ready hand went to the pocket where her little purse lay , for she felt rich with several presents lately made her ."
`` Two seventy-five .
"No , thank you , I wo n't borrow . ''"
`` What is it for ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
"`` Why , I thought you told me everything . ''"
"`` Sorry , but I ca n't this time ."
Do n't you worry ; I shall think of something . ''
`` Could n't your mother help ? ''
`` Do n't wish to ask her . ''
`` Why !
ca n't she know ? ''
`` Nobody can . ''
`` How queer !
"Is it a scrape , Jack ? ''"
"asked Jill , looking as curious as a magpie ."
"`` It is likely to be , if I ca n't get out of it this week , somehow . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't see how I can help if I 'm not to know anything ; '' and Jill seemed rather hurt ."
"`` You can just stop asking questions , and tell me how a fellow can earn some money ."
That would help .
"I 've got one dollar , but I must have some more ; '' and Jack looked worried as he fingered the little gold dollar on his watch-guard ."
"`` Oh , do you mean to use that ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ; a man must pay his debts if he sells all he has to do it , '' said Jack sternly ."
`` Dear me ; it must be something very serious . ''
"And Jill lay quite still for five minutes , thinking over all the ways in which Jack ever did earn money , for Mrs. Minot liked to have her boys work , and paid them in some way for all they did ."
`` Is there any wood to saw ? ''
"she asked presently , being very anxious to help ."
`` All done . ''
`` Paths to shovel ? ''
`` That would be better than if I explained it .
"Besides , I do n't think I could explain it ."
Take the beautiful line of a beautiful poem to help you in your thinking out : ` The gift without the giver is bare . ' ''
"`` I 'd put it the other way and say , ` The giver without the gift is bare , ' '' said Clorinda , with a grimace ."
`` That is my predicament exactly .
"Well , I hope by next Christmas I 'll not be quite bankrupt ."
I 'm going into Mr. Callender 's store down at Murraybridge in February .
"He has offered me the place , you know . ''"
`` Wo n't your aunt miss you terribly ? ''
said Aunt Emmy gravely .
Clorinda flushed .
There was a note in Aunt Emmy 's voice that disturbed her .
"`` Oh , yes , I suppose she will , '' she answered hurriedly ."
`` But she 'll get used to it very soon .
"And I will be home every Saturday night , you know ."
"I 'm dreadfully tired of being poor , Aunt Emmy , and now that I have a chance to earn something for myself I mean to take it ."
"I can help Aunt Mary , too ."
I 'm to get four dollars a week . ''
"`` I think she would rather have your companionship than a part of your salary , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` But of course you must decide for yourself , dear ."
It is hard to be poor .
I know it .
I am poor . ''
`` You poor ! ''
"said Clorinda , kissing her ."
"`` Why , you are the richest woman I know , Aunt Emmy -- rich in love and goodness and contentment . ''"
"`` And so are you , dearie ... rich in youth and health and happiness and ambition ."
Are n't they all worth while ? ''
"`` Of course they are , '' laughed Clorinda ."
"`` Only , unfortunately , Christmas gifts ca n't be coined out of them . ''"
`` Did you ever try ? ''
asked Aunt Emmy .
"`` Well , see here : you dinnae want the lad back ; well , what do ye want done with him , and how much will ye pay ? ''"
"My uncle made no answer , but shifted uneasily on his seat ."
"`` Come , sir , '' cried Alan ."
`` I would have you to ken that I am a gentleman ; I bear a king 's name ; I am nae rider to kick my shanks at your hall door .
"Either give me an answer in civility , and that out of hand ; or by the top of Glencoe , I will ram three feet of iron through your vitals . ''"
"`` Eh , man , '' cried my uncle , scrambling to his feet , `` give me a meenit !"
What 's like wrong with ye ?
I 'm just a plain man and nae dancing master ; and I 'm tryin to be as ceevil as it 's morally possible .
"As for that wild talk , it 's fair disrepitable ."
"Vitals , says you !"
And where would I be with my blunderbush ? ''
he snarled .
"`` Powder and your auld hands are but as the snail to the swallow against the bright steel in the hands of Alan , '' said the other ."
"`` Before your jottering finger could find the trigger , the hilt would dirl on your breast-bane . ''"
"`` Eh , man , whae 's denying it ? ''"
said my uncle .
"`` Pit it as ye please , hae ' t your ain way ; I 'll do naething to cross ye ."
"Just tell me what like ye 'll be wanting , and ye 'll see that we 'll can agree fine . ''"
"`` Troth , sir , '' said Alan , `` I ask for nothing but plain dealing ."
In two words : do ye want the lad killed or kept ? ''
"`` O , sirs ! ''"
cried Ebenezer .
"`` O , sirs , me !"
that 's no kind of language ! ''
`` Killed or kept ! ''
repeated Alan .
"`` O , keepit , keepit ! ''"
wailed my uncle .
"`` We 'll have nae bloodshed , if you please . ''"
"`` Well , '' says Alan , `` as ye please ; that 'll be the dearer . ''"
`` The dearer ? ''
cries Ebenezer .
"`` One Joan Sedley , '' replied Matcham , colouring ."
"`` It was Sir Daniel 's doing ; he hath money to gain upon both sides ; and , indeed , I have heard the poor wench bemoaning herself pitifully of the match ."
"It seems she is of your mind , or else distasted to the bridegroom . ''"
`` Well !
"marriage is like death , it comes to all , '' said Dick , with resignation ."
`` And she bemoaned herself ?
"I pray ye now , see there how shuttle-witted are these girls : to bemoan herself before that she had seen me !"
Do I bemoan myself ?
Not I .
"An I be to marry , I will marry dry-eyed !"
"But if ye know her , prithee , of what favour is she ?"
fair or foul ?
And is she shrewish or pleasant ? ''
"`` Nay , what matters it ? ''"
said Matcham .
"`` An y ' are to marry , ye can but marry ."
What matters foul or fair ?
These be but toys .
"Y ' are no milksop , Master Richard ; ye will wed with dry eyes , anyhow . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Shelton ."
`` Little I reck . ''
"`` Your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord , '' said Matcham ."
"`` She shall have the lord Heaven made her for , '' returned Dick ."
`` It trow there be worse as well as better . ''
"`` Ah , the poor wench ! ''"
cried the other .
`` And why so poor ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` To wed a man of wood , '' replied his companion ."
"`` O me , for a wooden husband ! ''"
"`` I think I be a man of wood , indeed , '' said Dick , `` to trudge afoot the while you ride my horse ; but it is good wood , I trow . ''"
"`` Good Dick , forgive me , '' cried the other ."
"He saw Matcham fall ; and on the instant his spirit and his strength revived ; With a cry of pity and anger , he unslung and bent his arblast ."
"But ere he had time to shoot , the leper held up his hand ."
"`` Hold your shot , Dickon ! ''"
cried a familiar voice .
"`` Hold your shot , mad wag !"
Know ye not a friend ? ''
"And then laying down Matcham on the turf , he undid the hood from off his face , and disclosed the features of Sir Daniel Brackley ."
`` Sir Daniel ! ''
cried Dick .
"`` Ay , by the mass , Sir Daniel ! ''"
returned the knight .
"`` Would ye shoot upon your guardian , rogue ?"
"But here is this '' -- And there he broke off , and pointing to Matcham , asked : `` How call ye him , Dick ? ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I call him Master Matcham ."
Know ye him not ?
He said ye knew him ! ''
"`` Ay , '' replied Sir Daniel , `` I know the lad ; '' and he chuckled ."
"`` But he has fainted ; and , by my sooth , he might have had less to faint for !"
"Hey , Dick ?"
Did I put the fear of death upon you ? ''
"`` Indeed , Sir Daniel , ye did that , '' said Dick , and sighed again at the mere recollection ."
"`` Nay , sir , saving your respect , I had as lief ` a ' met the devil in person ; and to speak truth , I am yet all a-quake ."
"But what made ye , sir , in such a guise ? ''"
Sir Daniel 's brow grew suddenly black with anger .
`` What made I ? ''
he said .
`` Ye do well to mind me of it !
What ?
"I skulked for my poor life in my own wood of Tunstall , Dick ."
We were ill sped at the battle ; we but got there to be swept among the rout .
Where be all my good men-at-arms ?
"Dick , by the mass , I know not !"
"In a short time they returned with the mattress , and Alan and Emily carried the sailor on it to Four Winds ."
"Lynde walked behind them , seemingly unconscious of both ."
She watched the stranger 's face as one fascinated .
"At Four Winds they carried the man to a room where Emily and Alan worked over him , while Lynde heated water and hunted out stimulants in a mechanical fashion ."
When Alan came down she asked no questions but looked at him with the same strained horror on her face which it had borne ever since Alan had dropped his burden at her feet .
`` Is he -- conscious ? ''
"asked Lynde , as if she forced herself to ask the question ."
"`` Yes , he has come back to life ."
But he is delirious and does n't realize his surroundings at all .
He thinks he is still on board the vessel .
He 'll probably come round all right .
Emily is going to watch him and I 'll go up to Rexton and send Dr. Ames down . ''
`` Do you know who that man you have saved is ? ''
asked Lynde .
`` No .
I asked him his name but could not get any sensible answer . ''
`` I can tell you who he is -- he is Frank Harmon . ''
Alan stared at her .
`` Frank Harmon .
Your -- your -- the man you married ?
Impossible ! ''
`` It is he .
Do you think I could be mistaken ? ''
* * * * * Dr. Ames came to Four Winds that night and again the next day .
He found Harmon delirious in a high fever .
"`` It will be several days before he comes to his senses , '' he said ."
`` Shall I send you help to nurse him ? ''
"`` It is n't necessary , '' said Emily stiffly ."
`` I can look after him -- and the Captain ought to be back tomorrow . ''
"`` You 've no idea who he is , I suppose ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` No . ''
"`` Just look at that poor little boy , Amy , '' said the taller of the two ."
"`` He is almost frozen , I believe ."
Why does n't Caroline hurry and open the door ? ''
"`` There she goes now , '' said Amy ."
"`` Edie , could n't we coax her to let him come in and get warm ?"
He looks so cold . ''
"And she drew her sister out into the hall , where the housekeeper was taking Bertie 's parcels ."
"`` Caroline , '' whispered Edith timidly , `` please tell that poor little fellow to come in and get warm -- he looks very cold . ''"
"`` He 's used to the cold , I warrant you , '' said the housekeeper rather impatiently ."
`` It wo n't hurt him . ''
"`` But it is Christmas week , '' said Edith gravely , `` and you know , Caroline , when Mamma was here she used to say that we ought to be particularly thoughtful of others who were not so happy or well-off as we were at this time . ''"
"Perhaps Edith 's reference to her mother softened Caroline , for she turned to Bertie and said cordially enough , `` Come in , and warm yourself before you go ."
It 's a cold day . ''
Bertie shyly followed her to the kitchen .
"`` Sit up to the fire , '' said Caroline , placing a chair for him , while Edith and Amy came round to the other side of the stove and watched him with friendly interest ."
`` What 's your name ? ''
asked Caroline .
"`` Robert Ross , ma'am . ''"
"`` Oh , you 're Mrs. Ross 's nephew then , '' said Caroline , breaking eggs into her cake-bowl , and whisking them deftly round ."
`` And you 're Sampson 's errand boy just now ?
"My goodness , '' as the boy spread his blue hands over the fire , `` where are your mittens , child ?"
You 're never out without mittens a day like this ! ''
"`` I lent them to William John -- he had n't any , '' faltered Bertie ."
He did not know but that the lady might consider it a grave crime to be mittenless .
`` No mittens ! ''
exclaimed Amy in dismay .
"`` Why , I have three pairs ."
And who is William John ? ''
"`` He is my cousin , '' said Bertie ."
`` And he 's awful sickly .
"He wanted to go out to play , and he had n't any mittens , so I lent him mine ."
I did n't miss them -- much . ''
"Wendy was now almost overhead , and they could hear her plaintive cry ."
But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell .
"The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship , and was darting at her victim from every direction , pinching savagely each time she touched ."
"` Hullo , Tink , ' cried the wondering boys ."
Tink 's reply rang out : ` Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy . '
It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered .
"` Let us do what Peter wishes , ' cried the simple boys ."
"` Quick , bows and arrows . '"
All but Tootles popped down their trees .
"He had a bow and arrow with him , and Tink noted it , and rubbed her little hands ."
"` Quick , Tootles , quick , ' she screamed ."
` Peter will be so pleased . '
Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow .
"` Out of the way , Tink , ' he shouted ; and then he fired , and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an arrow in her breast ."
"CHAPTER VI THE LITTLE HOUSE Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy 's body when the other boys sprang , armed , from their trees ."
"` You are too late , ' he cried proudly , ' I have shot the Wendy ."
Peter will be so pleased with me . '
Overhead Tinker Bell shouted ` Silly ass ! '
and darted into hiding .
The others did not hear her .
"They had crowded round Wendy , and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood ."
If Wendy 's heart had been beating they would all have heard it .
Slightly was the first to speak .
"` This is no bird , ' he said in a scared voice . '"
I think it must be a lady . ' '
A lady ? '
"said Tootles , and fell a-trembling ."
"` And we have killed her , ' Nibs said hoarsely ."
They all whipped off their caps .
"` Now I see , ' Curly said ; ` Peter was bringing her to us . '"
He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground . '
"A lady to take care of us at last , ' said one of the twins , ` and you have killed her . '"
asked Matcham .
"`` Never a girl for me , '' returned Dick ."
`` I do abjure the crew of them ! ''
"`` Ye speak boyishly , '' said the other ."
`` Ye think more of them than ye pretend . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick , stoutly ."
`` They come not in my mind .
"A plague of them , say I !"
"Give me to hunt and to fight and to feast , and to live with jolly foresters ."
"I never heard of a maid yet that was for any service , save one only ; and she , poor shrew , was burned for a witch and the wearing of men 's clothes in spite of nature . ''"
"Master Matcham crossed himself with fervour , and appeared to pray ."
`` What make ye ? ''
Dick inquired .
"`` I pray for her spirit , '' answered the other , with a somewhat troubled voice ."
`` For a witch 's spirit ? ''
Dick cried .
"`` But pray for her , an ye list ; she was the best wench in Europe , was this Joan of Arc ."
"Old Appleyard the archer ran from her , he said , as if she had been Mahoun ."
"Nay , she was a brave wench . ''"
"`` Well , but , good Master Richard , '' resumed Matcham , `` an ye like maids so little , y ' are no true natural man ; for God made them twain by intention , and brought true love into the world , to be man 's hope and woman 's comfort . ''"
`` Faugh ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Y ' are a milk-sopping baby , so to harp on women ."
"An ye think I be no true man , get down upon the path , and whether at fists , back-sword , or bow and arrow , I will prove my manhood on your body . ''"
"`` Nay , I am no fighter , '' said Matcham , eagerly ."
`` I mean no tittle of offence .
I meant but pleasantry .
"And if I talk of women , it is because I heard ye were to marry . ''"
`` I to marry ! ''
Dick exclaimed .
"`` Well , it is the first I hear of it ."
And with whom was I to marry ? ''
And then one night came the tragedy .
"It was the spring of the year , and the story had been told for the night , and Jane was now asleep in her bed ."
"Wendy was sitting on the floor , very close to the fire , so as to see to darn , for there was no other light in the nursery ; and while she sat darning she heard a crow ."
"Then the window blew open as of old , and Peter dropped in on the floor ."
"He was exactly the same as ever , and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth ."
"He was a little boy , and she was grown up ."
"She huddled by the fire not daring to move , helpless and guilty , a big woman ."
"`` Hullo , Wendy , '' he said , not noticing any difference , for he was thinking chiefly of himself ; and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first ."
"`` Hullo , Peter , '' she replied faintly , squeezing herself as small as possible ."
"Something inside her was crying `` Woman , Woman , let go of me . ''"
"`` Hullo , where is John ? ''"
"he asked , suddenly missing the third bed ."
"`` John is not here now , '' she gasped ."
`` Is Michael asleep ? ''
"he asked , with a careless glance at Jane ."
"`` Yes , '' she answered ; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter ."
"`` That is not Michael , '' she said quickly , lest a judgment should fall on her ."
Peter looked .
"`` Hullo , is it a new one ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
`` Boy or girl ? ''
`` Girl . ''
Now surely he would understand ; but not a bit of it .
"`` Peter , '' she said , faltering , `` are you expecting me to fly away with you ? ''"
`` Of course ; that is why I have come . ''
"He added a little sternly , `` Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time ? ''"
She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass .
"`` I ca n't come , '' she said apologetically , `` I have forgotten how to fly . ''"
`` I 'll soon teach you again . ''
"`` O Peter , do n't waste the fairy dust on me . ''"
She had risen ; and now at last a fear assailed him .
`` What is it ? ''
Let me see -- let me put on my thinking cap .
What is your name ? ''
`` Marcella Langley . ''
The older woman dropped the lingerie waist she was pretending to examine and stared at Marcella .
`` You do n't say !
"Look here , what was your mother 's name before she was married ? ''"
`` Mary Carvell . ''
"`` Well , I have heard of coincidences , but this beats all !"
Mary Carvell !
"Well , did you ever hear your mother speak of a girl friend of hers called Josephine Draper ? ''"
`` I should think I did !
You do n't mean -- '' `` I do mean it .
I 'm Josephine Draper .
"Your mother and I went to school together , and we were as much as sisters to each other until she got married ."
"Then she went away , and after a few years I lost trace of her ."
I did n't even know she was dead .
Poor Mary !
"Well , my duty is plain -- that 's one comfort -- my duty and my pleasure , too ."
Your sister is coming out to Dalesboro to stay with me .
"Yes , and you are too , for the whole summer ."
"You need n't say you 're not , because you are ."
I 've said so .
There 's room at Fir Cottage for you both .
"Yes , Fir Cottage -- I guess you 've heard your mother speak of that ."
There 's her old room out there that we always slept in when she came to stay all night with me .
It 's all ready for you .
What 's that ?
You ca n't afford to lose your place here ?
"Bless your heart , child , you wo n't lose it !"
"The owner of this store is my nephew , and he 'll do considerable to oblige me , as well he might , seeing as I brought him up ."
"To think that Mary Carvell 's daughter has been in his store for three years , and me never suspecting it !"
And I might never have found you out at all if you had n't been so patient with that woman .
`` No ! ''
"shrieked Tinker Bell , who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest ."
`` Why not ? ''
`` It is poisoned . ''
`` Poisoned ?
Who could have poisoned it ? ''
`` Hook . ''
`` Do n't be silly .
How could Hook have got down here ? ''
"Alas , Tinker Bell could not explain this , for even she did not know the dark secret of Slightly 's tree ."
Nevertheless Hook 's words had left no room for doubt .
The cup was poisoned .
"`` Besides , '' said Peter , quite believing himself `` I never fell asleep . ''"
He raised the cup .
"No time for words now ; time for deeds ; and with one of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught , and drained it to the dregs ."
"`` Why , Tink , how dare you drink my medicine ? ''"
But she did not answer .
Already she was reeling in the air .
`` What is the matter with you ? ''
"cried Peter , suddenly afraid ."
"`` It was poisoned , Peter , '' she told him softly ; `` and now I am going to be dead . ''"
"`` O Tink , did you drink it to save me ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But why , Tink ? ''"
"Her wings would scarcely carry her now , but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite ."
"She whispered in his ear `` You silly ass , '' and then , tottering to her chamber , lay down on the bed ."
His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress .
Every moment her light was growing fainter ; and he knew that if it went out she would be no more .
She liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it .
Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said .
Then he made it out .
She was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies .
"I promised to care for you as far as Holywood , and , by the rood , Jack , y ' are more capable to care for me . ''"
"`` Well , Dick , we 're friends now , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I never was unfriends , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Y ' are a brave lad in your way , albeit something of a milksop , too ."
I never met your like before this day .
"But , prithee , fetch back your breath , and let us on ."
Here is no place for chatter . ''
"`` My foot hurts shrewdly , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I had forgot your foot , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Well , we must go the gentlier ."
I would I knew rightly where we were .
"I have clean lost the path ; yet that may be for the better , too ."
"An they watch the ferry , they watch the path , belike , as well ."
I would Sir Daniel were back with two score men ; he would sweep me these rascals as the wind sweeps leaves .
"Come , Jack , lean ye on my shoulder , ye poor shrew ."
"Nay , y ' are not tall enough ."
"What age are ye , for a wager ?"
-- twelve ? ''
"`` Nay , I am sixteen , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are poorly grown to height , then , '' answered Dick ."
`` But take my hand .
"We shall go softly , never fear ."
"I owe you a life ; I am a good repayer , Jack , of good or evil . ''"
They began to go forward up the slope .
"`` We must hit the road , early or late , '' continued Dick ; `` and then for a fresh start ."
By the mass !
"but y ' ` ave a rickety hand , Jack ."
"If I had a hand like that , I would think shame ."
"I tell you , '' he went on , with a sudden chuckle , `` I swear by the mass I believe Hugh Ferryman took you for a maid . ''"
"`` Nay , never ! ''"
"cried the other , colouring high ."
"`` A ' did , though , for a wager ! ''"
Her eyes brightened when she saw the mayflowers he carried .
"She came and took them from him , and her hands touched his , sending a little thrill of joy through him ."
`` How lovely they are !
And the first I have seen this spring .
"You always bring me the first , do n't you , Jeff ?"
Do you remember the first day we spent picking mayflowers together ? ''
Jeff smiled .
Could he forget ?
But something held him back from speech .
"Sara put the flowers in a vase on the table , but slipped one starry pink cluster into the lace on her breast ."
"She came and sat down beside Jeffrey ; he saw that her beautiful eyes had been weeping , and that there were lines of pain around her lips ."
Some impulse that would not be denied made him lean over and take her hand .
She left it unresistingly in his clasp .
"`` I am very lonely now , Jeff , '' she said sadly ."
`` Father has gone .
I have no friends left . ''
"`` You have me , '' said Jeffrey quietly ."
`` Yes .
I should n't have said that .
"You are my friend , I know , Jeff ."
"But , but -- I must leave Pinehurst , you know . ''"
"`` I learned that tonight for the first time , '' he answered ."
"`` Did you ever come to a place where everything seemed ended -- where it seemed that there was nothing -- simply nothing -- left , Jeff ? ''"
she said wistfully .
"`` But , no , it could n't seem so to a man ."
Only a woman could fully understand what I mean .
That is how I feel now .
While I had Father to live for it was n't so hard .
But now there is nothing .
And I must go away . ''
`` Is there anything I can do ? ''
muttered Jeffrey miserably .
"`` I suppose it 's just as well she 's gone , though you DO do things in a dreadful headlong fashion , Anne ."
"I do n't see how she got out of the pen , though ."
She must have broken some of the boards off . ''
"`` I did n't think of looking , '' said Anne , `` but I 'll go and see now ."
Martin has never come back yet .
Perhaps some more of his aunts have died .
I think it 's something like Mr. Peter Sloane and the octogenarians .
"The other evening Mrs. Sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to Mr. Sloane , ' I see here that another octogenarian has just died ."
"What is an octogenarian , Peter ? '"
"And Mr. Sloane said he did n't know , but they must be very sickly creatures , for you never heard tell of them but they were dying ."
That 's the way with Martin 's aunts . ''
"`` Martin 's just like all the rest of those French , '' said Marilla in disgust ."
`` You ca n't depend on them for a day . ''
Marilla was looking over Anne 's Carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard .
"A minute later Anne dashed into the kitchen , wringing her hands ."
"`` Anne Shirley , what 's the matter now ? ''"
"`` Oh , Marilla , whatever shall I do ?"
This is terrible .
And it 's all my fault .
"Oh , will I EVER learn to stop and reflect a little before doing reckless things ?"
"Mrs. Lynde always told me I would do something dreadful some day , and now I 've done it ! ''"
"`` Anne , you are the most exasperating girl !"
WHAT is it you 've done ? ''
`` Sold Mr. Harrison 's Jersey cow ... the one he bought from Mr. Bell ... to Mr. Shearer !
Dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute . ''
"`` Anne Shirley , are you dreaming ? ''"
`` I only wish I were .
"There 's no dream about it , though it 's very like a nightmare ."
And Mr. Harrison 's cow is in Charlottetown by this time .
"Oh , Marilla , I thought I 'd finished getting into scrapes , and here I am in the very worst one I ever was in in my life ."
What can I do ? ''
`` Do ?
"He came upon Lynde , sitting on a grey boulder under the shadow of an overhanging fir coppice , with her dogs beside her ."
"She turned her head indifferently as Alan 's footsteps sounded on the pebbles , and then stood slowly up ."
`` Are you looking for me ? ''
she asked .
"`` I have some news for you , Lynde , '' Alan said ."
`` Has he -- has he come to himself ? ''
she whispered .
"`` Yes , he has come to himself ."
"Lynde , he is not Frank Harmon -- he is his twin brother ."
He says Frank Harmon was killed three years ago in the China seas . ''
"For a moment Lynde 's great grey eyes stared into Alan 's , questioning ."
"Then , as the truth seized on her comprehension , she sat down on the boulder and put her hands over her face without a word ."
Alan walked down to the water 's edge to give her time to recover herself .
"When he came back he took her hands and said quietly , `` Lynde , do you realize what this means for us -- for us ?"
You are free -- free to love me -- to be my wife . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` Oh , that ca n't be ."
I am not fit to be your wife . ''
"`` Do n't talk nonsense , dear , '' he smiled ."
`` It is n't nonsense .
You are a minister and it would ruin you to marry a girl like me .
Think what the Rexton people would say of it . ''
"`` Rexton is n't the world , dearest ."
Last week I had a letter from home asking me to go to a church there .
"I did not think of accepting then -- now I will go -- we will both go -- and a new life will begin for you , clear of the shadows of the old . ''"
`` That is n't possible .
"No , Alan , listen -- I love you too well to do you the wrong of marrying you ."
It would injure you .
There is Father .
I love him and he has always been very kind to me .
But -- but -- there 's something wrong -- you know it -- some crime in his past -- '' `` The only man who knew that is dead . ''
`` We do not know that he was the only man .
"Pew was that sort , and he died a beggar-man ."
"Flint was , and he died of rum at Savannah ."
"Ah , they was a sweet crew , they was !"
"On ` y , where are they ? ''"
"`` But , '' asked Dick , `` when we do lay 'em athwart , what are we to do with 'em , anyhow ? ''"
`` There 's the man for me ! ''
cried the cook admiringly .
`` That 's what I call business .
"Well , what would you think ?"
Put 'em ashore like maroons ?
That would have been England 's way .
Or cut 'em down like that much pork ?
"That would have been Flint 's , or Billy Bones 's . ''"
"`` Billy was the man for that , '' said Israel . ''"
"` Dead men do n't bite , ' says he ."
"Well , he 's dead now hisself ; he knows the long and short on it now ; and if ever a rough hand come to port , it was Billy . ''"
"`` Right you are , '' said Silver ; `` rough and ready ."
"But mark you here , I 'm an easy man -- I 'm quite the gentleman , says you ; but this time it 's serious ."
"Dooty is dooty , mates ."
I give my vote -- death .
"When I 'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach , I do n't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home , unlooked for , like the devil at prayers ."
"Wait is what I say ; but when the time comes , why , let her rip ! ''"
"`` John , '' cries the coxswain , `` you 're a man ! ''"
"`` You 'll say so , Israel when you see , '' said Silver ."
`` Only one thing I claim -- I claim Trelawney .
"I 'll wring his calf 's head off his body with these hands , Dick ! ''"
"he added , breaking off ."
"`` You just jump up , like a sweet lad , and get me an apple , to wet my pipe like . ''"
You may fancy the terror I was in !
"I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength , but my limbs and heart alike misgave me ."
"I heard Dick begin to rise , and then someone seemingly stopped him , and the voice of Hands exclaimed , `` Oh , stow that !"
"Do n't you get sucking of that bilge , John ."
John paled .
"` It is this , if we meet Hook in open fight , you must leave him to me . ' '"
"I promise , ' John said loyally ."
"For the moment they were feeling less eerie , because Tink was flying with them , and in her light they could distinguish each other ."
"Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they , and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo ."
"Wendy quite liked it , until Peter pointed out the drawback ."
"` She tells me , ' he said , ` that the pirates sighted us before the darkness came , and got Long Tom out . '"
` The big gun ? '
` Yes .
"And of course they must see her light , and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fly . '"
` Wendy ! '
` John ! '
` Michael ! '
"` Tell her to go away at once , Peter , ' the three cried simultaneously , but he refused ."
"` She thinks we have lost the way , ' he replied stiffly , ` and she is rather frightened ."
You do n't think I would send her away all by herself when she is frightened ! '
"For a moment the circle of light was broken , and something gave Peter a loving little pinch ."
"` Then tell her , ' Wendy begged , ` to put out her light . '"
` She ca n't put it out .
That is about the only thing fairies ca n't do .
"It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep , same as the stars . '"
"` Then tell her to sleep at once , ' John almost ordered ."
` She ca n't sleep except when she 's sleepy .
It is the only other thing fairies ca n't do . '
"` Seems to me , ' growled John , ` these are the only two things worth doing . '"
"Here he got a pinch , but not a loving one ."
"` If only one of us had a pocket , ' Peter said , ` we could carry her in it . '"
"However , they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them ."
He had a happy idea .
John 's hat !
Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand .
"John carried it , though she had hoped to be carried by Peter ."
O the lovely ! '
"she cried , though Tink 's face was still distorted with passion ."
"` Tink , ' said Peter amiably , ` this lady says she wishes you were her fairy . '"
Tinker Bell answered insolently .
"` What does she say , Peter ? '"
He had to translate .
` She is not very polite .
"She says you are a great ugly girl , and that she is my fairy . '"
He tried to argue with Tink .
"` You know you ca n't be my fairy , Tink , because I am a gentleman and you are a lady . '"
"To this Tink replied in these words , ` You silly ass , ' and disappeared into the bathroom ."
"` She is quite a common fairy , ' Peter explained apologetically ; ` she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots and kettles . '"
"They were together in the armchair by this time , and Wendy plied him with more questions ."
` If you do n't live in Kensington Gardens now -- ' ` Sometimes I do still . '
` But where do you live mostly now ? '
` With the lost boys . '
` Who are they ? '
` They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way .
If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses .
I 'm captain . '
` What fun it must be ! '
"` Yes , ' said cunning Peter , ` but we are rather lonely ."
You see we have no female companionship . '
` Are none of the others girls ? '
"` Oh no ; girls , you know , are much too clever to fall out of their prams . '"
This flattered Wendy immensely . '
"I think , ' she said , ` it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls ; John there just despises us . '"
"For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed , blankets and all ; one kick ."
"This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting , and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house ."
"However , John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there ."
"` And I know you meant to be kind , ' she said , relenting , ` so you may give me a kiss . '"
For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses . '
"`` Let me brush your hair now , dear , and bathe your face . ''"
`` Have you time ? ''
said Patty anxiously .
"`` Yes , I think so . ''"
Patty gave a sigh of content .
`` I 'm so glad !
Aunt Emma always hurts me when she brushes my hair -- she is in such a hurry .
"You 're so gentle , Marcella , you do n't make my head ache at all ."
But oh !
I 'm so tired of being sick .
I wish I could get well faster .
"Marcy , do you think I can be sent to the country ? ''"
"`` I -- I do n't know , dear ."
"I 'll see if I can think of any way to manage it , '' said Marcella , striving to speak hopefully ."
Patty drew a long breath .
"`` Oh , Marcy , it would be lovely to see the green fields again , and the woods and brooks , as we did that summer we spent in the country before Father died ."
I wish we could live in the country always .
I 'm sure I would soon get better if I could go -- if it was only for a little while .
It 's so hot here -- and the factory makes such a noise -- my head seems to go round and round all the time .
And Aunt Emma scolds so . ''
"`` You must n't mind Aunt Emma , dear , '' said Marcella ."
`` You know she does n't really mean it -- it is just a habit she has got into .
She was really very good to you when you were so sick .
"She sat up night after night with you , and made me go to bed ."
"There now , dearie , you 're fresh and sweet , and I must hurry to the store , or I 'll be late ."
"Try and have a little nap , and I 'll bring you home some oranges tonight . ''"
"Marcella dropped a kiss on Patty 's cheek , put on her hat and went out ."
"As soon as she left the house , she quickened her steps almost to a run ."
"She feared she would be late , and that meant a ten-cent fine ."
Ten cents loomed as large as ten dollars now to Marcella 's eyes when every dime meant so much .
"But fast as she went , her distracted thoughts went faster ."
She could not send Patty to the country .
"A creek ran up to meet the path , and close under the bank the ferryman 's hut lay snugly ."
"It was of wattle and clay , and the grass grew green upon the roof ."
Dick went to the door and opened it .
"Within , upon a foul old russet cloak , the ferryman lay stretched and shivering ; a great hulk of a man , but lean and shaken by the country fever ."
"`` Hey , Master Shelton , '' he said , `` be ye for the ferry ?"
"Ill times , ill times !"
Look to yourself .
There is a fellowship abroad .
Ye were better turn round on your two heels and try the bridge . ''
"`` Nay ; time 's in the saddle , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Time will ride , Hugh Ferryman ."
I am hot in haste . ''
`` A wilful man ! ''
"returned the ferryman , rising ."
"`` An ye win safe to the Moat House , y ' have done lucky ; but I say no more . ''"
"And then catching sight of Matcham , `` Who be this ? ''"
"he asked , as he paused , blinking , on the threshold of his cabin ."
"`` It is my kinsman , Master Matcham , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Give ye good day , good ferryman , '' said Matcham , who had dismounted , and now came forward , leading the horse ."
"`` Launch me your boat , I prithee ; we are sore in haste . ''"
The gaunt ferryman continued staring .
`` By the mass ! ''
"he cried at length , and laughed with open throat ."
"Matcham coloured to his neck and winced ; and Dick , with an angry countenance , put his hand on the lout 's shoulder ."
"`` How now , churl ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Fall to thy business , and leave mocking thy betters . ''"
"Hugh Ferryman grumblingly undid his boat , and shoved it a little forth into the deep water ."
"Then Dick led in the horse , and Matcham followed ."
"`` Ye be mortal small made , master , '' said Hugh , with a wide grin ; `` something o ' the wrong model , belike ."
"Nay , Master Shelton , I am for you , '' he added , getting to his oars ."
`` A cat may look at a king .
"`` Lion-driver , '' she said , at length , `` ye do not admire a maid in a man 's jerkin ? ''"
The moon was now up ; and they were only waiting to repose the wearied horses .
"By the moon 's light , the still penitent but now well-fed Richard beheld her looking somewhat coquettishly down upon him ."
"`` Madam '' -- he stammered , surprised at this new turn in her manners ."
"`` Nay , '' she interrupted , `` it skills not to deny ; Joanna hath told me , but come , Sir Lion-driver , look at me -- am I so homely -- come ! ''"
And she made bright eyes at him .
"`` Ye are something smallish , indeed '' -- began Dick ."
"And here again she interrupted him , this time with a ringing peal of laughter that completed his confusion and surprise ."
`` Smallish ! ''
she cried .
"`` Nay , now , be honest as ye are bold ; I am a dwarf , or little better ; but for all that -- come , tell me !"
"-- for all that , passably fair to look upon ; is ' t not so ? ''"
"`` Nay , madam , exceedingly fair , '' said the distressed knight , pitifully trying to seem easy ."
`` And a man would be right glad to wed me ? ''
she pursued .
"`` O , madam , right glad ! ''"
agreed Dick .
"`` Call me Alicia , '' said she ."
"`` Alicia , '' quoth Sir Richard ."
"`` Well , then , lion-driver , '' she continued , `` sith that ye slew my kinsman , and left me without stay , ye owe me , in honour , every reparation ; do ye not ? ''"
"`` I do , madam , '' said Dick ."
"`` Although , upon my heart , I do hold me but partially guilty of that brave knight 's blood . ''"
`` Would ye evade me ? ''
she cried .
"`` Madam , not so ."
"I have told you ; at your bidding , I will even turn me a monk , '' said Richard ."
"`` Then , in honour , ye belong to me ? ''"
she concluded .
"`` In honour , madam , I suppose '' -- began the young man ."
`` Go to ! ''
she interrupted ; `` ye are too full of catches .
"In honour do ye belong to me , till ye have paid the evil ? ''"
And I go dinnerless ! ''
"In the space of a minute , some running , some walking sharply , according as their stations were nearer or farther away , the men of the Black Arrow had all disappeared from the neighbourhood of the ruined house ; and the caldron , and the fire , which was now burning low , and the dead deer 's carcase on the hawthorn , remained alone to testify they had been there ."
CHAPTER V -- `` BLOODY AS THE HUNTER '' The lads lay quiet till the last footstep had melted on the wind .
"Then they arose , and with many an ache , for they were weary with constraint , clambered through the ruins , and recrossed the ditch upon the rafter ."
"Matcham had picked up the windac and went first , Dick following stiffly , with his cross-bow on his arm ."
"`` And now , '' said Matcham , `` forth to Holywood . ''"
`` To Holywood ! ''
"cried Dick , `` when good fellows stand shot ?"
Not I !
"I would see you hanged first , Jack ! ''"
"`` Ye would leave me , would ye ? ''"
Matcham asked .
"`` Ay , by my sooth ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` An I be not in time to warn these lads , I will go die with them ."
What !
would ye have me leave my own men that I have lived among .
I trow not !
Give me my windac . ''
But there was nothing further from Matcham 's mind .
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` ye sware before the saints that ye would see me safe to Holywood ."
Would ye be forsworn ?
Would you desert me -- a perjurer ? ''
"`` Nay , I sware for the best , '' returned Dick ."
`` I meant it too ; but now !
"But look ye , Jack , turn again with me ."
"Let me but warn these men , and , if needs must , stand shot with them ; then shall all be clear , and I will on again to Holywood and purge mine oath . ''"
"`` Ye but deride me , '' answered Matcham ."
`` These men ye go to succour are the I same that hunt me to my ruin . ''
Dick scratched his head .
"`` I can not help it , Jack , '' he said ."
`` Here is no remedy .
"he questioned sadly , after a silence ."
"`` I think I am , '' said Sara ."
She kept her stately head averted .
"`` If -- if you have loved me , Jeff , why did you never tell me so before ? ''"
`` How could I dare ? ''
he said gravely .
`` I knew I could never win you -- that I had no right to dream of you so .
"Oh , Sara , do n't be angry !"
My love has been reverent and humble .
I have asked nothing .
I ask nothing now but your friendship .
"Do n't take that from me , Sara ."
Do n't be angry with me . ''
"`` I am angry , '' repeated Sara , `` and I think I have a right to be . ''"
"`` Perhaps so , '' he said simply , `` but not because I have loved you ."
"Such love as mine ought to anger no woman , Sara ."
But you have a right to be angry with me for presuming to put it into words .
I should not have done so -- but I could not help it .
It rushed to my lips in spite of me .
Forgive me . ''
"`` I do n't know whether I can forgive you for not telling me before , '' said Sara steadily . ''"
"That is what I have to forgive -- not your speaking at last , even if it was dragged from you against your will ."
"Did you think I would make you such a very poor wife , Jeff , that you would not ask me to marry you ? ''"
`` Sara ! ''
"he said , aghast ."
`` I -- I -- you were as far above me as a star in the sky -- I never dreamed -- I never hoped -- '' `` That I could care for you ? ''
"said Sara , looking round at last ."
"`` Then you were more modest than a man ought to be , Jeff ."
"I did not know that you loved me , or I should have found some way to make you speak out long ago ."
I should not have let you waste all these years .
"I 've loved you -- ever since we picked mayflowers on the hill , I think -- ever since I came home from school , I know ."
"I never cared for anyone else -- although I tried to , when I thought you did n't care for me ."
Begone from me for ever . '
"She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded , but he brushed her off ."
"Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say , ` Well , not for ever , but for a whole week . '"
Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm ?
"Oh dear no , never wanted to pinch her so much ."
"Fairies indeed are strange , and Peter , who understood them best , often cuffed them ."
But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health ?
"` Let us carry her down into the house , ' Curly suggested ."
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is what one does with ladies . '"
"` No , no , ' Peter said , ` you must not touch her ."
It would not be sufficiently respectful . '
"` That , ' said Slightly , ` is what I was thinking . '"
"` But if she lies there , ' Tootles said , ` she will die . '"
"` Ay , she will die , ' Slightly admitted , ` but there is no way out . '"
"` Yes , there is , ' cried Peter ."
` Let us build a little house round her . '
They were all delighted .
"` Quick , ' he ordered them , ` bring me each of you the best of what we have ."
Gut our house .
Be sharp . '
In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding .
"They skurried this way and that , down for bedding , up for firewood , and while they were at it , who should appear but John and Michael ."
"As they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing , stopped , woke up , moved another step and slept again ."
"` John , John , ' Michael would cry , ` wake up ."
"Where is Nana , John , and mother ? '"
"And then John would rub his eyes and mutter , ` It is true , we did fly . '"
You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter .
"` Hullo , Peter , ' they said ."
"` Hullo , ' replied Peter amicably , though he had quite forgotten them ."
He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need .
Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table .
John and Michael watched him .
My unkle has adopted a cat .
it come to his house one day and woudent go away and unkle says it has forgot more than most people ever knowed .
he lets it sleep on his rocking chare and my aunt says he thinks more of it than he does of his children .
that is not right .
we ought to be kind to cats and give them new milk but we ought not be better to them than to our children .
this is oll I can think of so no more at present from edward blake ClaY . ' ''
"`` St. Clair Donnell 's is , as usual , short and to the point ."
St. Clair never wastes words .
I do not think he chose his subject or added the postscript out of malice aforethought .
It is just that he has not a great deal of tact or imagination . '' ''
` Dear Miss Shirley '' ` You told us to describe something strange we have seen .
I will describe the Avonlea Hall .
"It has two doors , an inside one and an outside one ."
It has six windows and a chimney .
It has two ends and two sides .
It is painted blue .
That is what makes it strange .
It is built on the lower Carmody road .
It is the third most important building in Avonlea .
The others are the church and the blacksmith shop .
They hold debating clubs and lectures in it and concerts . ''
"` Yours truly , '' ` Jacob Donnell . ''"
` P.S. .
The hall is a very bright blue . ' ''
"`` Annetta Bell 's letter was quite long , which surprised me , for writing essays is not Annetta 's forte , and hers are generally as brief as St. Clair 's ."
"Annetta is a quiet little puss and a model of good behavior , but there is n't a shadow of orginality in her ."
Here is her letter .
"-- '' ` Dearest teacher , '' `` I think I will write you a letter to tell you how much I love you ."
I love you with my whole heart and soul and mind ... with all there is of me to love ... and I want to serve you for ever .
It would be my highest privilege .
That is why I try so hard to be good in school and learn my lessuns . ''
"` You are so beautiful , my teacher ."
`` None in the world . ''
She looked at him through and through a moment longer .
"Then , seeming satisfied with her scrutiny , she picked up her pail ."
"`` Come down to the spring with me , '' she said ."
"As soon as they were out of sight of the house , Emily began abruptly ."
"`` If you do n't know why Lynde is acting so , I ca n't tell you , for I do n't know either ."
I do n't even know if she is angry .
I only thought perhaps she was -- that you had done or said something to vex her -- plaguing her to go to church maybe .
"But if you did n't , it may not be anger at all ."
I do n't understand that girl .
She 's been different ever since her mother died .
She used to tell me everything before that .
You must go and ask her right out yourself what is wrong .
But maybe I can tell you something .
Did you write her a letter a fortnight ago ? ''
`` A letter ?
No . ''
"`` Well , she got one then ."
I thought it came from you -- I did n't know who else would be writing to her .
A boy brought it and gave it to her at the door .
She 's been acting strange ever since .
She cries at night -- something Lynde never did before except when her mother died .
And in daytime she roams the shore and woods like one possessed .
"You must find out what was in that letter , Mr. Douglas . ''"
`` Have you any idea who the boy was ? ''
"Alan asked , feeling somewhat relieved ."
"The mystery was clearing up , he thought ."
No doubt it was the old story of some cowardly anonymous letter .
His thoughts flew involuntarily to Isabel King .
Emily shook her head .
`` No .
He was just a half-grown fellow with reddish hair and he limped a little . ''
gasped Appleyard .
`` I be done with Old England .
Pluck it out ! ''
"`` Master Dick , '' said Bennet , `` come hither , and pull me a good pull upon the arrow ."
"He would fain pass , the poor sinner . ''"
"Dick laid down his cross-bow , and pulling hard upon the arrow , drew it forth ."
"A gush of blood followed ; the old archer scrambled half upon his feet , called once upon the name of God , and then fell dead ."
"Hatch , upon his knees among the cabbages , prayed fervently for the welfare of the passing spirit ."
"But even as he prayed , it was plain that his mind was still divided , and he kept ever an eye upon the corner of the wood from which the shot had come ."
"When he had done , he got to his feet again , drew off one of his mailed gauntlets , and wiped his pale face , which was all wet with terror ."
"`` Ay , '' he said , `` it 'll be my turn next . ''"
"`` Who hath done this , Bennet ? ''"
"Richard asked , still holding the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Nay , the saints know , '' said Hatch ."
"`` Here are a good two score Christian souls that we have hunted out of house and holding , he and I ."
"He has paid his shot , poor shrew , nor will it be long , mayhap , ere I pay mine ."
Sir Daniel driveth over-hard . ''
"`` This is a strange shaft , '' said the lad , looking at the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Ay , by my faith ! ''"
cried Bennet .
"`` Black , and black-feathered ."
"Here is an ill-favoured shaft , by my sooth !"
"for black , they say , bodes burial ."
And here be words written .
Wipe the blood away .
What read ye ? '' '' '
"Appulyaird fro Jon Amend-All , ' '' read Shelton ."
`` What should this betoken ? ''
"`` Nay , I like it not , '' returned the retainer , shaking his head ."
`` John Amend-All !
Here is a rogue 's name for those that be up in the world !
But why stand we here to make a mark ?
"They were sorry for him , but sorrier for themselves , and when he took a step nearer them they turned from him ."
"Tootles ' face was very white , but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before . '"
"I did it , ' he said , reflecting ."
"` When ladies used to come to me in dreams , I said , `` Pretty mother , pretty mother . ''"
"But when at last she really came , I shot her . '"
He moved slowly away .
"` Do n't go , ' they called in pity . '"
"I must , ' he answered , shaking ; ' I am so afraid of Peter . '"
It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth .
They heard Peter crow .
` Peter ! '
"they cried , for it was always thus that he signalled his return ."
"` Hide her , ' they whispered , and gathered hastily around Wendy ."
But Tootles stood aloof .
"Again came that ringing crow , and Peter dropped in front of them ."
"` Greeting , boys , ' he cried , and mechanically they saluted , and then again was silence ."
He frowned . '
"I am back , ' he said hotly , ` why do you not cheer ? '"
"They opened their mouths , but the cheers would not come ."
He overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings .
"` Great news , boys , ' he cried , ' I have brought at last a mother for you all . '"
"Still no sound , except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees ."
` Have you not seen her ? '
"asked Peter , becoming troubled ."
` She flew this way . '
"` Ah me , ' one voice said , and another said , ` Oh , mournful day . '"
Tootles rose .
"` Peter , ' he said quietly , ' I will show her to you ' ; and when the others would still have hidden her he said , ` Back , twins , let Peter see . '"
"So they all stood back , and let him see , and after he had looked for a little time he did not know what to do next ."
"` She is dead , ' he said uncomfortably ."
` Perhaps she is frightened at being dead . '
"He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight of her , and then never going near the spot any more ."
He wished she had not mentioned letters .
"` Do n't get any letters , ' he said contemptuously ."
` But your mother gets letters ? '
"` Do n't have a mother , ' he said ."
"Not only had he no mother , but he had not the slightest desire to have one ."
He thought them very overrated persons .
"Wendy , however , felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy . '"
"O Peter , no wonder you were crying , ' she said , and got out of bed and ran to him . '"
"I was n't crying about mothers , ' he said rather indignantly . '"
I was crying because I ca n't get my shadow to stick on .
"Besides , I was n't crying . '"
` It has come off ? '
` Yes . '
"Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor , looking so draggled , and she was frightfully sorry for Peter ."
` How awful ! '
"she said , but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap ."
How exactly like a boy !
"Fortunately she knew at once what to do ` It must be sewn on , ' she said , just a little patronisingly ."
` What 's sewn ? '
he asked .
` You 're dreadfully ignorant . '
"` No , I 'm not . '"
But she was exulting in his ignorance . '
"I shall sew it on for you , my little man , ' she said , though he was as tall as herself ; and she got out her housewife , and sewed the shadow on to Peter 's foot . '"
"I daresay it will hurt a little , ' she warned him ."
"` Oh , I sha n't cry , ' said Peter , who was already of opinion that he had never cried in his life ."
"And he clenched his teeth and did not cry ; and soon his shadow was behaving properly , though still a little creased ."
"` Perhaps I should have ironed it , ' Wendy said thoughtfully ; but Peter , boylike , was indifferent to appearances , and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee ."
"Alas , he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy ."
He thought he had attached the shadow himself .
"` How clever I am , ' he crowed rapturously , ` oh , the cleverness of me ! '"
It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities .
he cried .
"`` Why , in a place like this , where nobody puts in but gen ` lemen of fortune , Silver would fly the Jolly Roger , you do n't make no doubt of that ."
"No , that 's your friends ."
"There 's been blows too , and I reckon your friends has had the best of it ; and here they are ashore in the old stockade , as was made years and years ago by Flint ."
"Ah , he was the man to have a headpiece , was Flint !"
"Barring rum , his match were never seen ."
"He were afraid of none , not he ; on ' y Silver -- Silver was that genteel . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that may be so , and so be it ; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends . ''"
"`` Nay , mate , '' returned Ben , `` not you ."
"You 're a good boy , or I 'm mistook ; but you 're on ' y a boy , all told ."
"Now , Ben Gunn is fly ."
"Rum would n't bring me there , where you 're going -- not rum would n't , till I see your born gen ` leman and gets it on his word of honour ."
"And you wo n't forget my words ; ' A precious sight -LRB- that 's what you 'll say -RRB- , a precious sight more confidence ' -- and then nips him . ''"
And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness .
"`` And when Ben Gunn is wanted , you know where to find him , Jim ."
Just wheer you found him today .
"And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand , and he 's to come alone ."
Oh !
"And you 'll say this : ` Ben Gunn , ' says you , ` has reasons of his own . ' ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I believe I understand ."
"You have something to propose , and you wish to see the squire or the doctor , and you 're to be found where I found you ."
Is that all ? ''
`` And when ?
"says you , '' he added ."
"`` Why , from about noon observation to about six bells . ''"
"`` Good , '' said I , `` and now may I go ? ''"
`` You wo n't forget ? ''
he inquired anxiously .
"`` Precious sight , and reasons of his own , says you ."
Reasons of his own ; that 's the mainstay ; as between man and man .
"Well , then '' -- still holding me -- `` I reckon you can go , Jim ."
"And , Jim , if you was to see Silver , you would n't go for to sell Ben Gunn ?"
"he cried , striking his hand upon the wall so that the house rang again ."
"`` Well , and that 's true , too , '' said Alan ; `` and my friend from the Lowlands here '' -LRB- nodding at me -RRB- `` gave me a good word upon that head , if I would only have listened to him . ''"
"`` But see here , '' said James , returning to his former manner , `` if they lay me by the heels , Alan , it 's then that you 'll be needing the money ."
"For with all that I have said and that you have said , it will look very black against the two of us ; do ye mark that ?"
"Well , follow me out , and ye 'll , I 'll see that I 'll have to get a paper out against ye mysel ' ; have to offer a reward for ye ; ay , will I !"
"It 's a sore thing to do between such near friends ; but if I get the dirdum * of this dreadful accident , I 'll have to fend for myself , man ."
Do ye see that ? ''
* Blame .
"He spoke with a pleading earnestness , taking Alan by the breast of the coat ."
"`` Ay '' said Alan , `` I see that . ''"
"`` And ye 'll have to be clear of the country , Alan -- ay , and clear of Scotland -- you and your friend from the Lowlands , too ."
For I 'll have to paper your friend from the Lowlands .
"Ye see that , Alan -- say that ye see that ! ''"
I thought Alan flushed a bit .
"`` This is unco hard on me that brought him here , James , '' said he , throwing his head back ."
`` It 's like making me a traitor ! ''
"`` Now , Alan , man ! ''"
cried James .
`` Look things in the face !
He 'll be papered anyway ; Mungo Campbell 'll be sure to paper him ; what matters if I paper him too ?
"And then , Alan , I am a man that has a family . ''"
"And then , after a little pause on both sides , `` And , Alan , it 'll be a jury of Campbells , '' said he ."
"`` There 's one thing , '' said Alan , musingly , `` that naebody kens his name . ''"
"`` Nor yet they shallnae , Alan !"
"There 's my hand on that , '' cried James , for all the world as if he had really known my name and was foregoing some advantage ."
"`` But just the habit he was in , and what he looked like , and his age , and the like ?"
I couldnae well do less . ''
"`` I wonder at your father 's son , '' cried Alan , sternly ."
`` Would ye sell the lad with a gift ?
Would ye change his clothes and then betray him ? ''
"`` No , no , Alan , '' said James ."
"`` No , no : the habit he took off -- the habit Mungo saw him in . ''"
"Here 's this squire and doctor with a map and such -- I do n't know where it is , do I ?"
"No more do you , says you ."
"Well then , I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff , and help us to get it aboard , by the powers ."
Then we 'll see .
"If I was sure of you all , sons of double Dutchmen , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck . ''"
"`` Why , we 're all seamen aboard here , I should think , '' said the lad Dick ."
"`` We 're all forecastle hands , you mean , '' snapped Silver ."
"`` We can steer a course , but who 's to set one ?"
"That 's what all you gentlemen split on , first and last ."
"If I had my way , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least ; then we 'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day ."
But I know the sort you are .
"I 'll finish with 'em at the island , as soon 's the blunt 's on board , and a pity it is ."
But you 're never happy till you 're drunk .
"Split my sides , I 've a sick heart to sail with the likes of you ! ''"
"`` Easy all , Long John , '' cried Israel ."
`` Who 's a-crossin ' of you ? ''
"`` Why , how many tall ships , think ye , now , have I seen laid aboard ?"
And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock ? ''
cried Silver .
`` And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry .
You hear me ?
"I seen a thing or two at sea , I have ."
"If you would on ' y lay your course , and a p ` int to windward , you would ride in carriages , you would ."
But not you !
I know you .
"You 'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow , and go hang . ''"
"`` Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling , John ; but there 's others as could hand and steer as well as you , '' said Israel ."
"`` They liked a bit o ' fun , they did ."
"They was n't so high and dry , nohow , but took their fling , like jolly companions every one . ''"
`` So ? ''
says Silver .
"`` Well , and where are they now ?"
"`` I will eat nothing at the hands that slew my kinsman , '' she replied ."
"`` Dear madam , '' Dick cried , `` I swear to you upon the rood I touched him not . ''"
"`` Swear to me that he still lives , '' she returned ."
"`` I will not palter with you , '' answered Dick ."
`` Pity bids me to wound you .
In my heart I do believe him dead . ''
`` And ye ask me to eat ! ''
she cried .
"`` Ay , and they call you ` sir ! '"
Y ' have won your spurs by my good kinsman 's murder .
"And had I not been fool and traitor both , and saved you in your enemy 's house , ye should have died the death , and he -- he that was worth twelve of you -- were living . ''"
"`` I did but my man 's best , even as your kinsman did upon the other party , '' answered Dick ."
`` Were he still living -- as I vow to Heaven I wish it !
"-- he would praise , not blame me . ''"
"`` Sir Daniel hath told me , '' she replied ."
`` He marked you at the barricade .
"Upon you , he saith , their party foundered ; it was you that won the battle ."
"Well , then , it was you that killed my good Lord Risingham , as sure as though ye had strangled him ."
And ye would have me eat with you -- and your hands not washed from killing ?
But Sir Daniel hath sworn your downfall .
He 't is that will avenge me ! ''
The unfortunate Dick was plunged in gloom .
"Old Arblaster returned upon his mind , and he groaned aloud ."
`` Do ye hold me so guilty ? ''
he said ; `` you that defended me -- you that are Joanna 's friend ? ''
`` What made ye in the battle ? ''
she retorted .
"`` Y ' are of no party ; y ' are but a lad -- but legs and body , without government of wit or counsel !"
Wherefore did ye fight ?
"For the love of hurt , pardy ! ''"
"`` Nay , '' cried Dick , `` I know not ."
"But as the realm of England goes , if that a poor gentleman fight not upon the one side , perforce he must fight upon the other ."
He looked real careworn and worried today . ''
The Rexton gossip soon ceased with the cessation of the young minister 's visits to Four Winds .
"A month later it suffered a brief revival when a tall grim-faced old woman , whom a few recognized as Captain Anthony 's housekeeper , was seen to walk down the Rexton road and enter the manse ."
"She did not stay there long -- watchers from a dozen different windows were agreed upon that -- and nobody , not even Mrs. Danby , who did her best to find out , ever knew why she had called ."
"Emily looked at Alan with grim reproach when she was shown into his study , and as soon as they were alone she began with her usual abruptness , `` Mr. Douglas , why have you given up coming to Four Winds ? ''"
Alan flinched .
"`` You must ask Lynde that , Miss Oliver , '' he said quietly ."
`` I have asked her -- and she says nothing . ''
`` Then I can not tell you . ''
Anger glowed in Emily 's eyes .
"`` I thought you were a gentleman , '' she said bitterly ."
`` You are not .
You are breaking Lynde 's heart .
She 's gone to a shadow of herself and she 's fretting night and day .
"You went there and made her like you -- oh , I 've eyes -- and then you left her . ''"
Alan bent over his desk and looked the old woman in the face unflinchingly .
"`` You are mistaken , Miss Oliver , '' he said earnestly ."
`` I love Lynde and would be only too happy if it were possible that I could marry her .
I am not to blame for what has come about -- she will tell you that herself if you ask her . ''
His look and tone convinced Emily .
`` Who is to blame then ?
Lynde herself ? ''
"`` No , no . ''"
`` The Captain then ? ''
`` Not in the sense you mean .
I can tell you nothing more . ''
A baffled expression crossed the old woman 's face .
`` There 's a mystery here -- there always has been -- and I 'm shut out of it .
Lynde wo n't confide in me -- in me who 'd give my life 's blood to help her .
Perhaps I can help her -- I could tell you something .
Have you stopped coming to Four Winds -- has she made you stop coming -- because she 's got such a wicked old scamp for a father ?
Is that the reason ? ''
"When Mrs. Liddell had gone , she rose and leaned over the counter ."
Marcella opened her burning eyes and pulled herself wearily together .
`` What can I do for you ? ''
she said .
`` Nothing .
I ai n't looking for to have anything done for me .
"You need to have something done for you , I guess , by the looks of you ."
You seem dead beat out .
Are n't you awful tired ?
I 've been listening to that woman jawing you till I felt like rising up and giving her a large and wholesome piece of my mind .
"I do n't know how you kept your patience with her , but I can tell you I admired you for it , and I made up my mind I 'd tell you so . ''"
The kindness and sympathy in her tone broke Marcella down .
Tears rushed to her eyes .
"She bowed her head on her hands and said sobbingly , `` Oh , I am tired !"
But it 's not that .
I 'm -- I 'm in such trouble . ''
"`` I knew you were , '' said the other , with a nod of her head ."
`` I could tell that right off by your face .
Do you know what I said to myself ?
"I said , ` That girl has got somebody at home awful sick . '"
That 's what I said .
Was I right ? ''
"`` Yes , indeed you were , '' said Marcella ."
`` I knew it '' -- another triumphant nod .
"`` Now , you just tell me all about it ."
It 'll do you good to talk it over with somebody .
"Here , I 'll pretend I 'm looking at shirtwaists , so that floor walker wo n't be coming down on you , and I 'll be as hard to please as that other woman was , so 's you can take your time ."
Who 's sick -- and what 's the matter ? ''
"Marcella told the whole story , choking back her sobs and forcing herself to speak calmly , having the fear of the floor walker before her eyes ."
"`` And I ca n't afford to send Patty to the country -- I ca n't -- and I know she wo n't get better if she does n't go , '' she concluded ."
"`` Dear , dear , but that 's too bad !"
Something must be done .
Davy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a time .
"Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne 's neck , snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder ."
"`` Anne , do n't you like me a little bit , even if I ai n't a good boy like Paul ? ''"
"`` Indeed I do , '' said Anne sincerely ."
"Somehow , it was impossible to help liking Davy ."
`` But I 'd like you better still if you were n't so naughty . ''
"`` I ... did something else today , '' went on Davy in a muffled voice ."
`` I 'm sorry now but I 'm awful scared to tell you .
"You wo n't be very cross , will you ?"
"And you wo n't tell Marilla , will you ? ''"
"`` I do n't know , Davy ."
Perhaps I ought to tell her .
"But I think I can promise you I wo n't if you promise me that you will never do it again , whatever it is . ''"
"`` No , I never will ."
"Anyhow , it 's not likely I 'd find any more of them this year ."
I found this one on the cellar steps . ''
"`` Davy , what is it you 've done ? ''"
`` I put a toad in Marilla 's bed .
You can go and take it out if you like .
"But say , Anne , would n't it be fun to leave it there ? ''"
`` Davy Keith ! ''
Anne sprang from Davy 's clinging arms and flew across the hall to Marilla 's room .
The bed was slightly rumpled .
"She threw back the blankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad , blinking at her from under a pillow ."
`` How can I carry that awful thing out ? ''
moaned Anne with a shudder .
The fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while Marilla was busy in the pantry .
"Anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs , for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall ."
When she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief .
`` If Marilla knew she 'd never feel safe getting into bed again in her life .
I 'm so glad that little sinner repented in time .
There 's Diana signaling to me from her window .
He knew now that he had made a mistake in coming tonight ; he could not help her .
His own pain had unmanned him .
Presently he would say something foolish or selfish in spite of himself .
Sara turned her eyes on him .
"`` There is nothing anybody can do , Jeff , '' she said piteously ."
"Her eyes , those clear child-eyes , filled with tears ."
`` I shall be braver -- stronger -- after a while .
But just now I have no strength left .
"I feel like a lost , helpless child ."
"Oh , Jeff ! ''"
She put her slender hands over her face and sobbed .
Every sob cut Jeffrey to the heart .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , Sara , '' he said huskily ."
`` I ca n't bear to see you suffer so .
I 'd die for you if it would do you any good .
I love you -- I love you !
"I never meant to tell you so , but it is the truth ."
I ought n't to tell you now .
Do n't think that I 'm trying to take any advantage of your loneliness and sorrow .
I know -- I have always known -- that you are far above me .
"But that could n't prevent my loving you -- just humbly loving you , asking nothing else ."
"You may be angry with my presumption , but I ca n't help telling you that I love you ."
That 's all .
I just want you to know it . ''
Sara had turned away her head .
Jeffrey was overcome with contrition .
"Ah , he had no business to speak so -- he had spoiled the devotion of years ."
Who was he that he should have dared to love her ?
"Silence alone had justified his love , and now he had lost that justification ."
She would despise him .
He had forfeited her friendship for ever .
"`` Are you angry , Sara ? ''"
But here Dr. Livesey cut in .
"`` Stay a bit , '' said he , `` stay a bit ."
No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling .
"The captain has said too much or he has said too little , and I 'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words ."
"You do n't , you say , like this cruise ."
"Now , why ? ''"
"`` I was engaged , sir , on what we call sealed orders , to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me , '' said the captain ."
`` So far so good .
But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do .
"I do n't call that fair , now , do you ? ''"
"`` No , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't . ''"
"`` Next , '' said the captain , `` I learn we are going after treasure -- hear it from my own hands , mind you ."
"Now , treasure is ticklish work ; I do n't like treasure voyages on any account , and I do n't like them , above all , when they are secret and when -LRB- begging your pardon , Mr. Trelawney -RRB- the secret has been told to the parrot . ''"
`` Silver 's parrot ? ''
asked the squire .
"`` It 's a way of speaking , '' said the captain ."
"`` Blabbed , I mean ."
"It 's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about , but I 'll tell you my way of it -- life or death , and a close run . ''"
"`` That is all clear , and , I dare say , true enough , '' replied Dr. Livesey ."
"`` We take the risk , but we are not so ignorant as you believe us ."
"Next , you say you do n't like the crew ."
Are they not good seamen ? ''
"`` I do n't like them , sir , '' returned Captain Smollett ."
"`` And I think I should have had the choosing of my own hands , if you go to that . ''"
"`` Perhaps you should , '' replied the doctor ."
"`` My friend should , perhaps , have taken you along with him ; but the slight , if there be one , was unintentional ."
And you do n't like Mr. Arrow ? ''
"`` I do n't , sir ."
"I believe he 's a good seaman , but he 's too free with the crew to be a good officer ."
A mate should keep himself to himself -- should n't drink with the men before the mast ! ''
`` Do you mean he drinks ? ''
cried the squire .
Oh !
how high she could kick !
` The old chair-cover in the corner split when he saw her .
` The urn would have sung but she said she had a cold ; she could not sing unless she boiled .
` In the window was an old quill pen .
There was nothing remarkable about her except that she had been dipped too deeply into the ink .
But she was very proud of that . '
"`` If the urn will not sing , '' said she , `` outside the door hangs a nightingale in a cage who will sing . '' '"
"`` I do n't think it 's proper , '' said the kettle , `` that such a foreign bird should be heard . '' '"
"`` Oh , let us have some acting , '' said everyone ."
`` Do let us ! ''
` Suddenly the door opened and the maid came in .
Everyone was quite quiet .
There was not a sound .
"But each pot knew what he might have done , and how grand he was ."
` The maid took the matches and lit the fire with them .
"How they spluttered and flamed , to be sure !"
"`` Now everyone can see , '' they thought , `` that we are the grandest !"
How we sparkle !
What a light - '' ` But here they were burnt out . '
` That was a delightful story ! '
said the sultana . '
I quite feel myself in the kitchen with the matches .
"Yes , now you shall marry our daughter . '"
"` Yes , indeed , ' said the sultan , ` you shall marry our daughter on Monday . '"
And they treated the young man as one of the family .
"The wedding was arranged , and the night before the whole town was illuminated ."
"Biscuits and gingerbreads were thrown among the people , the street boys stood on tiptoe crying hurrahs and whistling through their fingers ."
It was all splendid .
"` Now I must also give them a treat , ' thought the merchant 's son ."
"And so he bought rockets , crackers , and all the kinds of fireworks you can think of , put them in his trunk , and flew up with them into the air ."
"Whirr-r-r , how they fizzed and blazed !"
"`` Well , I must run up to MacPhersons ' ."
Moody Spurgeon came home from Queen 's today for Sunday and he was to bring me out a book Professor Boyd is lending me . ''
`` And I must get Marilla 's tea .
She went to see Mrs. Keith this evening and she will soon be back . ''
"Anne had tea ready when Marilla came home ; the fire was crackling cheerily , a vase of frost-bleached ferns and ruby-red maple leaves adorned the table , and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the air ."
But Marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh .
`` Are your eyes troubling you ?
Does your head ache ? ''
queried Anne anxiously .
`` No .
I 'm only tired ... and worried .
It 's about Mary and those children ... Mary is worse ... she ca n't last much longer .
"And as for the twins , I do n't know what is to become of them . ''"
`` Has n't their uncle been heard from ? ''
"`` Yes , Mary had a letter from him ."
"He 's working in a lumber camp and ` shacking it , ' whatever that means ."
"Anyway , he says he ca n't possibly take the children till the spring ."
He expects to be married then and will have a home to take them to ; but he says she must get some of the neighbors to keep them for the winter .
She says she ca n't bear to ask any of them .
Mary never got on any too well with the East Grafton people and that 's a fact .
"And the long and short of it is , Anne , that I 'm sure Mary wants me to take those children ... she did n't say so but she LOOKED it . ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"Anne clasped her hands , all athrill with excitement ."
"`` And of course you will , Marilla , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` I have n't made up my mind , '' said Marilla rather tartly ."
"`` I do n't rush into things in your headlong way , Anne ."
Third cousinship is a pretty slim claim .
"And it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children of six years to look after ... twins , at that . ''"
Marilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single children .
"`` Twins are very interesting ... at least one pair of them , '' said Anne ."
`` It 's only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous .
And I think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you when I 'm away in school . ''
"cried John , but soon he found he had not ."
"Not one of them could fly an inch , though even Michael was in words of two syllables , and Peter did not know A from Z. Of course Peter had been trifling with them , for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him ."
"Fortunately , as we have mentioned , one of his hands was messy with it , and he blew some on each of them , with the most superb results ."
"` Now just wriggle your shoulders this way , ' he said , ` and let go . '"
"They were all on their beds , and gallant Michael let go first ."
"He did not quite mean to let go , but he did it , and immediately he was borne across the room . '"
I flewed ! '
he screamed while still in mid-air .
John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom .
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Oh , ripping ! '"
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
"They were not nearly so elegant as Peter , they could not help kicking a little , but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling , and there is almost nothing so delicious as that ."
"Peter gave Wendy a hand at first , but had to desist , Tink was so indignant ."
"Up and down they went , and round and round ."
Heavenly was Wendy 's word . '
"I say , ' cried John , ` why should n't we all go out ! '"
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them .
Michael was ready : he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles .
But Wendy hesitated .
` Mermaids ! '
said Peter again .
` Oo ! '
` And there are pirates . '
"` Pirates , ' cried John , seizing his Sunday hat , ` let us go at once . '"
It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27 .
"They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window ; and , yes , it was still shut , but the room was ablaze with light , and most heart-gripping sight of all , they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round , not on the floor but in the air ."
"Not three figures , four !"
In a tremble they opened the street door .
"Mr. Darling would have rushed upstairs , but Mrs. Darling signed to him to go softly ."
I suppose you 'll soon be leaving Sampson 's .
He told me he did n't need you after the holiday season was over .
What are you going at next ?
Have you anything in view ? ''
Bertie shook his head sorrowfully .
"`` No , sir ; but , '' he added more cheerfully , `` I guess I 'll find something if I hunt around lively ."
I almost always do . ''
"He forgot his shyness ; his face flushed hopefully , and he looked straight at the doctor with his bright , earnest eyes ."
The doctor poked the fire energetically and looked very wise .
But just then the girls came up and carried Bertie off to display their holiday gifts .
And there was a fur cap and a pair of mittens for him !
He wondered whether he was dreaming .
"`` And here 's a picture-book for William John , '' said Amy , `` and there is a sled out in the kitchen for him ."
"Oh , there 's the dinner-bell ."
I 'm awfully hungry .
"Papa says that is my ` normal condition , ' but I do n't know what that means . ''"
"As for that dinner -- Bertie might sometimes have seen such a repast in delightful dreams , but certainly never out of them ."
It was a feast to be dated from .
"When the plum pudding came on , the doctor , who had been notably silent , leaned back in his chair , placed his finger-tips together , and looked critically at Bertie ."
`` So Mr. Sampson ca n't keep you ? ''
Bertie 's face sobered at once .
He had almost forgotten his responsibilities .
"`` No , sir ."
He says I 'm too small for the heavy work . ''
"`` Well , you are rather small -- but no doubt you will grow ."
Boys have a queer habit of doing that .
I think you know how to make yourself useful .
I need a boy here to run errands and look after my horse .
"If you like , I 'll try you ."
"You can live here , and go to school ."
"I sometimes hear of places for boys in my rounds , and the first good one that will suit you , I 'll bespeak for you ."
How will that do ? ''
"cried Alan , and he stood for a moment , wringing his mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity ."
"`` It 's the bare truth , '' he said , and drew his sword ."
"But before I could touch his blade with mine , he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground ."
"`` Na , na , '' he kept saying , `` na , na -- I cannae , I cannae . ''"
"At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me ; and I found myself only sick , and sorry , and blank , and wondering at myself ."
"I would have given the world to take back what I had said ; but a word once spoken , who can recapture it ?"
"I minded me of all Alan 's kindness and courage in the past , how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil days ; and then recalled my own insults , and saw that I had lost for ever that doughty friend ."
"At the same time , the sickness that hung upon me seemed to redouble , and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness ."
I thought I must have swooned where I stood .
This it was that gave me a thought .
"No apology could blot out what I had said ; it was needless to think of one , none could cover the offence ; but where an apology was vain , a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to my side ."
I put my pride away from me .
`` Alan ! ''
"I said ; `` if ye cannae help me , I must just die here . ''"
"He started up sitting , and looked at me ."
"`` It 's true , '' said I. `` I 'm by with it ."
"O , let me get into the bield of a house -- I 'll can die there easier . ''"
"I had no need to pretend ; whether I chose or not , I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone ."
`` Can ye walk ? ''
asked Alan .
"`` No , '' said I , `` not without help ."
This last hour my legs have been fainting under me ; I 've a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron ; I cannae breathe right .
"If I die , ye 'll can forgive me , Alan ?"
"In my heart , I liked ye fine -- even when I was the angriest . ''"
"`` Wheesht , wheesht ! ''"
cried Alan .
`` Dinna say that !
"David man , ye ken -- '' He shut his mouth upon a sob ."
"`` Let me get my arm about ye , '' he continued ; `` that 's the way !"
Now lean upon me hard .
Gude kens where there 's a house !
"We 're in Balwhidder , too ; there should be no want of houses , no , nor friends ' houses here ."
"But you must not think that Peter Pan was a boy to pity rather than to admire ; if Maimie began by thinking this , she soon found she was very much mistaken ."
"Her eyes glistened with admiration when he told her of his adventures , especially of how he went to and fro between the island and the Gardens in the Thrush 's Nest ."
` How romantic ! '
"Maimie exclaimed , but this was another unknown word , and he hung his head thinking she was despising him . '"
I suppose Tony would not have done that ? '
he said very humbly .
"` Never , never ! '"
"she answered with conviction , ` he would have been afraid . '"
` What is afraid ? '
asked Peter longingly .
He thought it must be some splendid thing . '
"I do wish you would teach me how to be afraid , Maimie , ' he said . '"
"I believe no one could teach that to you , ' she answered adoringly , but Peter thought she meant that he was stupid ."
"She had told him about Tony and of the wicked thing she did in the dark to frighten him -LRB- she knew quite well that it was wicked -RRB- , but Peter misunderstood her meaning and said , ` Oh , how I wish I was as brave as Tony ! '"
It quite irritated her .
"` You are twenty thousand times braver than Tony , ' she said ; ` you are ever so much the bravest boy I ever knew . '"
"He could scarcely believe she meant it , but when he did believe he screamed with joy ."
"` And if you want very much to give me a kiss , ' Maimie said , ` you can do it . '"
Very reluctantly Peter began to take the thimble off his finger .
He thought she wanted it back . '
"I do n't mean a kiss , ' she said hurriedly , ' I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
Peter asked .
"` It 's like this , ' she said , and kissed him . '"
"I should love to give you a thimble , ' Peter said gravely , so he gave her one ."
"He gave her quite a number of thimbles , and then a delightful idea came into his head ."
"` Maimie , ' he said , ` will you marry me ? '"
"-LSB- Illustration : ` My Lord Duke , ' said the physician elatedly , ' I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love ' -RSB- Now , strange to tell , the same idea had come at exactly the same time into Maimie 's head . '"
"I should like to , ' she answered , ` but will there be room in your boat for two ? '"
"` If you squeeze close , ' he said eagerly ."
` Perhaps the birds would be angry ? '
"He assured her that the birds would love to have her , though I am not so certain of it myself ."
"`` I want none of your money , '' said I , `` but what you owe my father ."
"I 'll get you one glass , and no more . ''"
"When I brought it to him , he seized it greedily and drank it out ."
"`` Aye , aye , '' said he , `` that 's some better , sure enough ."
"And now , matey , did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth ? ''"
"`` A week at least , '' said I. `` Thunder ! ''"
he cried .
`` A week !
I ca n't do that ; they 'd have the black spot on me by then .
"The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment ; lubbers as could n't keep what they got , and want to nail what is another 's ."
"Is that seamanly behaviour , now , I want to know ?"
But I 'm a saving soul .
"I never wasted good money of mine , nor lost it neither ; and I 'll trick 'em again ."
I 'm not afraid on 'em .
"I 'll shake out another reef , matey , and daddle 'em again . ''"
"As he was thus speaking , he had risen from bed with great difficulty , holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out , and moving his legs like so much dead weight ."
"His words , spirited as they were in meaning , contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered ."
He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge .
"`` That doctor 's done me , '' he murmured ."
`` My ears is singing .
Lay me back . ''
"Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place , where he lay for a while silent ."
"`` Jim , '' he said at length , `` you saw that seafaring man today ? ''"
`` Black Dog ? ''
I asked .
`` Ah !
"Black Dog , '' says he ."
`` HE 'S a bad un ; but there 's worse that put him on .
"Now , if I ca n't get away nohow , and they tip me the black spot , mind you , it 's my old sea-chest they 're after ; you get on a horse -- you can , ca n't you ?"
"Well , then , you get on a horse , and go to -- well , yes , I will !"
"-- to that eternal doctor swab , and tell him to pipe all hands -- magistrates and sich -- and he 'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow -- all old Flint 's crew , man and boy , all on 'em that 's left ."
"I was first mate , I was , old Flint 's first mate , and I 'm the on ' y one as knows the place ."
"`` Let us go around to the Point , '' she said ."
`` Have you matches ?
No ?
"Emily , get some ."
We must light a bonfire at least .
And bring Father 's glass . ''
"`` It is not a fit night for you to be out , '' said Alan anxiously ."
`` You are sheltered here -- you do n't feel it -- but it 's a fearful storm down there . ''
`` I am not afraid of the storm .
It will not hurt me .
Let us hurry .
It is growing dark already . ''
In silence they breasted their way to the shore and around the headland .
"Arriving opposite Philip 's Point , a lull in the sleet permitted them to see the sunken schooner and the clinging figure ."
Lynde waved her hand to him and they saw him wave back .
"`` It wo n't be necessary to light a fire now that he has seen us , '' said Lynde ."
`` Nothing can be done with village help till morning and that man can never cling there so long .
"He will freeze to death , for it is growing colder every minute ."
His only chance is to swim ashore if he can swim .
The danger will be when he comes near shore ; the undertow of the backwater on the quicksand will sweep him away and in his probably exhausted condition he may not be able to make head against it . ''
"`` He knows that , doubtless , and that is why he has n't attempted to swim ashore before this , '' said Alan ."
`` But I 'll meet him in the backwater and drag him in . ''
"`` You -- you 'll risk your own life , '' cried Lynde ."
"`` There is a little risk certainly , but I do n't think there is a great one ."
"Anyhow , the attempt must be made , '' said Alan quietly ."
Suddenly Lynde 's composure forsook her .
She wrung her hands .
"`` I ca n't let you do it , '' she cried wildly ."
`` You might be drowned -- there 's every risk .
You do n't know the force of that backwater .
"Alan , Alan , do n't think of it . ''"
She caught his arm in her white wet hands and looked into his face with passionate pleading .
`` Would ye lie there idle ? ''
cried Matcham .
`` Let us back into the open .
We have the better chance ; he can not steal upon us unawares . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick ."
"`` My time is come , and peradventure he may pass us by . ''"
"`` Bend me , then , your bow ! ''"
cried the other .
`` What !
will ye be a man ? ''
Dick crossed himself .
`` Would ye have me shoot upon a leper ? ''
he cried .
`` The hand would fail me .
"Nay , now , '' he added -- `` nay , now , let be !"
"With sound men I will fight , but not with ghosts and lepers ."
"Which this is , I wot not ."
"One or other , Heaven be our protection ! ''"
"`` Now , '' said Matcham , `` if this be man 's courage , what a poor thing is man !"
"But sith ye will do naught , let us lie close . ''"
"Then came a single , broken jangle on the bell ."
"`` He hath missed his hold upon the clapper , '' whispered Matcham ."
`` Saints !
how near he is ! ''
But Dick answered never a word ; his teeth were near chattering .
"Soon they saw a piece of the white robe between some bushes ; then the leper 's head was thrust forth from behind a trunk , and he seemed narrowly to scan the neighbourhood before he once again withdrew ."
"To their stretched senses , the whole bush appeared alive with rustlings and the creak of twigs ; and they heard the beating of each other 's heart ."
"Suddenly , with a cry , the leper sprang into the open close by , and ran straight upon the lads ."
"They , shrieking aloud , separated and began to run different ways ."
"But their horrible enemy fastened upon Matcham , ran him swiftly down , and had him almost instantly a prisoner ."
"The lad gave one scream that echoed high and far over the forest , he had one spasm of struggling , and then all his limbs relaxed , and he fell limp into his captor 's arms ."
Dick heard the cry and turned .
"`` Why , '' I cried , `` the squire 's a gentleman ."
"And besides , if we got rid of the others , we should want you to help work the vessel home . ''"
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` so you would . ''"
And he seemed very much relieved .
"`` Now , I 'll tell you what , '' he went on ."
"`` So much I 'll tell you , and no more ."
I were in Flint 's ship when he buried the treasure ; he and six along -- six strong seamen .
"They was ashore nigh on a week , and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS ."
"One fine day up went the signal , and here come Flint by himself in a little boat , and his head done up in a blue scarf ."
"The sun was getting up , and mortal white he looked about the cutwater ."
"But , there he was , you mind , and the six all dead -- dead and buried ."
"How he done it , not a man aboard us could make out ."
"It was battle , murder , and sudden death , leastways -- him against six ."
"Billy Bones was the mate ; Long John , he was quartermaster ; and they asked him where the treasure was ."
"` Ah , ' says he , ` you can go ashore , if you like , and stay , ' he says ; ` but as for the ship , she 'll beat up for more , by thunder ! '"
That 's what he said .
"`` Well , I was in another ship three years back , and we sighted this island ."
"` Boys , ' said I , ` here 's Flint 's treasure ; let 's land and find it . '"
"The cap'n was displeased at that , but my messmates were all of a mind and landed ."
"Twelve days they looked for it , and every day they had the worse word for me , until one fine morning all hands went aboard ."
"` As for you , Benjamin Gunn , ' says they , ` here 's a musket , ' they says , ` and a spade , and pick-axe ."
"You can stay here and find Flint 's money for yourself , ' they says ."
"`` Well , Jim , three years have I been here , and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this ."
"But now , you look here ; look at me ."
Do I look like a man before the mast ?
"No , says you ."
"Nor I were n't , neither , I says . ''"
And with that he winked and pinched me hard .
"`` Just you mention them words to your squire , Jim , '' he went on ."
"`` Nor he were n't , neither -- that 's the words ."
"Three years he were the man of this island , light and dark , fair and rain ; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer -LRB- says you -RRB- , and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother , so be as she 's alive -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- ; but the most part of Gunn 's time -LRB- this is what you 'll say -RRB- -- the most part of his time was took up with another matter ."
"And then you 'll give him a nip , like I do . ''"
"And I love you , Eve . ''"
Mollie lowered her eyes and the long fringe of her lashes lay in a burnished semi-circle on her cheek .
"`` I think , '' she said slowly , `` that it must have been very delightful in Eden ."
"But we are not really there , you know -- we are only playing that we are ."
And it is time for me to go back .
I must get the breakfast -- that sounds too prosaic for paradise . ''
Murray bent still closer .
"`` Before we remember that we are only playing at paradise , will you kiss me , dear Eve ? ''"
"`` You are very audacious , '' said Mollie coldly ."
"`` We are in Eden yet , '' he urged ."
`` That makes all the difference . ''
"`` Well , '' said Mollie ."
And Murray kissed her .
They had passed back over the fern path and were in the pasture before either spoke again .
"Then Murray said , `` We have left Eden behind -- but we can always return there when we will ."
"And although we were only playing at paradise , I was not playing at love ."
"I meant all I said , Mollie . ''"
`` Have you meant it often ? ''
asked Mollie significantly .
"`` I never meant it -- or even played at it -- before , '' he answered ."
`` I did -- at one time -- contemplate the possibility of playing at it .
But that was long ago -- as long ago as last night .
"I am glad to the core of my soul that I decided against it before I met you , dear Eve ."
I have the letter of decision in my coat pocket this moment .
I mean to mail it this afternoon . '' ''
"` Curiosity knows no gender , ' '' quoted Mollie ."
"`` Then , to satisfy your curiosity , I must bore you with some personal history ."
"My parents died when I was a little chap , and my uncle brought me up ."
"He has been immensely good to me , but he is a bit of a tyrant ."
Recently he picked out a wife for me -- the daughter of an old sweetheart of his .
I have never even seen her .
But she has arrived in town on a visit to some relatives there .
"As soon as the ceremony was over , Captain Harmon had to sail in his vessel ."
He was going to China .
Father and I came back home .
Nobody knew -- not even Emily .
He said we must not tell Mother until she was better .
But she was never better .
She only lived three months more -- she lived them happily and at rest .
"When I think of that , I am not sorry for what I did ."
Captain Harmon said he would be back in the fall to claim me .
"I waited , sick at heart ."
But he did not come -- he has never come .
We have never heard a word of or about him since .
Sometimes I feel sure he can not be still living .
"But never a day dawns that I do n't say to myself , ` Perhaps he will come today ' -- and , oh -- '' She broke down again , sobbing bitterly ."
"Amid all the daze of his own pain Alan realized that , at any cost , he must not make it harder for her by showing his suffering ."
"He tried to speak calmly , wisely , as a disinterested friend ."
`` Could it not be discovered whether your -- this man -- is or is not living ?
Surely your father could find out . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` No , he says he has no way of doing so ."
"We do not know if Captain Harmon had any relatives or even where his home was , and it was his own ship in which he sailed ."
"Father would be glad to think that Frank Harmon was dead , but he does not think he is ."
"He says he was always a fickle-minded fellow , one fancy driving another out of his mind ."
"Oh , I can bear my own misery -- but to think what I have brought on you !"
I never dreamed that you could care for me .
I was so lonely and your friendship was so pleasant -- can you ever forgive me ? ''
"`` There is nothing to forgive , as far as you are concerned , Lynde , '' said Alan steadily ."
`` You have done me no wrong .
I have loved you sincerely and such love can be nothing but a blessing to me .
I only wish that I could help you .
It wrings my heart to think of your position .
But I can do nothing -- nothing .
"`` The boy who broke the rule last Friday , at afternoon recess , will come to the desk , '' said Mr. Acton in his most impressive manner ."
"If a thunderbolt had fallen through the roof it would hardly have caused a greater surprise than the sight of Jack Minot walking slowly down the aisle , with a wrathful flash in the eyes he turned on Joe as he passed him ."
"`` Now , Minot , let us have this over as soon as possible , for I do not like it any better than you do , and I am sure there is some mistake ."
I 'm told you went to the shop on Friday .
Is it true ? ''
"asked Mr. Acton very gently , for he liked Jack and seldom had to correct him in any way ."
"`` Yes , sir ; '' and Jack looked up as if proud to show that he was not afraid to tell the truth as far as he could ."
`` To buy something ? ''
"`` No , sir . ''"
`` To meet someone ? ''
"`` Yes , sir . ''"
`` Was it Jerry Shannon ? ''
"No answer , but Jack 's fists doubled up of themselves as he shot another fiery glance at Joe , whose face burned as if it scorched him ."
`` I am told it was ; also that you were seen to go into the saloon with him .
Did you ? ''
"and Mr. Acton looked so sure that it was a mistake that it cost Jack a great effort to say , slowly , -- `` Yes , sir . ''"
"Quite a thrill pervaded the school at this confession , for Jerry was one of the wild fellows the boys all shunned , and to have any dealings with him was considered a very disgraceful thing ."
`` Did you play ? ''
"`` No , sir ."
I ca n't . ''
`` Drink beer ? ''
"`` I belong to the Lodge ; '' and Jack stood as erect as any little soldier who ever marched under a temperance banner , and fought for the cause none are too young nor too old to help along ."
`` I was sure of that .
"Then what took you there , my boy ? ''"
"The question was so kindly put that Jack forgot himself an instant , and blurted out , -- `` I only went to pay him some money , sir . ''"
"`` Ah , how much ? ''"
"`` Two seventy-five , '' muttered Jack , as red as a cherry at not being able to keep a secret better ."
`` Too much for a lad like you to owe such a fellow as Jerry .
How came it ? ''
And Mr. Acton looked disturbed .
"Jack opened his lips to speak , but shut them again , and stood looking down with a little quiver about the mouth that showed how much it cost him to be silent ."
`` Does any one beside Jerry know of this ? ''
I am the daughter of a criminal and I am no fit wife for Alan Douglas .
"No , Alan , do n't plead , please ."
I wo n't think differently -- I never can . ''
There was a ring of finality in her tone that struck dismay to Alan 's heart .
"He prepared to entreat and argue , but before he could utter a word , the boughs behind them parted and Captain Anthony stepped down from the bank ."
"`` I 've been listening , '' he announced coolly , `` and I think it high time I took a share in the conversation ."
"You seem to have run up against a snag , Mr. Douglas ."
You say Frank Harmon is dead .
That 's good riddance if it 's true .
Is it true ? ''
`` His brother declares it is . ''
"`` Well , then , I 'll help you all I can ."
"I like you , Mr. Douglas , and I happen to be fond of Lynde , too -- though you may n't believe it ."
I 'm fond of her for her mother 's sake and I 'd like to see her happy .
I did n't want to give her to Harmon that time three years ago but I could n't help myself .
"He had the upper hand , curse him ."
"It was n't for my own sake , though -- it was for my wife 's ."
"However , that 's all over and done with and I 'll do the best I can to atone for it ."
"So you wo n't marry your minister because your father was not a good man , Lynde ?"
"Well , I do n't suppose he was a very good man -- a man who makes his wife 's life a hell , even in a refined way , is n't exactly a saint , to my way of thinking ."
"But that 's the worst that could be said of him and it does n't entail any indelible disgrace on his family , I suppose ."
"I am not your father , Lynde . ''"
`` Not my father ? ''
Lynde echoed the words blankly .
`` No .
Your father was your mother 's first husband .
She never told you of him .
"When I said he made her life a hell , I said the truth , no more , no less ."
"I had loved your mother ever since I was a boy , Lynde ."
But she was far above me in station and I never dreamed it was possible to win her love .
She married James Ashley .
"He was a gentleman , so called -- and he did n't kick or beat her ."
A sweet pretty place you have of it here .
"Ah , there 's Jim !"
"The top of the morning to you , Jim ."
"Doctor , here 's my service ."
"Why , there you all are together like a happy family , in a manner of speaking . ''"
"`` If you have anything to say , my man , better say it , '' said the captain ."
"`` Right you were , Cap'n Smollett , '' replied Silver ."
"`` Dooty is dooty , to be sure ."
"Well now , you look here , that was a good lay of yours last night ."
I do n't deny it was a good lay .
Some of you pretty handy with a handspike-end .
And I 'll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook -- maybe all was shook ; maybe I was shook myself ; maybe that 's why I 'm here for terms .
"But you mark me , cap'n , it wo n't do twice , by thunder !"
We 'll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the rum .
Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind 's eye .
"But I 'll tell you I was sober ; I was on ' y dog tired ; and if I 'd awoke a second sooner , I 'd ' a caught you at the act , I would ."
"He was n't dead when I got round to him , not he . ''"
`` Well ? ''
says Captain Smollett as cool as can be .
"All that Silver said was a riddle to him , but you would never have guessed it from his tone ."
"As for me , I began to have an inkling ."
Ben Gunn 's last words came back to my mind .
"I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire , and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with ."
"`` Well , here it is , '' said Silver ."
"`` We want that treasure , and we 'll have it -- that 's our point !"
"You would just as soon save your lives , I reckon ; and that 's yours ."
"You have a chart , have n't you ? ''"
"`` That 's as may be , '' replied the captain ."
"`` Oh , well , you have , I know that , '' returned Long John ."
"`` You need n't be so husky with a man ; there ai n't a particle of service in that , and you may lay to it ."
"What I mean is , we want your chart ."
"Now , I never meant you no harm , myself . ''"
Rich !
I says .
"And I 'll tell you what : I 'll make a man of you , Jim ."
"Ah , Jim , you 'll bless your stars , you will , you was the first that found me ! ''"
"And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face , and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes ."
"`` Now , Jim , you tell me true : that ai n't Flint 's ship ? ''"
he asked .
At this I had a happy inspiration .
"I began to believe that I had found an ally , and I answered him at once ."
"`` It 's not Flint 's ship , and Flint is dead ; but I 'll tell you true , as you ask me -- there are some of Flint 's hands aboard ; worse luck for the rest of us . ''"
`` Not a man -- with one -- leg ? ''
he gasped .
`` Silver ? ''
I asked .
"`` Ah , Silver ! ''"
says he .
`` That were his name . ''
"`` He 's the cook , and the ringleader too . ''"
"He was still holding me by the wrist , and at that he give it quite a wring ."
"`` If you was sent by Long John , '' he said , `` I 'm as good as pork , and I know it ."
"But where was you , do you suppose ? ''"
"I had made my mind up in a moment , and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves ."
"He heard me with the keenest interest , and when I had done he patted me on the head ."
"`` You 're a good lad , Jim , '' he said ; `` and you 're all in a clove hitch , ai n't you ?"
"Well , you just put your trust in Ben Gunn -- Ben Gunn 's the man to do it ."
"Would you think it likely , now , that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help -- him being in a clove hitch , as you remark ? ''"
I told him the squire was the most liberal of men .
"`` Aye , but you see , '' returned Ben Gunn , `` I did n't mean giving me a gate to keep , and a suit of livery clothes , and such ; that 's not my mark , Jim ."
"What I mean is , would he be likely to come down to the toon of , say one thousand pounds out of money that 's as good as a man 's own already ? ''"
"`` I am sure he would , '' said I. `` As it was , all hands were to share . ''"
`` AND a passage home ? ''
he added with a look of great shrewdness .
"` Then , ' said Peter , not without grimness , ` step in , if you feel so sure of her , ' and he helped Maimie into the Thrush 's Nest ."
` But why do n't you look at me ? '
"she asked , taking him by the arm ."
"Peter tried hard not to look , he tried to push off , then he gave a great gulp and jumped ashore and sat down miserably in the snow ."
She went to him .
"` What is it , dear , dear Peter ? '"
"she said , wondering . '"
"O Maimie , ' he cried , ` it is n't fair to take you with me if you think you can go back !"
Your mother ' -- he gulped again -- ` you do n't know them as well as I do . '
"And then he told her the woeful story of how he had been barred out , and she gasped all the time ."
"` But my mother , ' she said , ' my mother -- ' ` Yes , she would , ' said Peter , ` they are all the same ."
I dare say she is looking for another one already . '
"Maimie said aghast , ' I ca n't believe it ."
"You see , when you went away your mother had none , but my mother has Tony , and surely they are satisfied when they have one . '"
"Peter replied bitterly , ` You should see the letters Solomon gets from ladies who have six . '"
"Just then they heard a grating creak , followed by creak , creak , all round the Gardens ."
"It was the Opening of the Gates , and Peter jumped nervously into his boat ."
"He knew Maimie would not come with him now , and he was trying bravely not to cry ."
But Maimie was sobbing painfully .
"` If I should be too late , ' she said in agony , ' O Peter , if she has got another one already ! '"
Again he sprang ashore as if she had called him back . '
"I shall come and look for you to-night , ' he said , squeezing close , ` but if you hurry away I think you will be in time . '"
"Then he pressed a last thimble on her sweet little mouth , and covered his face with his hands so that he might not see her go ."
` Dear Peter ! '
she cried .
` Dear Maimie ! '
cried the tragic boy .
"She leapt into his arms , so that it was a sort of fairy wedding , and then she hurried away ."
"Oh , how she hastened to the gates !"
"Peter , you may be sure , was back in the Gardens that night as soon as Lock-out sounded , but he found no Maimie , and so he knew she had been in time ."
"For long he hoped that some night she would come back to him ; often he thought he saw her waiting for him by the shore of the Serpentine as his bark drew to land , but Maimie never went back ."
"She wanted to , but she was afraid that if she saw her dear Betwixt-and-Between again she would linger with him too long , and besides the ayah now kept a sharp eye on her ."
Sore bested ? ''
returned the knight .
"`` Nay , then , we will make speed sitting down , good Richard ."
"As the world goes in this poor realm of England , he that rides softliest rides surest ."
"Delay , they say , begetteth peril ; but it is rather this itch of doing that undoes men ; mark it , Dick ."
"But let me see , first , what cattle ye have brought ."
"Selden , a link here at the door ! ''"
"And Sir Daniel strode forth into the village street , and , by the red glow of a torch , inspected his new troops ."
He was an unpopular neighbour and an unpopular master ; but as a leader in war he was well-beloved by those who rode behind his pennant .
"His dash , his proved courage , his forethought for the soldiers ' comfort , even his rough gibes , were all to the taste of the bold blades in jack and salet ."
"`` Nay , by the rood ! ''"
"he cried , `` what poor dogs are these ?"
"Here be some as crooked as a bow , and some as lean as a spear ."
"Friends , ye shall ride in the front of the battle ; I can spare you , friends ."
Mark me this old villain on the piebald !
A two-year mutton riding on a hog would look more soldierly !
Ha !
"Clipsby , are ye there , old rat ?"
"Y ' are a man I could lose with a good heart ; ye shall go in front of all , with a bull 's eye painted on your jack , to be the better butt for archery ; sirrah , ye shall show me the way . ''"
"`` I will show you any way , Sir Daniel , but the way to change sides , '' returned Clipsby , sturdily ."
Sir Daniel laughed a guffaw .
"`` Why , well said ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Hast a shrewd tongue in thy mouth , go to !"
I will forgive you for that merry word .
"Selden , see them fed , both man and brute . ''"
The knight re-entered the inn .
"`` Now , friend Dick , '' he said , `` fall to ."
Here is good ale and bacon .
"Eat , while that I read . ''"
"Sir Daniel opened the packet , and as he read his brow darkened ."
"When he had done he sat a little , musing ."
So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies . '
"She gave him a look of the most intense admiration , and he thought it was because he had run away , but it was really because he knew fairies ."
Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful .
"She poured out questions about them , to his surprise , for they were rather a nuisance to him , getting in his way and so on , and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding ."
"Still , he liked them on the whole , and he told her about the beginning of fairies ."
"` You see , Wendy , when the first baby laughed for the first time , its laugh broke into a thousand pieces , and they all went skipping about , and that was the beginning of fairies . '"
"Tedious talk this , but being a stay-at-home she liked it ."
"` And so , ' he went on good-naturedly , ` there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl . '"
` Ought to be ?
Is n't there ? '
` No .
"You see children know such a lot now , they soon do n't believe in fairies , and every time a child says , ' I do n't believe in fairies , ' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead ."
"Really , he thought they had now talked enough about fairies , and it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet . '"
"I ca n't think where she has gone to , ' he said , rising , and he called Tink by name ."
Wendy 's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill .
"` Peter , ' she cried , clutching him , ` you do n't mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room ! '"
"` She was here just now , ' he said a little impatiently ."
"` You do n't hear her , do you ? '"
and they both listened .
"` The only sound I hear , ' said Wendy , ` is like a tinkle of bells . '"
"` Well , that 's Tink , that 's the fairy language ."
I think I hear her too . '
"The sound came from the chest of drawers , and Peter made a merry face ."
"No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter , and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh ."
He had his first laugh still .
"` Wendy , ' he whispered gleefully , ' I do believe I shut her up in the drawer ! '"
"He let poor Tink out of the drawer , and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury ."
"` You should n't say such things , ' Peter retorted ."
"` Of course I 'm very sorry , but how could I know you were in the drawer ? '"
Wendy was not listening to him . '
"O Peter , ' she cried , ` if she would only stand still and let me see her ! '"
"` They hardly ever stand still , ' he said , but for one moment Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock . '"
"If you 'll come up one by one , unarmed , I 'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England ."
"If you wo n't , my name is Alexander Smollett , I 've flown my sovereign 's colours , and I 'll see you all to Davy Jones ."
You ca n't find the treasure .
You ca n't sail the ship -- there 's not a man among you fit to sail the ship .
"You ca n't fight us -- Gray , there , got away from five of you ."
"Your ship 's in irons , Master Silver ; you 're on a lee shore , and so you 'll find ."
"I stand here and tell you so ; and they 're the last good words you 'll get from me , for in the name of heaven , I 'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you ."
"Tramp , my lad ."
"Bundle out of this , please , hand over hand , and double quick . ''"
Silver 's face was a picture ; his eyes started in his head with wrath .
He shook the fire out of his pipe .
`` Give me a hand up ! ''
he cried .
"`` Not I , '' returned the captain ."
`` Who 'll give me a hand up ? ''
he roared .
Not a man among us moved .
"Growling the foulest imprecations , he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch ."
Then he spat into the spring .
`` There ! ''
he cried .
`` That 's what I think of ye .
"Before an hour 's out , I 'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon ."
"Laugh , by thunder , laugh !"
"Before an hour 's out , ye 'll laugh upon the other side ."
Them that die 'll be the lucky ones . ''
"And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off , ploughed down the sand , was helped across the stockade , after four or five failures , by the man with the flag of truce , and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees ."
"21 The Attack AS soon as Silver disappeared , the captain , who had been closely watching him , turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but Gray ."
It was the first time we had ever seen him angry .
`` Quarters ! ''
he roared .
"And then , as we all slunk back to our places , `` Gray , '' he said , `` I 'll put your name in the log ; you 've stood by your duty like a seaman ."
Hook wetted his dry lips .
"` Ay , ' he said , ` that 's the fear that haunts me . '"
Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm .
"` Smee , ' he said , ` this seat is hot . '"
He jumped up .
"` Odds bobs , hammer and tongs I 'm burning . '"
"They examined the mushroom , which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland ; they tried to pull it up , and it came away at once in their hands , for it had no root ."
"Stranger still , smoke began at once to ascend ."
The pirates looked at each other . '
A chimney ! '
they both exclaimed .
They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground .
It was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood .
Not only smoke came out of it .
"There came also children 's voices , for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering ."
"The pirates listened grimly , and then replaced the mushroom ."
They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees .
` Did you hear them say Peter Pan 's from home ? '
"Smee whispered , fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew ."
Hook nodded .
"He stood for a long time lost in thought , and at last a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face ."
Smee had been waiting for it .
"` Unrip your plan , captain , ' he cried eagerly ."
"` To return to the ship , ' Hook replied slowly through his teeth , ` and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it ."
"There can be but one room below , for there is but one chimney ."
The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece .
That shows they have no mother .
We will leave the cake on the shore of the mermaids ' lagoon .
"These boys are always swimming about there , playing with the mermaids ."
"They will find the cake and they will gobble it up , because , having no mother , they do n't know how dangerous 't is to eat rich damp cake . '"
"He burst into laughter , not hollow laughter now , but honest laughter ."
"` Aha , they will die . '"
Could anything be more exciting or more useful ?
"So he put it in his pocket , and ran quickly away out of the mountain by a little door which had been left open ."
When he got home his parents asked him what he had been doing and where he had got the fine clothes he wore .
"` Oh , I earned them myself , ' answered he ."
"` You never earned them in this short time , ' said his father ."
` Be off with you ; I wo n't keep you here .
I will have no thieves in my house ! '
"` Well I only came to help you , ' replied the boy sulkily ."
"` Now I 'll be off , as you wish ; but to-morrow morning when you rise you will see a great dog at the door ."
"Do not drive it away , but take it to the castle and sell it to the duke , and they will give you ten dollars for it ; only you must bring the strap you lead it with , back to the house . '"
Sure enough the next day the dog was standing at the door waiting to be let in .
"The old man was rather afraid of getting into trouble , but his wife urged him to sell the dog as the boy had bidden him , so he took it up to the castle and sold it to the duke for ten dollars ."
"But he did not forget to take off the strap with which he had led the animal , and to carry it home ."
When he got there old Kirsten met him at the door .
"` Well , Peder , and have you sold the dog ? '"
asked she .
"` Yes , Kirsten ; and I have brought back ten dollars , as the boy told us , ' answered Peder ."
` Ay !
but that 's fine ! '
said his wife .
"` Now you see what one gets by doing as one is bid ; if it had not been for me you would have driven the dog away again , and we should have lost the money ."
"After all , I always know what is best . '"
` Nonsense ! '
said her husband ; ` women always think they know best .
I should have sold the dog just the same whatever you had told me .
"Put the money away in a safe place , and do n't talk so much . '"
"The next day Hans came again ; but though everything had turned out as he had foretold , he found that his father was still not quite satisfied ."
` Be off with you ! '
"said he , ` you 'll get us into trouble . ' '"
"I have n't helped you enough yet , ' replied the boy ."
"` To-morrow there will come a great fat cow , as big as the house ."
Take it to the king 's palace and you 'll get as much as a thousand dollars for it .
"When morning came and it was the moon's turn to sink out of sight in the west, the Owls went to bed in their hollow trees, and Crows, Blue Jays, Woodpeckers, Chickadees, Grouse, Quail, Squirrels, and Rabbits came out."
"The Goldfinches were there too, but you would never have known the husbands and fathers of the flock, unless you had seen them before in their winter clothing, which is like that worn by the wives and children. Here, too, were the winter visitors, the Snow Buntings and the Juncos, brimming over with happiness and news of their northern homes."
"This warm day made them think of the coming springtime, and they were already planning their flight."
"""I wish you would stay with us all summer,"" said a friendly Goldfinch, as he dirted the snow off from a tall brown weed and began to pick out and eat the seeds."
"""Stay all summer!"" exclaimed a jolly little Snow Bunting. ""Why should we want to stay? Perhaps if you would promise to keep the snow and ice we might."""
"""Why not ask the Goldfinches to come north with us?"" suggested a Junco."
"""That would be much more sensible, for they can stand the cold weather as well as we, but we cannot stand warm days, such as I hear they have in this part of the country after the ice melts."""
"Then the older people of the group began to talk of the cares of life and many other things which did not interest their children, so the younger ones wandered away from them."
"""I say,"" called a young Junco to a young Snow Bunting, ""wouldn't you like to show some of these playmates of ours the countries where we were born?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" answered the Snow Bunting. ""Wouldn't they open their eyes, though? I'd like to have them see the rocks up there."""
"""And the animals,"" said the Junco."
"""Yes! Wouldn't they stare at the Bears, though!"""
"""Humph,"" said a Blue Jay. ""I wouldn't care very much about seeing Bears, would you?"" And he turned to a Crow near by."
"""No,"" said the Crow. ""I don't think very much of Bears anyway."" He said this as though he had seen them all his life, but the Chickadees say that he never saw even a Cub."
"""They haven't any big animals here,"" said the Junco to the Snow Bunting."
"""Haven't we, though?"" replied the Blue Jay. ""Guess you wouldn't say that if you saw the Ground Hog. Would he say that?"" he asked, turning to the young Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits who stood around listening."
"""No indeed!"" they answered, for they wanted their visitors to understand that the Forest was a most wonderful place, and they really thought the Ground Hog very large."
"""I don't believe he is as big as a Bear"" said the Snow Bunting, with his bill in the air."
"""How big is he?"" asked the Junco."
"Now the Blue Jay was afraid that the birds from the north were getting the better of him, and he felt very sure that they would leave before the Ground Hog had finished his winter sleep, so he did what no honest bird would have even thought of doing. He held his crested head very high and said, ""He is bigger than that rock, a great deal bigger."""
"The Crow looked at the rock and gave a hoarse chuckle, for it was a hundred times larger than the Ground Hog. The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits looked at each other without saying a word. They knew how the Blue Jay had lied, and it made them ashamed. The Grouse pretended to fix their snow-shoes."
They did not want to look at the birds from the north.
"The Snow Buntings and Juncos felt that it would not do to talk about Bears to people who had such a great creature as the Ground Hog living among them. ""He must be wonderful,"" they said. ""Where does he sleep?"""
"""In the Bats' cave,"" answered the Blue Jay, who having told one lie, now had to tell another to cover it up. ""He sleeps in the middle and there is just room left around the edges for the Bats."""
"Now at this very time the Ground Hog was awake in his burrow. He could feel that it was warmer and he wanted room to stretch. He thought it would seem good to have an early spring after such a cold winter, so he decided to take a walk and make the weather, as his grandfather had done. When he came out of his burrow he heard a great chattering and went to see what was the matter. That was how it happened that soon after the Blue Jay had told about the Bats' cave, one wide-awake young Junco saw a reddish-brown animal trotting over the grass toward them."
"""Who is that?"" he cried."
"The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits gave one look. ""Oh, there is the Ground Hog!"" they cried. Then they remembered and were ashamed again because of what the Blue Jay had said."
"""Oh!"" said the Snow Buntings and the Juncos. ""So that is the Ground Hog!"
"Big as that rock, is he? And you don't think much of Bears?"""
"The Crow pointed one claw at the Blue Jay. ""I never said he was as big as that rock. He is the fellow that said it."""
"""I don't care,"" said the Blue Jay; ""I was only fooling. I meant to tell you after a while. It's a good joke on you."" But he had a sneaky look around the bill as he spoke, and nobody believed him. Before long, he and the Crow were glad enough to get away from the rest and go away together. Yet even then they were not happy, for each began to blame the other, and they had a most dreadful fight."
"When the Ground Hog was told about it he said, ""What foolishness it is to want to tell the biggest story! My grandfather told us once that a lie was always a lie, and that calling it a joke didn't make it any better. I think he was right."""
How the Raja's Son won the Princess Labam.
"In a country there was a Raja who had an only son who every day went out to hunt. One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, ""You can hunt wherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the fourth side."" This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth side he would hear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he would leave his father and mother and seek for the princess."
"The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time; but one day, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was allowed to go, he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth side, and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that side. When he got there, he found himself in a jungle, and nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in it."
"The young Raja shot at some of them, and at once they all flew away up to the sky. All, that is, but one, and this was their Raja, who was called Hiraman parrot."
"When Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the other parrots, ""Don't fly away and leave me alone when the Raja's son shoots. If you desert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam."""
"Then the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering. The prince was greatly surprised, and said, ""Why, these birds can talk!"" Then he said to the parrots, ""Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?"""
"But the parrots would not tell him where she lived. ""You can never get to the Princess Labam's country."" That is all they would say."
"The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more; and he threw his gun away, and went home. When he got home, he would not speak or eat, but lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed very ill."
"At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the Princess Labam. ""I must go,"" he said; ""I must see what she is like."
"Tell me where her country is."""
"""We do not know where it is,"" answered his father and mother."
"""Then I must go and look for it,"" said the prince."
"""No, no,"" they said, ""you must not leave us. You are our only son."
"Stay with us. You will never find the Princess Labam."""
"""I must try and find her,"" said the prince. ""Perhaps God will show me the way. If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but perhaps I shall die, and then I shall never see you again. Still I must go."""
"So they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with him. His father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse. And he took his gun, and his bow and arrows, and a great many other weapons, ""for,"" he said, ""I may want them."" His father, too, gave him plenty of rupees."
"Then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey, and he said good-bye to his father and mother; and his mother took her handkerchief and wrapped some sweetmeats in it, and gave it to her son. ""My child,"" she said to him, ""When you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats."""
"He then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he came to a jungle in which were a tank and shady trees. He bathed himself and his horse in the tank, and then sat down under a tree. ""Now,"" he said to himself, ""I will eat some of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I will drink some water, and then I will continue my journey."" He opened his handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He took out another. There was an ant in that one too. So he laid the two sweetmeats on the ground, and he took out another, and another, and another, until he had taken them all out; but in each he found an ant."
"""Never mind,"" he said, ""I won't eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall eat them."" Then the Ant-Raja came and stood before him and said, ""You have been good to us. If ever you are in trouble, think of me and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued his journey. He rode on and on until he came to another jungle, and there he saw a tiger who had a thorn in his foot, and was roaring loudly from the pain."
"""Why do you roar like that?"" said the young Raja. ""What is the matter with you?"""
"""I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years,"" answered the tiger, ""and it hurts me so; that is why I roar."""
"""Well,"" said the Raja's son, ""I will take it out for you. But perhaps, as you are a tiger, when I have made you well, you will eat me?"""
"""Oh, no,"" said the tiger, ""I won't eat you. Do make me well."""
"Then the prince took a little knife from his pocket, and cut the thorn out of the tiger's foot; but when he cut, the tiger roared louder than ever so loud that his wife heard him in the next jungle, and came bounding along to see what was the matter. The tiger saw her coming, and hid the prince in the jungle, so that she should not see him."
"""What man hurt you that you roared so loud?"" said the wife."
"""No one hurt me,"" answered the husband; ""but a Raja's son came and took the thorn out of my foot."""
"""Where is he? Show him to me,"" said his wife."
"""If you promise not to kill him, I will call him,"" said the tiger."
"""I won't kill him; only let me see him,"" answered his wife."
"""Well! well!"" said Boots; ""but now that I am here, I may as well try what I can do with him; and I will see if I can't free my brothers, who are standing turned to stone out of doors; and you, too, I will try to save, that I will."""
"""Well, if you must, you must,"" said the Princess; ""and so let us see if we can't hit on a plan. Just creep under the bed yonder, and mind and listen to what he and I talk about. But, pray, do lie as still as a mouse."""
"So he crept under the bed, and he had scarce got well underneath it, before the Giant came."
"""Ha!"" roared the Giant, ""what a smell of Christian blood there is in the house!"""
"""Yes, I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out, but all one can do, the smell doesn't go off so soon."""
"So the Giant said no more about it, and when night came, they went to bed. After they had lain a while, the Princess said:"
"""There is one thing I'd be so glad to ask you about, if I only dared."""
"""What thing is that?"" asked the Giant."
"""Only where it is you keep your heart, since you don't carry it about you,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah! that's a thing you've no business to ask about; but if you must know, it lies under the door-sill,"" said the Giant."
"""Ho! ho!"" said Boots to himself under the bed, ""then we'll soon see if we can't find it."""
"Next morning the Giant got up cruelly early, and strode off to the wood; but he was hardly out of the house before Boots and the Princess set to work to look under the door-sill for his heart; but the more they dug, and the more they hunted, the more they couldn't find it."
"""He has baulked us this time,"" said the Princess, ""but we'll try him once more."""
"So she picked all the prettiest flowers she could find, and strewed them over the door-sill, which they had laid in its right place again; and when the time came for the Giant to come home again, Boots crept under the bed. Just as he was well under, back came the Giant."
"Snuff snuff, went the Giant's nose. ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here,"" said he."
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made as much haste as I could to get it out, but I daresay it's that you smell."""
"So the Giant held his peace, and said no more about it. A little while after, he asked who it was that had strewed flowers about the door-sill."
"""Oh, I, of course,"" said the Princess."
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this?"" said the Giant."
"""Ah!"" said the Princess, ""I'm so fond of you that I couldn't help strewing them, when I knew that your heart lay under there."""
"""You don't say so,"" said the Giant; ""but after all it doesn't lie there at all."""
"So when they went to bed again in the evening, the Princess asked the Giant again where his heart was, for she said she would so like to know."
"""Well,"" said the Giant, ""if you must know, it lies away yonder in the cupboard against the wall."""
"""So, so!"" thought Boots and the Princess; ""then we'll soon try to find it."""
"Next morning the Giant was away early, and strode off to the wood, and so soon as he was gone Boots and the Princess were in the cupboard hunting for his heart, but the more they sought for it, the less they found it."
"""Well,"" said the Princess, ""we'll just try him once more."""
"So she decked out the cupboard with flowers and garlands, and when the time came for the Giant to come home, Boots crept under the bed again."
Then back came the Giant.
"Snuff snuff! ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here!"""
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess; ""for a little while since there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out of the house again; but after all my pains, I daresay it's that you smell."""
"When the Giant heard that, he said no more about it; but a little while after, he saw how the cupboard was all decked about with flowers and garlands; so he asked who it was that had done that? Who could it be but the Princess?"
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this tomfoolery?"" asked the Giant."
"""You are very good, and very clever, and very dear,"" said the Princess, smiling and giving him both her hands."
He shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.
"""So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat,"""
he said.
"""But what about the dragon and the griffin?"" asked the Princess."
"""Dear me,"" said Nigel. ""I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill them?"""
"""Don't be a silly boy,"" said the Princess, pretending to be very grown up, for, though she had been on the island time only knows how many years, she was just eighteen, and she still liked pretending. ""You haven't a sword, or a shield, or anything!"""
"""Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?"""
"""Why, yes,"" said the Princess, ""but only once in twenty-four hours, and then the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The griffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for five minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the day before."""
"""What time does he sleep today?"" asked Nigel."
"""At eleven,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah,"" said Nigel, ""can you do sums?"""
"""No,"" said the Princess sadly. ""I was never good at them."""
"""Then I must,"" said Nigel. ""I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me very unhappy. It'll take me days and days."""
"""Don't begin yet,"" said the Princess. ""You'll have plenty of time to be unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself."""
So he did. And then she told him all about herself.
"""I know I've been here a long time,"" she said, ""but I don't know what Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my wedding day. And the griffin does the housework his wings are so convenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does the cooking he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and though I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day, because my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve, and a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready."""
"Just then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks above them and a snorting sound. ""It's the dragon,"" said the Princess hurriedly."
"""Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done."" And she ran away and left him to his arithmetic."
"Now, the sum was this: ""If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down once in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier every twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does it three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in the day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls asleep?"""
"It is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a minute because you have been to a good school and have taken pains with your lessons; but it was quite otherwise with poor Nigel. He sat down to work out his sum with a piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by practice and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by rule-of-three-and-three-quarters. He tried it by decimals and by compound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube root. He tried it by addition, simple and otherwise, and he tried it by mixed examples in vulgar fractions. But it was all of no use. Then he tried to do the sum by algebra, by simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry, by logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He got an answer every time, it is true, but it was always a different one, and he could not feel sure which answer was right."
"And just as he was feeling how much more important than anything else it is to be able to do your sums, the Princess came back. And now it was getting dark."
"""Why, you've been seven hours over that sum,"" she said, ""and you haven't done it yet. Look here, this is what is written on the tablet of the statue by the lower gate. It has figures in it. Perhaps it is the answer to the sum."""
"She held out to him a big white magnolia leaf. And she had scratched on it with the pin of her pearl brooch, and it had turned brown where she had scratched it, as magnolia leaves will do. Nigel read:"
AFTER NINE DAYS         T ii. 24.
D ii. 27 Ans.
P.S. And the griffin is artificial. R.
He clapped his hands softly.
"""Dear Princess,"" he said, ""I know that's the right answer. It says R too, you see. But I'll just prove it."" So he hastily worked the sum backward in decimals and equations and conic sections, and all the rules he could think of. And it came right every time."
"""So now we must wait,"" said he. And they waited."
"And every day the Princess came to see Nigel and brought him food cooked by the dragon, and he lived in his cave, and talked to her when she was there, and thought about her when she was not, and they were both as happy as the longest day in summer. Then at last came The Day. Nigel and the Princess laid their plans."
"""You're sure he won't hurt you, my only treasure?"" said Nigel."
"Then the tiger called the Raja's son, and when he came the tiger and his wife made him a great many salaams. Then they gave him a good dinner, and he stayed with them for three days. Every day he looked at the tiger's foot, and the third day it was quite healed. Then he said good-bye to the tigers, and the tiger said to him, ""If ever you are in trouble, think of me, and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle. Here he found four fakirs whose teacher and master had died, and had left four things, a bed, which carried whoever sat on it whithersoever he wished to go; a bag, that gave its owner whatever he wanted, jewels, food, or clothes; a stone bowl that gave its owner as much water as he wanted, no matter how far he might be from a tank; and a stick and rope, to which its owner had only to say, if any one came to make war on him, ""Stick, beat as many men and soldiers as are here,"" and the stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up."
"The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things. One said, ""I want this;"" another said, ""You cannot have it, for I want it;"" and so on."
"The Raja's son said to them, ""Do not quarrel for these things. I will shoot four arrows in four different directions. Whichever of you gets to my first arrow, shall have the first thing the bed. Whosoever gets to the second arrow, shall have the second thing the bag. He who gets to the third arrow, shall have the third thing the bowl. And he who gets to the fourth arrow, shall have the last things the stick and rope."" To this they agreed, and the prince shot off his first arrow."
"Away raced the fakirs to get it. When they brought it back to him he shot off the second, and when they had found and brought it to him he shot off his third, and when they had brought him the third he shot off the fourth."
"While they were away looking for the fourth arrow the Raja's son let his horse loose in the jungle, and sat on the bed, taking the bowl, the stick and rope, and the bag with him. Then he said, ""Bed, I wish to go to the Princess Labam's country."" The little bed instantly rose up into the air and began to fly, and it flew and flew till it came to the Princess Labam's country, where it settled on the ground. The Raja's son asked some men he saw, ""Whose country is this?"""
"""The Princess Labam's country,"" they answered. Then the prince went on till he came to a house where he saw an old woman."
"""Who are you?"" she said. ""Where do you come from?"""
"""I come from a far country,"" he said; ""do let me stay with you to-night."""
"""No,"" she answered, ""I cannot let you stay with me; for our king has ordered that men from other countries may not stay in his country. You cannot stay in my house."""
"""You are my aunty,"" said the prince; ""let me remain with you for this one night. You see it is evening, and if I go into the jungle, then the wild beasts will eat me."""
"""Well,"" said the old woman, ""you may stay here to-night; but to-morrow morning you must go away, for if the king hears you have passed the night in my house, he will have me seized and put into prison."""
"Then she took him into her house, and the Raja's son was very glad."
"The old woman began preparing dinner, but he stopped her, ""Aunty,"" he said, ""I will give you food."" He put his hand into his bag, saying, ""Bag, I want some dinner,"" and the bag gave him instantly a delicious dinner, served up on two gold plates. The old woman and the Raja's son then dined together."
"When they had finished eating, the old woman said, ""Now I will fetch some water."""
"""Don't go,"" said the prince. ""You shall have plenty of water directly."" So he took his bowl and said to it, ""Bowl, I want some water,"" and then it filled with water. When it was full, the prince cried out, ""Stop, bowl,"" and the bowl stopped filling. ""See, aunty,"""
"he said, ""with this bowl I can always get as much water as I want."""
"By this time night had come. ""Aunty,"" said the Raja's son, ""why don't you light a lamp?"""
"""There is no need,"" she said. ""Our king has forbidden the people in his country to light any lamps; for, as soon as it is dark, his daughter, the Princess Labam, comes and sits on her roof, and she shines so that she lights up all the country and our houses, and we can see to do our work as if it were day."""
"When it was quite black night the princess got up. She dressed herself in her rich clothes and jewels, and rolled up her hair, and across her head she put a band of diamonds and pearls. Then she shone like the moon, and her beauty made night day. She came out of her room, and sat on the roof of her palace. In the daytime she never came out of her house; she only came out at night. All the people in her father's country then went about their work and finished it."
"The Raja's son watched the princess quietly, and was very happy. He said to himself, ""How lovely she is!"""
"At midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess came down from her roof, and went to her room; and when she was in bed and asleep, the Raja's son got up softly, and sat on his bed. ""Bed,"" he said to it, ""I want to go to the Princess Labam's bed-room."" So the little bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep."
"The young Raja took his bag and said, ""I want a great deal of betel-leaf,"" and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf. This he laid near the princess's bed, and then his little bed carried him back to the old woman's house."
"Next morning all the princess's servants found the betel-leaf, and began to eat it. ""Where did you get all that betel-leaf?"" asked the princess."
"""We found it near your bed,"" answered the servants. Nobody knew the prince had come in the night and put it all there."
"In the morning the old woman came to the Raja's son. ""Now it is morning,"" she said, ""and you must go; for if the king finds out all I have done for you, he will seize me."""
"""I am ill to-day, dear aunty,"" said the prince; ""do let me stay till to-morrow morning."""
"""Good,"" said the old woman. So he stayed, and they took their dinner out of the bag, and the bowl gave them water."
"When night came the princess got up and sat on her roof, and at twelve o'clock, when every one was in bed, she went to her bed-room, and was soon fast asleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed, and it carried him to the princess. He took his bag and said, ""Bag, I want a most lovely shawl."" It gave him a splendid shawl, and he spread it over the princess as she lay asleep. Then he went back to the old woman's house and slept till morning."
"In the morning, when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted."
"""See, mother,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given me this shawl, it is so beautiful."" Her mother was very glad too."
"""Yes, my child,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given you this splendid shawl."""
"""No! only just look,"" they said; ""there the fool sits still."""
"The next day when they went out to battle, they saw the lad sitting there still, so they laughed again, and made game of him; but as soon as ever they had ridden by, the lad ran again to the lime-tree, and all happened as on the first day. Every one wondered what strange champion it could be that had helped them, but no one got so near him as to say a word to him; and no one guessed it could be the lad; that's easy to understand."
"So when they went home at night, and saw the lad still sitting there on his hack, they burst out laughing at him again, and one of them shot an arrow at him and hit him in the leg. So he began to shriek and to bewail; 'twas enough to break one's heart; and so the King threw his pocket-handkerchief to him to bind his wound."
"When they went out to battle the third day, the lad still sat there."
"""Gee up! gee up!"" he said to his hack."
"""Nay, nay,"" said the King's men; ""if he won't stick there till he's starved to death."""
"And then they rode on, and laughed at him till they were fit to fall from their horses. When they were gone, he ran again to the lime, and came up to the battle just in the very nick of time. This day he slew the enemy's king, and then the war was over at once."
"When the battle was over, the King caught sight of his handkerchief, which the strange warrior had bound round his leg, and so it wasn't hard to find him out. So they took him with great joy between them to the palace, and the Princess, who saw him from her window, got so glad, no one can believe it."
"""Here comes my own true love,"" she said."
"Then he took the pot of ointment and rubbed himself on the leg, and after that he rubbed all the wounded, and so they all got well again in a moment."
"So he got the Princess to wife; but when he went down into the stable where his horse was on the day the wedding was to be, there it stood so dull and heavy, and hung its ears down, and wouldn't eat its corn. So when the young King for he was now a king, and had got half the kingdom spoke to him, and asked what ailed him, the Horse said:"
"""Now I have helped you on, and now I won't live any longer. So just take the sword, and cut my head off."""
"""No, I'll do nothing of the kind,"" said the young King; ""but you shall have all you want, and rest all your life."""
"""Well,"" said the Horse, ""if you don't do as I tell you, see if I don't take your life somehow."""
"So the King had to do what he asked; but when he swung the sword and was to cut his head off, he was so sorry he turned away his face, for he would not see the stroke fall. But as soon as ever he had cut off the head, there stood the loveliest Prince on the spot where the horse had stood."
"""Why, where in all the world did you come from?"" asked the King."
"""It was I who was a horse,"" said the Prince; ""for I was king of that land whose king you slew yesterday. He it was who threw this Troll's shape over me, and sold me to the Troll. But now he is slain I get my own again, and you and I will be neighbour kings, but war we will never make on one another."""
"And they didn't either; for they were friends as long as they lived, and each paid the other very many visits."
THE THREE BILLY-GOATS GRUFF
"Once on a time there were three Billy-goats, who were to go up to the hill-side to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was ""Gruff."""
"On the way up was a bridge over a burn they had to cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly Troll, with eyes as big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker."
So first of all came the youngest billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.
"""Trip, trap! trip, trap!"" went the bridge."
"""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""Oh! it is only I, the tiniest billy-goat Gruff; and I'm going up to the hill-side to make myself fat,"" said the billy-goat, with such a small voice."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" said the Troll."
"""Oh, no! pray don't take me. I'm too little, that I am,"" said the billy-goat; ""wait a bit till the second billy-goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."""
"""Well! be off with you,"" said the Troll."
A little while after came the second billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.
"""TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!"" went the bridge."
"""WHO'S THAT tripping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""Oh! It's the second billy-goat Gruff, and I'm going up to the hill-side to make myself fat,"" said the billy-goat, who hadn't such a small voice."
"The little Bats flitted along after her, and Papa Bat came behind them."
"They had been flying through the starlit forest all night, chasing the many small insects that come out after the sun has gone down, and passing in and out of the tangled branches without ever touching one."
"Indeed, Mamma Bat would have been ashamed if children of hers flew against anything in the dark. There might be some excuse for such a mistake in the daytime, for Bats' eyes do not see well then, but in the night-time! She would have scolded them well, and they would have deserved it, for Bats have the most wonderful way of feeling things before they touch them, and there are no other people in the forest who can do that. There are no other people who can tell by the feeling of the air when something is near, and the Bats made much fun of their friend, the Screech Owl, once, when he flew against a tree and fell to the ground."
And now the night was over and their mother had called them to go home.
"One of the little Bats hung back with a very cross look on his face, and twice his father had to tell him to fly faster. He was thinking how he would like to see the forest in the daytime. He had never seen the sun rise, and he wanted to do that. He had never seen any of the day-birds or the animals that awaken in the morning. He thought it was pretty mean to make poor little Bats go off to bed the minute the stars began to fade. He didn't believe what his father and mother said, that he wouldn't have a good time if he did stay up. He had coaxed and coaxed and teased and teased, but it hadn't made a bit of difference. Every morning he had to fold his wings and go to sleep in a dark crack in the rock of the cave, hanging, head downward, close to the rest of the family. Their father said that there never was a better place to sleep than in this same crack, and it certainly was easy to catch on with the hooks at the lower ends of their wings when they hung themselves up for the day. But now he just wouldn't go to bed, so there!"
"""It is your turn next,"" said Mamma Bat to him, when the rest of the children had hung themselves up."
"""I'm not going to bed,"" the little Bat answered."
"""Not going to bed!"" said his father. ""Are you crazy?"""
"""No,"" said the little Bat, ""I'm not."""
"""I don't believe the child is well,"" said Mamma Bat. ""He never acted like this before. I'm afraid he has overeaten."" And she looked very anxious."
"""I am well, and I haven't eaten too much,"" said the little Bat. ""I think you might let a fellow have some fun once in a while. I've never seen the sun in my life, and there are whole lots of birds and animals in the forest that I've only heard about."""
Papa and Mamma Bat looked at each other without speaking.
"""I won't go to bed!"" said the little Bat."
"""Very well,"" said his father. ""I shall not try to make you. Fly away at once and let us go to sleep."""
"After he had gone, Mamma Bat said, ""I suppose you did right to let him go, but it seems too bad that children have to find out for themselves the trouble that comes from disobedience."""
"The little Bat flew away feeling very brave. He guessed he knew how to take care of himself, even in daylight. He felt sorry for his brothers who were in the cave, but he made up his mind that he would tell them all about it the next night."
"The eastern sky grew brighter and brighter. It hurt his eyes to look at it, and he blinked and turned away. Then the song-birds awakened and began to sing. It was very interesting, but he thought they sang too loudly. The forest at night is a quiet place, and he didn't see the sense of shouting so, even if the sun were coming up. The night-birds never made such a fuss over the moon, and he guessed the moon was as good as the sun."
"Somebody went scampering over the grass, kicking up his heels as he ran."
"""That must be a Rabbit,"" thought the little Bat. ""The Screech Owl told me that Rabbits run in that way. I wish I could see him more plainly. I don't know what is the matter with my eyes."""
"Just then a sunbeam came slanting through the forest and fell on his furry coat as he clung to a branch. ""Ow!"" he cried. ""Ow! How warm it is!"
"I don't like that. The moonbeams do not feel so. I must fly to a shady corner."" He started to fly. Just what was the matter, he never knew. It may have been because he couldn't see well, it may have been because he was getting very tired, or it may have been because the strangeness of it all was beginning to frighten him; but at all events, he went down, down, down until he found himself pitching and tumbling around in the grass."
"A Crow had seen him fall, and cried loudly, ""Come! Come! Come!"" to his friends. The Rabbits, who were feeding near by, came scampering along, making great leaps in their haste to see what was the matter. The Goldfinches, the Robins, the Orioles, the Woodpeckers, and many other birds came fluttering up. Even a Blue Jay sat on a branch above the Bat and shrieked, ""Jay! Jay! Jay!"" to add to the excitement. And last of all, the Ground Hog appeared, coming slowly and with dignity, as a person who can remember his grandfather should do."
"""What is the cause of all this commotion?"" he asked. He might have said, ""What is the matter?"" and then they would have understood him at once, but he was too haughty for that. He thought he had to use big words once in a while to show that he could. If people didn't understand them, he was willing to explain what he meant."
"""We've found such a queer bird, sir,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, without waiting to find out what a ""commotion"" was. ""Just see him tumble around!"""
"""Bird? That is no bird,"" said a Woodpecker. ""Look at his ears and his nose. He hasn't even a bill."""
"""Well, he flies,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, ""because I saw him, so he must be a bird."""
"""Humph!"" said a Chipmunk. ""So does my cousin, the Flying Squirrel, in a way, yet he is no more bird than I am."""
"""And this fellow hasn't a feather to his skin!"" cried an Oriole."
"""I don't say that my son is right,"" said Papa Rabbit, ""but this creature has wings."" And he gave the Bat a poke that made him flutter wildly for a minute."
"""Yes, but what kind of wings?"" asked the Goldfinch. ""A pair of skinny things that grow on to his legs and have hooks on both ends."""
"""He must be a very stupid fellow, at all events,"" said the Ground Hog."
"""He doesn't talk, or walk, or eat, or even fly well. He must come of a very common family. For my part, I am not interested in persons of that kind."" And he walked away with his nose in the air."
"When it was morning the old woman said to the Raja's son, ""Now you must really go."""
"""Aunty,"" he answered, ""I am not well enough yet. Let me stay a few days longer. I will remain hidden in your house, so that no one may see me."" So the old woman let him stay."
"When it was black night, the princess put on her lovely clothes and jewels, and sat on her roof. At midnight she went to her room and went to sleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed and flew to her bed-room."
"There he said to his bag, ""Bag, I want a very, very beautiful ring."""
"The bag gave him a glorious ring. Then he took the Princess Labam's hand gently to put on the ring, and she started up very much frightened."
"""Who are you?"" she said to the prince. ""Where do you come from? Why do you come to my room?"""
"""Do not be afraid, princess,"" he said; ""I am no thief. I am a great Raja's son. Hiraman parrot, who lives in the jungle where I went to hunt, told me your name, and then I left my father and mother, and came to see you."""
"""Well,"" said the princess, ""as you are the son of such a great Raja, I will not have you killed, and I will tell my father and mother that I wish to marry you."""
"The prince then returned to the old woman's house; and when morning came the princess said to her mother, ""The son of a great Raja has come to this country, and I wish to marry him."" Her mother told this to the king."
"""Good,"" said the king; ""but if this Raja's son wishes to marry my daughter, he must first do whatever I bid him. If he fails I will kill him. I will give him eighty pounds weight of mustard seed, and out of this he must crush the oil in one day. If he cannot do this he shall die."""
"In the morning the Raja's son told the old woman that he intended to marry the princess. ""Oh,"" said the old woman, ""go away from this country, and do not think of marrying her. A great many Rajas and Rajas' sons have come here to marry her, and her father has had them all killed. He says whoever wishes to marry his daughter must first do whatever he bids him. If he can, then he shall marry the princess; if he cannot, the king will have him killed. But no one can do the things the king tells him to do; so all the Rajas and Rajas' sons who have tried have been put to death. You will be killed too, if you try. Do go away."" But the prince would not listen to anything she said."
"The king sent for the prince to the old woman's house, and his servants brought the Raja's son to the king's court-house to the king."
"There the king gave him eighty pounds of mustard seed, and told him to crush all the oil out of it that day, and bring it next morning to him to the court-house. ""Whoever wishes to marry my daughter,"" he said to the prince, ""must first do all I tell him. If he cannot, then I have him killed. So if you cannot crush all the oil out of this mustard seed, you will die."""
"The prince was very sorry when he heard this. ""How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day?"" he said to himself; ""and if I do not, the king will kill me."" He took the mustard seed to the old woman's house, and did not know what to do. At last he remembered the Ant-Raja, and the moment he did so, the Ant-Raja and his ants came to him. ""Why do you look so sad?"" said the Ant-Raja."
"The prince showed him the mustard seed, and said to him, ""How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day? And if I do not take the oil to the king to-morrow morning, he will kill me."""
"""Be happy,"" said the Ant-Raja; ""lie down and sleep; we will crush all the oil out for you during the day, and to-morrow morning you shall take it to the king."" The Raja's son lay down and slept, and the ants crushed out the oil for him. The prince was very glad when he saw the oil."
"The next morning he took it to the court-house to the king. But the king said, ""You cannot yet marry my daughter. If you wish to do so, you must first fight with my two demons and kill them."" The king a long time ago had caught two demons, and then, as he did not know what to do with them, he had shut them up in a cage. He was afraid to let them loose for fear they would eat up all the people in his country; and he did not know how to kill them. So all the kings and kings' sons who wanted to marry the Princess Labam had to fight with these demons; ""for,"" said the king to himself, ""perhaps the demons may be killed, and then I shall be rid of them."""
"When he heard of the demons the Raja's son was very sad. ""What can I do?"" he said to himself. ""How can I fight with these two demons?"" Then he thought of his tiger: and the tiger and his wife came to him and said, ""Why are you so sad?"" The Raja's son answered, ""The king has ordered me to fight with his two demons and kill them. How can I do this?"" ""Do not be frightened,"" said the tiger. ""Be happy. I and my wife will fight with them for you."""
"Then the Raja's son took out of his bag two splendid coats. They were all gold and silver, and covered with pearls and diamonds. These he put on the tigers to make them beautiful, and he took them to the king, and said to him, ""May these tigers fight your demons for me?"""
"""Yes,"" said the king, who did not care in the least who killed his demons, provided they were killed. ""Then call your demons,"" said the Raja's son, ""and these tigers will fight them."" The king did so, and the tigers and the demons fought and fought until the tigers had killed the demons."
"""That is good,"" said the king. ""But you must do something else before I give you my daughter. Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum. You must go and beat it. If you cannot do this, I will kill you."""
"The Raja's son thought of his little bed; so he went to the old woman's house and sat on his bed. ""Little bed,"" he said, ""up in the sky is the king's kettle-drum. I want to go to it."" The bed flew up with him, and the Raja's son beat the drum, and the king heard him."
"Still, when he came down, the king would not give him his daughter."
"""You have,"" he said to the prince, ""done the three things I told you to do; but you must do one thing more."" ""If I can, I will,"" said the Raja's son."
"Then the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was lying near his court-house. It was a very, very thick trunk. He gave the prince a wax hatchet, and said, ""To-morrow morning you must cut this trunk in two with this wax hatchet."""
"The Raja's son went back to the old woman's house. He was very sad, and thought that now the Raja would certainly kill him. ""I had his oil crushed out by the ants,"" he said to himself. ""I had his demons killed by the tigers. My bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum. But now what can I do? How can I cut that thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet?"""
"At night he went on his bed to see the princess. ""To-morrow,"" he said to her, ""your father will kill me."" ""Why?"" asked the princess."
"""He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet."
"How can I ever do that?"" said the Raja's son. ""Do not be afraid,"" said the princess; ""do as I bid you, and you will cut it in two quite easily."""
"Then she pulled out a hair from her head, and gave it to the prince."
"""To-morrow,"" she said, ""when no one is near you, you must say to the tree-trunk, 'The Princess Labam commands you to let yourself be cut in two by this hair.' Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax hatchet's blade."""
"""And your ruby clasps."""
And the Queen undid the clasps.
"""Now the lilies from your breast."""
The Queen gathered together the lilies.
"""And the diamonds of your little bright shoe buckles."""
The Queen pulled off her shoes.
"Then the witch stirred the stuff that was in the cauldron, and, one by one, she threw in the gold crown and the sapphire necklace and the pearl bracelets and the ruby clasps and the diamonds of the little bright shoe buckles, and last of all she threw in the lilies."
"The stuff in the cauldron boiled up in foaming flashes of yellow and blue and red and white and silver, and sent out a sweet scent, and presently the witch poured it out into a pot and set it to cool in the doorway among the snakes."
"Then she said to the Queen: ""Your child will have hair as golden as your crown, eyes as blue as your sapphires. The red of your rubies will lie on its lips, and its skin will be clear and pale as your pearls. Its soul will be white and sweet as your lilies, and your diamonds will be no clearer than its wits."""
"""Oh, thank you, thank you,"" said the Queen, ""and when will it come?"""
"""You will find it when you get home."""
"""And won't you have something for yourself?"" asked the Queen. ""Any little thing you fancy would you like a country, or a sack of jewels?"""
"""Nothing, thank you,"" said the witch. ""I could make more diamonds in a day than I should wear in a year."""
"""Well, but do let me do some little thing for you,"" the Queen went on."
"""Aren't you tired of being a witch? Wouldn't you like to be a Duchess or a Princess, or something like that?"""
"""There is one thing I should rather like,"" said the witch, ""but it's hard to get in my trade."""
"""Oh, tell me what,"" said the Queen."
"""I should like some one to love me,"" said the witch."
"Then the Queen threw her arms around the witch's neck and kissed her half a hundred times. ""Why,"" she said, ""I love you better than my life!"
"You've given me the baby and the baby shall love you too."""
"""Perhaps it will,"" said the witch, ""and when the sorrow comes, send for me. Each of your fifty kisses will be a spell to bring me to you. Now, drink up your medicine, there's a dear, and run along home."""
"So the Queen drank the stuff in the pot, which was quite cool by this time, and she went out under the fringe of snakes, and they all behaved like good Sunday-school children. Some of them even tried to drop a curtsy to her as she went by, though that is not easy when you are hanging wrong way up by your tail. But the snakes knew the Queen was friends with their mistress; so, of course, they had to do their best to be civil."
"When the Queen got home, sure enough there was the baby lying in the cradle with the Royal arms blazoned on it, crying as naturally as possible. It had pink ribbons to tie up its sleeves, so the Queen saw at once it was a girl. When the King knew this he tore his black hair with fury."
"""Oh, you silly, silly Queen!"" he said. ""Why didn't I marry a clever lady? Did you think I went to all the trouble and expense of sending you to a witch to get a girl? You knew well enough it was a boy I wanted a boy, an heir, a Prince to learn all my magic and my enchantments, and to rule the kingdom after me. I'll bet a crown my crown,"" he said, ""you never even thought to tell the witch what kind you wanted! Did you now?"""
And the Queen hung her head and had to confess that she had only asked for a child.
"""Very well, madam,"" said the King, ""very well have your own way. And make the most of your daughter, while she is a child."""
"The Queen did. All the years of her life had never held half so much happiness as now lived in each of the moments when she held her little baby in her arms. And the years went on, and the King grew more and more clever at magic, and more and more disagreeable at home, and the Princess grew more beautiful and more dear every day she lived."
"The Queen and the Princess were feeding the goldfish in the courtyard fountains with crumbs of the Princess's eighteenth birthday cake, when the King came into the courtyard, looking as black as thunder, with his black raven hopping after him. He shook his fist at his family, as indeed he generally did whenever he met them, for he was not a King with pretty home manners. The raven sat down on the edge of the marble basin and tried to peck the goldfish. It was all he could do to show that he was in the same temper as his master."
"""A girl indeed!"" said the King angrily. ""I wonder you can dare to look me in the face, when you remember how your silliness has spoiled everything."""
"""You oughtn't to speak to my mother like that,"" said the Princess. She was eighteen, and it came to her suddenly and all in a moment that she was a grown-up, so she spoke out."
The King could not utter a word for several minutes. He was too angry.
"But the Queen said, ""My dear child, don't interfere,"" quite crossly, for she was frightened."
"""It was only a short time after this that I had such trouble about making my fort. Whenever I started to dig in a place I would find some other Mole there ahead of me."""
"""And then you would have to go somewhere else, of course?"" said the Ground Hog."
"""I'd like to know why!"" said the Mole, with his glossy silver-brown fur on end. ""No indeed! I had a perfect right to dig wherever I wished, and I would tell them so, and they would have to go elsewhere. One Mole was bad-tempered enough to say that he had as much right in the meadow as anybody, and I had to tussle with him and bite him many times before he saw his mistake.... They are disagreeable people over there, but why are you going so soon? I thought we would have a good visit together."""
"""I promised to meet Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband, ""and must go."
"Good-night!"" and he trotted away."
"Not long afterward this highly respectable couple were feeding together in the moonlight. ""What do you think of the Mole?"" said she."
"""Well, er ahem,"" answered her husband. ""You know, my dear, that I do not like to talk against people, and I might better not tell you exactly what I think of him. He is a queer-looking fellow, and I always distrust anyone who will not look me in the eye. Perhaps that is not his fault, for the fur hides his eyes and he wears his ears inside of his head; but I must say that a fiercer or more disagreeable-looking snout I never saw. He has had trouble with all his old neighbors, and a fellow who cannot get along peaceably in one place will not in another. He is always talking about his rights and what he thinks  """
"""You have told me enough,"" said Mrs. Ground Hog, interrupting him."
"""Nobody ever liked a person who insists on his 'rights' every time. And such a person never enjoys life. What a pity it is!"" and she gave a sigh that shook her fat sides. ""Now, I had it all planned that he should marry and set up housekeeping, and that I should have another pleasant neighbor soon."""
"""Ah! Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband teasingly, ""I knew you would be thinking of that. You are a born matchmaker. Now I think we could stand a few bachelors around here, fine young fellows who have nothing to do but enjoy life."" And his eyes twinkled as he said it."
"""As though you did not enjoy life!"" answered his wife. ""Still, I could not wish any young Mole such a husband as this fellow. It is a great undertaking to marry a grumpy bachelor and teach him the happiness of living for others."" And she looked very solemn."
"""I suppose you found it so?"" said Mr. Ground Hog, sidling up toward her."
"""What a tease you are!"" said his wife. ""You know that I am happy."" And really, of all the couples on whom the moon looked that night, there was not a happier one than this pair of Ground Hogs; and there was not a lonelier or more miserable person than the Mole, who guarded his own rights and told people what he thought of them. But it is always so."
THE WILD TURKEYS COME
"The Wild Turkeys are a wandering people, and stay in one place only long enough to rear their young. One could hardly say that they lived in the Forest, but every year when the acorns and beechnuts were ripe, they came for a visit. It is always an exciting time when the Turkeys are seen gathering on the farther side of the river and making ready to fly over. Some of the Forest People have started for the warmer country in the South, and those who still remain are either talking over their plans for flight, or working hard, if they are to spend the winter in the North, to get their stores of food ready."
"It was so this year. One morning a Red-headed Woodpecker brought the news that the Turkeys were gathering. The Ground Hog heard of it just as he was going to sleep after a night of feeding and rambling in the edge of the meadow. One of the young Rabbits told him, and coaxed him to stay up to see the newcomers."
"""I've never seen Turkeys in my life,"" said the young Rabbit, ""and they say it is great fun to watch them. Oh, please come with me to the river-bank and see the Turkeys cross over. Please do!"""
"""Ah-h-h,"" yawned the Ground Hog. ""You might better ask somebody who has not been up all night. I am too sleepy."""
"""You won't be sleepy when you reach the river-bank,"" said the Rabbit."
"""Beside, I think there should be someone there to meet them."""
"At this, the Ground Hog raised his drooping head, opened his blinking eyes, and answered with great dignity: ""There should indeed be someone."
"I will go at once."""
"When they reached the river-bank there was a sight well worth seeing. On the farther side of the water were a great many Turkeys. Old Gobblers were there, and the mother Turkeys with their broods of children, all looking as fine as you please, in their shining black coats. When they stood in the shadow, one might think that they wore no color but the brilliant red of their heads and necks, where there were no feathers to cover their wrinkled skin. When they walked out into the sunshine, however, their feathers showed gleams of beautiful purple and green, and the Rabbit thought them the most wonderful great creatures he had ever seen."
"""Look at them now!"" he cried. ""Why do those largest ones walk up and down in front of the rest and scold them?"""
"""They are the Gobblers,"" answered the Ground Hog, ""and they are doing that to show that they are not afraid to cross the river. They strut and gobble, and strut and gobble, and say: 'Who's-afraid? Who's-afraid?'"
"until the rest are ready to fly over."""
"""Now the others are doing the same thing,"" said the Rabbit, as the mothers and young Turkeys began to strut back and forth."
"""That shows that they are willing to cross,"" answered the Ground Hog."
"""Now they will fly up to the very tops of the trees on the hill and visit there for a time. It is always so. They start from the highest point they can find. It will be some time before they come over, and I will take a short nap. Be sure to awaken me when they start. I want to welcome them to the Forest."" And the Ground Hog curled himself up beside a log and went to sleep."
The Rabbit wandered around and ate all the good things he could find.
"Then he fell to wondering how it would feel to be a bird. He thought it would be great fun to fly. To pass so swiftly through the air must be delightful, and then to sweep grandly down and alight softly on the ground without having people know that you were coming!"
"And she dragged the Rabbit out by one ear, and put him into the Boy's arms."
"That night, and for many nights after, the Velveteen Rabbit slept in the Boy's bed. At first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the Boy hugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and sometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the Rabbit could scarcely breathe. And he missed, too, those long moonlight hours in the nursery, when all the house was silent, and his talks with the Skin Horse. But very soon he grew to like it, for the Boy used to talk to him, and made nice tunnels for him under the bedclothes that he said were like the burrows the real rabbits lived in. And they had splendid games together, in whispers, when Nana had gone away to her supper and left the night-light burning on the mantelpiece. And when the Boy dropped off to sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close under his little warm chin and dream, with the Boy's hands clasped close round him all night long."
"And so time went on, and the little Rabbit was very happy-so happy that he never noticed how his beautiful velveteen fur was getting shabbier and shabbier, and his tail becoming unsewn, and all the pink rubbed off his nose where the Boy had kissed him."
"Spring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever the Boy went the Rabbit went too. He had rides in the wheelbarrow, and picnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built for him under the raspberry canes behind the flower border. And once, when the Boy was called away suddenly to go out to tea, the Rabbit was left out on the lawn until long after dusk, and Nana had to come and look for him with the candle because the Boy couldn't go to sleep unless he was there."
"He was wet through with the dew and quite earthy from diving into the burrows the Boy had made for him in the flower bed, and Nana grumbled as she rubbed him off with a corner of her apron."
Spring Time
"""You must have your old Bunny!"" she said. ""Fancy all that fuss for a toy!"""
The Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands.
"""Give me my Bunny!"" he said. ""You mustn't say that. He isn't a toy."
"He's REAL!"""
"When the little Rabbit heard that he was happy, for he knew that what the Skin Horse had said was true at last. The nursery magic had happened to him, and he was a toy no longer. He was Real. The Boy himself had said it."
"That night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love stirred in his little sawdust heart that it almost burst. And into his boot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a look of wisdom and beauty, so that even Nana noticed it next morning when she picked him up, and said, ""I declare if that old Bunny hasn't got quite a knowing expression!"""
That was a wonderful Summer!
"Near the house where they lived there was a wood, and in the long June evenings the Boy liked to go there after tea to play. He took the Velveteen Rabbit with him, and before he wandered off to pick flowers, or play at brigands among the trees, he always made the Rabbit a little nest somewhere among the bracken, where he would be quite cosy, for he was a kind-hearted little boy and he liked Bunny to be comfortable. One evening, while the Rabbit was lying there alone, watching the ants that ran to and fro between his velvet paws in the grass, he saw two strange beings creep out of the tall bracken near him."
"They were rabbits like himself, but quite furry and brand-new. They must have been very well made, for their seams didn't show at all, and they changed shape in a queer way when they moved; one minute they were long and thin and the next minute fat and bunchy, instead of always staying the same like he did. Their feet padded softly on the ground, and they crept quite close to him, twitching their noses, while the Rabbit stared hard to see which side the clockwork stuck out, for he knew that people who jump generally have something to wind them up. But he couldn't see it. They were evidently a new kind of rabbit altogether."
Summer Days
"They stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the time their noses twitched."
"""Why don't you get up and play with us?"" one of them asked."
"""I don't feel like it,"" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain that he had no clockwork."
"""Ho!"" said the furry rabbit. ""It's as easy as anything,"" And he gave a big hop sideways and stood on his hind legs."
"""I don't believe you can!"" he said."
"""I can!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I can jump higher than anything!"" He meant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn't want to say so."
"""Can you hop on your hind legs?"" asked the furry rabbit."
"That was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no hind legs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a pincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other rabbits wouldn't notice."
"""I don't want to!"" he said again."
But the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. And this one stretched out his neck and looked.
"""He hasn't got any hind legs!"" he called out. ""Fancy a rabbit without any hind legs!"" And he began to laugh."
"""I have!"" cried the little Rabbit. ""I have got hind legs! I am sitting on them!"""
"""Then stretch them out and show me, like this!"" said the wild rabbit."
"And he began to whirl round and dance, till the little Rabbit got quite dizzy."
"""I don't like dancing,"" he said. ""I'd rather sit still!"""
"But all the while he was longing to dance, for a funny new tickly feeling ran through him, and he felt he would give anything in the world to be able to jump about like these rabbits did."
"""You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir,"" said he. ""In fact, you want a good many."""
"""Well, get to work, then,"" said the dragon. ""You mend my wing, and then I'll go out and eat up all the town, and if you make a really smart job of it I'll eat you last. There!"""
"""I don't want to be eaten last, sir,"" said John."
"""Well then, I'll eat you first,"" said the dragon."
"""I don't want that, sir, either,"" said John."
"""Go on with you, you silly man,"" said the dragon, ""you don't know your own silly mind. Come, set to work."""
"""I don't like the job, sir,"" said John, ""and that's the truth. I know how easily accidents happen. It's all fair and smooth, and 'Please rivet me, and I'll eat you last' and then you get to work and you give a gentleman a bit of a nip or a dig under his rivets and then it's fire and smoke, and no apologies will meet the case."""
"""Upon my word of honor as a dragon,"" said the other."
"""I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, sir,"" said John, ""but any gentleman will give a jump and a sniff if he's nipped, and one of your sniffs would be enough for me. Now, if you'd just let me fasten you up?"""
"""It would be so undignified,"" objected the dragon."
"""We always fasten a horse up,"" said John, ""and he's the 'noble animal.'"""
"""It's all very well,"" said the dragon, ""but how do I know you'd untie me again when you'd riveted me? Give me something in pledge. What do you value most?"""
"""My hammer,"" said John. ""A blacksmith is nothing without a hammer."""
"""But you'd want that for riveting me. You must think of something else, and at once, or I'll eat you first."""
"At this moment the baby in the room above began to scream. Its mother had been so quiet that it thought she had settled down for the night, and that it was time to begin."
"""Whatever's that?"" said the dragon, starting so that every plate on his body rattled."
"""It's only the baby,"" said John."
"""What's that?"" asked the dragon. ""Something you value?"""
"""Well, yes, sir, rather,"" said the blacksmith."
"""Then bring it here,"" said the dragon, ""and I'll take care of it till you've done riveting me, and you shall tie me up."""
"""All right, sir,"" said John, ""but I ought to warn you. Babies are poison to dragons, so I don't deceive you. It's all right to touch but don't you go putting it into your mouth. I shouldn't like to see any harm come to a nice-looking gentleman like you."""
"The dragon purred at this compliment and said: ""All right, I'll be careful. Now go and fetch the thing, whatever it is."""
"So John ran up the steps as quickly as he could, for he knew that if the dragon got impatient before it was fastened, it could heave up the roof of the dungeon with one heave of its back, and kill them all in the ruins. His wife was asleep, in spite of the baby's cries; and John picked up the baby and took it down and put it between the dragon's front paws."
"""You just purr to it, sir,"" he said, ""and it'll be as good as gold."""
"So the dragon purred, and his purring pleased the baby so much that it stopped crying."
"Then John rummaged among the heap of old iron and found there some heavy chains and a great collar that had been made in the days when men sang over their work and put their hearts into it, so that the things they made were strong enough to bear the weight of a thousand years, let alone a dragon."
"John fastened the dragon up with the collar and the chains, and when he had padlocked them all on safely he set to work to find out how many rivets would be needed."
"""Six, eight, ten twenty, forty,"" said he. ""I haven't half enough rivets in the shop. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll step around to another forge and get a few dozen. I won't be a minute."""
"And off he went, leaving the baby between the dragon's fore-paws, laughing and crowing with pleasure at the very large purr of it."
"John ran as hard as he could into the town, and found the mayor and corporation."
"""There's a dragon in my dungeon,"" he said; ""I've chained him up. Now come and help to get my baby away."""
"""What would I have done without your help?"" she said. ""I was so dreadfully frightened. Don't you see how my paws are shaking still?"" And she held out the prettiest little paws imaginable for him to see."
"Then Mr. Red Squirrel's heart began to thump very fast and hard beneath the white fur of his chest, and he sighed softly. ""I wish I might always help you and protect you,"" he said; ""but I suppose there are better fellows than I who want to do that."" And he sighed again."
"""Yes, they might want to,"" she said, looking away from him and acting as though she saw another Blue Jay coming."
"""You wouldn't be my little wife, would you?"" he asked, coming nearer to her."
"""Why I might!"" she answered, with a saucy flirt of her tail, and she scampered away as fast as she could. Do you think Mr. Red Squirrel stopped then to eat his fat kernel of yellow corn? Or do you think he waited to see whether the Blue Jays were around? No, indeed! He followed as fast as his legs could carry him from tree to tree, from branch to branch, and it was not until he had reached the top of a tall beech that he overtook his little sweetheart. They were still there when the Gray Squirrel happened along in the afternoon."
"""Ah!"" said he, squinting at Mr. Red Squirrel, for his eyes were poor."
"""You are getting acquainted, are you? Pleasant society here. The Squirrel set is very select. You must meet some of our young people."
"Suppose you will begin housekeeping one of these days?"""
"""I have done so already, sir,"" answered Mr. Red Squirrel, although his wife was nudging him with one paw and motioning him to keep quiet. ""Mrs."
"Red Squirrel and I will build our round home in the top fork of this tree. We shall be pleased to have you call when we are settled."""
"""Is that so?"" exclaimed the Gray Squirrel. ""I did not know that you were married. I thought you came alone to the forest."""
"""This is my wife, sir,"" said Mr. Red Squirrel, and the Gray Squirrel made his very best bow and looked at her as sharply as his poor eyes would let him."
"""I think I must have seen you somewhere,"" he said; ""your face is very familiar."" And he scratched his poor old puzzled head with one claw."
"""Why, Cousin Gray Squirrel, don't you know Bushy-tail?"" she cried. ""You lived the next tree to mine all winter."""
"""To be sure!"" he exclaimed. ""But isn't your marriage rather sudden?"""
"""No,"" she said, blushing under her fur. ""We have always liked each other, although we never spoke until this morning. I used to scamper along the rail fence to see Mr. Red Squirrel in his cage."""
"""Did you truly come for that?"" asked her husband, after their caller had gone."
"""I truly did,"" she answered, ""but I never expected anybody to know it."
"You poor fellow! I felt so sorry for you. I would have given every nut I had to set you free."""
"They were a very happy couple, and the next fall the Gray Squirrel watched them and their children gathering nuts for their winter stores."
"Mr. Red Squirrel, as the head of the family, planned the work, yet each did his share. The nuts were not yet ripe, and they gnawed off the stems, then came to the ground, filled their cheek-pockets with the fallen nuts, and scampered off to hide them in many places. They were stored in tree-hollows, under the rustling leaves which strewed the ground, in the cracks of old logs, beneath brush-heaps, and in holes in the ground."
"""Don't stop to think how many you need,"" said the little mother to her children. ""Get every nut you can. It may be a very long winter."""
"""And if you don't eat them all,"" said their hard-working father with a twinkle in his eyes, ""you may want to drop a few down to some poor fellow who has none. That was your mother's way."""
"""When was it her way? What makes you smile when you say it? Mother, what does he mean?"" cried the young Red Squirrels all in a breath."
"""I gave some nuts to a hungry Squirrel once,"" she said, ""and he was so grateful that he drove the Blue Jays away when they tried to rob me."""
"But she looked so happy as she spoke that the children knew there was more to the story. They dared not tease her to tell, so they whispered among themselves and wondered what their father meant."
"As they gathered nuts near the Gray Squirrel, he motioned them to come close. ""S-sh!"" said he. ""Don't tell it from me, but I think the poor hungry fellow was your father, and it was a lucky thing for you that she had enough to give away."""
"""Do you suppose that was it?"" the young Red Squirrels whispered to each other. ""Do you really suppose so?"""
THE BIGGEST LITTLE RABBIT LEARNS TO SEE
"Seven little Rabbits lay on their nest at the bottom of the burrow, and wriggled and squirmed and pushed their soft noses against each other all day long. Life was very easy for them, and they were contented. The first thing that they remembered was lying on their bed of fur, hay, and dried leaves, and feeling a great, warm, soft Something close beside them. After a while they learned that this Something was their Mamma Rabbit. It was she who had gotten the nest ready for them and lined it with fur that she tore from her own breast. She didn't care so much about looking beautiful as she did about making her babies comfortable."
"It was their Mamma Rabbit, too, who fed them with warm milk from her own body until they should be old enough to go out of the burrow. Then they would nibble bark and tender young shoots from the roots of the trees, and all the fresh, green, growing things that Rabbits like. She used to tell them about this food, and they wondered and wondered how it would taste. They began to feel very big and strong now. The soft fur was growing on their naked little bodies and covering even the soles of their feet. It was growing inside their cheeks, too, and that made them feel important, for Papa Rabbit said that he did not know any other animals that had fur inside their cheeks. He said it was something to be very proud of, so they were very proud, although why one should want fur inside of one's cheeks it would be hard to say."
"said the stranger, in his sweetest way; ""but who is the Moth who is punishing him that queer-looking one with a crooked feeler?"""
"""Sir,"" said she, moving farther from him, ""he is a friend of mine, and I do not think it matters to you if he is queer-looking."""
"""Oh!"" said the stranger. ""Oh! oh! oh! You have a bad temper, haven't you? But you are very good-looking in spite of that."" There is no telling what he would have said next, for at this minute Miss Cecropia's friend heard the mean things he was saying, and flew against him."
"It was not long before this stranger also was punished, and then the Moth with the crooked feeler turned to the others. ""Do any of you want to try it?"" he said. ""You must understand that you cannot be rude before her."" And he pointed his right fore leg at Miss Cecropia as she sat trembling on the branch."
"""Her!"" they cried mockingly, as they flew away. ""There are prettier Moths than she. We don't care anything for her."""
"Miss Cecropia's friend would have gone after them to punish them for this impoliteness, but she clung to him and begged him not to. ""You will be killed, I know you will,"" she sobbed. ""And then what will become of me?"""
"""Would you miss me?"" he asked, as he felt of one of his wings, now broken and bare."
"""Yes,"" she cried. ""You are the best friend I have. Please don't go."""
"""But I am such a homely fellow,"" he said. ""I don't see how you can like me since I broke my wing."""
"""Well, I do like you,"" she said. ""Your wing isn't much broken after all, and I like your crooked feeler. It is so different from anybody else's."" Miss Cecropia looked very happy as she spoke, and she quite forgot how she once decided to go away from him. There are some people, you know, who can change their minds in such a sweet and easy way that we almost love them the better for it. One certainly could love Miss Cecropia for this, because it showed that she had learned to care more for a warm heart and courage than for whole wings and straight feelers."
"Mr. Cecropia did not live long after this, unfortunately, but they were very, very happy together, and she often said to her friends, as she laid her eggs in the best places, ""I only hope that when my Caterpillar babies are grown and have come out of their chrysalides, they may be as good and as brave as their father was."""
THE BEES AND THE KINGBIRD
"There was in the forest a great hollow tree where for years a swarm of Bees had made their home. To look at it in winter, one would never guess what a store of honey was sealed up within, but in summer the Bees were always passing in and out, and it was indeed a busy place. Then the Workers had to gather honey and build the cells and look out for the Queen-Mother's many babies. The Queen-Mother had so much care of her eggs that she could really do nothing but attend to them. After they were ready in their cells, the Workers took care of them, and tucked in a lot of bread for the babies to eat when they were hatched. Then there was the bread-making to be done also, and all the Workers helped bring the pollen, or flower-dust, out of which it was made."
"The Drones didn't do anything, not a thing, not a single thing, unless it were taking care of the Queen when she flew away from the tree. They had done that once, but it was long ago, before she had laid an egg and while she was still quite young. They were handsome great fellows, all black and gold, and if you didn't know about them, you might have thought them the pleasantest Bees in the tree. Of course you would not care for them after finding how lazy they were, for people are never liked just because they are fine-looking."
"The Drones always found some excuse for being idle, and like many other lazy people they wanted the busy ones to stop and visit with them. ""What is the hurry?"" they would say. ""There will be more honey that you can get to-morrow. Stop a while now."""
"But the Workers would shake their brown heads and buzz impatiently as they answered, ""We can get to-morrow's honey when to-morrow comes, but to-day's honey must be gathered to-day."""
"Then the Drones would grumble and say that they didn't see the sense of storing up so much honey anyway. That also was like lazy people the world over, for however much they scold about getting the food, they are sure to eat just as much as anybody else. Sometimes lazy people eat even more than others, and pick for the best too."
"On cloudy days, the Workers did stay at home in the tree, but not to play. They clung to the walls and to each other and made wax. It took much patience to make wax. When they were gathering honey there was so much that was interesting to be seen, and so many friends to meet, that it was really quite exciting; but when they made wax they had to hang for a long, long time, until the wax gathered in flakes over their bodies. Then it was ready to scrape off and shape into six-sided cells to hold honey or to be homes for the babies."
One sunshiny morning the Queen-Mother stopped laying her eggs and cried:
"""Listen! did you hear that?"""
"""What?"" asked the Workers, crowding around her."
"""Why, that noise,"" she said. ""It sounded like a bird calling 'Kyrie!"
"K-y-rie!' and I thought I heard a Worker buzzing outside a minute ago, but no one has come in. I am afraid "" and here she stopped."
"""Of what are you afraid!"" asked the Drones, who, having nothing to do but eat and sleep, were always ready to talk about anything and everything. The great trouble with them was that if you once began to talk they did not like to have you leave and go to work."
"""Why,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I don't want to alarm you, but I thought it was a Kingbird."""
"""Well, what if it was?"" said a big Drone. ""There is only one of him and there are a great many of us."""
"""Yes,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""but there may not be so many of us very long if he begins to watch the tree. I have lived much longer than you and I know how Kingbirds act."""
"This was true, for Queens live to be very old, and Drones never live long because they are so lazy."
"""Well,"" said the big Drone, ""we must find out about this. Just fly around and see if it is a Kingbird,"" he said to a Worker. ""We must know about things before we act."""
"""Suppose you should go,"" she replied. ""I have my leg-pockets full of pollen, and it ought to be made into bread at once. I never saw Larvæ so hungry as these last ones are."""
"""I only wish that I could go,"" said the big Drone, limping as he got out of her way; ""but my fifth foot just stepped on my third foot, and I can hardly move."""
THE UNDECIDED RATTLESNAKE
"It is not often that one of the Forest People has any trouble about making up his mind, but there was one large Rattlesnake who had great difficulty in doing so. She lived in the southern edge of the forest, where the sunshine was clear and warm, and there were delightful crevices among the rocks in which she and all her friends and relatives could hide."
"It seemed very strange that so old a Snake should be so undecided as she was. It must be that she had a careless mother who did not bring her up in the right way. If that were so, one should indeed be sorry for her."
"Still even that would be no real excuse, for was she not old enough now to train herself? She had seven joints in the rattle on her tail and an eighth one growing, so you can see that she was no longer young, although, being healthy, she had grown her new joints and changed her skin oftener than some of her friends. In fact, she had grown children of her own, and if it had not been that they took after their father, they would have been a most helpless family. Fortunately for them, their father was a very decided Snake."
"Yes, it was exceedingly lucky for them. It may not have been so good a thing for him. His wife was always glad to have things settled for her, and when he said, ""We will do this,"" she answered, ""Yes, dear."" When he said, ""We will not do that,"" she murmured, ""No, dear."" And when he said, ""What shall we do?"" she would reply, ""Oh, I don't know. What do you think we might better do?"" He did not very often ask her opinion, and there were people in the forest who said he would never have talked matters over with her if he had not known that she would leave the decision to him."
"Now this is a bad way in which to have things go in any family, and it happened here as it would anywhere. He grew more and more selfish from having his own way all of the time, and his wife became less and less able to take care of herself. Most people thought him a very devoted husband. Perhaps he was. It is easy to be a devoted husband if you always have your own way."
"One night Mr. Rattlesnake did not return to their home. Nobody ever knew what had become of him. The Red Squirrel said that Mrs. Goldfinch said that the biggest little Rabbit had told her that the Ground Hog had overheard Mr. Crow say that he thought he saw somebody that looked like Mr. Rattlesnake chasing a Field Mouse over toward the farm, but that he might have been mistaken. This was all so uncertain that Mrs."
Rattlesnake knew no more than she had known before. It was very trying.
"""If I only knew positively,"" she said to her friend, Mrs. Striped Snake, ""I could do something, although I am sure I don't know what it would be."""
"Mrs. Striped Snake tried to help her. ""Why not have one of your children come home to live with you?"" she said pleasantly, for this year's children were now old enough to shift for themselves."
"""I've thought of that,"" answered Mrs. Rattlesnake, ""but I like a quiet life, and you know how it is. Young Snakes will be young Snakes."
"Besides, I don't think they would want to come back."""
"""Well, why not be alone, then?"""
"""Oh, it is so lonely,"" replied Mrs. Rattlesnake, with a sigh."
"""Everything reminds me so of my husband, and that makes me sad. If I lived somewhere else it would be different."""
"""Then why not move?"" said Mrs. Striped Snake, briskly. ""I would do that."
"Find a nice crack in the rock just big enough for one, or make a cosy little hole in the ground somewhere near here. Then if he comes back he can find you easily. I would do that. I certainly would."""
"She spoke so firmly that Mrs. Rattlesnake said she would, she would to-morrow. And her friend went home thinking it was all settled. That shows how little she really knew Mrs. Rattlesnake."
"The more Mrs. Rattlesnake thought it over that night, the more she dreaded moving. ""If he does not come back,"" she sighed, ""I may marry again in the spring, and then I might have to move once more. I believe I will ask somebody else what I ought to do."""
"So in the morning she began to consult her friends. They all told her to move, and she decided to do it. Then she could not make up her mind whether to take a rock-crevice or make a hole in the ground. It took another day of visiting to settle that it should be a hole in the ground. A fourth day was spent in finding just the right place for her home, and on the fifth day she began work."
"By the time the sun was over the tree-tops, she wished she had chosen some other place, and thought best to stop and talk to some of her friends about it. When she returned she found herself obliged to cast her skin, which had been growing tight and dry for some time. This was hard work, and she was too tired to go on with her home-making, so she lay in the sunshine and admired her beautiful, long, and shining body of reddish brown spotted with black. Her rattle had eight joints now, for when a Rattlesnake casts the old skin a new joint is always uncovered at the end of the tail. She waved it quickly to see how an eight-jointed rattle would sound. ""Lovely!"" she said. ""Lovely! Like the seeds of the wild cucumber shaking around in their dry and prickly case."""
"One could not tell all the things that happened that fall, or how very, very, very tired her friends became of having her ask their advice. She changed her mind more times than there are seeds in a milkweed pod, and the only thing of which she was always sure was eating. When there was food in sight she did not stop for anybody's advice. She ate it as fast as she could, and if she had any doubts about the wisdom of doing so, she kept them to herself."
"When winter came she had just got her new home ready, and after all she went when invited to spend the winter with a cave party of other Snakes."
"They coiled themselves together in a great mass and slept there until spring. As the weather grew warmer, they began to stir, wriggling and twisting themselves free."
Two bachelor Snakes asked her to marry. One was a fine old fellow with a twelve-jointed rattle. The other was just her own age.
"""To be sure I will,"" she cried, and the pits between her nostrils and her ears looked more like dimples than ever. ""Only you must wait until I can make up my mind which one to marry."""
"""Oh, no,"" they answered, ""don't go to all that trouble. We will fight and decide it for you."""
"It was a long fight, and the older of the two Snakes had a couple of joints broken off from his rattle before it was over. Still he beat the other one and drove him away. When he came back for his bride he found her crying. ""What is the matter?"" said he, quite sternly."
"""Oh, that p-poor other b-bachelor!"" she sobbed. ""I b-believe I will g-go after him. I think p-perhaps I l-love him the b-better."""
"""No, you don't, Mrs. Rattlesnake,"" said the fine old fellow who had just won the fight. ""You will do no such thing. You will marry me and never speak to him again. When I have lost two joints of my rattle in fighting for you, I intend to have you myself, and I say that you love me very dearly. Do you hear?"""
"""Yes, darling,"" she answered, as she wiped her eyes on the grass, ""very dearly."" And they lived most happily together."
"""He reminds me so much of the first Mr. Rattlesnake,"" she said to her friends. ""So strong, so firm, so quick to decide!"""
"""I think,"" remarked a Red-headed Woodpecker, ""that I have the best wing feathers now that I ever had. They seem to be a little longer, and they hook together so well. I almost wish I were going South to try them on a long journey."""
"""Mr. Woodpecker's wing feathers are certainly excellent,"" said his wife, who was always glad to see him well dressed. ""I am sure that the strongest wind will never part them. I don't see how the Owls can stand it to wear their feathers unhooked so that some of the air passes through their wings each time they flap them. It must make flying hard."""
"""Well, if you were an Owl you would understand,"" chuckled the Crow. ""If their great wings were like ours, the noise of their flying would scare every creature within hearing, and there would not be much fun in hunting."""
"And so they chatted on, while from the meadow came the sound of the happy insects piping in the sunshine. It was chilly now at night and in the early morning, and they could give concerts only at noonday. The next day the Wild Turkeys came and there was great excitement in the forest. The Squirrels were busier than ever storing up all the acorns that they could before the newcomers reached the oak trees; and the Blue Jays were so jealous of the Turkeys that they overate every day for fear there would not be enough to go around. As though there were any danger!"
"The Ground Hog was getting so sleepy now that he would doze off while people were talking to him, and then he would suddenly straighten up and say: ""Yes, yes, yes! Don't think that I was asleep, please. The colors of the trees are so bright that they tire my eyes and I sometimes close them."" The dear old fellow really never knew how he had been nodding."
"The Snakes, too, were growing dull and slow of motion, while the Bats talked freely of hanging themselves up for the winter. The Grouse and Quail made daily trips to the edges of the grain-fields, and found rich picking among the stubble. You could almost fancy that they came home each night fatter than when they went away in the morning."
"Life went on in this way for many days, and the birds had all stopped singing. There were no more happy concerts at sunrise and no more carols at evening; only chirrupings and twitterings as the feathered people hopped restlessly from one perch to another. All could see that they were busily thinking and had no time for music. The truth was that each bird who was not to spend the winter in the Forest felt as though something were drawing drawing drawing him southward. It was something they could not see or hear, and yet it was drawing drawing drawing all day and all night. They spoke of it often to each other, and the older birds told the young ones how, before long, they would all start South, and fly over land and water until they reached their winter home."
"""How do we know where to go?"" asked the children."
"""All that you have to do,"" the older ones said, ""is to follow us."""
"""And how do you know?"" they asked."
"""Why, we have been there before,"" they answered; ""and we can see the places over which we pass. But perhaps that is not the real reason, for sometimes we fly over such great stretches of water that we can see nothing else and it all looks alike. Then we cannot see which way to go, but still we feel that we are drawn South, and we only have to think about that and fly onward. The fathers and sons can fly the faster and will reach there first. The mothers and daughters come a few days later."
"We never make a mistake."""
"""It is wonderful, wonderful,"" thought a young Rabbit on the grass below."
"""I must watch them when they go."""
"The very next morning the Forest People awakened to find a silvery frost on the grass and feel the still air stirred by the soft dropping of damp red, brown, and yellow leaves from the trees. Over the river and all the lowland near it hung a heavy veil of white mist."
"""It is time!"" whispered the Robins to each other."
"""It is time!"" cooed the Mourning Doves."
"""It is time!"" cried the Cowbirds in their hoarse voices."
"All through the forest there was restlessness and quiet haste. The Juncoes had already come from the cold northland and were resting from their long flight. The Ground Hogs, the Rabbits, and the Squirrels were out to say good-by. The Owls peeped from their hollow trees, shading their eyes from the strong light of the sun. And then the travellers went. The Robins started in family parties. The Mourning Doves slipped quietly away. The Cowbirds went in a dashing crowd. And the Crows, after much talking and disputing on the tree-tops, took a noisy farewell of the few members of the flock who were to remain behind, and, joining other flocks from the North, flew off in a great company which darkened the sky and caused a shadow to pass over the stubble-field almost like that of a summer cloud."
"""They are gone!"" sighed the Ground Hog and his wife. ""We shall miss them sadly. Well, we can dream about them, and that will be a comfort."""
"""Jay! Jay!"" shrieked a handsome-crested fellow from the tree above."
"""What if they are gone? They will be back in the spring, and we have plenty to eat. What is the use of feeling sad? Jay! Jay!"""
"But all people are not so heartless as the hungry Blue Jays, and the song-birds had many loving friends who missed them and longed for their return."
THE RUFFED GROUSE'S STORY
"The Ruffed Grouse cocked his crested head on one side and looked up through the bare branches to the sky. It was a soft gray, and in the west were banks of bluish clouds. ""I think it will snow very soon,"" said he. ""Mrs. Grouse, are the children all ready for cold weather?"""
"""All ready,"" answered his cheerful little wife. ""They have had their thickest feathers on for quite a while. The Rabbits were saying the other day that they had never seen a plumper or better clothed flock than ours."" And her beautiful golden-brown eyes shone with pride as she spoke."
"Indeed, the young Ruffed Grouse were a family of whom she might well be proud. Twelve healthy and obedient children do not fall to the lot of every Forest mother, and she wished with a sad little sigh that her other two eggs had hatched. She often thought of them with longing. How lovely it would have been to have fourteen children! But at that moment her brood came crowding around her in fright."
"""Some cold white things,"" they said, ""came tumbling down upon us and scared us. The white things didn't say a word, but they came so fast that we think they must be alive. Tell us what to do. Must we hide?"""
"""Why, that is snow!"" exclaimed their mother. ""It drops from the clouds up yonder quite as the leaves drop from the trees in the fall. It will not hurt you, but we must find shelter."""
"""What did I tell you, Mrs Grouse?"" asked her husband. ""I was certain that it would snow before night. I felt it in my quills."" And Mr. Grouse strutted with importance. It always makes one feel so very knowing when he has told his wife exactly what will happen."
"""How did you feel it in your quills?"" asked one of his children. ""Shall I feel it in my quills when I am as old as you are?"""
"Well, in she came."
"""Can you wash this shirt clean, lassie you?"" said he."
"""I don't know,"" she said, ""but I think I can."""
"And almost before she had taken it and dipped it in the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still."
"""Yes; you are the lassie for me,"" said the Prince."
"At that the old hag flew into such a rage, she burst on the spot, and the Princess with the long nose after her, and the whole pack of Trolls after her at least I've never heard a word about them since."
"As for the Prince and Princess, they set free all the poor Christian folk who had been carried off and shut up there; and they took with them all the silver and gold, and flitted away as far as they could from the Castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon."
THE BLUE BELT
"Once on a time there was an old beggar-woman, who had gone out to beg."
"She had a little lad with her, and when she had got her bag full she struck across the hills towards her own home. So when they had gone a bit up the hill-side, they came upon a little Blue Belt which lay where two paths met, and the lad asked his mother's leave to pick it up."
"""No,"" said she, ""maybe there's witchcraft in it;"" and so with threats she forced him to follow her. But when they had gone a bit further, the lad said he must turn aside a moment out of the road; and meanwhile his mother sat down on a tree-stump. But the lad was a long time gone, for as soon as he got so far into the wood that the old dame could not see him, he ran off to where the Belt lay, took it up, tied it round his waist, and lo! he felt as strong as if he could lift the whole hill. When he got back, the old dame was in a great rage, and wanted to know what he had been doing all that while. ""You don't care how much time you waste, and yet you know the night is drawing on, and we must cross the hill before it is dark!"" So on they tramped; but when they had got about half-way, the old dame grew weary, and said she must rest under a bush."
"""Dear mother,"" said the lad, ""mayn't I just go up to the top of this high crag while you rest, and try if I can't see some sign of folk hereabouts?"""
Yes! he might do that; so when he had got to the top he saw a light shining from the north. So he ran down and told his mother.
"""We must get on, mother; we are near a house, for I see a bright light shining quite close to us in the north."" Then she rose and shouldered her bag, and set off to see; but they hadn't gone far, before there stood a steep spur of the hill, right across their path."
"""Just as I thought!"" said the old dame, ""now we can't go a step farther; a pretty bed we shall have here!"""
"But the lad took the bag under one arm, and his mother under the other, and ran straight up the steep crag with them."
"""Now, don't you see? Don't you see that we are close to a house? Don't you see that bright light?"""
"But the old dame said those were no Christian folk, but Trolls, for she was at home in all that forest far and near, and knew there was not a living soul in it, until you were well over the ridge and had come down on the other side. But they went on, and in a little while they came to a great house which was all painted red."
"""What's the good?"" said the old dame. ""We daren't go in, for here the Trolls live."""
"""Don't say so; we must go in. There must be men where the lights shine so,"" said the lad. So in he went, and his mother after him, but he had scarce opened the door before she swooned away, for there she saw a great stout man, at least twenty feet high, sitting on the bench."
"""Good evening, grandfather!"" said the lad."
"""Well, here I've sat three hundred years,"" said the man who sat on the bench, ""and no one has ever come and called me grandfather before."""
"Then the lad sat down by the man's side, and began to talk to him as if they had been old friends."
"""But what's come over your mother?"" said the man, after they had chatted a while. ""I think she swooned away; you had better look after her."""
"So the lad went and took hold of the old dame, and dragged her up the hall along the floor. That brought her to herself, and she kicked and scratched, and flung herself about, and at last sat down upon a heap of firewood in the corner; but she was so frightened that she scarce dared to look one in the face."
"After a while, the lad asked if they could spend the night there."
"""Yes, to be sure,"" said the man."
"So they went on talking again, but the lad soon got hungry, and wanted to know if they could get food as well as lodging."
"""Of course,"" said the man, ""that might be got too."" And after he had sat a while longer, he rose up and threw six loads of dry pitch-pine on the fire. This made the old hag still more afraid."
"""Oh! now he's going to roast us alive,"" she said, in the corner where she sat."
"And when the wood had burned down to glowing embers, up got the man and strode out of his house."
"Listen. The ogress, who lives in that house with the prince and his wife, has swallowed a ring, which I very much want. If you will procure it for me, I will allow the rat to depart unharmed. If you do not, then your prince dies under my feet."""
"""Very well, we agree,"" said they all. ""Nay, if we do not get the ring for you, devour us all."""
"This was rather a bold offer. However, they accomplished the thing. At midnight, when the ogress was sound asleep, one of the rats went to her bedside, climbed up on her face, and inserted its tail into her throat; whereupon the ogress coughed violently, and the ring came out and rolled on to the floor. The rat immediately seized the precious thing and ran off with it to its king, who was very glad, and went at once to the cat and released its son."
"As soon as the cat received the ring, she started back with the dog to go and tell their master the good tidings. All seemed safe now. They had only to give the ring to him, and he would speak to it, and the house and beautiful princess would again be with them, and everything would go on as happily as before. ""How glad master will be!"" they thought, and ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Now, on the way they had to cross a stream. The dog swam, and the cat sat on its back. Now the dog was jealous of the cat, so he asked for the ring, and threatened to throw the cat into the water if it did not give it up; whereupon the cat gave up the ring. Sorry moment, for the dog at once dropped it, and a fish swallowed it."
"""Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?"" said the dog."
"""What is done is done,"" replied the cat. ""We must try to recover it, and if we do not succeed we had better drown ourselves in this stream."
"I have a plan. You go and kill a small lamb, and bring it here to me."""
"""All right,"" said the dog, and at once ran off. He soon came back with a dead lamb, and gave it to the cat. The cat got inside the lamb and lay down, telling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet."
"Not long after this a nadhar, a bird whose look can break the bones of a fish, came and hovered over the lamb, and eventually pounced down on it to carry it away. On this the cat came out and jumped on to the bird, and threatened to kill it if it did not recover the lost ring."
"This was most readily promised by the nadhar, who immediately flew off to the king of the fishes, and ordered it to make inquiries and to restore the ring. The king of the fishes did so, and the ring was found and carried back to the cat."
"""Come along now; I have got the ring,"" said the cat to the dog."
"""No, I will not,"" said the dog, ""unless you let me have the ring. I can carry it as well as you. Let me have it or I will kill you."" So the cat was obliged to give up the ring. The careless dog very soon dropped it again. This time it was picked up and carried off by a kite."
"""See, see, there it goes away to that big tree,"" the cat exclaimed."
"""Oh! oh! what have I done?"" cried the dog."
"""You foolish thing, I knew it would be so,"" said the cat. ""But stop your barking, or you will frighten away the bird to some place where we shall not be able to trace it."""
"The cat waited till it was quite dark, and then climbed the tree, killed the kite, and recovered the ring. ""Come along,"" it said to the dog when it reached the ground. ""We must make haste now. We have been delayed. Our master will die from grief and suspense. Come on."""
"The dog, now thoroughly ashamed of itself, begged the cat's pardon for all the trouble it had given. It was afraid to ask for the ring the third time, so they both reached their sorrowing master in safety and gave him the precious charm. In a moment his sorrow was turned into joy. He spoke to the ring, and his beautiful wife and house reappeared, and he and everybody were as happy as ever they could be."
The Talkative Tortoise
"The future Buddha was once born in a minister's family, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares; and when he grew up, he became the king's adviser in things temporal and spiritual."
"Now this king was very talkative; while he was speaking, others had no opportunity for a word. And the future Buddha, wanting to cure this talkativeness of his, was constantly seeking for some means of doing so."
"At that time there was living, in a pond in the Himalaya mountains, a tortoise. Two young hamsas, or wild ducks, who came to feed there, made friends with him. And one day, when they had become very intimate with him, they said to the tortoise:"
"""Friend tortoise! the place where we live, at the Golden Cave on Mount Beautiful in the Himalaya country, is a delightful spot. Will you come there with us?"""
"""But how can I get there?"""
"""We can take you, if you can only hold your tongue, and will say nothing to anybody."""
"""Oh! that I can do. Take me with you."""
"""That's right,"" said they. And making the tortoise bite hold of a stick, they themselves took the two ends in their teeth, and flew up into the air."
"Seeing him thus carried by the hamsas, some villagers called out, ""Two wild ducks are carrying a tortoise along on a stick!"" Whereupon the tortoise wanted to say, ""If my friends choose to carry me, what is that to you, you wretched slaves!"" So just as the swift flight of the wild ducks had brought him over the king's palace in the city of Benares, he let go of the stick he was biting, and falling in the open courtyard, split in two! And there arose a universal cry, ""A tortoise has fallen in the open courtyard, and has split in two!"""
"The king, taking the future Buddha, went to the place, surrounded by his courtiers; and looking at the tortoise, he asked the Bodisat, ""Teacher! how comes he to be fallen here?"""
"The future Buddha thought to himself, ""Long expecting, wishing to admonish the king, have I sought for some means of doing so. This tortoise must have made friends with the wild ducks; and they must have made him bite hold of the stick, and have flown up into the air to take him to the hills. But he, being unable to hold his tongue when he hears any one else talk, must have wanted to say something, and let go the stick; and so must have fallen down from the sky, and thus lost his life."" And saying, ""Truly, O king! those who are called chatter-boxes people whose words have no end come to grief like this,"" he uttered these Verses:"
"""Verily the tortoise killed himself     Whilst uttering his voice;     Though he was holding tight the stick,     By a word himself he slew."

PAYNTER withdraws.
SIR CHARLES.  Hullo!  Where are they?  H'm!
"As he speaks, GEORGE re-enters."
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Kissing her son]  Well, George.  Where's Clare?"
GEORGE.  Afraid she's late.
LADY DEDMOND.  Are we early?
"GEORGE.  As a matter of fact, she's not in."
LADY DEDMOND.  Oh?
SIR CHARLES.  H'm!  Not--not had a rumpus?
GEORGE.  Not particularly.  [With the first real sign of feeling]
What I can't stand is being made a fool of before other people.
Ordinary friction one can put up with.  But that----
SIR CHARLES.  Gone out on purpose?  What!
LADY DEDMOND.  What was the trouble?
GEORGE.  I told her this morning you were coming in to Bridge.
"Appears she'd asked that fellow Malise, for music."
"LADY DEDMOND.  Well, my dear!"
SIR CHARLES.  Ah!  George.  Good dinner?
GEORGE.  [Giving his hand to MALISE]  How are you?  Clare!  Mr.
MALISE!
CLARE.  [Smiling-in a clear voice with the faintest possible lisp]
"Yes, we met on the door-mat.  [Pause.]"
SIR CHARLES.  Deuce you did!  [An awkward pause.]
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Acidly]  Mr. Malise doesn't play Bridge, it appears."
Afraid we shall be rather in the way of music.
SIR CHARLES.  What!  Aren't we goin' to get a game?  [PAYNTER has
entered with a tray.]
GEORGE.  Paynter!  Take that table into the dining room.
"PAYNTER.  [Putting down the tray on a table behind the door]  Yes,"
sir.
MALISE.  Let me give you a hand.

"in which Creon bids Ismene speak no more of Antigone as ἥδε, and an"
ironical stress might well be laid by Creon on the word τούσδε as he
"uses it, which would suggest to his audience its antithesis τοὺς ἐκεὶ"

LADY DEDMOND.  Well! it would be better for you and Clare to be
"supposed to be out together, than for her to be out alone.  Go"
quietly into the dining-room and wait for her.
SIR CHARLES.  Good!  Leave your mother to make up something.  She'll
do it!
LADY DEDMOND.  That may be he.  Quick!
[A bell sounds.]
"GEORGE goes out into the hall, leaving the door open in his"
"haste.  LADY DEDMOND, following, calls ""Paynter!""  PAYNTER"
enters.
LADY DEDMOND.  Don't say anything about your master and mistress
being out.  I'll explain.
"PAYNTER.  The master, my lady?"
"LADY DEDMOND.  Yes, I know.  But you needn't say so.  Do you"
understand?
"PAYNTER.  [In polite dudgeon]  Just so, my lady."
[He goes out.]
SIR CHARLES.  By Jove!  That fellow smells a rat!
"LADY DEDMOND.  Be careful, Charles!"
LADY DEDMOND.  Without letting you know?
GEORGE.  I believe she did tell me.
LADY DEDMOND.  But surely----
GEORGE.  I don't want to discuss it.  There's never anything in
"particular.  We're all anyhow, as you know."
"LADY DEDMOND.  I see.  [She looks shrewdly at her son]  My dear,"
"I should be rather careful about him, I think."
SIR CHARLES.  Who's that?
LADY DEDMOND.  That Mr. Malise.
SIR CHARLES.  Oh!  That chap!
GEORGE.  Clare isn't that sort.
LADY DEDMOND.  I know.  But she catches up notions very easily.  I
think it's a great pity you ever came across him.
SIR CHARLES.  Where did you pick him up?
GEORGE.  Italy--this Spring--some place or other where they couldn't
speak English.
SIR CHARLES.  Um!  That's the worst of travellin'.
LADY DEDMOND.  I think you ought to have dropped him.  These literary
"people---[Quietly]  From exchanging ideas to something else, isn't"
"says: ""Clare!""  Receiving no answer, he goes in.  PAYNTER"
"switches up the electric light.  His face, turned towards the"
"curtained door, is apprehensive."
GEORGE.  [Re-entering]  Where's Mrs. Dedmond?
"PAYNTER.  I hardly know, sir."
GEORGE.  Dined in?
"PAYNTER.  She had a mere nothing at seven, sir."
"GEORGE.  Has she gone out, since?"
"PAYNTER.  Yes, sir--that is, yes.  The--er--mistress was not dressed"
"at all.  A little matter of fresh air, I think; sir."
GEORGE.  What time did my mother say they'd be here for Bridge?
PAYNTER.  Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond were coming at half-past nine;
"and Captain Huntingdon, too--Mr. and Mrs.  Fullarton might be a bit"
"late, sir."
GEORGE.  It's that now.  Your mistress said nothing?
"PAYNTER.  Not to me, sir."
GEORGE.  Send Burney.
"PAYNTER.  Very good, sir.  [He withdraws.]"
GEORGE stares gloomily at the card tables.  BURNEY comes in
"very far, George."
"SIR CHARLES.  We'll make him play Bridge.  Do him good, if he's that"
sort of fellow.
LADY DEDMOND.  Is anyone else coming?
"GEORGE.  Reggie Huntingdon, and the Fullartons."
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Softly]  You know, my dear boy, I've been meaning to"
speak to you for a long time.  It is such a pity you and Clare--What
is it?
"GEORGE.  God knows!  I try, and I believe she does."
"SIR CHARLES.  It's distressin'--for us, you know, my dear fellow--"
distressin'.
LADY DEDMOND.  I know it's been going on for a long time.
"GEORGE.  Oh!  leave it alone, mother."
"LADY DEDMOND.  But, George, I'm afraid this man has brought it to a"
point--put ideas into her head.
GEORGE.  You can't dislike him more than I do.  But there's nothing
one can object to.
"LADY DEDMOND.  Could Reggie Huntingdon do anything, now he's home?"
Brothers sometimes----
GEORGE.  I can't bear my affairs being messed about----

MALISE.  Such is my weakness.
LADY DEDMOND.  Delightful profession.
SIR CHARLES.  Doesn't tie you!  What!
MALISE.  Only by the head.
SIR CHARLES.  I'm always thinkin' of writin' my experiences.
MALISE.  Indeed!
[There is the sound of a door banged.]
"SIR CHARLES.  [Hastily]  You smoke, Mr.  MALISE?"
MALISE.  Too much.
SIR CHARLES.  Ah!  Must smoke when you think a lot.
MALISE.  Or think when you smoke a lot.
SIR CHARLES.  [Genially]  Don't know that I find that.
LADY DEDMOND.  [With her clear look at him]  Charles!
The door is opened.  CLARE DEDMOND in a cream-coloured evening
"frock comes in from the hall, followed by GEORGE.  She is rather"
"pale, of middle height, with a beautiful figure, wavy brown"
"hair, full, smiling lips, and large grey mesmeric eyes, one of"
"those women all vibration, iced over with a trained stoicism of"
voice and manner.
GEORGE.  There are things one does not do.
CLARE.  I came in because I was sorry.
GEORGE.  And at once began to do it again!  It seems to me you
delight in rows.
CLARE.  You'd miss your--reconciliations.
"GEORGE.  For God's sake, Clare, drop cynicism!"
CLARE.  And truth?
"GEORGE.  You are my wife, I suppose."
CLARE.  And they twain shall be one--spirit.
GEORGE.  Don't talk wild nonsense!
[There is silence.]
CLARE.  [Softly]  I don't give satisfaction.  Please give me notice!
GEORGE.  Pish!
"CLARE.  Five years, and four of them like this!  I'm sure we've"
served our time.  Don't you really think we might get on better
together--if I went away?
"GEORGE.  I've told you I won't stand a separation for no real reason,"
and have your name bandied about all over London.  I have some
primitive sense of honour.
"CLARE.  You mean your name, don't you?"
GEORGE.  Look here.  Did that fellow Malise put all this into your
head?
CLARE.  No; my own evil nature.
GEORGE.  I wish the deuce we'd never met him.  Comes of picking up
people you know nothing of.  I distrust him--and his looks--and his
infernal satiric way.  He can't even 'dress decently.  He's not--good
form.
CLARE.  [With a touch of rapture]  Ah-h!
GEORGE.  Why do you let him come?  What d'you find interesting in
him?
CLARE.  A mind.
GEORGE.  Deuced funny one!  To have a mind--as you call it--it's not
necessary to talk about Art and Literature.
CLARE.  We don't.
GEORGE.  Then what do you talk about--your minds?  [CLARE looks at
him]  Will you answer a straight question?  Is he falling in love
with you?
CLARE.  You had better ask him.

1. Definition of a Hymn.
"St. Augustine, 354-430, gave a definition of a hymn, which has been"
widely accepted:
A hymn is the praise of God by singing. A hymn is a song embodying the
praise of God. If there is merely praise but not praise of God it is
"not a hymn. If there be praise, and praise of God, but not sung, it is"
"not a hymn. For it to be a hymn, it is needful, therefore, for it to"
"have three things—praise, praise of God, and these sung."
"A recent definition, accepted by the Hymn Society of America, is that of"
the late Carl F. Price:
"surprise, then with offence, then almost with horror.  GEORGE is"
"about to go up to her, but HUNTINGDON heads him off."
"HUNTINGDON.  Bring the tray along, old man."
"GEORGE takes up the tray, stops to look at CLARE, then allows"
HUNTINGDON to shepherd him out.
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Without looking at CLARE]  Well, if we're going to"
"play, Charles? [She jerks his sleeve.]"
SIR CHARLES.  What?  [He marches out.]
LADY DEDMOND.  [Meeting MALISE in the doorway]  Now you will be able
to have your music.
[She follows the GENERAL out]
"[CLARE stands perfectly still, with her eyes closed.]"
MALISE.  Delicious!
"CLARE.  [In her level, clipped voice]  Perfectly beastly of me!  I'm"
so sorry.  I simply can't help running amok to-night.
MALISE.  Never apologize for being fey.  It's much too rare.
CLARE.  On the door-mat!  And they'd whitewashed me so beautifully!
Poor dears!  I wonder if I ought----[She looks towards the door.]
MALISE.  Don't spoil it!
"CLARE.  No, thank you."
"PAYNTER.  No, ma'am.  Good-night, ma'am."
[He withdraws.]
GEORGE.  You needn't have gone out of your way to tell a lie that
wouldn't deceive a guinea-pig.  [Going up to her]  Pleased with
yourself to-night?  [CLARE shakes her head]  Before that fellow
MALISE; as if our own people weren't enough!
"CLARE.  Is it worth while to rag me?  I know I've behaved badly, but"
"I couldn't help it, really!"
GEORGE.  Couldn't help behaving like a shop-girl?  My God!  You were
brought up as well as I was.
CLARE.  Alas!
GEORGE.  To let everybody see that we don't get on--there's only one
word for it--Disgusting!
CLARE.  I know.
GEORGE.  Then why do you do it?  I've always kept my end up.  Why in
heaven's name do you behave in this crazy way?
CLARE.  I'm sorry.
GEORGE.  [With intense feeling]  You like making a fool of me!
CLARE.  No--Really!  Only--I must break out sometimes.

GEORGE.  Did your mistress say anything before she went out?
"BURNEY.  Yes, sir."
GEORGE.  Well?
"BURNEY.  I don't think she meant it, sir."
"GEORGE.  I don't want to know what you don't think, I want the fact."
"BURNEY.  Yes, sir.  The mistress said: ""I hope it'll be a pleasant"
"evening, Burney!"""
GEORGE.  Oh!--Thanks.
"BURNEY.  I've put out the mistress's things, sir."
GEORGE.  Ah!
"BURNEY.  Thank you, sir.  [She withdraws.]"
GEORGE.  Damn!
"He again goes to the curtained door, and passes through."
"PAYNTER, coming in from the hall, announces: ""General Sir"

SIR CHARLES.  I'm fond of her.  Nothing she wants that she hasn't
"got, is there?"
HUNTINGDON.  Never heard her say so.
SIR CHARLES.  [Dimly]  I don't know whether old George is a bit too
matter of fact for her.  H'm?
[A short silence.]
LADY DEDMOND.  There's a Mr. Malise coming here to-night.  I forget
if you know him.
HUNTINGDON.  Yes.  Rather a thorough-bred mongrel.
LADY DEDMOND.  He's literary.  [With hesitation]  You--you don't
think he--puts--er--ideas into her head?
"HUNTINGDON.  I asked Greyman, the novelist, about him; seems he's a"
"bit of an Ishmaelite, even among those fellows.  Can't see Clare----"
"LADY DEDMOND.  No.  Only, the great thing is that she shouldn't be"
encouraged.  Listen!--It is her-coming in.  I can hear their voices.
Gone to her room.  What a blessing that man isn't here yet!  [The
"door bell rings] Tt!  There he is, I expect."
SIR CHARLES.  What are we goin' to say?
"HUNTINGDON.  Say they're dining out, and we're not to wait Bridge for"
them.
SIR CHARLES.  Good!

"BECAUSE you cried, I kissed you, and,"
Ah me! how should I understand
That piteous little you were fain
To cry and to be kissed again?
"Because you smiled at last, I thought"
That I had found what I had sought.
"But soon I found, without a doubt,"
No man can find a woman out.
"I kissed your tears, and did not stay"
Till I had kissed them all away.
"Ah, hapless me! ah, heartless child!"
She would not kiss me when she smiled.

George's.
"PAYNTER, reappearing, announces: ""Captain Huntingdon.""  SIR"
CHARLES and LADY DEDMOND turn to him with relief.
"LADY DEDMOND.  Ah!  It's you, Reginald!"
"HUNTINGDON.  [A tall, fair soldier, of thirty] How d'you do?  How are"
"you, sir?  What's the matter with their man?"
SHE CHARLES.  What!
HUNTINGDON.  I was going into the dining-room to get rid of my cigar;

"instructions are to the effect that he's not."""

suddenly]  Play me something.

make me feel just an attractive female.  I wanted somebody like that.

"When the teacher appeared in the dosshouse, Tyapa had already lived"
"there for some time.  He looked long into the teacher's face, as if to"
discover what kind of a man he was.  Tyapa often listened to his
"conversation, and once, sitting down beside him, said:"

_THE MONK WITH THE RED NOSE_
The next day Cæsar was finishing dressing when the servant told him
that a gentleman was waiting for him.
“Who is it?” asked Cæsar.
“It’s a monk.”
"Cæsar went to the salon and there found a tall monk with an evil face,"
"a red nose, and a worn habit."
"Cæsar recalled having seen him, but didn’t know where."
“What can I do for you?” asked Cæsar.
"“I come from His Eminence, Cardinal Fort. I must speak with you.”"
“Let’s go into the dining-room. We shall be alone there.”
“It would be better to talk in your room.”
"“No, there is no one here. Besides, I have to eat breakfast. Will you"
join me?”
"“No, thanks,” said the monk."
Cæsar remembered having seen that face in the Altemps palace. He was
doubtless one of the domestic monks who had been with the Abbé Preciozi.
"PAYNTER.  Country homes--I know 'em.  What's her father, the old"
"Rector, like?"
BURNEY.  Oh! very steady old man.  The mother dead long before I took
the place.
"PAYNTER.  Not a penny, I suppose?"
BURNEY.  [Shaking her head]  No; and seven of them.
PAYNTER.  [At sound of the hall door]  The Governor!
BURNEY withdraws through the curtained door.
"GEORGE DEDMOND enters from the hall.  He is in evening dress,"
"opera hat, and overcoat; his face is broad, comely, glossily"
"shaved, but with neat moustaches.  His eyes, clear, small, and"
"blue-grey, have little speculation.  His hair is well brushed."
"GEORGE.  [Handing PAYNTER his coat and hat]  Look here, Paynter!"
"When I send up from the Club for my dress things, always put in a"
black waistcoat as well.
"PAYNTER.  I asked the mistress, sir."
GEORGE.  In future--see?
"PAYNTER.  Yes, sir.  [Signing towards the window]  Shall I leave the"
"sunset, sir?"
But GEORGE has crossed to the curtained door; he opens it and
"Entman sighed. ""I wish I could get some of the data those creatures"
"used in the construction of the androids."""
"""You'd like to make one of your own?"""
"""It would solve the servant problem. Terrible here in Washington."""
"""Labor unions would holler bloody murder."""
"""You can't stop progress."""
Suddenly Entman got to his feet. He walked to the edge of the patio and
looked upward. Taber saw his face in the light streaming from the living
room--he seemed frightened.
"""Brent! It's such a helpless feeling. What do we do?"""
"Brent Taber got up and went over and stood beside Entman. He, too,"
"looked up into the velvet night; the beautiful, quiet, impersonal night."
The sinister night.
"""We watch the stars,"" Brent said. ""And we wait."""

CHAPTER IX
THE DAWN
An undefined melancholy overshadowed the world. Autumn breathed in the
"wind. The year, red-bosomed, was rushing to its doom."
"On the summit of a wood-crowned hill, rising like a pyramid above moor"
"and forest, stood two men silent under the shadows of an oak. In the"
discoveries had been made at Benham's lodgings.
"""Indeed, sir,"" said the man, ""I believe the Superintendent wished to see"
"you."""
"""Ah, I dare say,"" said Kilshaw. ""Tell him I'm here."""
"When he was ushered into the inner room, the Superintendent confirmed"
the officer's surmise.
"""I was going to send a message to ask you to step round, sir,"" he"
remarked.
"""Here I am, but don't be long. I don't want to miss the Premier's"
"speech."""
"""Mr. Medland speaking to-day?"""
"""Of course. It's a great day with us at the House."""
"""I think it looks like being a great day all round. Well, Mr. Kilshaw,"
"you told me you knew the deceased."""
"""Yes, I knew Benham."""
"""Benyon,"" corrected the Superintendent."
"""Yes, that was his real name,"" assented Kilshaw."
"""At his lodgings there was found a packet. That's the wrapper,"" and he"
handed a piece of brown paper to Kilshaw.
CLARE.  [Shaking her head]  Reggie lives on his pay.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  [With one of her quick looks]  That was Mr. Malise,"
then?
"FULLARTON.  [Coming towards them]  I say, Mrs. Dedmond, you wouldn't"
"sing me that little song you sang the other night,  [He hums]  ""If I"
"might be the falling bee and kiss thee all the day""?  Remember?"
"MRS. FULLARTON.  ""The falling dew,"" Edward.  We simply must go,"
Clare.  Good-night.  [She kisses her.]
FULLARTON.  [Taking half-cover between his wife and CLARE]  It suits
you down to the ground-that dress.
CLARE.  Good-night.
"HUNTINGDON sees them out.  Left alone CLARE clenches her hands,"
"moves swiftly across to the window, and stands looking out."
"HUNTINGDON.  [Returning]  Look here, Clare!"
"CLARE.  Well, Reggie?"
"HUNTINGDON.  This is working up for a mess, old girl.  You can't do"
this kind of thing with impunity.  No man'll put up with it.  If
"you've got anything against George, better tell me.  [CLARE shakes"
her head]  You ought to know I should stick by you.  What is it?
Come?
"CLARE.  Get married, and find out after a year that she's the wrong"
The boy answered boldly and stoutly:
"""I am a barefooted tramp ...."""
The Captain looked critically at him.  This youngster had long hair and
"a weak face, with prominent cheek-bones and a turned-up nose.  He was"
"dressed in a blue blouse without a waistband, and on his head he wore"
"the remains of a straw hat, while his feet were bare."
"""You are a fool!"" decided Aristid Kuvalda.  ""What are you knocking"
about here for?  You are of absolutely no use to us ...  Do you drink
"vodki? ...  No? ...  Well, then, can you steal?""  Again, ""No.""  ""Go"
"away, learn, and come back again when you know something, and are a man"
"..."""
The youngster smiled.
"""No.  I shall live with you."""
"""Why?"""
"""Just because ..."""
"""Oh you ... Meteor!"" said the Captain."
"""I will break his teeth for him,"" said Martyanoff."
"""And why?"" asked the youngster."
"""Just because...."""

"""I want to talk to you, Dad."""
"He gave her a quick look, selected his hat, and followed to the door.  In"
"the cab, he put his hand on hers and said:"
"""Now, my dear?"""
But all she could get out was:
"""I want to come back to you.  I can't go on there.  It's--it's--I've come"
"to an end."""
"His hand pressed hers tightly, as if he were trying to save her the need"
for saying more.  Gyp went on:
"""I must get baby; I'm terrified that he'll try to keep her, to get me"
"back."""
"""Is he at home?"""
"""I don't know.  I haven't told him that I'm going to leave him."""
Winton looked at his watch and asked:
"""Does the baby ever go out as late as this?"""
"""Yes; after tea.  It's cooler."""
"""I'll take this cab on, then.  You stay and get the room ready for her."
"Don't worry, and don't go out till I return."""

Brent Taber was human and his triumph had been a thing of satisfaction
to him--but only momentarily. Now it had a slightly sour taste.
Not that he was unhappy. He was content and almost relaxed as he sat in
Doctor Entman's patio and worked on a Scotch and soda.

"""Beautiful. Those stars are about ready to fall into our laps."""

His hand touched her foot through the soft eiderdown.  Gyp thought: 'Why
does he come and whine to me like this?  He has no dignity--none!'  And
she said:
"""How can you promise?  You have made the girl love you.  I saw her face."""
He drew his hand back.
"""You saw her?"""
"""Yes."""
"He was silent, staring at her.  Presently he began again:"
"""She is a little fool.  I do not care for the whole of her as much as I"
care for your one finger.  What does it matter what one does in that way
"if one does not care?  The soul, not the body, is faithful.  A man"
"satisfies appetite--it is nothing."""
Gyp said:
"""Perhaps not; but it is something when it makes others miserable."""
"""Has it made you miserable, my Gyp?"""
"His voice had a ring of hope.  She answered, startled:"
"""I?  No--her."""
"""Her?  Ho!  It is an experience for her--it is life.  It will do her no"
"""I wish this confounded thing hadn't happened. It spoils our win."""
"The Chief Justice nodded, and whistled a bar or two of some sad ditty."
"""I'm glad she's dead, poor soul, Perry,"" he said."
"""There's the girl,"" said Sir Robert."
"""Ay, there's the girl."""
"They did not speak again till they were just parting, when the Chief"
"Justice broke out,"
"""Why the deuce couldn't the fellow take his beastly photograph with"
"him?"""
"""It's very absurd,"" answered Sir Robert, ""but I feel just the same about"

"""I'm hanged if you're not a gentleman, Perry,"" said the Chief Justice,"
"and he hastened away, blowing his nose."

THREE AGAINST THE WORLD.
"Though the House had risen early that evening, the Central Club sat very"
"late. The smoking-room was crowded, and tongues wagged briskly. Every"
"""Speak to me!"""
"""Ilaria!"""
"""Raniero?"""
"""Dead!"""
A great silence held for a moment. The woman's head sank upon the
man's shoulder. Madness had passed. Her eyes were fixed upon his with
"a wonderful earnestness, a splendid calm."
"""Is this a dream?"""
"""It is the truth!"""
Through the forest aisles rode the Duke of Spoleto.
He saw and paused.
"""I return beyond the Alps to join the forces of Rudolf of Hapsburg. My"
"men are at your disposal. I shall wait for you on yonder hillock."""
He wheeled about and was gone.
Again silence held for a pace.
Presently Ilaria gave a great sigh and looked strangely at the sun.
"""I have dreamed a dream,"" she crooned, ""and all was dark and fearful."
"Death seemed near; lurid phantoms,--things from hell! I knew not what"
"I did, nor where I wandered, nor what strange stupor held my soul. All"

"own wife?  That was a funny thing!  And now, when, for an hour or two, he"
"had shaken free of worry, had been feeling happy--yes, happy--this fellow"
"must come, and stand there with his face of a sphinx!  And he said"
pettishly:
"""Well, Paul! sit down.  What troubles have you brought?"""
Rosek lit a cigarette but did not sit down.  He struck even Fiorsen by
his unsmiling pallor.
"""You had better look out for Mr. Wagge, Gustav; he came to me yesterday."
"He has no music in his soul."""
Fiorsen sat up.
"""Satan take Mr. Wagge!  What can he do?"""
"""I am not a lawyer, but I imagine he can be unpleasant--the girl is"
"young."""
"Fiorsen glared at him, and said:"
"""Why did you throw me that cursed girl?"""
"Rosek answered, a little too steadily:"
"""I did not, my friend."""
"""What!  You did.  What was your game?  You never do anything without a"
"game.  You know you did.  Come; what was your game?"""
LOVE’S DISGUISES.
LOVE IN SPRING.
"GOOD to be loved and to love for a little, and then"
"Well to forget, be forgotten, ere loving grow life!"
"Dear, you have loved me, but was I the man among men?"
"Sweet, I have loved you, but scarcely as mistress or wife."
"Message of Spring in the hearts of a man and a maid,"
Hearts on a holiday: ho! let us love: it is Spring.
"Joy in the birds of the air, in the buds of the glade,"
Joy in our hearts in the joy of the hours on the wing.
"Well, but to-morrow? To-morrow, good-bye: it is over."
"Scarcely with tears shall we part, with a smile who had met."
Tears? What is this? But I thought we were playing at lover.
Play-time is past. I am going. And you love me yet!
GIPSY LOVE.
"THE gipsy tents are on the down,"
The gipsy girls are here;
And it’s O to be off and away from the town
The floor was crowded now. The press and the visitors' galleries were
packed as Senator Crane's words continued to boom forth.
And in the press gallery a reporter from the Sioux City _Clarion_ looked
"at a representative of the London _Times_, and said, ""Good God! He's"
"gone off his rocker!"""
"The Englishman, aloof but definitely enthralled, touched his mustache"

Frank Corson rang the bell and waited at the door of Rhoda Kane's
apartment. The door opened. She wore a pale blue brunch coat. Her hair
"glowed in the light of midmorning, but her face was pale and a little"
drawn.
"Her eyes were slightly red, as though she might have been crying."
"""Hello, Rhoda."""
"""Hello, Frank."""
"""I really didn't expect to find you. I was going to write a note and"
"slip it under the door."""
"""I didn't feel well today so I didn't go to work."""
"""May I come in?"""
"""Of course."""
unconquerable.
"""I should have climbed that peak long ago if you, Miss Torsen, hadn't"
"forbidden me,"" said the lawyer."
"""You'd never have made it,"" said Mrs. Molie in an indifferent tone. This"
was probably her revenge. She turned to the Dane again as though ready to
believe him capable of anything.
"""I shouldn't want anyone to think of climbing that peak,"" said Miss"
"Torsen. ""It's as bare as a ship's mast."""
"""What if I tried it, Gerda?"" the manufacturer asked his wife with a smile."
"""After all, I'm an old sailor."""
"""Nonsense,"" she said, smiling a little."
"""Well, I climbed the mast of a schooner last spring."""
"""Where?"""
"""In Iceland."""
"""What for?"""
"""I don't know, though--all this mountain climbing--I haven't much use for"
"it,"" said the manufacturer."
"""What did you do it for? What did you climb the mast for?"" his wife"
repeated nervously.
The manufacturer laughed.
"""I don't know, Rhoda. I should know but I don't. I should have known"
what was wrong so I could have done something about it. It just went
"sour, I guess."""
She turned and walked to the window. He wondered if there were tears in
her eyes.
"""Good-bye, Rhoda."""
"""Good-bye, Frank. I'm sorry."""
"The door hadn't quite closed. Now, as Frank Corson turned, he found it"
open. A man stood there--a man in a blue suit with empty eyes.
Frank stared at the man for long seconds. His eyes went toward the
"window. Rhoda had turned. She was watching the man in the doorway,"
looking past Frank at the creature from somewhere in space who was
neither man nor machine. _But how--?_ Frank Corson asked himself the
question. _Good God! How had this thing come about?_
"""Not--not _him_,"" he finally exploded."
Rhoda was walking forward. The look of fevered excitement was in her
"eyes. ""Please leave, Frank."" She did not look at him as she spoke. She"
kept her eyes on the man in the blue suit.
"""Not him!"""
"""Please leave, Frank."""
But it was too late. The door had closed. The man was looking at Frank.
"""Sit down,"" he said."
dragged her with them up the ladder. Lav was at the side of the boat
tearing off his blouse.
"""Oh, Lav, what'll we do! What are you going to do now?"" cried Sidney."
"""It's so black,"" wailed Pola. ""I'm--sick!"""
"""I'm going to swim ashore. It's the only way. I don't know how long"
"this old tub'll stand a sea and the wind's rising. We got to get help."""
"""You shan't swim alone, Lavender Green. We'll _all_ swim. That's"
"nothing of a swim--"""
"""You can't! You forget--Pola."""
"Sidney wheeled in consternation. ""Pola's complex!"" The girl was"
"crouched, now, on the deck, an abject, wailing figure."
"""You go with Lav, Mart,"" said Sidney in a quiet voice. ""I'll stay with"
"Pola."""
"""What do you think I am? I guess I'll stay with her too!"""
"""But your grandmother--"""
"""Oh, gran'ma!"" Mart's voice choked. ""But she'd be the one to _tell_ me"
"to stay--"""
"""It's no use our all trying it,"" muttered Lav. ""I'll get there or I"
"won't get anywhere."""
"""Maybe it's too far for you to swim!"" Sidney was at Lavender's side,"
"""You like pleasure, I believe."""
Fiorsen said violently:
"""Look here: I have done with your friendship--you are no friend to me.  I"
"have never really known you, and I should not wish to.  It is finished."
"Leave me in peace."""
Rosek smiled.
"""My dear, that is all very well, but friendships are not finished like"
"that.  Moreover, you owe me a thousand pounds."""
"""Well, I will pay it.""  Rosek's eyebrows mounted.  ""I will.  Gyp will"
"lend it to me."""
"""Oh!  Is Gyp so fond of you as that?  I thought she only loved her"
"music-lessons."""
"Crouching forward with his knees drawn up, Fiorsen hissed out:"
"""Don't talk of Gyp!  Get out of this!  I will pay you your thousand"
"pounds."""
"Rosek, still smiling, answered:"
"""Gustav, don't be a fool!  With a violin to your shoulder, you are a man."
"Without--you are a child.  Lie quiet, my friend, and think of Mr. Wagge."
But you had better come and talk it over with me. Good-bye for the
"moment.  Calm yourself.""  And, flipping the ash off his cigarette on to"
"the tray by Fiorsen's elbow, he nodded and went."
"HUNTINGDON.  Well!  I don't know him.  He may be all right, but he's"
not our sort.  And you're too pretty to go on the tack of the New
Woman and that kind of thing--haven't been brought up to it.
"CLARE.  British home-made summer goods, light and attractive--don't"
wear long.  [At the sound of voices in the hall]  They seem 'to be
"going, Reggie."
"[HUNTINGDON looks at her, vexed, unhappy.]"
"HUNTINGDON.  Don't head for trouble, old girl.  Take a pull.  Bless"
you!  Good-night.
"CLARE kisses him, and when he has gone turns away from the door,"
"holding herself in, refusing to give rein to some outburst of"
"emotion.  Suddenly she sits down at the untouched Bridge table,"
"leaning her bare elbows on it and her chin on her hands, quite"
calm.  GEORGE is coming in.  PAYNTER follows him.
"CLARE.  Nothing more wanted, thank you, Paynter.  You can go home,"
and the maids can go to bed.
"PAYNTER.  We are much obliged, ma'am."
"CLARE.  I ran over a dog, and had to get it seen to."
"PAYNTER.  Naturally, ma'am!"
CLARE.  Good-night.
"PAYNTER.  I couldn't get you a little anything, ma'am?"
CLARE.  When every day and every night!--Oh!  I know it's my fault
"for having married him, but that doesn't help."
HUNTINGDON.  Look here!  It's not as if George wasn't quite a decent
chap.  And it's no use blinking things; you are absolutely dependent
on him.  At home they've got every bit as much as they can do to keep
going.
CLARE.  I know.
HUNTINGDON.  And you've got to think of the girls.  Any trouble would
be very beastly for them.  And the poor old Governor would feel it
awfully.
"CLARE.  If I didn't know all that, Reggie, I should have gone home"
long ago.
"HUNTINGDON.  Well, what's to be done?  If my pay would run to it--but"
it simply won't.
"CLARE.  Thanks, old boy, of course not."
HUNTINGDON.  Can't you try to see George's side of it a bit?
CLARE.  I do.  Oh!  don't let's talk about it.
"HUNTINGDON.  Well, my child, there's just one thing you won't go"
"sailing near the wind, will you?  I mean, there are fellows always on"
the lookout.
"CLARE.  ""That chap, Malise, you'd better avoid him!""  Why?"
"of seventy-six ..."""

Frank Corson lay propped on two pillows in a private room of the Park
Hill Hospital. Rhoda Kane sat in a chair beside the bed. She was pale
and very beautiful. The fire was now gone from her body and the fever
from her eyes.
"""They say he wasn't human. They say he was an android."" She shuddered,"
"looked down quickly, then slowly raised her head."
"""Yes."""
"""I'll--I'll never understand. I get sick thinking about it. I'll just"
"never understand."""
"""He was human and yet not human. He had extraordinary powers that we"
"don't begin to understand, so that what happened to you is no disgrace."""
"""It's a terrible disgrace."""
"""It happened to me, too. When he told me to sit down I had to do it. I"
"was helpless."""
"""But you fought! You overcame it."""
"Frank Corson smiled wryly. ""No, I didn't. It was just that he'd had"
"little time to work on me. It was a single mental blow, so to speak,"
"that laid me out. Like one punch in the ring. Gradually, I came out of"
"it."""
"""A woman!"" chorused the group."
"""That's what I said."""
"""Where is she now?"""
"""I don't know. I didn't see her at all. I grappled with the first"
"person I ran into. She must have gone out as you came in."" Boyd"
"indicated the side door, which was still ajar."
"""It's a lie,"" screamed Marsh."
"""It's the truth,"" stoutly maintained Emerson, ""and there was a man with"
"her, too. Who was she, Marsh? Who was the man?"""
"""She--she--I don't know."""
"""Don't lie."""
"""I'm hurt,"" reiterated the stricken man, feebly. Then, seeing the"
"bewilderment in the faces about him, he burst out anew: ""Don't stand"
"there like a lot of fools. Why don't you get him?"""
"""If I stabbed him I must have had a knife,"" Emerson said, again"
"checking the forward movement. ""You may search me if you like. See?"" He"
opened his coat and displayed his belt.
"""He's got a six-shooter,"" some one said."
"""Yes, and I may use it,"" said Emerson, quietly."
"Inside, a shadow of concern moved like a quick cloud across her"
"beautiful face. ""You don't look well, Frank."""
"""I'm quite all right, really. Haven't been sleeping too well, but"
"there's been a lot on my mind."""
"""I've been hoping you'd phone."""
"""I wanted to but there didn't seem to be anything to say. Nothing except"
"that I'm sorry I let you down so miserably."""
"""Frank! You didn't. You really didn't. It was just that--oh, it's not"
"important any more."""
"""No. It's not important now."""
"""Would you like a drink?"""
"""Thanks, no. I've come to say good-bye."""
"""Good-bye?"""
"""Yes. I'm leaving Park Hill--leaving New York. I'm going into a small"
Minnesota hospital to finish my internship. Then I'll probably practice
"out there somewhere."""
Behind the new glitter of her eyes there was stark misery.
"""Frank--Frank--what went wrong with us?"""
The appeal was a labored whisper.
"""Only think, Alicia!"" she cried. ""Dick is on his way home, and with such"
"good news. We've just had a cable from him."""
"""Coming back!"""
"""Yes. He's engaged! He met the Grangers on their tour round the"
"world--you know them, the great cotton people?--at Sydney, and he's"
"engaged to the youngest girl, Violet--you remember her? It all happened"
in a fortnight. Mary and Lord Eynesford are delighted. It's just
"perfect. She's very pretty, and tremendously well off. I do declare, I"
never thought Dick would end so well! What a happy thought it was
"sending him away! Aren't you delighted?"""
"""It sounds very nice, doesn't it? I don't think I knew her more than"
"just to speak to."""
"""Dick'll be here in four days. I've been looking for you to tell you for"
"the last hour. Where have you been?"""
"""In the Park."""
"""Alone, as usual, you hermit?"""
"""Well, I met the Medlands and Mr. Norburn, and talked to them for a"
"little while."""
"""Alicia! But it's no use talking to you. Come and find Mary."""
"""No, Eleanor, I'm tired, and--and hot. I'll go to my room."""
"""Oh, you must come and see her first."""
"""Just a moment."""
"Crane waited. He waited for what seemed like ages, but a glance at his"
watch told him it had been less than five minutes. He disconnected and
dialed again.
"""This is Crane. We got cut off. I want to talk to Porter."""
"""I'm sorry but Mr. Porter has gone for the day."""
"""Well, where can I reach him? It's important."""
"""I'm sorry. Mr. Porter left no number."""
"""When will he be back?"""
"""He didn't say."""
"Crane slammed the phone down. ""The bastards!"" he snarled. ""The lousy,"
crummy bastards. Running like a pack of scared rats. Bureaucrats!
"Damned, cowardly, self-appointed opportunists!"""
He stopped cursing and sat for a while.
When he got up and left the office he looked and felt old but he had
faced a truth. It would not be necessary to campaign next year.
It wouldn't be of any use.

The Jewish converts who at first composed the church had a rich heritage
"of song in the Book of Psalms. This was their hymnbook, used in the"
Temple worship and in the home and probably also in the synagogue
"services. The use of the Psalms, carried over from the Jewish service,"
forms to this day an important element in Christian worship.
"Besides the Psalms, the early church sang the nativity lyrics that adorn"
the first two chapters of the Gospel of Luke. It also made extensive use
"of _Hallelujah_ as a part of the people’s praise, adding, in the course"
"of time, the _Gloria Patri_, the _Sanctus_, the _Te Deum_, and other"
canticles.

"She had her face towards the window, and dark as the room was"
growing--outside the light was failing fast--he read the thought in
"her eyes, and nodded."
"'The Waldgrave?' he said lightly. 'Yes, he is alive, Countess, at"
present; and your steward also.'
"'They are prisoners?' she whispered, her cheeks grown white."
'Prisoners; and under sentence of death.'
'Where?'
'In my camp.'
'Why?' she muttered. But alas! she knew; she knew already.
"'They are hostages for your good behaviour,' he answered in his cold,"
"mocking tone. 'If their principal satisfies me, good; they will go"

"Mr. Coxon had wandered to the window again, and was thrumming on the"
panes. He turned on hearing some one enter. It was Sir Robert Perry.
"""Well,"" he began, ""I bring news of the event of the day."""
"""About to-night?"" asked Coxon eagerly."
"""To-night! That's not the event of the day. Ministers are a deal"

Coxon turned away disappointed.
"""Nearly everything here is mine."""
Rosek shook his head.
"""The lease is in his name--you are his wife.  They can do it, I assure"
"you.""  A sort of shadow passed over his face, and he added: ""I cannot"
"help him any more--just now."""
Gyp shook her head quickly.
"""No--of course!  You ought not to have helped him at all.  I can't"
"bear--""  He bowed, and she stopped, ashamed.  ""How much does he owe"
"altogether?"""
"""About thirteen hundred pounds.  It isn't much, of course.  But there is"
"something else--"""
"""Worse?"""
Rosek nodded.
"""I am afraid to tell you; you will think again perhaps that I am trying"
"to make capital out of it.  I can read your thoughts, you see.  I cannot"
"afford that you should think that, this time."""
Gyp made a little movement as though putting away his words.

"""It's funny, that's all I got to say. I mean--how it come here."""
"""Lavender Green, show me that knife this minute! You act so mysterious"
"and I have a right to know why."""
Slowly Lavender placed the knife in Sidney's eager hands. It was an
"ordinary case knife such as the fishermen carried, but Lavender pointed"
to two initials that had been carved on the case.
"""J.S."""
"""J.S."" repeated Sidney; then she cried: ""Why--J.S.! That's Jed Starrow!"""
"""Sure it's Jed Starrow!"""
"""But how did it get on the _Arabella_?"""
"""That's what I'd like to know."""
"""He's _been_ on the _Arabella_, Lav!"""
"""Or someone of his gang."""
"""Isn't that _funny_? What would he come here for?"""
"Lavender was silent. And Sidney, staring at him as though to read from"
"his face some explanation, suddenly fell silent, too. The secret that"
Cap'n Davies had laid upon her weighed heavily. She _wished_ she could
tell.

As concerning my friend is anything amiss?
"_C. Custance._ No, not on my part; but here was Sim. Suresby--"
"_T. Trusty._ He was with me, and told me so."
_C. Custance._ And he stood by
"While Ralph Roister Doister, with help of Merrygreek,"
For promise of marriage did unto me seek.
_T. Trusty._ And had ye made any promise before them twain?
"_C. Custance._ No, I had rather be torn in pieces and slain."
"No man hath my faith and troth but Gawin Goodluck,"
"And that before Suresby did I say, and there stuck;"
But of certain letters there were such words spoken--
_T. Trusty._ He told me that too.

“But I am already married!” cried Yvonne.
“Thinking me dead?”
“Yes.”
"He looked at her for a few seconds, then slapped his thigh and, rising"
"from his chair, bent himself double and gave vent to a roar of laughter."
The tears stood in Yvonne’s eyes.
"“Oh, but it’s comic. You don’t find it so?”"
He leant back against the railings and laughed again in genuine
merriment.
"“Why, it’s all the more reason to come back to me. _Ça y met du salé_."
Have you any children?”
Yvonne shook her head.
"“_Eh bien!_” he exclaimed, triumphantly, stepping towards her with"
"outstretched hands. But she shrank from him, outraged and bewildered."
"“Never, never!” she cried. “Go away. Have pity on me, for God’s sake!”"
Amédée Bazouge shrugged his shoulders carelessly.

And very soon the French and English skippers were talking to each
"other at the rate of knots, while Hart sat in a crowd of Frenchmen"
and told them all about everything.
It was close on sundown when Jones returned to the _Potluck_.  He had
to be helped up the side by some of the crew.
"""Ain't we under arrest?"" they asked.  ""Does we dare come out?"""
Jones hiccupped.
"""I releases you on your own recognition,"" he said.  ""So down you come"
"and 'elp."""
"When he put his foot on the deck, he mustered all hands aft."
"""And you, Lampert, and you, Simcox!"""
The two mates came out of their cabins.
"""And where's Hart?"""
"""If you please, sir, he's drunk,"" said Billy."
"""Arrest 'im,"" said the skipper; ""what's 'e mean by it?  Now, look"
"'ere, you bally lot, what does you think of yourselves?"""
The crew appeared uneasy.

and pistol in his girdle and a white shoulder sash.
'Herr Krapp?' I said.
"'The same,' he answered, eying me gravely."
"'I am the Countess of Heritzburg's steward,' I said. I began to see"
the need of explanation. 'Doubtless you have heard that she is in the
city?'
"'Certainly,' he answered. 'In the Ritter Strasse.'"
"'Yes,' I replied. 'A fortnight ago she missed a young woman, one of"
"her attendants. She was lost in a night adventure,' I continued, my"
throat dry and husky. 'A few minutes ago I saw her looking from one of
your windows.'
'From one of my windows?' he exclaimed in a tone of surprise.
"'Yes,' I said stiffly."
He opened his eyes wide. 'Here?' he said. He pointed to his house.
I nodded.
"'Impossible!' he replied, shutting his lips suddenly. 'Quite"
"impossible, my friend. My household consists of my two sons and"
"myself. We have a housekeeper only, and two lads. I have no young"
women in the house.'
"'Yet I saw her face, Herr Krapp, at your window,' I answered"
"The Princess looked puzzled.  ""But it wasn't your fault, dear, that"
"mother died."""
"""Oh, no, no, I'm not saying that.  As you know, a dragon carried her"
"off and--well, there it was.  But supposing""--he looked at her"
"shyly--""I had married again."""
The Princess was startled.
"""Who?"" she asked."
"The King peered into his flagon.  ""Well,"" he said, ""there _are_"
"people."""
"""If it had been somebody _very_ nice,"" said the Princess wistfully,"
"""it might have been rather lovely."""
The King gazed earnestly at the outside of his flagon.
"""Why 'might have been?'"" he said."
"The Princess was still puzzled.  ""But I'm grown up,"" she said; ""I"
"don't want a mother so much now."""
The King turned his flagon round and studied the other side of it.
"""A mother's--er--tender hand,"" he said, ""is--er--never----"" and then"
the outrageous thing happened.
"It was all because of a birthday present to the King of Barodia, and"
the present was nothing less than a pair of seven-league boots.  The
"King being a busy man, it was a week or more before he had an"
"""Play me the 'Carnival,'"" he said.  ""We shall soon see!"""
"Gyp played.  Twice he nodded; once he tapped his fingers on his teeth,"
"and showed her the whites of his eyes--which meant: ""That will have to be"
"very different!""  And once he grunted.  When she had finished, he sat"
"down beside her, took her hand in his, and, examining the fingers, began:"
"""Yes, yes, soon again!  Spoiling yourself, playing for that fiddler!"
"Trop sympathique!  The back-bone, the back-bone--we shall improve that."
"Now, four hours a day for six weeks--and we shall have something again."""
Gyp said softly:
"""I have a baby, Monsieur Harmost."""
Monsieur Harmost bounded.
"""What!  That is a tragedy!""  Gyp shook her head.  ""You like it?  A baby!"
"Does it not squall?"""
"""Very little."""
"""Mon Dieu!  Well, well, you are still as beautiful as ever.  That is"
"something.  Now, what can you do with this baby?  Could you get rid of it"
"a little?  This is serious.  This is a talent in danger. A fiddler, and a"
"baby!  C'est beaucoup!  C'est trop!"""
"Gyp smiled.  And Monsieur Harmost, whose exterior covered much"
"sensibility, stroked her hand."
"""You have grown up, my little friend,"" he said gravely.  ""Never mind;"
"and rather looking on than taking part. 'What is it?' I said, shaking"
him roughly by the arm. 'What is the matter here?'
"'Hallo!' he answered, starting as he turned to me. 'Is it you again,"
my friend?'
I had hit on Herr Krapp!' Yes!' I cried breathlessly. 'What is it?
what is amiss?'
"He shrugged his shoulders. 'They are hanging a spy,' he answered."
"'Nothing more. Irregular, but wholesome.'"
I drew a deep breath. 'Is that all?' I said.
"He eyed me curiously. 'To be sure,' he said. 'What did you think it"
was?'
"'I feared that there might be something wrong at my lady's,' I said,"
beginning to get my breath again. 'I left her alone at sunset. And
when I saw this crowd before the house I--I could almost have cut off
"my hand. Thank God, I was mistaken!'"
"He looked at me again and seemed to reflect a moment. Then he said,"
'You have not found the young woman you were seeking?'
I shook my head.
"'Well, it occurred to me afterwards--but at which window did you see"
her?'
"'At a window on the first floor; the farthest from the door,' I"
answered.

The affair seemed to cause him intense amusement. A ray of light
appeared to Yvonne.
"“You won’t interfere with me at all, Amédée--not claim anything?”"
"“Oh, don’t be afraid. _Dès ce moment je vais me reflanquer au sapin!_ I"
shall be as dead as dead can be for you. _Suis pas méchant va!_”
"“Thank you,” said Yvonne. “You were always kind-hearted, Amédée--oh,"
it was a horrible mistake--it can’t be altered. You see that I am
helpless.”
"“Why, my child,” said he, seating himself again, “I keep on telling you"
it is a farce--like all the rest of life. I only laugh. And now let us
talk a little before I pop into the coffin again. What is the name of
the thrice happy being?”
"“Oh, don’t ask me, I beg you,” said Yvonne shivering. “It is all"
so painful. Tell me about yourself--your voice--Is it still in good
condition?”
“Never better. I am singing here this afternoon.”
“In the Kursaal?”
"“Why, yes. That’s why I am here. Oh, _ca marche--pas encore paralysée,"
celle-là_. Come and hear me. _Et ton petit organe à toi?_”
“I am out of practice. I have given up the profession.”
"with him, and going alone was such a bore. He did not conceal that the"
young woman meant something to him.
"Solem approached, and lifted his cap in greeting. Then he looked round"
"quickly and began to talk to the lawyer--politely, as became his position"
of a servant:
"""The Danish gentleman is going to climb the peak tomorrow. I'm to take a"
"rope and go with him."""
The lawyer was startled.
"""Is he--?"""
"The blankness of the lawyer's face was a remarkable sight. His small,"
athletic brain failed him. A moment passed in silence.
"""Yes, early tomorrow morning,"" said Solem. ""I thought I'd tell you."
"Because after all it was your idea first."""
"""Yes, so it was,"" said the lawyer. ""You're quite right. But now he'll be"
"ahead of me."""
Solem knew how to get round that.
"""No, I didn't promise to go,"" he said. ""I told him I had to go to the"
"village tomorrow."""
"""But we can't deceive him. I don't want to do that."""
"""Pity,"" said Solem. ""Everybody says the first one to climb the Blue Peak"
"will be in all the papers."""

"“I'll go and tell her now,” said John."
“Let me just say how d' ye do to her first. I won't stay a minute.”
The two men entered the sea-chamber together. Stella welcomed her Great
High Favourite and chatted gaily for a while. Then she commanded him to
sit down.
"“I 'm afraid I can't stay, Stellamaris. I have to go back to London.”"
Stella glanced at the clock. “Your train does n't go for an hour.” She
was jealously learned in trains.
“I think John wants to talk to you.”
"“He has been talking to me quite beautifully for a long time,” said"
"Stella, “and I want to talk to you.”"
"“He has something very particular to say, Stellamaris.”"
"“What is it, Belovedest?” Her eyes sparkled, and she clasped her hands"
over her childish bosom. “You are not going to marry Belinda Molyneux?”
"“No, dear,” said John; “I'm not going to marry anybody.”"
“I'm so glad.” She turned to Herold. “Are you going to get married?”
"“No,” smiled Herold."

"""What then?"""
"""I would follow you to the world's end!"""

"He held out his arms toward her, impulse rising like the sun high and"
splendid above the mists of distrust. It was an instant's
"forgetfulness, which passed as rapidly as it had come. His arms sank"
heavily to his side.
"""Have you thought what that means? If you go with me, you must leave"
"your people for ever."""
"""I would follow you gladly."""
He shook his head.
"""You do not understand. You must leave them now--now when I go against"
"them."""
"""No!"" she broke in roughly. ""You can't, Nehal, you can't. You have the"
right to be bitter and angry; you have not the right to commit a
crime. And it would be a crime. You are plunging thousands into

eyes checked her.
Balt. A half-hour's run down the bay and he clambered from his launch
"to the pile-driver, where, amid the confusion and noise, he made known"
his tidings. The big fellow's calmness amazed him.
"""What are you going to do now?"""
"""Butcher by hand,"" said the fisherman."
"""But how? That takes skilled labor--lots of it."""
"George grinned. ""I'm too old a bird to be caught like this. I figured"
"on accidents from the start, and when I hired my Chinamen I included a"
"crew of cutters."""
"""By Jove, you never told me!"""
"""There wasn't no use. We ain't licked yet, not by a damned sight."
"Willis Marsh will have to try again."""
CHAPTER XXI
A HAND IN THE DARK
While they were talking a tug-boat towing a pile-driver came into view.
Boyd asked the meaning of its presence in this part of the river.
"""I don't know,"" answered Big George, staring intently. ""Yonder looks"
"here.' And again she tried to shut the door, but I prevented her."
'Where is he?' I asked sternly.
"'He is at morning drill, if you must know,' she snapped; 'and his two"
"sons. Now, will you let me shut my door? Or must I cry out?'"
"'Nonsense, mother!' I said. 'Who is in the house besides yourself?'"
"'What is that to you?' she replied, breathing short."
"'I have told you,' I said, trying to control my anger. 'I----'"
"But, quick as lightning, the door slammed to and cut me short. I had"
thoughtlessly moved my foot. I heard the woman chuckle and go slipshod
"down the passage, and though I knocked again in a rage, the door"
remained closed.
"I fell back and looked at the house. An elderly man in a grave, sober"
"dress was passing, among others, and I caught his eye."
'Whose house is that?' I asked him.
"'Herr Krapp's,' he answered."
"'I am a stranger,' I said. 'Is he a man of substance?'"
The person I addressed smiled. 'He is a member of the Council of
"Safety,' he said dryly. 'His brother is prefect of this ward. But here"
is Herr Krapp. Doubtless he has been at St. Sebald's drilling.'
"I thanked him, and made but two steps to Herr Krapp's side. He was the"
"""Sure."" Norton grinned. ""I am that."" He disappeared down the ladder"
towards the generator room.
"Andrews turned to Alice. ""You're not going to go for that fancy"
"routine, are you?"" he demanded crossly."
"""What routine?"""
"""First he uses power for hot water, power that I was storing up. Now"
"he's going to pedal that thing to waste more power."""
"Alice shrugged. ""He's the spaceman,"" she said simply. ""If he thinks we"
"can spare the power for a bath, I could certainly use one."""
"""How can you trust the likes of him?"""
"""We've got to,"" she said. ""We've got to."""
"""I wouldn't,"" said Andrews. ""I can't."""
"She looked at her employer seriously. ""We've both got to trust him,"""
"she said quietly. ""Because, right or wrong, he is the only one who"
"knows anything about space and what's likely to happen next."""
"""At a hundred an hour,"" Andrews said for the ninetieth time or so,"
scathingly.
"Alice nodded soberly. ""But you mustn't forget that isn't going to do"
"him any good unless he gets us all home so that he can use it."""
"Reluctantly, Andrews nodded. ""I suppose you're right."""
"can have heard, that it would distress you to speak of."""
"She said nothing, but fixed her eyes on his."
"""I am right?"" he asked. ""It is about--my wife?"""
"She bowed her head. He stood silent for a moment, and she cried,"
"""It was only gossip--a woman's gossip; I did wrong to listen to it."""
"""Gossip,"" he said, ""is often true. This is true,"" and he set his lips."
"The worst often finds or makes people calm. She had flushed at first,"
"but the colour went again, and she said quietly,"
"""If you have time and don't mind, I should like to hear it all."""
"She had forgotten what this request must mean to him, or perhaps she"
"thought the time for pretence had gone by. If so, he understood, for he"
"answered,"
"""It's your right."""
"Her eyes sank to the ground, but she did not quarrel with his words. She"
stood motionless while he told his story. He spoke with wilful brevity
and dryness.
"""I was a young man when I met her. She was married, and I went to the"
"house. Her husband----"""
"""Did he ill-treat her?"""
"""I don't know. Why?"""
"""I wonder if I could get one."""
"""What do you want it for?"""
"""Don't you think it might attract people to the place? Oh, well, perhaps"
"it wouldn't."""
And Paul withdrew.
Madder than ever. Some people see flies. Paul saw goldfish.
XX
The lawyer is constantly in Miss Torsen's company; he even swings her in
"the children's swing, and puts his arm around her to steady her when the"
"swing stops. Solem watches all this from the field where he is working,"
and begins to sing a ribald song. Certainly these two have so ill-used him
"that if he is going to sing improper songs in self-defense, this is the"
"time to do it; no one will gainsay that. So he sang his song very loud,"
and then began to yodel.
"But Miss Torsen went on swinging, and the lawyer went on putting his arm"
round her and stopping her....
It was a Saturday evening. I stood talking to the lawyer in the garden; he
"didn't like the place, and wanted to leave, but Miss Torsen would not go"
"Frank Corson sat down. He saw the man and he saw Rhoda, but they seemed"
unimportant. Something had happened to his mind and he was busy
struggling with it. That was all that was important.
The strange lethargy that came like a cloud over his mind was beyond
understanding.

Captain Abrams looked into the closet and back at Brent Taber. His lips
"were back a little off his teeth. With Abrams, this indicated anger."
"""All right. What does Washington do about this one? Does Washington tell"
"us to be good little boys and go hand out parking tickets?"""
"""It wasn't like that,"" Taber said."
"""It doesn't much matter how it was. The thing is--how is it going to be"
"now?"""
"""You got a murder, friend. Plain and simple. What do the New York police"
"do when they get a murder?"""
"Abrams spoke bitterly. ""Sometimes they let a panel truck drive in and"
"haul the body away and that's that."""
"""Let's save the sarcasm until later. I called you in. It's your case."
"What do you want me to do?"""
"""Talk a little, maybe. The other one--now this one. The same killer?"""
"""Oh, I'm--I'm--sick!"" broke in Pola."
"""Sit up straight and talk and you won't think about it,"" commanded"
"Mart, so sternly that Pola straightened, her white face wan in the"
darkness.
"""I don't see how you _can_ talk when you're--may be--going--to die!"""
"""Well, talking helps you more than crying."""
"""But I--I don't _want_ to--die."""
"""Who does?"" retorted Mart roughly. Nevertheless, touched by Pola's"
"helplessness, she found Pola's hand and held it close in hers. ""But"
"let's face whatever happens with our heads up!"""
"""To the wind,"" breathed Sidney, shivering."
"""I--I just can't be brave like you two. I--I'm an awful coward. I can't"
help it. I've always been afraid to even try to swim. I'm afraid of
"lots of things. Oh, I'm afraid to--to--"""
Sidney caught Pola's other hand.
"""Don't say it, Pola. Maybe someone will find us. And probably you can't"
"help feeling afraid."""
Mart suddenly remembered the cookies she had brought. She found them
where she had hidden them at the back of one of the bunks.
"""Here, eat a cookie and you'll forget things. I'm hungry, aren't you,"
"too?"""
"house, she had heard the men summoning him. She had lost no time in"
getting to Sunset Lane.
"""Who went with me? Where? What's happened?"""
Now Aunt Achsa let her whole weight drop against Mr. Dugald.
"""Didn't Sidney go 'long to Truro with you?"" she asked falteringly."
"""I didn't go to Truro. Knew this storm was comin'. Where--"""
"""Oh--h!"" Aunt Achsa moaned Mr. Dugald motioned to Miss Vine."
"""Take care of things--here. I'm off--"""
"""Cap'n Davies and Jim Saunders and Pete Cady's gone out in the"
"_Sally_,"" cried one of the men who had brought Lavender home. But"
Dugald Allan had plunged into the darkness without hearing him. The men
rushed after him.
Miss Vine pushed Aunt Achsa into a chair.
"""You're not going to cross any bridges 'til you come to them, Achsy"
Green. Doctor Blackwell brought Lav into this world and he isn't going
to let him quit it without putting up a pretty good fight. Jeremiah
Berry's in with him and he's as good as two women. You wrap that shawl
'round you 'til I can light a lamp and get you some clothes. You're
"shivering like it was December. I'll put the kettle over, too--"""
"Oddly huge and gaunt in the shadowy room, Miss Vine moved and talked"
briskly to keep up Aunt Achsa's nerve and her own against the black
fear that held them.
"sunny and carefree soul of yours?"""
"""Nobody! _Nobody!_"""
"""Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand--"""
"""I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me"
"Ford."""
"""Ford? _Ford?_ Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand...."""
After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few
"moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided"
"miserably. Besides, she was a girl."
"All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could"
help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to
"him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a"
little better.
"The door opened on the signal, ""Sesame."" When Butt saw somebody was"
"with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his"
fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.
"He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered"
his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump
when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.
"""An honor, Miss Sparling,"" he said in that rumbly voice. ""Please come"
"right in. There's a hurry-up draft."""
So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the
"Charlotte. “I agree with mother,” she cried triumphantly. “The train"
overweights it.”
"Old Mr. Neave, forgotten, sank into the broad lap of his chair, and,"
"dozing, heard them as though he dreamed. There was no doubt about it,"
he was tired out; he had lost his hold. Even Charlotte and the girls
were too much for him to-night. They were too... too.... But all his
drowsing brain could think of was—too _rich_ for him. And somewhere at
the back of everything he was watching a little withered ancient man
climbing up endless flights of stairs. Who was he?
"“I shan’t dress to-night,” he muttered."
"“What do you say, father?”"
"“Eh, what, what?” Old Mr. Neave woke with a start and stared across at"
"them. “I shan’t dress to-night,” he repeated."
"“But, father, we’ve got Lucile coming, and Henry Davenport, and Mrs."
Teddie Walker.”
“It will look so _very_ out of the picture.”
"“Don’t you feel well, dear?”"
“You needn’t make any effort. What is Charles _for_?”
"“But if you’re really not up to it,” Charlotte wavered."
“Very well! Very well!” Old Mr. Neave got up and went to join that
little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing-room....
"Entman's little eyes shone with affection. ""I can only wish you good"
"luck."""
"""Thanks. I'll need it."""
"""And one more thing I was wondering."""
"""What's that?"""
"""Why do you suppose the tenth android killed the one in the Village?"""
"""Another case of taking one reason for want of a better one. I think it"
was his way of delivering the creature to us for research. He couldn't
"know for sure that we already had his 'brothers.'"""
"""You're right--you must be,"" Entman agreed."
"""Small consolation. I'd like a few facts to go on for a change instead"
"of having to depend on logic all the time,"" Taber growled."
"""What are you referring to?"""
"""The data. I'm assuming, _if_ that's what's important, that the tenth"
"creature has a way of getting the stuff back up there."""
"""I can help a little on that,"" Entman said. ""I can assure you that from"
"what I've found in those brains, the data could, most likely, be sent"
"mentally."""
"""You're sure of that?"""
"MRS. FULLARTON, taken aback, cannot refrain from her glance at"
FULLARTON automatically gazing at CLARE while he talks with
HUNTINGDON.
MRS. FULLARTON.  Of course--the only thing is that----
"CLARE.  [With a faint smile]  It's all right, Dolly.  I'm not coming."
"MRS. FULLARTON.  Oh!  don't do anything desperate, Clare--you are so"
desperate sometimes.  You ought to make terms--not tracks.
CLARE.  Haggle?  [She shakes her head]  What have I got to make terms
with?  What he still wants is just what I hate giving.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  But, Clare----"
"CLARE.  No, Dolly; even you don't understand.  All day and every day"
"--just as far apart as we can be--and still--Jolly, isn't it?  If"
you've got a soul at all.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  It's awful, really."
"CLARE.  I suppose there are lots of women who feel as I do, and go on"
"with it; only, you see, I happen to have something in me that--comes"
"to an end.  Can't endure beyond a certain time, ever."
"She has taken a flower from her dress, and suddenly tears it to"
bits.  It is the only sign of emotion she has given.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  [Watching]  Look here, my child; this won't do.  You"
must get a rest.  Can't Reggie take you with him to India for a bit?
My stomach is not good;
But sure I think that I can drink
With him that wears a hood.
"Though I go bare, take ye no care,"
I am nothing a-cold;
I stuff my skin so full within
Of jolly good ale and old.
"Back and side go bare, go bare,"
Both foot and hand go cold:
"But belly, God send thee good ale enough,"
Whether it be new or old.

In the end they came to an agreement.
"""You won't tell anyone?"" the lawyer said to me."
*       *       *       *       *
The lawyer was missed in the course of the morning; he was not in his
"room, and not in the garden."
"""Perhaps the Danish mountaineer can tell us where he is,"" I said. But it"
transpired that the Dane had not even thought of climbing the Blue Peak
"that day, and knew nothing whatever about the expedition."
This surprised me greatly.
I looked at the clock; it was eleven. I had been watching the peak through
"my field glasses from the moment I got up, but there was nothing to be"
seen. It was five hours since the two men had left.
At half-past eleven Solem came running back; he was drenched in sweat and
exhausted.
"“Come,” he said, “we must first sup.”"
"She gathered up her skirts, and slipped her hand through his arm. They"
"climbed up to the courtyard, and so into the street, and out into the"
night.
Madelaine sat on the side of the bed and undressed.
It was a sadly simple undressing.
She was languid with sleep.
"Noll went and looked out of the window, where Paris lay below him,"
blinking her thousand eyes....
He roused and went to the bed.
The dark head on the pillow lay very still. The girl was fast asleep.
Noll went back to the window--it was the window from which Horace had
gazed down upon the world the night before Noll and Betty had come to
Paris.
"And as Noll so stood, his brows hard knit upon the problems of his"
"life, the night slowly passed."
The rustle of a woman’s skirt had been in his ears all day--in his
"blood. This girl had brought back to him, of a sudden, the fragrance of"
his marriage.
And this beautiful winsome girl--what was to be the end?
"insects.  Each of these bright frail, growing things had life and"
individuality like herself!
The sound of footsteps on the gravel made her turn.  Rosek was coming
"from the drawing-room window.  Rather startled, Gyp looked at him over"
her shoulder.  What had brought him at eleven o'clock in the morning?  He
"came up to her, bowed, and said:"
"""I came to see Gustav.  He's not up yet, it seems.  I thought I would"
"speak to you first.  Can we talk?"""
"Hesitating just a second, Gyp drew off her gardening-gloves:"
"""Of course!  Here?  Or in the drawing-room?"""
Rosek answered:
"""In the drawing-room, please."""
"A faint tremor passed through her, but she led the way, and seated"
herself where she could see Betty and the baby.  Rosek stood looking down
"at her; his stillness, the sweetish gravity of his well-cut lips, his"
spotless dandyism stirred in Gyp a kind of unwilling admiration.
"""What is it?"" she said."
"""Bad business, I'm afraid.  Something must be done at once.  I have been"
"trying to arrange things, but they will not wait.  They are even"
"threatening to sell up this house."""
"With a sense of outrage, Gyp cried:"
"“By the way, I think your old admirer, Severance, must be about to put"
"himself in silken fetters, as Boswell would say. I caught him buying an"
unusually fine sapphire in Tiffany’s yesterday. Said it was for his
sister. H’m—h’m.”
“Ah! I wonder who it can be?”
“Don’t know. Hasn’t looked at a woman since you left. But I have a
strong suspicion that it is some one here in Newport.”
“Here! I wonder if it can be Edith?”
"“Miss Decker? Sure enough. Never seemed to pay her much attention,"
though. She’s not my style; too much like sixteen dozen other New York
girls.”
"He buttoned up his coat, braced himself against it, and gave his"
moustache a frantic twist.
"“Mrs.—Jessica!” he ejaculated desperately, “you are engaged to"
me—won’t you—won’t you—”
She drew herself up and glanced down upon him from her higher chair with
a look of sad disapproval.
"“I did not think it of you, Teddy,” she said. “And it is one of the"
things of which I have never approved.”
"“But why not?” asked Teddy, feebly."
“I thought you knew me better than to ask such a question.”
"columns of smoke close together, and you ought to know what that means.”"
“Indian sign! Boy Scout sign! Means ‘Help is wanted’!” exclaimed Harry.
“We’ve got to go and see what it is.”
"“It may be Jimmie,” Jack suggested."
"“It’s either Jimmie or that messenger boy,” Frank said. “If it’s Jimmie,"
"he’s really in trouble, and if it’s the messenger boy, he’s doing it to"
get more of us into his clutches.”
"“Then we’d better go well armed and ready for any kind of a reception,”"
Jack advised. “No knowing what we’ll find.”
“What’ll we do with Gilroy?” asked Frank.
"“Aw, let him sleep,” advised Harry."
"“Sure, let him sleep,” Jack put in. “He’ll be all right ’till we get"
back. No one will molest the camp in daytime.”
"“Seems to me that we ought to leave someone here,” Frank said."
"“All right, you can stay if you want to!” Jack declared. “Harry and I"
are going down there to see what the trouble is about.”
"“Aw, come on, Frank!” Harry urged. “There won’t anything happen to"
"Gilroy! He may have a bad dream, but that’s about all.”"
“How far do you suppose that signal is from here?” asked Frank.
"“Not more than half a mile,” Harry explained."
"What did it mean? Hastily, I could fill in “Dearest Nettie,” and “I am"
"dying to see you.” Kennedy added, “The Recherche to-day,” that being"
"the name of a new apartment uptown, as well as “love and many kisses.”"
But “—rman”—what did that mean? Could it be Herman—Herman Schloss?
She was returning and we resumed our seats quickly.
Kennedy took the jewel case from her and examined it carefully. There
was not a mark on it.
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he said slowly, rising and handing it back to her,"
“have you told me all?”
"“Why—yes,” she answered."
Kennedy shook his head gravely.
“I’m afraid not. You must tell me everything.”
"“No—no,” she cried vehemently, “there is nothing more.”"
"We left and outside the Deluxe he paused, looked about, caught sight of"
a taxicab and hailed it.
“Where?” asked the driver.
"“Across the street,” he said, “and wait. Put the window in back of you"
"down so I can talk. I’ll tell you where to go presently. Now, Walter,"
sit back as far as you can. This may seem like an underhand thing to
"do, but we’ve got to get what that woman won’t tell us or give up the"
case.”
"only fitting you should have an opportunity to see it first hand."""
"""Mind giving us a preview of the upcoming agenda?"" Vance leaned back."
"""We need to plan our day."""
"""Quite simply, I thought it was time you and I got reacquainted, Dr."
"Vance. It's been a long time."""
"""Eight years."""
"""Yes. Eight years . . ."" There was a pause. ""If you would excuse me a"
"moment, I must take a call."""
The speaker clicked off.
"""Michael, I've got a very bad feeling about all this."" She was rising"
"from the bath, her back to the camera. ""What do you think he's going to"
"do?"""
"He's going to kill us, Vance realized. After he's played with us a"
while. It's really quite simple.
"""I don't know,"" he lied."
"Then the speaker clicked on again. ""Please forgive me. There are so"
"many demands on my time. However, I was hoping you, Dr. Vance, would"
consent to join me this afternoon for tea. We have some urgent matters
"to discuss."""
"""I'll see if I can work it into my schedule."""
"""Given the hectic goings-on here at the moment, perhaps a quiet moment"
settled. All we have to do now is to wait until the Courts take up again
"and confirm--"""
"""How long will that be?"" Slyne inquired. He, too, was smiling"
ecstatically.
"""Not much more than a fortnight,"" the lawyer informed him. ""It will soon"
"pass. We must just be patient."""
"""We must keep very quiet, too,"" said Slyne, ""unless we want to give the"
whole show away to the enemy in advance. We must clear off out of London
"till then. I'll tell you what, Jobling! Why shouldn't we all go down to"
"Scotland to-night?"""
"Mr. Jobling nodded agreement. ""An excellent idea,"" he declared. ""There's"
"nothing to keep us here."""
"""That's settled, then,"" Slyne asserted. ""And we'll all dine together at"
the Savoy before we start. I think we can afford to celebrate the
"occasion, eh! And I want to show Lady Josceline a few of her future"
"friends."""
CHAPTER XVI
"""PLEASURES AND PALACES"""
"The Duchess of Dawn was dining a number of notabilities at the Savoy, on"
her way to a command performance at the Gaiety; a fact of which the
across a fine circle of foam. “A young man took it. He went up to bed
two hours ago.”
"“Now, did ye, Mrs. Purdy, ma’am?” said Mrs. McCool, with intense"
admiration. “You do be a wonder for rentin’ rooms of that kind. And did
"ye tell him, then?” she concluded in a husky whisper, laden with"
mystery.
"“Rooms,” said Mrs. Purdy, in her furriest tones, “are furnished for to"
"rent. I did not tell him, Mrs. McCool.”"
"“’Tis right ye are, ma’am; ’tis by renting rooms we kape alive. Ye have"
"the rale sense for business, ma’am. There be many people will rayjict"
the rentin’ of a room if they be tould a suicide has been after dyin’
in the bed of it.”
"“As you say, we has our living to be making,” remarked Mrs. Purdy."
"“Yis, ma’am; ’tis true. ’Tis just one wake ago this day I helped ye lay"
"out the third floor, back. A pretty slip of a colleen she was to be"
"killin’ herself wid the gas—a swate little face she had, Mrs. Purdy,"
ma’am.”
"“She’d a-been called handsome, as you say,” said Mrs. Purdy, assenting"
"but critical, “but for that mole she had a-growin’ by her left eyebrow."
"Do fill up your glass again, Mrs. McCool.”"
THE BRIEF DÉBUT OF TILDY
"""Awake, Alice?"" Norton asked brightly."
"""Awake again,"" she said unhappily. ""For.... What is it? The ninth day?"""
"""Eighth,"" he said. ""Can't go on much longer."""
"""I hope not."""
"""You look all in,"" he said softly. He sat down on the edge of the"
"divan, beside her, and put a gentle hand on her shoulder. ""Take it"
"easy, m'lady. They're really scouring space for us. We'll be all right."
"You'll see."""
*       *       *       *       *
Unexpectedly he bent and kissed her chastely on the forehead. Alice
"tensed at first, but relaxed almost immediately because the warmth of"
"that honest affection made her feel less alone and cold, in the depths"
"of uncharted space. Some of the worry and concern was erased, at least."
She stretched warmly as he rubbed her forehead with his cheek.
Then he sat up and looked down at her. He put his hand on her cheek
"gently and said, ""We'll be all right, kid."""
"""Eight days,"" she said in a hoarse whisper."
"He nodded solemnly. ""Every hour means they must be coming closer and"
"closer. Every lonely hour means that it can't be many more, because"
"they've covered all the places where we weren't. Follow me, Alice?"""
She shook her head unhappily.
“Then we both saw the light creeping over the sea like a monstrous
"ghost. And it all lay so pallid and still,--did n't it?--as if it were"
a sea in a land of death. And then a cheeky little thrush began to
twitter.”
"“I heard the thrush,” replied John. “He said, 'Any old thing! Any old"
thing!' ”
He mimicked the bird's note. Stella laughed. “That's just what he
said--as though a sea in a land of death or the English Channel was all
the same to him. I suppose it was.”
"“It must be good to be a thrush,” said Risca. “There 's a _je m'en"
fich'isme_ about his philosophy which must be very consoling.”
"“I know what that is in English,” cried Stellamaris. “It is"
'don't-care-a-damativeness.' “ Her lips rounded roguishly over the
naughty syllable.
“Where did you learn that?”
“Walter told me.”
"“Walter must be clapped into irons, and fed on bread and water, and"
seriously spoken to.”
Unconsciously he had drifted into his usual manner of speech with her.
She laughed with a child's easy gaiety.
"“It's delightful to be wicked, is n't it?”"
“Why?” he asked.
CLARE.  I'd been walking up and down the Embankment for about three
hours.  One does get desperate sometimes.
MALISE.  Thank God for that!
CLARE.  Only makes it worse afterwards.  It seems so frightful to
"them, too."
"MALISE.  [Softly and suddenly, but with a difficulty in finding the"
right words]  Blessed be the respectable!  May they dream of--me!
And blessed be all men of the world!  May they perish of a surfeit
of--good form!
"CLARE.  I like that.  Oh, won't there be a row!  [With a faint"
movement of her shoulders]  And the usual reconciliation.
"MALISE.  Mrs. Dedmond, there's a whole world outside yours.  Why"
don't you spread your wings?
"CLARE.  My dear father's a saint, and he's getting old and frail; and"
I've got a sister engaged; and three little sisters to whom I'm
"supposed to set a good example.  Then, I've no money, and I can't do"
"anything for a living, except serve in a shop.  I shouldn't be free,"
"either; so what's the good?  Besides, I oughtn't to have married if I"
"wasn't going to be happy.  You see, I'm not a bit misunderstood or"
ill-treated.  It's only----
MALISE.  Prison.  Break out!
CLARE.  [Turning to the window]  Did you see the sunset?  That white
cloud trying to fly up?
_Far_ from the world.
_Far_ ...
_Far_ ***
"_Far_, *** B. F."
"_Far_ ..., J. B."
"_Farr_, John."
The arrangement of title-entries is first by the heading words; if
"they are the same, then by the next word; if that is the same,"
"by the next; and so on. Every word, articles and prepositions"
"included, is to be regarded, but not a transposed article: e.g.,"
_Uncovenanted_ Mercies.
_Under_ a Cloud.
_Under_ the Ban.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a novel.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a poem.
_Under_ Which King.
"_Undone_ Task, The."
_Undone_ Task Done.[53]
It makes no difference whether the words are connected with one another
in sense or not; the searcher should not be compelled to think of that.
Let the arrangement be by words as ordinarily printed. Thus _Home Rule_
"is one idea but it is two words, and its place must be determined"
"primarily by its first word _Home_, which brings it before _Homeless_."
If it were printed _Homerule_ it would come after _Homeless_. Similarly
"_Art Amateur_ is one phrase, but as the first word _Art_ is followed by"
"a word beginning with _am_, it must come before _Art_ and _Artists_,"
although its parts are more closely connected than the parts of the
latter phrase.
"""Come along, Flemyng,"" he said. ""The show's over for to-night."""
"He seemed to express the general feeling, but men were reluctant to"
"acknowledge so disappointing a conclusion, and the preparations for"
departure were slow and lingering. They had not fairly begun before Mr.
Kilshaw's entrance abruptly checked them. Instantly he became the centre
of a crowd.
"""Now, Kilshaw,"" they cried, ""you know all about it. Oh, come now! Of"
"course you do! Secret? Nonsense! Out with it!"" and one or two of his"
"intimates added imploringly, ""Don't be an ass, Kilshaw."""
Kilshaw flung himself into a chair.
"""They resign,"" he said."
"""At once?"""
"""Yes. Perry's to be sent for. Medland, I'm told, insists on going. For"
"my own part, I think he's right."""
"""Of course,"" said somebody sapiently, ""he doesn't want to dissolve with"
"this affair hanging over him."""
"""It comes to the same thing,"" observed Kilshaw. ""Perry will dissolve;"
"the Governor has promised to do it, if he likes."""
"""Perry dissolve!"""
"""Yes,"" nodded Kilshaw. ""You see--"" He paused and added, ""Our present"
"position isn't very independent."""
"entirely here. This place belongs to her."""
"""And you?"""
"""I? I have just been released from prison in London, Holloway"
"Prison..."""
"""My dear young lady! You are surely joking--what do you say? You"
pull my leg? But no; I see! You have been Suffragette. Aha! _I_
"understand you are _the_ Miss Warren, the Miss Warren who make the"
"English Government afraid, nicht wahr? You set fire to Houses of"
"Parliament..."""
"_Vivie_ (interrupting): ""No, no! Only to some racing stables..."""
"_Oberst_: ""I understand. But you are rebel?"""
"_Vivie_: ""I hate the present British Government--the most"
"hypocritical, the most..."""
"_Oberst_: ""But we are in agreement, you and I! This is splendid. But"
"now we must be praktisch. We are at war, though we hope here for a"
"peaceful occupation of Belgium. You will see how the Flämisch--Ah,"
you say the Fleming?--the Flemish part of Belgium will receive us
"with such pleasure. It is only with the Wälsch, the Wallon part we"
disagree.... But there is so much for me to do--we must talk of all
these things some other time. Let us begin our business. I must
first introduce myself. I am Oberst Gottlieb von Giesselin of the
"Saxon Army. (He rose, clicked heels, bowed, and sat down.) I see you"
"have three heavy bags you look at often. What is it?"""
"_Vivie_ (taking courage): ""It is my mother's jewellery and some"
Butt sitting with folded arms in a corner of the brig. He grinned at
"me. ""Hi, tadpole. Like the splash?"""
"I shook my head unhappily. ""Butt, why did you do it? I'd sure love to"
"be your brother-in-law, but, gosh, you didn't have to marry Sis."" I"
pointed at some of the bustling females. Sis was going to have three
"hundred bridesmaids. ""Any one of them would have jumped at the chance"
"to be your wife. And once on any woman's passport, you'd be free. Why"
"Sis?"""
"""That's what the Captain said in the lifeboat. Told him same thing I'm"
"telling you. I'm stubborn. What I like at first, I keep on liking. What"
"I want at first, I keep on wanting until I get."""
"""Yes, but making Sis sheriff! And you'll have to back her up with your"
"blaster. What'll happen to that man's world?"""
"""Wait'll after we nest and go out to my islands."" He produced a"
"hard-lipped, smug grin, sighting it at Sis's slender back. ""She'll"
find herself sheriff over a bunch of natives and exactly two Earth
"males--you and me. I got a hunch that'll keep her pretty busy, though."""
"He tried to stand, and realized his knees were numb. He staggered"
"backward, grabbing for something to steady himself . . . and the light"
came on.
"""Yuri Andreevich, so this is where you are. What are you doing here?"""
"It was the gravel voice of his father. He felt like a child again,"
caught with his hand in his pants. What should he do? tell the truth?
"""I'm--I'm checking over the consoles, passing the time. I couldn't"
"sleep."""
"""Don't lie to me."" Andrei Androv's ancient eyebrows gathered into the"
"skeptical furrow Yuri knew so well. ""You're up to something, another of"
"your tricks."""
Yuri stared at him a moment. How had he known? A sixth sense?
"""_Moi otyets_, why are you here? You should be getting your sleep."""
"""I'm an old man. An old man worries. I had a feeling you might be in"
"here tonight, tinkering with the vehicle. You told me you were planning"
"something. I think the time has come to tell me what it is."""
Yuri took a deep breath and looked him over.
"No, it was too risky. For them both. His secret had to be ironclad."
"""It's better if you don't know."""
"""As you wish,"" the old man sighed. ""But if you do something foolish . ."

"patriotism; as I say, it is an experimental form.”"
Kennedy looked at Cæsar with curiosity.
“And how can it help you with your plans to stay here in Rome?” he
asked.
“It can help me. In Spain nobody knows me. This is the only place where
"I have a certain position, through being the nephew of a Cardinal. I am"
trying to build on that. How am I going to arrange it? I don’t know. I
"am feeling out my future course, taking soundings.”"
"“But the support you could find here would be all of a clerical nature,”"
said Kennedy.
“Of course.”
“But you are not Clerical!”
“No; but it is necessary for me to climb. Afterwards there will be time
to change.”
"“You are not taking it into account, my dear Cæsar, that the Church is"
still powerful and that it doesn’t pardon people who impose upon it.”
“Bah! I am not afraid of it.”
"“And you were just saying you are not courageous! You are courageous, my"
"dear man.... After this, I don’t doubt of your success.”"
“I need data.”
"would be useful for us both."" He paused again, speaking to someone"
"else, then his voice came back. ""Shall we say four o'clock."""
"""What time is it now?"""
"""Please forgive me. I forgot. Your world is not regimented by time,"
whereas mine regrettably is measured down to seconds. It is now almost
three in the afternoon. I shall expect you in one hour. Your clothes
"are in the closet in your room. Now, if you will allow me. Affairs . ."

And the voice was gone.
"""Michael, are you really going to talk with that criminal?"""
"""Wouldn't miss it for the world. There's a game going on here, and we"
have to stay in. Everybody's got a score to settle. We're about to see
"who settles up first."""
Thursday 3:29 P.M.
"""Zero minus eighteen hours."" Yuri Andreevich Androv stared at the green"
"screen, its numbers scrolling the computerized countdown. ""Eighteen"
"fucking hours."""
"As he wheeled around, gazing over the beehive of activity in Flight"
"Control, he could already feel the adrenaline beginning to build."
Everything depended on him now. The vehicle was as ready as it was
her lap. She slipped the sapphire on her finger and hid the others under
"a cushion. Trent, who had been detained a moment by Miss Decker,"
advanced to her.
"“It is very soon to come again,” he said, “but I simply had to call and"
inquire if you felt better. I am delighted to see that you apparently
do.”
"“I am better, thank you.” Her voice was weak. “It was good of you to"
come again.”
“Whose ring is that?”
“Why—a—to—sure—”
"“Jessica!” cried Miss Decker, “have you gone off with my ring again? You"
are so absent-minded! I hunted for that ring high and low!”
"“You should not be so good-natured, and my memory would turn over a new"
"leaf. Here, take it.” She tossed the ring to Miss Decker and raised her"
eyes guiltily to Trent’s. “Shall I go up and get the other?”
“No. But I thought you promised never to take it off.”
“I forgot that water ruins stones.”
"“Well, it is a consolation to know that water does not ruin a certain"
plain gold circlet.”
“Mr. Boswell!”
Jessica gasped and looked at the flames. A crisis had come. Would she be
"""Gee, how'd you ever get away?"" asked Lav, admiringly, but Sidney had"
"no opportunity to explain for at that moment Mart joined them, eager"
and excited.
"""I put some cookies in my pocket,"" she exclaimed. ""You can't tell"
"what'll happen."""
"""Good. And I've got matches."""
Sidney wished she had thought of something to bring. Lav went on:
"""It isn't dark enough to go out yet. We got to be awful careful. You"
"girls sort o' walk up the beach as though we weren't all together."""
Lavender was actually pale and his eyes burned fiercely. Sidney looked
at him admiringly. She knew he was not thinking of the reward but of
the fair name of the Cape.
"Obediently the girls strolled up the beach. And, as they turned, a"
voice hailed them. To their consternation Pola came flying toward them.
At sight of her Sidney bit her lips with vexation. She gave a sidewise
glance at Mart and saw Mart's chin set stubbornly.
"""Sidney--wait a minute!"" Pola called and Sidney could do nothing but"
wait until Pola came up to them.
"""I thought you were going to stay in Chatham tonight."""
"""I should say _not_!"" Pola had enough breath to make her answer"
"expressive. ""I was never so bored in my life. Those Truxton girls are"
"""For me?"""
"""For you and every one. I have hurt so many. It has all been my fault."
I would give ten lives if I had them to see the harm undone. But that
"isn't possible. Oh, Lois, there is surely nothing worse than helpless"
"remorse!"""
The hand within her own tightened in its clasp.
"""Is it ever helpless, though?"""
"""I can't give the dead life--I can't give back a man's faith, can I?"""
The light of understanding deepened in Lois' eyes.
"""Beatrice--I believe I know!"""
"""Yes, I see you do. Do you despise me? What does it matter if you do?"
It has been my fear of the world and its opinion that helped to lead
me wrong. Isn't it a just punishment? I have ruined both our lives.
"Lois, I couldn't help hearing what Captain Nicholson said to you. It"
explained what you said to me about building on the ruins of the past.
That was what he did--he built a beautiful palace on me--and I wrecked
"it. I failed him."""
"""Have you really failed him?"""
"""Lois, I don't know--I am beginning to believe not. But it is too"
late. I meant to clear away the rubbish--and build. But there is no
"time."""
"""You have done your best."""
"""How about covering the door? I think it's time we got down to business"
"and traded some bonds."""
"""With pleasure."" She stepped over and glanced out. It was clear."
"""What do you think, Alex?"" Vance turned back. ""Word's going around"
there's a hot new issue of Mino Industries zero-coupons coming out
today. What do you say we go long? In for a hundred. Just take the
"lot."""
"""I heard the same rumor, this very morning,"" he smiled. ""You're right."
"My instincts say it's a definite buy."""
"""Fine."" Vance turned to MNB's jowled branch chief. ""We'd like to do a"
little trading here this morning. Mind getting the bond desk at
Westminster Union on the line? Tell Nogami we're good for a hundred in

"""Michael."" It was Eva's voice, suddenly alarmed."
"""What?"""
"""We've got company. They look like field reps."""
"""Good God."" Novosty strode to the door and looked out. A group of four"
"leather-jacketed Japanese were headed down the hallway, two disarmed"
MNB guards in front. Also with them was Kenji Nogami.

"""Figure they came prepared."" He waved toward Eva. ""Better lose that"

"considers me his friend."""
"""Sibyl was at your reception the other evening,"" I remarked suddenly."
"""She told me she met a man who was a stranger in Paris.  His name, I"
"think she said, was Wolf--Rodolphe Wolf.  Who is he?"""
"""He was introduced by de Wolkenstein, the Austrian Ambassador,"" she"
"replied quickly.  ""I did not know him."""
"""Have you never met him before?""  I asked, looking sharply into her"
eyes.
"""Once, I think, but I am not certain,"" she said, with a palpable effort"
to evade my question.
I smiled.
"""Come, madame,"" I said good-humouredly, ""you know Rodolphe Wolf quite as"
"well as I do.  When you last met, his name was not Wolf.  Is not that"
"so?"""
"""Well,"" she answered, ""now that you put it in that manner I may as well"
"admit that your suggestion is correct."""
"""And what is the object of his sudden visit to Paris?"""
"""I cannot make out,"" she replied in a more confidential tone.  ""As I"
"tell you, de Wolkenstein introduced him, but, as m'sieur knows, I am"

"""If we don't take it off tonight Lav Green may find it--or that girl--"""
"At that someone laughed, horribly. ""Huh--_him_! Why we could twist"
"every crooked bone in his body until he wouldn't know 'em. Him--ha,"
"that's a joke! Why, a look 'ud scare him to a pulp. The girl, too."""
"Sidney, reaching her hand out instinctively, caught Lavender's and held"
it tight. She felt the writhing of his body.
"A new voice broke in above them. ""I got a better scheme. Listen."
"We'll--"" But the voices suddenly died to silence; the footsteps moved"
away.
"The four, huddled in the darkness of the cabin, drew long trembling"
breaths.
"""Lav, those diamonds are on this boat!"""
"""Sh--h. I know it. But we got to be careful. They haven't gone yet. We"
got to wait. And we'll wait until we find 'em. Damn them _I'll_ show

He climbed the steps of the brownstone and tried the knob. The door
"opened. He went inside and found himself in a drab, dark hall furnished"
"with an umbrella stand, a worn carpet, and a table spread with mail."
"There was a bell on the table. He tapped it and, after a lazy length of"
"time, a shapeless woman came through a door on the right and regarded"
him with no great show of cordiality.
"""Nothing vacant, mister. Everything I've got is rented."""
"""I wasn't looking for a room. I'm just doing a little checking."""
"""My license is okay,"" the woman said belligerently. ""The place is clean"
"and orderly."""
"""That's not what I'm checking about. There's been some counterfeit money"
"passed in this neighborhood and we're trying to trace it down."""
The woman had a pronounced mustache that quivered at this news.
"""Counterfeit! My roomers are honest."""
"""I'm sure they are. But some people carry counterfeit money without"
"knowing it. Do they all pay in cash?"""
"""Only two of them."""
"""Men or women?"""
"""One girl--Katy Wynn."""
"""It was not more than fifteen minutes after I had left, you say?""  I"
inquired.
"""No, m'sieur, not more."""
"""Mademoiselle had no other visitor?"""
"""No, m'sieur.  Of that we are all certain."""
"""And the Countess, where was she during the time I was here?"""
"""She was out driving.  She did not return till about five minutes after"
"we had made the terrible discovery."""
"""And how did madame act?"""
"""She ordered us to carry poor mademoiselle to her room.  Poor madame!"
"She bore the blow with wonderful fortitude."""
That remark caused me to prick up my ears.
"""I don't quite understand,"" I said.  ""Did she not give way to tears?"""
"""No, m'sieur; she shed no tears, but sat erect, motionless as a statue."
She appeared unable to realise that poor mademoiselle was actually dead.
"At last she rang, and sent Jean to you."""
"""You are absolutely certain that mademoiselle had no visit or after I"
"left?"""
"I began speaking French, but when I paused for his verdict, he shrugged"
"his shoulders, saying:--"
"""Ah, _oui, oui!_ It may be better than my English."" But notwithstanding"
"his scant praise, we spoke the French language thereafter."
"The count bowed himself out and left me to decipher, if I could, the"
problem of M. l'Abbé du Boise. Presently I discovered the cue. The
"Abbé was George Hamilton, and for the moment my heart almost stopped"
"beating. If he should come to England on the French king's business,"
"which could be nothing more nor less than the Dunkirk affair, and"
"should be discovered, there would be a public entertainment on Tyburn"
"Hill, with George as the central figure."
"When I found a spare hour, I hastened to see Lilly and came upon the"
"good Doctor among the stars, as usual. There was a letter for me from"
Hamilton. It was short and in cipher:--
"""DEAR FRIEND:"
"""This is to tell you that M. l'Abbé du Boise will soon be in London. He"
will be the guest of M. Comte de Grammont.
"""You do not know him. Please call on him when he arrives. Tell the"
Duchess of Hearts that he will want to see her. Ask her to be ready to
"help him. He goes to buy Dunkirk for the French king, and his success"
will mean good fortune for me.
"""Your friend,"
"""LE BLANC."""
more.
"""You know,"" she began, ""there's more to marriage than just--"""
"""So there is,"" he cut in. ""Well, we can try each other for taste."" And"
"he pulled her in, both of his great hands practically covering her"
"slim, straight back."
Neither of them said anything for a bit after he let go. Butt spoke up
first.
"""Now, me,"" he said, ""I'd vote yes."""
Sis ran the tip of her tongue kind of delicately from side to side
of her mouth. Then she stepped back slowly and looked at him as if
she were figuring out how many feet high he was. She kept on moving
"backward, tapping her chin, while Butt and I got more and more"
"impatient. When she touched the lifeboat door, she pushed it open and"
jumped out.
*       *       *       *       *
"Butt ran over and looked down the crossway. After a while, he shut the"
"door and came back beside me. ""Well,"" he said, swinging to a bunk,"
"""that's sort of it."""
"""You're better off, Butt,"" I burst out. ""You shouldn't have a woman"
"like Sis for a wife. She looks small and helpless, but don't forget"
"she was trained to run an underwater city!"""
"""Wasn't worrying about that,"" he grinned. ""_I_ grew up in the fifteen"
"long years of the Blue Chicago Rising. Nope."" He turned over on his"
"her waist: ""Ah, my Gyp!  I shall be a different being, now."""
"And Gyp went on smiling.  Between that, and stabbing these false raptures"
"to the heart, there seemed to be nothing she could do. The moment his"
"hands relaxed, she got up and said:"
"""You know there's a baby in the house?"""
He laughed.
"""Ah, the baby!  I'd forgotten.  Let's go up and see it."""
Gyp answered:
"""You go."""
She could feel him thinking: 'Perhaps it will make her nice to me!' He
turned suddenly and went.
"She stood with her eyes shut, seeing the divan in the music-room and the"
"girl's arm shivering.  Then, going to the piano, she began with all her"
might to play a Chopin polonaise.
"That evening they dined out, and went to ""The Tales of Hoffmann."" By such"
devices it was possible to put off a little longer what she was going to
"do.  During the drive home in the dark cab, she shrank away into her"
"corner, pretending that his arm would hurt her dress; her exasperated"
nerves were already overstrung.  Twice she was on the very point of
"crying out: ""I am not Daphne Wing!""  But each time pride strangled the"
words in her throat.  And yet they would have to come.  What other reason
could she find to keep him from her room?
"like another one behind it, with a raft of piles."""
"""I thought all the Company traps were up-stream."""
"""So they are. I can't tell what they're up to."""
"A half-hour later, when the new flotilla had come to anchor a short"
"distance below, Emerson's companion began to swear."
"""I might have known it."""
"""What?"""
"""Marsh aims to 'cork' us."""
"""What is that?"""
"""He's going to build a trap on each side of this one and cut off our"
"fish."""
"""Good Lord! Can he do that?"""
"""Sure. Why not? The law gives us six hundred yards both ways. As long"
"as he stays outside of that limit he can do anything he wants to."""
"""Then of what use is our trap? The salmon follow definite courses close"
"to the shore, and if he intercepts them before they reach us--why, then"
"we'll get only what he lets through."""
"""That's his plan,"" said Big George, sourly, ""It's an old game, but it"
don't always work. You can't tell what salmon will do till they do it.
"I've studied this point of land for five years, and I know more about"
"""No. In his way, I suppose he was fond of her. But--she didn't like his"
"way. She was very beautiful, and I fell in love with her, and she with"
"me. And we ran away."""
"""Is--is that all? Is there no----?"""
"""No excuse? No, I suppose, none. And I lived with her till she died four"
"years ago. And--Daisy is our daughter."""
"""And he--the husband?"""
"""He did not divorce her. I don't know why not, perhaps because she asked"
him to--anyhow he didn't. And he outlived her: so she died--as she had
"lived."""
"""And is he still alive?"""
"""No; he is dead now."" He was about to go on, but checked himself. Why"
add that horror? How the man died was nothing between her and him.
"""Have you no--nothing to say?"" she burst out, almost angrily. ""You just"
"tell me that and stop!"""
"""What is there to say? I have told you all there is to tell. I loved her"
"very much. I did what I could to make her happy, and I try to make up"
"for it to Daisy. But there is nothing more to say."""
"She was angry that he would not defend himself. She was ready--ah, so"
ready!--to listen to his pleading. But he would not say a word for
"himself. Instead, he went on,"
"""She didn't want to come, but I made her. She repented, poor girl, all"
"""What?"" She was shakily rising, pulling her yukata around her."
"""All the comforts of home. Too bad they forgot the geisha."""
"She came over and stood beside him. ""I don't believe this."""
"""Want to see if it's real, or just a mirage?"""
"She hesitantly stepped onto the decking, then walked out and bent down"
"to test the water. ""Feels wet."" She glanced back. ""So what the heck. I"
"could use it."""
"""I'm ready."" He kicked off his tabi and walked on out."
"She pulled off his _yukata_, then picked up one of the pails and began"
"filling it from a spigot on the wall. ""Okay, exalted male,"" she"
"laughed, ""I'm going to scrub you. That's how they do it, right?"" She"
stood up and reached for a sponge and soap.
"""They know how to live. Here, let me."" He picked up a second sponge and"
"began scrubbing her back in turn. ""How does it feel?"""
"""Maybe this is heaven."""
"""Hope we didn't have to die to get here. But hang on. I've got a"
"feeling the fun is just beginning."""
"He splashed her off with one of the pails, then watched as she gingerly"
climbed down into the wooden tub.

"her. ""This has got to be Japan, but where?"""

"""So that's where he's gone?"" he said. ""Well, let him stay there, for all I"
"care!"""
The manufacturer cracked jokes to the very end. Of course he was a little
"depressed by the farewells, too, but he had to keep his family's courage"
"up. His wife stood holding one of his arms with both hands, and the"
children clung to his other arm.
"""I can't salute you,"" the manufacturer said to us, smiling. ""I'm not"
"allowed to say good-bye."""
"The children rejoiced at this and cried, ""No, he can't have his arm back;"
"Mummy, you hold him tight, too!"""
"""Come, come!"" the father said. ""I've got to go to Scotland, just a short"
"trip. And when you come home from the mountains, I'll be there, too."""
"""Scotland? What are you going to Scotland for?"" the children asked."
He twisted round and nodded to us.
"""These women! All curiosity!"" he said."
But none of his family laughed.
He continued to us:
"""I was telling my wife a story about a rich man who was curious, too. He"
"shot himself just to find out what comes after death. Ha, ha, ha! That's"
"the height of curiosity, isn't it? Shooting yourself to find out what"
“Why?”
"“Because I remember that I must die, and then I shall not come back"
"to see Rome. She will be here still, century after century, full of"
"sunlight, and I shall be dead.... It is horrible, horrible!”"
“And your religion?”
"“Yes, I know. I believe I shall see other things; but not these things"
that are so beautiful.”
“You are an Epicurean.”
“It is so beautiful to be alive!”
"They stayed there looking at the panorama. Below, in the Piazza del"
"Popólo, they saw a red tram slipping along, which looked, at that"
"distance, like a toy."
"A tilbury, driven by a woman, stopped near their carriage. The woman was"
"blond with green eyes, prominent cheek-bones, and a little fur cap. At"
her feet lay an enormous dog with long flame-coloured hair.
"“She must be a Russian,” said Cæsar."
“Yes. Do you like that type?”
“She has a lot of character. She looks like one of the women that would
order servants to be whipped.”
The Russian was smiling vaguely. Laura told the coachman to drive on.
They made a few rounds in the avenues of the Pincio. The music was
"overlooking any bets, but I do admit that Miss Hemingway is a bit more"
"important to me than any of the rest."""
"""No, I suppose no one could blame you for that. Just keep it up,"
"Wilson."""
"""Sure,"" Ted said wearily. ""After all, this is a black and white job I'm"
"on. Either we'll be successful--or we won't."""
"""Luck."""
"""Spaceman's luck, Admiral."""
Wilson went back to his brooding....
Charles Andrews came back into the salon with a brisk air. He
"flexed his arms, took a deep breath, and mopped his forehead with a"
handkerchief. He sat down beside Alice and smiled at her warmly.
"""That thing is a wonder worker,"" he said, breathing deeply. ""Nothing"
"like exercise to make a man feel fine and fit."""
"Alice looked up at him with some amusement. ""Mr. Andrews, tell me. Are"
you the kind of man who opens the window on a winter morning about six
"o'clock, and takes deep lungsful of icy air?"""
"""Not quite that bad, my dear. Not quite. But brisk living does keep a"
man sharp and hard. I daresay I acquitted myself well on that pedal
"generator despite my fifty years."""
"""No doubt."""
"""I don't borrow."""
"""Ingeborg!"" said he, pretending playfully to whimper."
"""What is it?"""
"""Nothing. Can't I say 'Ingeborg' to my own wife?"""
"""I'm not your own wife,"" she said, getting up."
"""Pish! We were man and wife last night. It says so in the visitors' book."""
"She was silent at this. Yes, last night they had been man and wife; that"
"was to save getting two rooms, and travel economically. But she had been"
very foolish to agree to it.
"""'Miss Torsen,' then?"" he whimpered."
"And to put an end to the game, she paid for both of them and took her"
knapsack on her back.
They walked again. At the next stop she paid for them both without
"discussion--for the evening meal, for bed and breakfast. It grew to be a"
habit. They walked on once more. They reached the end of the valley by the
"sea, and here she revolted again."
"""Go away--go on by yourself; I don't want you in my room any more!"""
The old argument no longer held good. When he repeated that they saved
"money by it, she replied that she for her part required no more than one"
"room, and was quite able to pay for it. He joked again, whimpered,"
"""Ingeborg!"" and left her. He was beaten, and his back was bent."
"Suddenly he flung in upon us with a great noise, his colour high, his"
eyes glittering. His first action was to throw his feathered hat on
"one chair, and himself into another."
'I've seen him!' he said. 'Himmel! he is a clever fellow. He will
"worst you, cousin, yet--see if he does not. Oh, he is a clever one!'"
"'Who?' my lady said, looking at him in some displeasure."
"'Who? Tzerclas, to be sure!' he answered, chuckling."
"'You have seen him!' she exclaimed, rising."
"'Of course I have!' he answered. 'And you will see him too, one of"
these days.'
"My lady looked at me, frowning. But I shook my head. He was not drunk."
"'Where?' she asked, after a pause. 'Where did you see him, Rupert?'"
"'In the street--where you see other men,' he answered, chuckling"
"again. 'He should not be there, but who is to keep him out? He is too"
"clever. He will get his way in the end, see if he does not!'"
"'Rupert!' my lady cried in wrathful amazement, 'to hear you, one would"
suppose you admired him.'
"'So I do,' he replied coolly. 'Why not? He has all the wits of the"
"family. He is as cunning as the devil. Take a hint, cousin; put"
yourself on the right side. He will win in the end!' And the Waldgrave
"rose restlessly from his chair, and, going to the window, began to"
whistle.
a sheaf of notes from his jacket pocket.
"""I've known Mr. Dennis for quite some time,"" Frank commented wryly."
"""Be quiet."""
John Dennis' tone was neither hostile nor friendly. They were the words
of a person whose mind was on other things. They watched him as his eyes
scanned the notes.
He appeared to be memorizing them.
"The air became somewhat electric, the silence so deep it seemed to"
scream. Rhoda looked across at Frank Corson. Frank's expression was
"empty, as though he'd suffered some traumatic emotional blow and was"
struggling to recover.
John Dennis stirred. He also appeared to be struggling. He turned his
eyes on the drink Rhoda was holding. He took it out of her hand and
downed it in a single gulp.
"They watched as he went back to work, leafing through the notes, one at"
"a time. As he came close to the end, he lifted his head and shook it"
"violently, as though from sudden pain. He scowled at the empty glass"
he'd handed back to Rhoda.
"""Do you want another?"" she inquired."
"""Give me another."""
She poured a second Scotch and handed it to him. He drank it like so
much water.
"over it, and charging on and on and on through the darkness."
"To the foot of the hill and across the bottom, and up the opposite"
"slope. I do not know how far we had sped, when Steve's voice was"
"heard, calling on us to halt."
"'Pull up! pull up!' he cried, with an angry oath. 'It is a false"
alarm! What fool set it going? There is no one behind us. Donner und
Blitzen! where is Martin?'
"The horses were beginning to flag, and gladly came to a trot, and then"
to a walk.
'Here! I panted.
"'Himmel! I thought we had ridden you down!' he said, leaving my lady's"
side. His voice shook with passion and loss of breath. 'Who was it? We
"might all have broken our necks, and for nothing!'"
The Waldgrave--it was his stirrup I had caught--turned his horse
round. 'I heard them--close behind us!' he panted. There was a note of
"wildness in his voice. My elbow was against his knee, and I felt him"
tremble.
"'A bird in the hedge,' Steve said rudely. 'It has cost some one dear."
Whose horse was it struck him?'
No one answered. I left the Waldgrave's side and went back a few
"paces. The women were sobbing. Ernst and Jacob stood by them,"
breathing hard after their run. I thought the men's silence strange. I
looked again. There was a figure missing; a horse missing.
"""Never!"""
Monsieur Harmost's eyebrows rose.
"""Ah,"" he said, ""you think!  No, that is impossible!""  He walked twice"
"very quickly up and down the room; then spinning round on his heel, said"
"sharply: ""Well, we must not waste your father's time. To work."""
Winton's simple comment in the cab on the way home was:
"""Nice old chap!"""
"At Bury Street, they found Gyp's agitated parlour-maid.  Going to do the"
"music-room that morning, she had ""found the master sitting on the sofa,"
"holding his head, and groaning awful.  He's not been at home, ma'am,"
"since you--you went on your visit, so I didn't know what to do.  I ran"
"for cook and we got him up to bed, and not knowing where you'd be, ma'am,"
"I telephoned to Count Rosek, and he came--I hope I didn't do wrong--and"
he sent me down to see you. The doctor says his brain's on the touch and
"go, and he keeps askin' for you, ma'am.  So I didn't know what to do."""
"Gyp, pale to the lips, said:"
"""Wait here a minute, Ellen,"" and went into the dining-room.  Winton"
"followed.  She turned to him at once, and said:"
"""Oh, Dad, what am I to do?  His brain!  It would be too awful to feel I'd"
"brought that about."""
Winton grunted.  Gyp went on:
"""I must go and see.  If it's really that, I couldn't bear it.  I'm afraid"
_stupid_. And I kept wondering what you were doing. I coaxed mother to
let Shields bring me back and she said she would provided I came and
stayed with you tonight. Can you squeeze me in? Dug will give me his
"room, I know."""
"Sidney cast a wild glance toward Mart. She started to answer, then"
stopped. Pola looked from her to Mart and back again to Sidney.
"""What's the mystery? If you don't want me I'll go to the hotel."""
"""Oh, Pola, it isn't that. It's--it's--"""
"""Sidney Romley I'll bet you're up to something! And if you are, you"
simply have got to let me in on it! I'm just pepped up to some
"excitement. Tell me what's up."""
"The girls turned slowly and walked toward Lav and the dory, Pola"
between them.
"""It isn't any fun,"" Sidney explained slowly. ""It's something"
serious--and--and dangerous. And you'll have to ask Mart and Lav if you
"can come with us."""
"""You'll let me go, won't you, Mart?"" Pola begged with friendly"
"entreaty, forgetting she had ever thought Mart a riot."
Sidney introduced Pola to Lavender and turned away that she might not
see the pain that flashed across Lavender's face.
"""Pola came back to stay all night with me. She wants to go with us and"
"if she doesn't I guess I'll have to go back home."""
Something of the light of triumph came stealing back to the old
tear-stained face.
“And Julia?” he asked.
"“I’ve sent her out to get tickets for the theatre,” she said drily."
“They will want amusing badly to-night--and the tuning of the fiddles
"would always rouse my Netherby.... But you’d better go up and see him,"
Noll--you used to know the way.”
Noll made a pause to take breath at the top of the stairs (how he and
Betty had raced up those steps!). He pushed open the attic door.
"In the midst of the smudgy dusk that filled the room, his head in his"
"hands, elbows on knees, sat the dim figure of Netherby Gomme, sobbing"
pitifully.
"Noll shut the door softly, and went up to the bowed man:"
"“Good God, Netherby!” said he--“what’s this?”"
"He gripped his hand upon the other’s shoulder, affectionately."
Gomme signed him to a seat:
"“Sit down, Noll--I’ll be all right in a minute.” He blew his nose."
"“No--better still, light the gas. I must stop. Tears will not bring"
"back one’s dead, nor grief annul the things that are done. Light up! A"
man can only cry comfortably in the dark.”
"Noll struck a light, turned on the tap of the wrought-iron gas-jet; and"
The last sheet of notations was covered. Then John Dennis sat motionless
"for a minute, his frown and uncertainty returning. ""It's hard to project"
"the details,"" he said. ""All this detail. Difficult."""
He dropped the last sheet and got up and poured himself another Scotch.
"""They will make an army now,"" he said. The Scotch went down smoothly. He"
"went to the window and looked out. ""This planet is different. The sun"
"there is blue and the air is very thin. Their bodies are nothing, but"
their heads are very big. Now they will create an army and take this
"planet."""
Frank Corson was shaking his head slowly like a groggy fighter. Rhoda
"sat huddled on the sofa, her mind such a mixture of tumbling emotions"
that it seemed to be trying to tear itself out of her head. John Dennis
"came back and stood in the middle of the room. He swayed drunkenly. ""So"
many things I don't understand. I see people I know--or I should know.
"I--"" He turned his eyes--eyes no longer empty--on Rhoda."
"""I want to make love!"""
Frank Corson got up from his chair and hurled himself on Dennis.
Rhoda screamed.

Senator Crane sat at his desk. There were a pile of newspapers in front
of him. The first one carried a front page story with the headline:
SENATOR CRANE WARNS OF SPACE INVASION
"""I damned sure intend to try."" He met his father's steely gaze."
"""So did you do it?"" Andrei Androv examined him, his ancient face ashen"
"beneath his mane of white hair. ""Did you manage to sabotage the AI"
"module?"""
"He caught himself laughing out loud. Whatever else, his father was no"
fool. He'd been a Russian too long to believe anything he heard or half
of what he saw. Intrigue was a way of life for him.
"""Let's go. They'll come looking for us soon. This is the wrong place to"
"be found."""
"""You're right."""
"""Go back to the West Quadrant. Listen to a string quartet."" He opened"
"the port and waited for his father to step out. Then he followed,"
"closing it behind them. ""There's no reason for you to be involved."
"Heads are going to roll, but why should yours be one of them?"""
"Andrei Petrovich Androv moved lightly up the metal stair, the spring in"
his step belying his age. At the top he paused and turned back.
"""You're acting out of principle, aren't you, Yuri? For once in your"
"life."""
"""I guess you could say that."" He smiled, then moved on up the steps."
"""Someday, the Russian people will thank you."""
"""Someday. Though I may not live to see it."""
"""Want to give you a little tip, too. They want you upstairs. A"
"commendation. Not generally known, though. And you deserve it. You'll be"
"called up tomorrow."""
"""You never know the day or the hour."""
"The laugh came again. ""You're humor is priceless, old man."""
"""Isn't it?"""
"""Another thing--I got pretty hot when I got wind of how the ground was"
being cut out from under you. I made it my business to do something
about it. I hate to see a good man pushed around. Of course I okayed the
orders cutting you down--a matter of routine--I had to follow through.
"But then I got busy. A thing like that won't happen again."""
"""Thanks, Porter. It warms a man to know he's got a friend--a friend like"
"you."""
"""Just between us, old man, I'm one of your admirers."" Porter laughed and"
"sprayed charm through the phone like perfume from an atomizer. ""But if"
"you quote me, I'll deny it."""
"""Oh, I wouldn't think of quoting you, old man,"" Taber replied in a"
kindly voice and put down the phone.
He sat back and closed his eyes. Three people dead. One person maimed.
Blood in the streets.
Good job well done.
“Poor great men!” exclaimed Cæsar. “Their statues serve only to
"decorate a public garden.” “They had their lives,” replied Laura, gaily;"
“now we have ours.”
Laura ordered the coachman to stop a moment. The air was still murmuring
"in the foliage, the birds singing, and the clouds flying slowly across"
the sky.
A man with a black box approached the carriage to offer them postcards.
"“Buy two or three,” said Laura."
Cæsar bought a few and put them into his pocket. The vendor withdrew
and Laura continued to look at Rome with enthusiasm.
"“Oh, how beautiful, how lovely it is! I never get tired of looking at"
"it. It is my favourite city. ‘_O fior d’ogni cittá, donna del mondo_.’”"
"“She is no longer mistress of the world, little sister.”"
“For me she is. Look at St. Peter’s. It looks like a shred of cloud.”
"“Yes, that’s so. It’s of a blue shade that seems transparent.”"
Bells were ringing and great majestic white clouds kept moving along the

“I don’t understand.” she murmured. “A pawnbroker’s?”
"“Come,” urged Kennedy, not harshly but firmly, then, as she held back,"

And jammed neatly down behind it was the body of Les King. His throat
had been cut.
Brent Taber stared down into the closet for what seemed like an
interminable time. His eyes were bleak and his mouth was grim and stiff
as he passed a slow hand along his jaw.
"He took a long, backward step and closed his eyes for a moment as though"
hoping the whole improbable mess would go away. But it was still there
when he opened them again.
"He turned, went downstairs, and took the receiver off the phone on the"
wall by the front door.
"The shapeless landlady came out again. She scowled at Taber. ""What are"
"you doing here?"""
"He regarded her with a kind of affectionate weariness. ""Have you got a"
"dime, lady?"""
"Gaping, she pawed into her apron pocket and handed him a coin."
"""Thanks much."" He dialed. ""Is Captain Abrams there?"""
"There was a wait, during which Brent Taber asked the oddly bemused"
"landlady: ""Are you afraid of the dead?"""
"But before she could decide whether she was or not, Taber turned to the"
"phone. ""Captain?.... That's right, Brent Taber ... No, right, here in"
Manhattan. There's been a little trouble. You'd better come over
"personally."""
"""No, it is not.  It has been destroyed."""
"""Why?""  I asked."
"""For some mysterious reason known to Yolande.""  Then, turning quickly"
"again to me, she placed her hand upon my arm in deep earnestness,"
"saying: ""Tell me, is your love for her absolutely and entirely dead--so"
"dead that you would not care to perform her a service?"""
Anderson's strange and startling story flashed through my mind.  I made
no reply.
"""Remember the affection you once bore her,"" she urged.  ""I am a woman,"
"m'sieur, and I presume to remind you of it."""
I needed no reminder.  The recollection of those sweet idyllic days was
still fresh as ever in my memory.  Ah! in those brief sunny hours I had
fondly believed that our love would last always.  It is ever the same.
Youth is ever foolish.

"There was a mystery which had ended our love, and I saw now an"
"opportunity of clearing it up.  ""To what fact do you refer?"""
"""To the reason of our parting."""
"""The reason!"" echoed the Countess.  ""I have no idea whatever of the"
"reason.  What was it?"""
I held my breath.  Would it be just to tell her the truth?  I wondered.
"""Where does she work?"""
"""Down in Wall Street."""

"""Six--on the second floor. But he isn't in now. He just went out."""
"""Okay. Maybe I'll be back. As I said, we don't suspect anybody. We're"
"just checking for sources."""
Taber turned toward the door. The woman vanished back into her own
quarters as Taber snapped the lock. He stood in the vestibule for a
"minute or two, studying some cards he took from his pocket, and when she"
"did not reappear, he opened the door, went back in, and climbed the"
stairs.
The door to number six was not locked. Taber went inside. The window was
small and gave on an areaway. He could see nothing until he turned on
"the light. Even then, he could see nothing of interest--the room was"
ordinary in every sense.
"But as Brent Taber checked it out, some unusual aspects became apparent."
"There were two pieces of luggage in the closet. One, an oversized"
"suitcase, stood on end."

"“Mrs. Moulton,” he said firmly, “listen to me. What was the first"
question you asked me? ‘Can I trust you?’ And I told you you could.
This is no time for—for suicide.” He shot the word out bluntly. “All
may not be lost. I have sent for your husband. Muller is outside.”
“Muller?” she cried. “He made the replica.”
“Very well. I am going to clear this thing up. Come. You _must_.”
"It was all confused to me, the dash in a car to the little pawnbroker’s"

Over the safe in back was a framework like that which had covered

'Countess!' she cried. 'Rotha! Surely you are mad! You cannot think
that I would----'
"My lady turned, and in a flash struck her fiercely on the cheek with"
"her open hand. 'Liar!' she cried; 'go to your master, you whipped"

"laughed her hard, bright laugh and patted her hair in a mirror."
"Strange! When she was a little girl she had such a soft, hesitating"
"voice; she had even stuttered, and now, whatever she said—even if it"

touches of silver. Don’t you agree?”
"“Give it to me, love,” said Charlotte. She fumbled for her"

"with her plump small fingers, and pursed up her lips. “Very sweet!” she"
crooned vaguely; she looked at Ethel over her spectacles. “But I
shouldn’t have the train.”
“Not the train!” wailed Ethel tragically. “But the train’s the whole
point.”

One of the _kobun  _withdrew the Zenith. He placed it on the mahogany

"""Do you want the dogs?"""
"""Yes--oh, yes!  He doesn't care for them."""

red had come into his brown cheeks; his eyes under their half-drawn lids
had a keener light; his lips were tightly closed; he looked as he did
"when a fox was breaking cover.  Gyp could do no wrong, or, if she could,"
he would stand by her in it as a matter of course.  But he was going to
"take no risks--make no frontal attack. Time for that later, if necessary."
"He had better nerves than most people, and that kind of steely"

Lavender's admission faded beside the fact that he knew something.
"""Oh, what?"" Sidney cried."
"""I wasn't going to tell you. I thought you didn't care anything about"
"the pirates any more. And the laugh's sort o' on me, anyway, because I"
"thought we were all crazy to suspect Jed Starrow."""
"""Tell me quick, Lav,"" commanded Sidney, quivering with excitement."
Lav leaned against the rail. To tell his story meant confessing his
state of mind.
"""I guess I've been sore because you and Mr. Dugald fooled 'round with"

"Yell! Wave something! _Anything!_"" She sprang to her feet, leaning her"
body against the rail for support as the boat rolled in the heavy sea.
"She cupped her hands to her lips and shouted lustily. ""Come on, girls!"""
she commanded.
"""Maybe it's the pirates,"" wailed Pola."
"""I don't care if it is! I don't care _what_ it is!"" And Mart and Sidney"
lifted their chorus.
"Out of the mist that lay over the surging water a small, gray object"
gradually shaped. The chug-chug of an engine now came distinctly to
their ears. After a little they could make out the forms of two men
standing. And then someone shouted faintly.
"Pola, a solemn happiness transfiguring her face, clung to Sidney."
"""Girls,"" she whispered, ""We're going to be saved! And I'll never forget"
this night--never. Or you two. Or what you've done! Or what you _are_.
"And I'm never going to get over being ashamed of myself!"""
Sidney had some solemn resolutions of her own shaping in her heart but

The horseman in the valley had swept at a gallop through a sea of
"sun-bronzed fern. His eyes were full of a restless glitter, as the"
"eyes of a man, whose heart is troubled. He sprang from the saddle,"
"and, leading his horse by the bridle, bent low before the twain."
"""Tidings, my lord!"""
"“_Allons d’ici_,” she whispered, turning a terrified glance around."
The man raised his hat to his companions and signed to her to come. He
"was a handsome, careless, dissipated-looking fellow, with curly hair and"
a twirled black moustache; short and slightly made. He wore a Tyrolese
hat and a very low turned-down collar and a great silk bow outside
his waistcoat. There was a devil-may-care charm in his swagger as
he walked--also an indefinable touch of vulgarity; the type of the
_cabotin_ in easy circumstances.
"Yvonne, more dead than alive, followed him through the deserted _salle"
"des jeux_ on to the quiet bit of verandah, and sank into a chair that he"
"offered. She looked at him, still white to the lips."
“You?”
"“Yes,” he said laughingly, “why not? It is not astonishing.”"
"“But I thought you dead!” gasped Yvonne, trembling."
"“_A la bonne heure!_ And I seem a ghost. Oh, I am solid. Pinch me. But"

"“Absinthe?” asked Yvonne, almost mechanically."
"He nodded, went through the motions of preparing the drink, and laughed."
"“I had a touch lately,” he went on. “That was the second. The third I"

"Andrews said scornfully, ""Without a doubt, a man of your age and build"

"Norton chuckled. ""Don't count on your age being good protection,"
Andrews. You may push me far enough to make me forget that you're a
"decrepit old man who has to buy what your physique can't get you."""
"""Now see here!"" roared Andrews."

He was stopped short by Norton who took one long step forward to grasp
"him by the coat lapels. Andrews' face went white, because he was"
looking into the face of dark anger. Norton's other hand was clenched
"in a large, tight fist. He eyed the older man sourly for a minute, then"
shoved him backward to collapse in a chair.
"""What are you trying to do?"" sneered Norton. ""Make me mad enough to"
clip you so you can yell 'Foul!'? I know as well as you do that the law
doesn't even recognize taunts and tongue-lashings as contributory to

"Alice got up from her couch and stood between them. ""Stop it, both of"
"you!"" she cried. ""Stop it!"""

"There was a brief, noisy interval, during which Emerson was too"
astounded to attempt an answer to the questions hurled broadcast by the
"new-comers; then Marsh levelled a trembling finger at him and cried,"
hysterically:
"""There he is, men. He tried to murder me. I--I'm hurt. I'll have him"
"arrested."""
The seriousness of the accusation struck the young man on the instant;
he turned upon the group.
"""I didn't do that. I heard a fight going on and ran in here--"""
"""He's a liar,"" the wounded man interrupted, shrilly. ""He stabbed me!"
"See?"" He tried to strip the shirt from his wounds, then fell to"
"chattering and shaking. ""Oh, God! I'm hurt."" He staggered to a"
packing-case and sank upon it weakly fumbling at his sodden shoulder.
"""I didn't do that,"" repeated Boyd. ""I don't know who stabbed him. I"
"didn't."""
"""Then who did?"" some one demanded."
"""What are you doing in here? You'd a killed him in a minute,"" said the"
man with the lantern.
"""We'll fix you for this,"" a third voice threatened."
"""Listen,"" Boyd said, in a tone to make them pause. ""There has been a"
"mistake here. I was passing the building when I heard a woman scream,"
"and I rushed in to prevent Marsh from choking her to death."""
"calmly, and added, with a sigh, ""I have no doubt he would have landed"
"you in rather an awkward fix ... had we not taken pity upon you."""
"""Ah!""  And the angry soldier raised his hand.  ""There are two of them"
"...  One of them discovered it, the other wrote the petition, the"
"accursed reporter!"""
"""Why the reporter?"""
"""He writes for the papers ...  He is one of your lodgers ... there they"
"all are outside ...  Clear them away, for Christ's sake!  The robbers!"

them ... And they are all desperate fellows ...  You had better take
"care, or else they will rob or burn you ..."""
"""And this reporter, who is he?"" asked Petunikoff, with interest."
"""He?  A drunkard.  He was a teacher but was dismissed.  He drank"
everything he possessed ... and now he writes for the papers and
"composes petitions.  He is a very wicked man!"""
"""H'm!  And did he write your petition, too?  I suppose it was he who"
discovered the flaws in the building.  The beams were not rightly put
"in?"""
"""He did!  I know it for a fact!  The dog!  He read it aloud in here and"
"boasted, 'Now I have caused Petunikoff some loss!'"""
"""Ye--es...  Well, then, do you want to be reconciled?"""
"""To be reconciled?""  The soldier lowered his head and thought. ""Ah!"
"This is a hard life!"" said he, in a querulous voice, scratching his"
"""But the police?"" queried Boyd."
"""Oh, I squared them easy. It's you they want. Yes, sir, I _worked_."""
"Again he scanned their faces anxiously. ""I'm a scullery-maid."""
"""What?"""
"""That's what I said. I've rustled garbage-cans till the smell of food"
"gives me a cold sweat. I'm as hungry as a starving Cuban, and yet the"
"sight of a knife and fork turns my stomach."" He wheeled suddenly upon"
"Alton Clyde, whose burst of shrill laughter offended him. ""Don't cry."
"Your sympathy unmans me."""
"""Tell us about it,"" urged Cherry."
"""What's the use?"" he demanded, with a glare at Clyde. ""That bone-head"
"wouldn't understand."""
"""Go ahead,"" Boyd seconded, with twitching lips. ""You look as if you had"
"worked, and worked hard."""
"""Hard? I'm the only man in the world who knows what hard work is!"""

"condemned her to, what manner of man he was; he must seem to destroy or"
impair the perfect sweetness of memory wherein she held her mother.
"He opened the door softly. She was sitting in a large armchair, over a"
"little bit of bright fire; save for gleams suddenly coming and going, as"
"a coal blazed and died down again, the room was in darkness. He walked"
"up to her and knelt by the chair, his head almost on a level with hers."
"""Well, Daisy, what are you doing?"""
She put out a hand and laid it on his with a gentle pressure.
"""I'm thinking,"" she said. ""Do you want a light?"""
"""No, I like it dark best--best for what I have to say."""
"Suddenly she threw her arms round his neck, drawing him to her and"
kissing his face.
"""I'd do the same if you'd killed him yourself,"" she whispered in the"
"extravagance of her love, and kissed him again."
"""But, Daisy, you don't know."""
"""Yes, I do. He told me. He's been here."""

"""Jack Norburn. He said you would hate telling me, so he did. You mustn't"

"'It should be in this direction,' Steve said, with an accent of doubt."
'But I cannot see. We shall have the horses down.'
"'Let me go first,' I said."
"'We must not separate,' he answered hastily."
"'No, no,' I said, my teeth beginning to chatter. 'But are you sure"
that there is an eyot here?'
"'I did not go to it,' he answered, scratching his head. 'But I saw a"
"clump of willows rising well above the level, and they looked to me as"
if they grew on dry land.'
"He stood a moment irresolutely, first one and then another of the"
horses shaking itself till the women could scarcely keep their seats.
'Why do we not go on?' my lady asked in a low voice.
"'Because Steve is not sure of the place, my lady,' I said. 'And it is"
"almost impossible to move, it is so dark, and the osiers grow so"
closely. I doubt we should have waited until daylight.'
"'Then we should have run the risk of being intercepted,' she answered"
feverishly. 'Are you very wet?'
"'No,' I said, though my feet were growing numb, 'not very. I see what"
we must do. One of us must climb into a willow and look out.'
We had passed a small one not long before. I plashed my way back to
ever-increasing recklessness--began presently to possess us. Once or
"twice I had to check the foremost, or they would have outrun the rear;"
"and this kind of race brought us gradually into such a state of alarm,"
"that by-and-by, when the line came to a sudden stop on the brow of a"
"gentle descent, I could hardly restrain my impatience."
'What is it?' I asked eagerly. 'Why are we stopping?' Surely the road
is good enough here.'
"No one answered, but it was significant that on the instant one of the"
women began to cry.
'Stop that folly!' I said. 'What is in front there? Cannot some one
speak?'
"'The Waldgrave thinks that he hears horsemen before us,' Fraulein Max"
answered.
In another moment the Waldgrave's figure loomed out of the darkness.
"'Martin,' he said--I noticed that his voice shook--'go forward. They"
"are in front. Man alive, be quick!' he continued fiercely. 'Do you"
want to have them into us?'
"I left my girl's rein, and pushing past the women and Fraulein, joined"
"Steve, who was standing by my lady's rein. 'What is it?' I said."
"'Nothing, I think,' he answered in an uncertain tone."
"I stood a moment listening, but I too could hear nothing. I began to"
argue with him. 'Who heard it?' I asked impatiently.
"'The Waldgrave,' he answered."
"“I know you are an angel—oh, hang it! You do make me feel as if you"
_were_ my mother.”
"“Now, don’t be unreasonable, or I shall believe that you are a tyrant.”"
"“A tyrant? I? Horri—no, I wish I was. What a model of propriety you"
are! I never should have thought it—I mean—darling! you were always
"such a coquette, you know. Not that I ever thought so. You know I never"
"did—oh, hang it all—but if I let you have your own way in this"
unreasonable—I mean this perfectly natural whim—you might at least

"angel, I am a saint.”"
"“Well, on one condition.”"
“Any! Any!”
“It must be an absolute secret until the wedding is over. I hate
"congratulations, and if we are going to have a sensation we might as"
well have a good concentrated one.”
"“I agree with you, and I’ll never find fault with you again. You—”"
Miss Decker almost ran into the room.
"“Jessica!” she cried. “Oh, dear Mr. Dedham, how are you? Jessica, mother"
"has one of her terrible attacks, and I must ask you to stay with her"

“Let me go! let me go!” cried Teddy. “I’ll bring him back in a quarter
of an hour. Who shall—”

"""Sure."""
"""See here. Is life one long succession of surprise parties with you?"""
"""Why, I've figgered on this right along."""
"""But the ship is jammed now. There is no room."""
"""Oh, I fixed that up long ago. I am going to bunk with the steward."""
"""Well, why in the world didn't you let us know you were coming?"""
"""Say, don't kid yourself. You knew I couldn't stay behind."" Fraser blew"
"a cloud of smoke airily. ""I never start anything I can't finish, I keep"

"manner, he laid his hand upon Boyd's shoulder, saying: ""Pal, I ain't"
"much good to myself or anybody else, but I like you and I want to stick"
"around. Maybe I'll come in useful yet--you can't tell."""
"Emerson had never glimpsed this side of the man's nature, and it rather"
surprised him.

"""Pola!"" Her mother called sharply."
"Pola waved her hand toward her mother. ""Yes, mamma!"" Then, to Sidney,"
"""Isn't it simply rare our meeting like this? It shows how small the"
"world is. I must run now! By-by!"" She gave the slightest flip of her"
"hand in sign of leave-taking and, turning, ran lightly up the wharf"
toward her mother.
"Sidney's eyes followed her, devouring her dainty clothes, the"
"tight-fitting motoring hat, the buckled pumps. Pola--the Pola she had"
"carried enshrined in her heart! That heart hurt now, to the core. She"
"had dreamed of a meeting sometime, somewhere, had planned just what it"
would be like and what she'd say and what Pola would say. And now Pola
had turned a shoulder upon it.
Mart's laugh behind her roused her.
"""Who's Guinevere, anyway? Her ma called her just in time--we might a"
"hurt the doll-baby!"""
"Sidney turned on Mart fiercely. ""She's a friend of mine,"" she cried, in"
"a voice she made rough to keep the tears from it. ""And she's _not_ a"
"doll-baby."""
"""All right--go and play with her then--she's crazy about you, I guess."""
"And with that Mart swung on her heel and stalked away, her head in the"
air.
Poor Sidney hurried back to Sunset Lane to hide her humiliation and her
"""Yes, yes; that's nothing!  Don't cry--don't cry!"""
"Very slowly the sobbing died away, till it was just a long shivering, but"
still the girl held her hands over her face and her face down.  Gyp felt
"paralyzed.  The unhappy girl, the red and green room, the smell of"
mutton--creeping!
"At last, a little of that white face showed; the lips, no longer craving"
"for sugar-plums, murmured:"
"""It's you he--he--really loves all the time.  And you don't love"
"him--that's what's so funny--and--and--I can't understand it.  Oh, Mrs."
"Fiorsen, if I could see him--just see him!  He told me never to come"
again; and I haven't dared.  I haven't seen him for three weeks--not
"since I told him about IT.  What shall I do?  What shall I do?"""
His being her own husband seemed as nothing to Gyp at that moment. She
felt such pity and yet such violent revolt that any girl should want to
"crawl back to a man who had spurned her.  Unconsciously, she had drawn"
"herself up and pressed her lips together.  The girl, who followed every"
"movement, said piteously:"
"""I don't seem to have any pride.  I don't mind what he does to me, or"
"what he says, if only I can see him."""
Gyp's revolt yielded to her pity.  She said:
"""How long before?"""
"""Three months."""
"""My lord,"" she said, kneeling at his feet, ""God save and comfort"
"you!""--"
The man's brow was twisted into furrows. His right hand clasped his
"left wrist. He looked over the woman's head into the woods, and"
breathed fast through clenched teeth.
"""Speak!"" he said."
"""My lord, the woman lives!"""
"""I can bear the truth!"""
The anchoress made the sign of the cross.
"""She came to us here in the valley, my lord, tall and white as a lily,"
"her hair loose upon her neck. Her feet were bare and bleeding, her"
"soles rent with thorns. And as she came, she sang wild snatches of a"
"song, such as tells of love, and of Proserpina, Goddess of Shades. We"
"took her, my lord, gave her meat and drink, bathed her torn feet, and"
"gave her raiment. She abode with us, ever gentle and lovely, yet"
"speaking like one who had suffered, even to the death. And yet,--even"
"as we slept, she stole away from us last night, and now is gone!""--"
The woman had never so much as raised her eyes to the man's face. Her
"hands held her crucifix, and she was ashen pale, even as new-hewn"
stone.
"""And is this all?"""
The man's voice trembled in his throat. His face was terrible to
foreigners at his heels.  The true battle (for this was but an affair
"of outposts) joined on the crest of the rise, and in five minutes the"
English were in flight for the shelter of the piled-up _Potluck_.

away and got him down to the ship.  He swore most terribly.

Simcox looked sulky and injured.
"""How was I to look dignified with six of 'em after me--and two with"

"""They're standin' upon the 'ill as thick as pea-sticks,"" said one of"
the boys.
"""Speak hup,"" roared the skipper."
The crew shoved old Mac in front.
"""We've revolved the notion up and over,"" said Mac, ""and we've come to"
"the conclusion, sir, there ain't nothin' to be got by sendin'"
"ignorant men like we on such errands."""
The skipper hiccupped angrily.
"""Who asted you to think?  But I ain't the man to press unwilling"
"lubbers into goin' aloft, _I_ can lead the way.  Go into the"
"fo'castle, you dogs, and consider yourselves under arrest.  Go!"""
"""Blimy,"" said the crowd, ""but we're all in our own custody, so we"
"are.  Now what's the old man goin' to do?"""
They watched him from the fo'castle as he staggered into his own part
of the ship.
"""I'll be my own hambassador,"" said Jones.  ""I'll show 'em 'ow to work"
things with dignity; I'll show that ass Lampert what's o'clock.  What
"you wants in such cases made and provided is tact, and go, and"
innerds.  Innerds is the chief need.  Why fight if palaver'll do?
Where I was wrong was to send a galoot like Simcox.  But what could I
"do but work the best with the tools I 'ad?  If I'd gone myself, we'd"
"'ave made peace afore there was a row."""
"Brand laughed. ""Try and get you out of it! I know your attitude toward"
"a real jaunt. And it's a real jaunt we've got ahead of us, too, old"
"boy. We're going to the red spot. Immediately."""
*       *       *       *       *
"Dex's sandy eyebrows shot up. ""The red spot! That's where Coblenz and"
"Heiroy were lost!"""
"""And Journeyman,"" added Brand. ""He's the latest victim of whatever's"
"in the hell-hole."""
"Dex whistled. ""Journeyman too! Well, all I've got to say is that"
whatever's there must be strong medicine. Journeyman was a damn fine
"man, and as brave as they come. Have you any idea what it's all"
"about?"""
"""Not an idea. Nobody has. We're to go and find out--if we can. Are you"
"all ready?"""
"""All ready,"" said Dex."
"""So am I. We'll start at eleven o'clock in one of the Old Man's best"
"cruisers. Meanwhile, we might as well go and hunt up a dinner"
"somewhere, to fortify us against the synthetic pork chops and bread"
"we'll be swallowing for the next fortnight."""
They went out; and at ten minutes of eleven reported at the great
"space ship hangars north of New York, with their luggage, a"
conspicuous item of which was a chess board to help while away the
"long, long days of spacial travel. Brand then paused a little while"
"right in suspecting Eilert, for I heard him going upstairs, and when I"
"came in, he was turning out the bag and going through the clothes."
"""What are you doing?"" I said."
At first he tried to brazen it out.
"""Never you mind,"" he replied. But my knowing something about him was so"
"much to my advantage that he soon drew in his horns. How I wronged him, he"
"complained, and exploited him:"
"""You haven't bought these clothes,"" he said. ""I could have got more for"
"them if I'd sold them."" He had been paid, but he still wanted more, like"
"the stomach, which goes on digesting after death. That was Eilert. Yet he"
"was not too bad; he had never been any better, and he certainly had grown"
no worse with his new livelihood.
May no one ever grow worse with a new livelihood!
So I moved the knapsack and the clothes into my own room in order to take
better care of them. It was a slow job to tidy everything up for the
"second time, but it had to be done. Later that evening I would resume my"
"journey, taking the knapsack with me. I had done with the place, and the"
nights were moonlit again.
Enough of these clothes!

"her life; she was never quite happy. It was all my doing. Still, I think"
"she was happier with me, in spite of it."""
"A movement of impatience escaped from Alicia. Seeing it he added,"
"""I beg your pardon. I didn't want you to think hardly of her."""
"""I don't want to think of her at all. Was she--was she like Daisy?"""
"""Yes; but prettier."""
"""I don't know what you expect me to say,"" she exclaimed. ""I know--I"
suppose some men don't think much of--of a thing like that. To me it is
"horrible. You simply followed your-- Ah, I can't speak of it!"" and she"
seemed to put him from her with a gesture of disgust.
"He walked beside her in silence, his face set in the bitter smile it"
always wore when fate dealt hardly with him.
"""I think I'll go straight home,"" she said, stopping suddenly. ""You can"
"join the others."""
"""Yes, that will be best. I'm not due at the Council just yet."""
"""I suppose I ought to thank you for telling me the truth. I--"" Her false"
composure suddenly gave way. With a sob she stretched out her hands
"towards him, crying, ""Why didn't you tell me sooner?"" and before he"
"could answer her she turned and walked swiftly away, leaving him"
standing still on the pathway.
She was hardly inside the gates of Government House when she saw Eleanor
"Scaife, who hurried to meet her."
"The horseman leaned against his horse, his arm hooked over its neck."
He pointed to the valley.
"""Yonder lies Narni. Beyond the Campanile of St. Juvenal is a"
sanctuary. You can see it yonder by the ford. Two holy women dwell
"therein. To them, my lord, I commend you!"""
"""You know more!"""
The voice that spoke was terrible.
"""Spare me, my lord! The words are for women's lips, not for mine!"""
"""So be it!"""
"The three rode in silence, Francesco and the duke together, looking"
mutely into each other's face. Francesco's head was bowed to his
breast. The reins lay loose on his horse's neck.
A gray cell of roughly hewn stone showed amidst the green boughs
beyond the water. At its door stood a woman in a black mantle. A cross
hung from her neck and a white kerchief bound her hair. She stood
"motionless, half in the shadow, watching the horsemen as they rode"
down to the rippling fords.
"Autumn had touched the sanctuary garden, and Francesco's eyes beheld"
"ruin as he climbed the slope. The woman had come from the cell, and"
now stood at the wicket-gate with her hands folded as if in prayer.
The horseman took Francesco's bridle. The latter went on foot alone to
speak with the anchoress.
"""But what was the cause of it all?""  I demanded.  ""You surely know the"
"reason?"""
"""No, we cannot yet tell,"" he answered.  ""The marks puzzle us.  That mark"
on her lower lip is the most peculiar and unaccountable.  At present we
"can say nothing."""
"""Then why did you call me out?"""
"""Because I want to consult you,"" he replied.  ""The fact is, that in this"
affair there is a strong element of mystery which I don't like at all.
"And, moreover, the few seconds during which I've seen the Countess have"
plainly impressed upon me the belief that either she has had something
"to do with it, or else that she knows the truth."""
"I nodded.  This was exactly my own theory.  ""Do you think Yolande has"
"been the victim of foul play?""  I inquired a moment later."
"""That's my suspicion,"" he responded.  ""But only she herself can tell us"
"the truth."""
"""You really think, then, that a dastardly attempt has been made upon her"
"life?""  I cried incredulously."
"""Personally, I think there can be no doubt."""
"""But by whom?  No one called here after my departure."""
"""It is that mystery which we must elucidate,"" he said.  ""All I fear is,"
"however, that she may render us no assistance."""
“But if it will kill you?”
"“Bah. What do I care? When one lives, one amuses oneself. And I have"
"well amused myself, eh, Yvonne? For the rest, _je m’en fiche!_”"
He went on talking with airy cynicism. To Yvonne it seemed some horrible
"dream. The husband she had looked upon as dead was before her, gay,"
"mocking, just as she had known him of old. And he greeted her after all"
these years with the-same lightness as he had bidden her farewell.
"“_Et toi, Yvonne?_” said he at length. “_Ça roule toujours?_ You"
look as if you were brewing money. Ravishing costume. _Crépon_--not
twenty-five centimes a yard! A hat that looks like the Rue de la Paix!
_Gants de reine et petites bottines de duchesse!_ You must be doing
"golden business. But speak, _petite_, since I assure you I am not a"
ghost!”
"Yvonne forced a faint smile. She tried to answer him, but her heart was"
thumping violently and a lump rose in her throat.
"“I am doing very well, Amédée,” she said. The dreadfulness of her"
position came over her. She felt sick and faint. What was going to
happen? For some moments she did not hear him as he spoke. At last
perception returned.
"“And you are pretty,” Amédée Bazouge was saying. “_Mais jolie à"
croquer_--prettier than you ever were. And I--I am going down the hill
"at the gallop. _Tiens_, Yvonne. Let us celebrate this meeting. Come and"
see me safe to the bottom. It won’t be long. I have money. I am always
_bon enfant._ Let us remarry. From to-day. _Ce serait rigolo!_ And I
will love you--_mais énormément!_”
"said. ""Percy says all Indian butter is bad. Of course, it's only an"
"idea of his, but men are such faddy creatures, don't you think?"""
"""They wouldn't be men if they weren't--"" Mrs. Carmichael had begun,"
"when she broke off, and the scissors that had been snipping their way"
steadily through the rough linen jagged and dropped on the table. She
picked them up immediately and went on with an impatient exclamation
at her own carelessness. But the involuntary start had coincided with
"a loud report from outside in the darkness, and a smothered scream."
Lois put down her knife.
"""Won't you come and help me?"" she said to Beatrice. ""Your mother will"
"not notice that you have gone."""
"Beatrice nodded, and letting the heavy head sink back among the"
"cushions, came over to Lois' side."
"""How brave you are!"" she said in a whisper. ""You seem so cool and"
"collected, just as though you believed your sandwiches would ever be"
"eaten!"""
"""I am not braver than you are. Look how steady your hand is--much"
"steadier than mine."""
Beatrice held out her white hand and studied it thoughtfully.
"""I am not afraid,"" she said, ""but not because I am brave. There is no"
"room for fear, that is all."" She paused an instant, and then suddenly"
"the hand fell on Lois'. The two women looked at each other. ""Lois, I"
"am so sorry."""
"""Have you ever heard the like of it? She told me to get out! I shall leave"
"tomorrow."""
"""Have you found the galoshes?"" I asked."
"""Of course,"" he replied. ""They were right in the passage. 'Here they are,'"
"I said to her. 'Yes, yes,' she said. 'Right under your nose,' I said."
"'Yes, yes, go away,' she said, and began to cry. So I went away."""
"""She'll get over it."""
"""Do you think so? Yes, I expect she will. Oh, well, it's my opinion nobody"
"can understand women, anyhow. But they're a mighty sex, the women, a"
"mighty sex. They certainly are."""
"He sat on a while, but he had no peace of mind, and soon went out again."

That evening the lady was in the dining room before us; she was there when
"we came in, and we all nodded slightly in greeting. To the actor she was"
"very kind, quite making up for her petulance of the afternoon."
When he sat down he found a letter in his table napkin: a written note
folded into the napkin. He was so surprised that he dropped everything he
"was doing to unfold and read it. With an exclamation and a smile, his"
"blue, delighted eyes splashed over her; but she was looking down into her"
"lap with her forehead wrinkled, so he put the note away in his vest"
pocket.
"Then it probably dawned on him that he had betrayed her, and he tried to"
cover it up somehow.
"""I can say no more,"" Monsieur added. ""Accept my thanks and gratitude for"
"the help you have given me. And now--_bon soir_."""
"He bowed, backing himself toward the stairs as though leaving a royal"
"presence, doing it so easily, so naturally, that we did not even smile."
When he had quite disappeared we turned and faced each other.
"""What do you think now?"" I asked."
"""I think he's a treasure,"" Tommy cried. His face had lighted with a new"
"excitement. ""If we want any fun on this trip, don't let him get out of"
"our sight! Stick to him! I won't deny he has a screw loose, but----"""
"""That makes it all the better,"" I laughed, adding: ""Looks like the"
"Mater's toast might come true, after all, doesn't it!""--for I had"
described our New Year's Eve to Tommy.
"""Sonny, I've a hunch we won't even have to tiptoe over the hill to find"
"adventures with him around! He's their regular hanging-out place!"""
"Gates came up, and seemed vastly amused when we told him of our hopes."
"""He doesn't look like much of an adventurer, sir, but he's certainly a"
"change from the great run of people I've met. Still, I carn't see how"
"we're going to keep him against his will!"""
"""Neither can I, Tommy."""
"""Use a little persuasion."""
"""But suppose he won't persuade?"""
wings.
"The Canon came later to her room, kindly solicitous. Was she ill? Would"
she like to see a medical man? Should he sit with her? She clasped his
hand impulsively and kissed it.
“You are too good to me. I am not worth it. I am not ill. It was the
"sun, I think. Let me lie down this afternoon by myself and I shall be"
better.”
"Surprised and touched by her action, he bent down and kissed her."
“My poor little wife.”
He stepped to the window and pulled the curtain to shield her eyes from
"the glare, and promising to order some tea to be brought up later, he"
went out.
"The kiss, the term, and the little act of thoughtfulness comforted her,"
gave her a sense of protection. She had been so bruised and frightened.
Now she could think a little. Should she tell Everard? Then she broke
down again and began to cry silently in a great soothing pity for
herself.
"“It would only make him unhappy,” she moaned. “Why should I tell him?”"
She grew calmer. If Amédée would only keep his promise and leave her
"free, there was really nothing to fret about. She reassured herself with"
his words. Through all his failings toward her he had ever been “_bon
enfant_.” There was no danger.
Suddenly a thought came that made her spring from her bed in dismay. The
"After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. ""You're right. I've also"
"become a male outside the law. We're in this together."""
He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found
myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis
insists such things have always had for men.
"""Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll"
"call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown."""
"I liked the sound of Ford. ""Is Butt a nickname, too?"""
"""Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a"
"blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the"
eighties--the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named
"all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the"
"name they were saving for a girl."""
"""You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?"""
"He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. ""Oh, a nestful. Of course, they"
were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys--all
except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.
Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down
"the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up."""
I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of
"the blaster above the firing button. ""Have you killed a lot of men with"
"that, Mr. Butt?"""
"""Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford."" He frowned and sighted at"
over tomorrow. We can stay there for a few days. I shall welcome the
"change for this place has been very stupid for me, my dear."""
"""Poor mamma! I've been selfish. It'll be a lark seeing Cora Truxton"
"again!"" Pola had explained to Sidney: ""We met the Truxtons at Nice."
"Cora and Millicent are both older, but they're the _cutest_ girls. Will"
"we go in the morning, mamma?"""
Pola's manner had indicated that the coming of the Truxtons into their
plans raised a barrier that now excluded Sidney. Throughout the dinner
she had talked exclusively of the trip on the morrow and the renewing
of that acquaintance that had begun in Nice. But Sidney felt nothing
but a sense of escape.
She found Aunt Achsa alone in the cottage on Sunset Lane. She was
"sitting on the doorstep, ""coolin' off."" Sidney sat down beside her."
"""Where's Lavender?"" she asked, wishing Lavender was at home that she"
"might begin her ""making up"" at once."
"""Don't know. And I wish I did. Don't know what's gotten into that boy."
"I'm as worried as can be."""
"""About Lav? Oh, what's the matter?"" For Aunt Achsa was close to tears."
Something must have happened to break her habitual optimism.
"""He's acted so queer like lately. Cal'late you'd of noticed it if you"
hadn't been off so much with Mr. Dugald's folks. I thought it might a'
"been his stomach and I put a powder into his coffee, but he ain't been"
"a mite different--"""
"""But what does he do, Aunt Achsa? He looks all right--"""
"""But the diamonds!"" she cried."
"""_Diamonds_--"" Cap'n Davies stared at her, his mouth open."
"""Why, yes, they're on this boat. They _must_ be! We were in the forward"
cabin watching and Jed Starrow came on board and they talked right
where we could hear. They were going to take them off and then they
decided it wasn't safe and they'd wait and they went away. And then
they must have cut the boat adrift. But we're _sure_ they're on this
"boat."""
"""So that was it! Of all the low-down dastardly tricks! Well, never mind"
"your diamonds, now. We got to get back to shore and let a few folks"
"know--"""
"""But I won't _go_ until we've looked!"" Sidney protested, almost in"
"tears. ""Why, that was why we risked everything! And Lav wants to save"
"the name of the Cape--the--the way--you do! Oh, please look!"""
"The old Captain dropped his hold of the girl's arm. ""Well, I'll be"
"ding-blasted!"" he stormed. But he motioned to Saunders. ""Climb aboard"
and give us a hand. 'Taint likely they'd hide their stuff above deck.
You look round the stern and the girls and me'll give a hunt forward.
"Of all the stubborn, crazy-headed female pieces you'll beat 'em all!"""
While Saunders searched the stern of the schooner the Captain and
"Sidney and Mart searched the fo'castle cabin. Sidney, tugging away the"
"heavy tarpaulins, disclosed a small wooden box."
"""I'm _sure_ it wasn't there before--"" she cried. ""Why--why, I was"
"_sitting_ on it--"""
"""Vera, my love,"" Eva said, cutting her off, ""if you try and double-"
"cross us, you're making a very big mistake. You seem to forget we've"
got that protocol. What we didn't get around to telling you is that
"we've deciphered it."""
"""You--?"""
"""That's right. As it happens, I don't think you're going to like what"
"it's got to say, but you might at least want to know the story before"
"you read about it in The Times day after tomorrow."""
"Alex Novosty's face had turned ashen. ""Michael, Tanzan Mino's people"
are probably headed here by now. Unless they go to the main office on
"King William Street first."" He was nervously glancing out the window."
"""We're running out of time."""
"The game's about to get rough, Vance thought. Better take charge."
"But before he could move, Novosty was gripping a Ruger P-85, a"
"lightweight 9mm automatic, pulled from a holster under the back of his"
jacket. He'd worn it where the MNB guards would miss it.
The two Victoria couriers were caught flat-footed. Bankers weren't
supposed to start drawing weapons. They stared in astonishment as he
gestured for them to turn and face the wall.
"""Michael,"" he said as he glanced over, ""would you kindly give me a hand"
"and take those two .38's? We really must get this party moving."""
"Vera Karanova was smiling a thin smile. ""I don't know how far you think"
"you will get with this."""
"to tea and was very----'  I can't quite make this word out."""
"""Let _me_ look,"" said the King, his rubicund face becoming yet more"
"rubicund.  ""It looks like 'charming,'"" he said casually."
"""Fancy!"" said Belvane.  ""Fancy my writing that!  I put down just what"
"comes into my head at the time, you know.""  She made a gesture with"
her hand indicative of some one who puts down just what comes into her
"head at the time, and returned to her diary.  ""'Remained to tea, and"
"was very charming.  Mused afterwards on the mutability of life!'"" She"
"looked up at him with wide-open eyes.  ""I often muse when I'm alone,"""
she said.
The King still hovered over the diary.
"""Have you any more entries like--like that last one?  May I look?"""
"""Oh, your Majesty!  I'm afraid it's _quite_ private.""  She closed the"
book quickly.
"""I just thought I saw some poetry,"" said the King."
"""Just a little ode to a favourite linnet.  It wouldn't interest your"
"Majesty."""
"""I adore poetry,"" said the King, who had himself written a rhymed"
"couplet which could be said either forwards or backwards, and in the"
latter position was useful for removing enchantments.  According to
"the eminent historian, Roger Scurvilegs, it had some vogue in Euralia"
and went like this:
"""_Bo, boll, bill, bole._"
"My lady came swiftly to me, and it grieved me to see the pain and woe"
in her face.
'Is he mad?' she muttered.
I shook my head.
'Do you think he has really seen him?' she whispered. We both stood
with our eyes on him.
"'I fear so, my lady,' I said with reluctance."
"'But it would cost _him_ his life,' she muttered eagerly, 'if he were"
found here!'
"'He is a bold man,' I answered."
"'Ah! so was he--once,' she replied in a peculiar tone, and she pointed"
stealthily to the unconscious man in the window. 'A month ago he would
have taken him by the throat anywhere. What has come to him?'
"'God knows,' I answered reverently. 'Grant only he may do us no harm!'"
"He turned round at that, humming gaily, and went out, seeming almost"
unconscious of our presence; and I made as light of the matter to my
"lady as I could. But Tzerclas in the city, the Waldgrave mad, or at"
"any rate not sane, and last, but not least, the strange light in which"
"the latter chose to regard the former, were circumstances I could not"
easily digest. They filled me with uneasy fears and surmises. I began
"to perambulate the crowd, seeking furtively for a face; and was"
"entirely determined what I would do if I found it. The town was full,"
"While I was reading the poems to her, the actor returned."
"""I couldn't find any galoshes there,"" he said."
"""No?"" she replied absently."
"""No, I really looked everywhere, but...."""
She got up and left the room.
"He looked after her in some surprise, and sat still for a moment. Then it"
occurred to him.
"""I believe her galoshes are in the passage outside her door,"" he said, and"
hurried after her.
"I sat back, thinking it over. There had been a sweetness in her face as"
"she said, ""Yes, you're very silent."" Had she seen through me and my"
pretext for reading to her? Of course she had. She was no fool. I was the
"fool, nobody else. I should have driven a sportsman to despair. Some"
"practice the sport of making conquests and the sport of making love,"
because they find it so agreeable; I have never practiced sport of any
kind. I have loved and raged and suffered and stormed according to my
nature--that is all; I am an old-fashioned man. And here I sit in the
"shadow of evening, the shadow of the half-century. Let me have done!"
The actor returned to the living room confused and dejected. She had
turned him out; she had wept.
"I was not surprised, for it was the mode of expression of her type."
"“Ah, it’s a pity. You had such an exquisite little voice. I regretted"
it after we parted. Two or three times it nearly brought me back to
you--_foi d’artiste!_”
"“I think I must go,” said Yvonne after a little. “I am leaving Ostend"
to-morrow and I shall not see you again. You don’t think I am treating
"you unkindly, Amédée?”"
He laughed in his bantering way and lit a cigarette.
"“On the contrary, _cher ange_. It is very good of you to talk to a poor"
"ghost. And you look so pathetic, like a poor little saint with its harp"
out of tune.”
"She rose, anxious to leave him and escape into solitude, where she could"
"think. She still trembled with agitation. In the little cool park, on"
"the other side of the square below, she could be by herself. She dreaded"
meeting the Canon yet awhile.
"“Do give up that vile absinthe,” she said, as a parting softness."
“It is the only consoler that remains to me--sad widower.”
"“Well, good-bye, Amédée.”"
"“Ah--not yet. Since you are the wife of somebody else, I am dying to"
make love to you.”
"He held her by the wrist, laughing at her. But at that moment Yvonne"
"caught sight of the Canon and Mrs. Winstanley, entering upon the"
terrace. She wrenched her arm away.
“Then it was sent up by this crooked messenger boy with the intention of
"getting us out to look for you. He believed, of course, that we would"
regard the call for help as coming from you and rush away from camp.”
"“Don’t be too sure of that,” warned Ned. “There’s something about that"
"boy I rather like. Besides, he really is a member of the Wolf Patrol,"
New York.”
“My own patrol?” exclaimed Jimmie. “I never saw him at the club room. He
"told me that he belonged to the Wolf Patrol, but I didn’t believe it. I"
think he’s a fake.”
"“Time alone will tell,” answered Ned. “I’m going to believe in the boy"
until I get some positive proof that he really is crooked.”
Jimmie was about to continue the argument when a succession of shrieks
and calls for help came from the forest on the slope below.
"“Now, what’s that?” demanded Jimmie. “That isn’t any of our boys!”"
“Help! Help! Help!” cried the voice.
"“No,” Ned agreed, “our boys don’t make a racket like that.”"
"“Say!” Jimmie shouted, springing to his feet. “I bet you the next dollar"
"I don’t find that that’s the fat clerk, Gilroy!”"
"“The voice sounds like that of a fat man,” Ned laughed."
“Gilroy’s fat all right!” Jimmie exclaimed. “He’s got one of those pink
baby faces that make you hungry to look at. He makes me think of a roast
tries to draw her with him; but she resists.
Then he grows angry.
"""What the devil did you send for me for?"" he asks roughly."
And she begins to weep and says:
"""So that's all you've come for! Oh, oh! But I'm not like that at all. Why"
"can't you leave me alone? I'm not hurting you."""
Am I one who understands women? Self-deception. Vain boasting. I made my
presence known then because her weeping sounded so wretched; I moved a
chair and cleared my throat.
"The sound caught his attention at once, and he hushed her, trying to"
listen; but she said:
"""No, it was nothing...."""
But she knew very well this was not true; she knew what the sound was. It
was not the first time Miss Torsen used this trick with me; she had often
"pretended that she thought I was not within hearing, and then created some"
such delicate situation. Each time I had promised myself not to intervene;
but she had not wept before; now she wept.
"Why did she use these wiles? To clear herself in my eyes--mine, the eyes"
"of a settled man--to make me believe how good she was, how well-behaved!"
"But, dear child, I knew that before; I could see it from your hands! You"
"are so unnatural that in your seven and twentieth year, you walk"
"unmarried, barren and unopen!"
"me--I imagine you are in diplomacy, as I noticed you went through"
"with a Red passport.--I am Vivien Warren, just out of prison, and an"
"outlaw, more or less."""
"""'The outlaws of to-day are the in-laws of to-morrow,' as the"
English barrister said when he married the Boer general's daughter.
I have thought I recognized you. I have heard you speak at Lady
Maud's and also at Lady Feenix's Suffrage parties. My name is Hawk.
I suppose you've been in prison for some Suffrage offence? So has my
"aunt, for the matter of that."""
"_Vivie_: ""Yes, but in her case they only sentenced her to the First"
"Division; whereas _I_ have been doing nine months' hard."""
"_Hawk_: ""What was your crime?"""
"_Vivie_: ""I admit nothing, it is always wisest. But I was accused of"
"burning down Mr. ----'s racing stables--and other things..."""
"_Hawk_: ""_That_ beast. Well, I suppose it was very wrong. Can't"
"quite make up my mind about militancy, one way or the other. But"
"here we are up against the biggest war in history, and such"
"peccadilloes as yours sink into insignificance. By the bye, my aunt"
"was amnestied and so I suppose were you?"""
"_Vivie_: ""Yes, but not so handsomely. I was requested to go away"
"from England for a time, so here I am, about to join my mother in"
"Brussels--or in a little country place near Brussels."""
"_Hawk_: ""Well, I've been Secretary of Legation there. I'm just going"
"back to--to--well I'm just going back."""
"I must go, Dad."""
Winton nodded.
"""Well, I'll come too,"" he said.  ""The girl can go back in the cab and say"
"we're on the way."""
"Taking a parting look at her baby, Gyp thought bitterly: 'My fate? THIS"
"is my fate, and no getting out of it!'  On the journey, she and Winton"
were quite silent--but she held his hand tight.  While the cook was
"taking up to Rosek the news of their arrival, Gyp stood looking out at"
her garden.  Two days and six hours only since she had stood there above
"her pansies; since, at this very spot, Rosek had kissed her throat!"
"Slipping her hand through Winton's arm, she said:"
"""Dad, please don't make anything of that kiss.  He couldn't help himself,"
"I suppose.  What does it matter, too?"""
"A moment later Rosek entered.  Before she could speak, Winton was saying:"
"""Thank you for letting us know, sir.  But now that my daughter is here,"
"there will be no further need for your kind services.  Good-day!"""
"At the cruel curtness of those words, Gyp gave the tiniest start forward."
She had seen them go through Rosek's armour as a sword through brown
"paper.  He recovered himself with a sickly smile, bowed, and went out."
Winton followed--precisely as if he did not trust him with the hats in
"the hall.  When the outer door was shut, he said:"
"""I don't think he'll trouble you again."""
"Gyp's gratitude was qualified by a queer compassion.  After all, his"
"""When do you propose to make the start, Colonel?"" Nicholson asked."
"""Within an hour. The night favors us. The women must be kept in the"
center as much as possible. I have given Geoffries special charge over
them. They will be told at the last moment. There is no use in
"spoiling what little rest they have had."" He drew out a pencil and"
"began to scribble a despatch on the back of an old letter. ""I advise"
"you gentlemen to do likewise,"" he said. ""Very often a piece of paper"
"gets through where a man can not, and it is our bounden duty to supply"
"the morning periodicals with as much news as possible."""
For some minutes there was no sound save that of the pencils scrawling
the last messages of men with the seal of death already stamped upon
"their foreheads. All three had forgotten Travers, and yet from the"
moment they had begun to speak he had been awake and listening. He sat
"up now, leaning upon his elbow."
"""Nicholson!"" he said faintly."
Nicholson turned and came to his side.
"""Hullo!"" he said. ""Awake, are you? How are you?"""
Travers made no immediate answer; he took Nicholson's hand in a
feverish clasp and drew him nearer.
"""I am in great pain,"" he said. ""You don't need to pretend. I know. The"
fear of death has been on me all day. Just now I am not afraid. Is
"there no hope?"""
"""You mean--for us? None."""
"""Looks like too little, too late."" He stretched beside her."
"""What did she mean just now? About our 'contribution'?"""
"""Probably the protocol. My guess is she wants to see it destroyed."
Let's hope that'll be the end of it. The godfather's got his money. And
"Alex's problem is solved permanently."""
"Now Kenji Nogami was entering the room, an island of Zen-like calm"
amidst all the bedlam.
"""Michael, I'm so sorry."" He stepped over. ""When the money didn't show"
"up as scheduled, they called Jiro Sato and he suggested they try here."
"There was nothing I could do."""
"Vance nodded. ""That's how I figured it'd be played. We didn't move fast"
"enough on this end. It was my fault."""
"""Too bad. We came close."" He sighed. ""But I'm not going to underwrite"
"the rest of those bogus debentures. He'll have to kill me."""
"""And he'll probably do just that. The hell with it. You tried, we all"
tried. Now it looks like Tanzan Mino's scam is going to go through
whether we play or not. You might as well save your own skin. With any
"luck, we can still sort out our end, but you--you're going to have to be"
"dealing with that bastard for years to come. Think about it."""
"""I'm still deciding,"" he said finally. ""Let's wait and see how things"
"go."""
"""Alex opted for suicide. You shouldn't follow his lead."""
"'Then now go! Go out, do you hear?' she cried, stamping her foot with"
passion. 'I want nothing. Go!'
I turned and crept towards the door like a beaten hound. But I was not
"to go; when my hand was on the latch, her mood changed."
"'No, stay,' she said in a different tone. 'You may come back. After"
"all, Martin, I had rather it was you than any one else.'"
"She dried her tears as she spoke, standing up very straight and proud,"
and hiding nothing. I felt a pang as I looked at her. I had neglected
her of late. I had been thinking more of others.
"'It is nothing, Martin,' she said after a pause, and when she had"
quite composed her face. 'You need not be frightened. All women cry a
"little sometimes, as men swear,' she added, smiling."
"'You have been looking at that thing outside,' I said, grumbling."
"'Perhaps it did upset me,' she replied. 'But I think it was that I"
felt--a little lonely.'
"That sounded so strange a complaint on her lips, seeing that the echo"
"of the young sparks' laughter was barely dead in the room, that I"
"stared. But I took it, on second thoughts, to refer to Fraulein Max,"
"whom she had kept at a distance since our escape, never sitting down"
"with her, or speaking to her except on formal occasions; and I said"
bluntly--
"'You need a woman friend, my lady.'"
"Well, it was not much to go away with, but perhaps that doesn't matter. As"
long as one has a reason to go away.

"Later in the forenoon Eilert returned home. He was alone, but he came up"
the path carrying one of the knapsacks--the larger one. He was in a
"furious temper, and kept saying they'd better not try it on him--no,"
they'd just better not.
Of course it was the bill again.
"""She'll probably have a good deal of this sort of trouble,"" I thought to"
"myself, ""but no doubt she'll get used to it, and take it as nonchalantly"
"as it should be taken. There are worse things."""
"But the fact remains that it was I that upset them, I that had driven them"
away without their clothes; perhaps they had really expected some money to
be sent here--who knows?
"I got hold of Eilert. How big was the bill? What, was that all? ""Good"
"heavens! Here you are, here's your money; now row across to them at once"
"with their clothes!"""
"But it all proved in vain, for the strangers had gone; they had arrived"
"just in time for the boat, and were aboard it at that very moment."
"Well, there was no help for it."
"""Here's their address,"" says Eilert. ""We can send the clothes next"
"Thursday; that's the next trip the boat goes south again."""
In the wind.
"""A passable enough rendering, if I may say, though I don't necessarily"
"accept your analogy."" He reached down and lifted a bottle of warmed"
"sake from beside the brazier. ""By the way, I know you prefer tequila,"
"one of your odd quirks, but there was no time to acquire any. Perhaps"
"this will suffice."""
"He set down two black _raku_ saucers and began to pour. ""Now, alas, we"
"must proceed."""
"Post time, Vance thought."
"""Dr. Michael Vance."" He lifted his saucer in a toast. ""A scholar of the"
"lost Aegean civilizations, a former operative of the Central"
"Intelligence Agency, and finally a private consultant affiliated with a"
group of mercenaries. I had your file updated when I first heard you
were involved. I see you have not been entirely idle since our last
"encounter."""
"""You haven't done too bad yourself."" Vance toasted him back. ""This new"
"project is a big step up from the old days. Has a lot of style."""
"""It does indeed,"" he nodded. ""I'm quite proud of our achievement here."""
"""You always thought big."" Vance sipped again at his sake, warm and"
soothing.
"""It's kind of you to have remembered."" Mino drank once more, then"
"was he all alone, climbing up and down? Where was Harold? Ah, it was no"
"good expecting anything from Harold. Down, down went the little old"
"spider, and then, to his horror, old Mr. Neave saw him slip past the"
"dining-room and make for the porch, the dark drive, the carriage gates,"
"the office. Stop him, stop him, somebody!"
Old Mr. Neave started up. It was dark in his dressing-room; the window
"shone pale. How long had he been asleep? He listened, and through the"
"big, airy, darkened house there floated far-away voices, far-away"
"sounds. Perhaps, he thought vaguely, he had been asleep for a long"
time. He’d been forgotten. What had all this to do with him—this house
"and Charlotte, the girls and Harold—what did he know about them? They"
were strangers to him. Life had passed him by. Charlotte was not his
wife. His wife!
"... A dark porch, half hidden by a passion-vine, that drooped"
"sorrowful, mournful, as though it understood. Small, warm arms were"
"round his neck. A face, little and pale, lifted to his, and a voice"
"breathed, “Good-bye, my treasure.”"
"My treasure! “Good-bye, my treasure!” Which of them had spoken? Why had"
they said good-bye? There had been some terrible mistake. _She_ was his
"wife, that little pale girl, and all the rest of his life had been a"
dream.
"Then the door opened, and young Charles, standing in the light, put his"
"hands by his side and shouted like a young soldier, “Dinner is on the"
"table, sir!”"
"“I’m coming, I’m coming,” said old Mr. Neave."
"and Lady Eynesford, and all the rest, but what do I care if I have you"
"and him?"""
"""Me and him, Daisy?"""
"""Yes,"" she answered, smiling boldly. ""He's asked me to marry him--just"
"to show he didn't mind--and I think I will, father. We three against the"
"world! What need we care? Father, we'll beat Sir Robert!"" and she seized"
his two hands and laughed.
In vain Medland tried to tell her what he had come to say. Mighty as his
"relief and joy were, he still felt a burden lay on him. She would not"
hear.
"""Don't you see I'm happy?"" she cried. ""It can't be your duty to make me"
"unhappy. Jack doesn't mind, I don't mind!"" Her voice sank a little and"
"she added, ""It can't hurt mother now. Oh, don't be unhappy about it,"
"dear--don't, don't!"""
"They were standing now, and his arm was about her. Looking up at him,"
"she went on,"
"""They shan't beat us! They shan't say they beat us. We three, father!"""
He stooped and kissed her. There is love that lies beyond the realm of
"giving or taking, of harm or good, of wrong, or even of forgiveness."
"With all his faults, this love he had won from his daughter, and it"
"stood him in stead that night. He drew himself up to his height, and the"
air of despondency fell from him. The girl's brave love braced him to
meet the world again.
"""No, by Jove, we're not beat yet, Daisy!"" he said, and she kissed him"
concert. She had forgotten that Amédée was singing there. Everard was
"going. He would see the name on the programme, “Amédée Bazouge.” There"
could not be two tenors of that name in Europe. Everard must be kept
away at all costs.
"She rushed from the room and down the stairs, in terrible anxiety lest"
"he should have already left the hotel. To her intense relief, she saw"
him sitting in one of the cane chairs in the vestibule smoking his
after-lunch cigar. He threw it away as he caught sight of her at the
"head of the stairs, breathless, and holding the balusters, and went up"
to meet her.
"“My poor child,” said he in an anxious tone. “What is the matter?”"
"“Oh, Everard--I don’t want any more to be left alone. Don’t think me"
silly and cowardly. I am afraid of all kinds of things.”
"“Of course I ’ll come and sit with you a little,” he replied kindly."
They entered her room together. Yvonne lay down. Her head was splitting
with nervous headache. The Canon tended her in his grave way and
"sat down by the window with a book. Yvonne felt very guilty, but yet"
"comforted by his presence. At the end of an hour, he looked at his watch"
and rose from his seat.
“Are you easier now?”
"“You are not going to the Kursaal, Everard?”"
"“I am afraid Emmeline is expecting me.” She signed to him to approach,"
and put her arms round his neck.
"""I suppose so."""
"""And the way I phrased it. I actually said I'd bought the lower right"
"hand drawer and hadn't used it--take me with you, Frank."""
"""Rhoda, I was so wrong in--"""
"""_I_ was wrong, Frank. I was trying to mold you into my way of life. I"
"wanted you, but only as a part of my own eager little world. I had money"
"so I furnished my apartment. I put this here and that there, and hung a"
"toothbrush over the sink as necessarily functional, and then I decided I"
needed a man in the same way and so I picked you.
"""But I found out that the man in the bed was the most important part of"
it and without him there wasn't anything. Without him I didn't want any
of the other. Now ... I want to be a wife. A wife is a person who goes
where her husband goes and lives where he lives and shares what he has.
You don't barter and trade--this for that--give up this part to get
that. You give up everything and yet it isn't like that at all because
"you're really getting everything."""
He took out another cigarette.
"""Oh, Frank, it's all mixed up and I'm going to cry, I think."""
"""It's not mixed up at all,"" he said quietly. He turned to look at her,"
"half frowning, half smiling. ""Now why in the hell couldn't you have"
given me a little notice? Twenty minutes to plane time and I've got to
"get another reservation."""
"""I'm sorry, Frank."""
"trumpet brayed, though a host had scattered in search of a woman's"
face.
"On the seventh day, the trees drew back before Francesco where the"
shimmering waters of the Nera streaked the meads. Peace dwelled there
"and calm eternal, as of the Spirit that heals the throes of men. Rare"
and golden lay the dawn-light on the valleys. The songs of the birds
came glad and multitudinous as in the burgeoning dawn of a glorious
day.
Francesco had halted under a great oak. His head was bare in the
"sun-steeped shadows, his face was the face of one weary with long"
watching under the voiceless stars. Great dread possessed him. He
dared not question his own soul.
"A horn sounded in the woods, wild, clamorous and exultant. It was as"
"the voice of a prophet, clearing the despair of a godless world. Even"
"the trees stood listening. Far below, in the green shadows of the"
"valley, a horseman spurred his steed."
"Francesco's eyes were upon him. Yet he dared not hope, gripped by a"
great fear.
"""I am even as a child,"" he said."
The duke's lips quivered.
"""The dawn breaks,--the night is past. Tidings come to us. Let us ride"
"out!"""
Francesco seemed lost in thought. He bowed his head and looked long
into the valley.
"carefully kept his eyes to this side and to that, as if examining the"
"flowers, but noted all the same that Fiorsen had receded from the window."
Rapid thought told him that the fellow would come back there to see if he
"were gone, and he placed himself before a rose-bush, where, at that"
"reappearance, he could make a sign of recognition.  Sure enough, he came;"
and Winton quietly raising his hand to the salute passed on through the
"drawing-room window.  He went quickly into the hall, listened a second,"
"and opened the dining-room door.  Fiorsen was pacing up and down, pale"
"and restless.  He came to a standstill and stared haggardly at Winton,"
who said:
"""How are you?  Gyp not in?"""
"""No."""
"Something in the sound of that ""No"" touched Winton with a vague--a very"
vague--compunction.  To be left by Gyp!  Then his heart hardened again.
"The fellow was a rotter--he was sure of it, had always been sure."
"""Baby looks well,"" he said."
Fiorsen turned and began to pace up and down again.
"""Where is Gyp?  I want her to come in.  I want her."""
Winton took out his watch.
"""It's not late.""  And suddenly he felt a great aversion for the part he"
"was playing.  To get the baby; to make Gyp safe--yes!  But, somehow, not"
this pretence that he knew nothing about it.  He turned on his heel and
walked out.  It imperilled everything; but he couldn't help it.  He could
not stay and go on prevaricating like this.  Had that woman got clear?
"girl's getting on. She's dependent upon her own labor."" As she spoke"
she spread out the sheet. A sketch dropped to the table.
Trude drew a long breath. She had not known how worried she was. She
wanted to laugh aloud now from sheer relief. Because she had to do
"something she took up the sketch with a murmured: ""May I?"""
"""Laura writes it's a little sketch she made in class. 'This will show"
you I am improving. It's from life. It will give you an idea of the
"delightful types we find around here, types that you will not find"
anywhere else. These are two little vagabonds whom you see almost
anytime on the beach or around the wharves--as wild and free and
"beautiful as the seagulls--'"""
Mrs. White looked up from the letter to take the sketch and exclaimed
aloud at Trude's face. It had gone deathly white.
"""My _dear_, what is it?"""
For a moment Trude could not answer. She was staring at the sketch as
though she could not take her eyes from it.
"""Read that again! These are types--you find these girls any time on the"
"wharves--wild--vagabonds! Oh, Aunt Edith that's--_that's_--_Sidney_!"""
"""Why, it _can't_ be, Trude. You said--"""
"Trude shook her head. ""I can't help what I said. It's Sidney. I--know."
The likeness is true--there can't be anyone else who looks like Sidney!
But she's barefooted--and--and so--_slovenly_--and--_her hair_! She's
"cut her beautiful hair!"""
"house of four stories, three gables in width. The upper stories jutted"
"out; the beams on which they rested were finely carved, the gables"
"were finished off with rich, wooden pinnacles. In each story, the"
"lowest excepted, were three long, low windows of the common Nuremberg"
"type, and the whole had a substantial and reputable air."
"The window at which I had seen Marie was farthest from the door, on"
"the first floor. To go to the door I had to lose sight of it, and"
perhaps for that reason I stood the longer. At last I went and
"knocked, and waited in a fever for some one to come. The street was a"
thoroughfare. There were a number of people passing. I thought that
all the town would go by before a dragging foot at last sounded
"inside, and the great nail-studded door was opened on the chain. A"
"stout, red-faced woman showed herself in the aperture."
'What is it?' she asked.
"'You have a girl in this house, named Marie Wort,' I answered"
"breathlessly. 'I saw her a moment ago at the window. I know her, and I"
wish to speak to her.'
The woman's little eyes dwelt on me stolidly for a space. Then she
made as if she would shut the door. 'For shame!' she said spitefully.
'We have no girls here. Begone with you!'
But I put my foot against the door. 'Whose house is this?' I said.
"'Herr Krapp's,' she answered crustily."
'Is he at home?'
"'No, he is not,' she retorted; 'and if he were, we have no baggages"
"""Ours was a foolish infatuation,"" she answered with an effort.  ""It is"
"best that we should both of us forget."""
"""Forget!""  I cried.  ""But I can never forget you, Yolande.  You are my"
"love.  You are all the world to me."""
"Her eyes were grave, and I saw that tears stood in them."
"""No,"" she protested quietly; ""do not say that.  I cannot be any more to"
"you than other women whom you meet daily.  Besides, I know well that in"
the diplomatic service marriage is a serious drawback to any save an
"ambassador."""
"""When a man is in love as I am with you, dearest, he throws all thoughts"
of his career to the winds; personal interests are naught where true
"love is concerned."""
"""You must not--nay, you shall not--wreck your future on my account,"" she"
"declared in a low, intense voice.  ""It is not just either to yourself or"
"to the Englishwoman who loves you."""
"""Why do you taunt me with that, Yolande?""  I asked reproachfully.  ""I do"
not love her.  I have never truly loved her.  I was lonely after you had
"gone out of my life, and she was amusing,--that was all."""
"""And now you find me equally amusing--eh?"" she remarked, with just a"
touch of bitter sarcasm.
"""Why should you be jealous of her?""  I asked.  ""You might just as well"
"be jealous of Sibyl, Lord Barmouth's daughter."""
"""With the latter you are certainly on terms of most intimate"
the other end of the eyot.
"'I shall sleep,' Steve said drowsily."
"The insects were beginning to hum. The horses stood huddled together,"
swishing their long tails.
'You think they won't track us?' I asked.
"'Certain,' he said. 'There are six hundred yards of mud and water,"
"eel-holes, and willow shoots between us and the road.'"
The Waldgrave assented mechanically; it seemed so to me too. And
"by-and-by, worn out with the night's work, I fell asleep, and slept, I"
"suppose, for a good many hours, with the sun and shade passing slowly"
"across my face, and the bees droning in my ears, and the mellow warmth"
of the summer day soaking into my bones. When I awoke I lay for a time
"revelling in lazy enjoyment. The oily plop of a water-rat, as it dived"
"from a stump, or the scream of a distant jay, alone broke the laden"
silence. I looked at the sun. It lay south-west. It was three o'clock
then.
[Illustration: We were alone.... I whispered in her ear ...]
"A light touch fell on my knee. I started, looked down, and for a"
"moment stared in sleepy wonder. A tiny bunch of blue flowers, such as"
"I could see growing in a dozen places on the edge of the island, lay"
"on it, tied up with a thread of purple silk. I started up on my elbow,"
"and--there, close beside me, with her cheeks full of colour, and the"
"sunshine finding golden threads in her dark hair, sat Marie, toying"
Eva. Where was she?
"He popped erect and surveyed the room. It was traditional Jap anese,"
"the standard four-and-a-half tatami in size, bare and Spartan. A"
classic.
But the music. It seemed to be coming through the walls.
The walls. They all looked to be rice paper. He clambered up and headed
for the fusuma with the double-ax logo. He tested it and realized that
the paper was actually painted steel. And it was locked. The room was
secure as a vault.
"But across, opposite the _tokonoma_, was another set of sliding doors."
"As he turned to walk over, he noticed he was wearing _tabi_, light"
"cotton stockings split at the toe, and he was clad in a blue-patterned"
"_yukata_  robe, cinched at the waist. He'd been stripped and re-"
dressed.
"This door was real, and he shoved it open. A suite of rooms lay beyond,"
"and there on a second futon, still in a drugged sleep, lay Eva. He"
"moved across, bent down, and shook her. She jerked away, her dreaming"
"disrupted, and turned over, but she didn't come out of it."
"""Wake up."" He shook her again. ""The party just got moved. Wait'll you"
"get a load of the decor."""
"""What . . ."" She rolled back and cracked open her bloodshot eyes. Then"
she rose on one elbow and gazed around the room. It was appointed
"identically to his, with only the hanging scroll in the _tokonoma_"
"different, hers being an angular, three-level landscape. ""My God."""
"grunted: ""It's been in two days!"""
By the time they reached the _Arabella_ Sidney's remorse was yielding
"to a spark of indignation. Lav needn't be _quite_ so mad for, after"
"all, it had been his own precious Mr. Dugald who had thrown her and"
Pola so constantly together! And if Lav had not hidden himself away he
most certainly would have been included in all the plans. It was not
fair in Lav to act so cross.
"""I know you came out to read, Lav, and I've some thinking to do, so I'm"
"going up in the bow and leave you quite to yourself,"" Sidney said as"
"they boarded the _Arabella_, and if in her tone there was something of"
"Mart's tartness, it may be forgiven for Sidney had been punished enough."
"""I don't care if you hang 'round,"" Lav conceded. ""It's too hot to read,"
"anyways. I thought maybe there'd be a breeze out here. What's that?"""
For he had suddenly spied an object lying on the deck close to the rail
as though it had dropped there from someone's pocket.
"At almost the same moment Sidney spied it, too. Both darted for it."
Lavender reached it first and picked it up and examined it with
frowning eyes.
"""It's a knife!"" cried Sidney, at his elbow."
"""Sure it's a knife. Anybody can see that. What I want to know--"""
"""Let me look at it. Isn't it Mr. Dugald's?"""
"""No, it isn't Mr. Dugald's. He hasn't been out here for a week. And"
"that knife wasn't here yesterday for I'd a' seen it."""
"""And what did they say, Lav? Oh, tell me quick!"""
"""I could only get scraps of it. I didn't dare look, I didn't dare move."
But one fellow called the other Jed. I heard 'em say something about
'risk' and a 'stranger from Boston asking too many questions 'round
"Rockman's to be healthy,' and Jed Starrow--I'm dead sure it was his"
"voice--said, sort of blustering like, 'Let them search the _Puritan_!"
They won't find anything on her _now_!' And the other fellow answered
"him: 'There's too much in this, Jed, to take any chances.' That's what"
"they said, Sid, and then they went on."""
"""Oh, Lav, they're pirates!"""
"""Well, not exactly pirates, but they're up to _something_ that's sure."
Maybe they're rum-runners. There's a lot of that going on. I thought
"you were crazy, but I guess you weren't."""
Sidney's lips trembled with eagerness. As long as Lavender knew what he
knew she felt that she would be justified in telling him what Cap'n
Davies had told her.
"""It isn't rum--Lav,"" she whispered, ""It's _diamonds_!"""
"""Diamonds! Oh, go on, where did you get that stuff?"""
"""It's diamonds, Lav."" Then Sidney solemnly repeated what the old"
"Captain had told her concerning the letter and the reward. ""He asked me"
"not to tell a soul, but you're different because you know. And he said"
that the reward would be posted everywhere in two weeks at least and
"it's that long now. Everyone will know soon."""
"""Sid, five thousand dollars!"" Lavender whistled."
"""Grapple the days to come!"" he said. ""Let Scripture and ethics rot! My"
"men are at your command! Let them ride by stream and forest, moor and"
"mere! Let them ride in quest of your lost one, ride like the wind!"""
Francesco looked at the duke through a mist of tears.
"""You know?"" he faltered."
"""For this I came!"" replied the duke, extending his hand. ""You will"
find her whom your heart seeks. Like a golden dawn shall she rise out
"of the past. Blow your horn! Let us not tarry!"""
CHAPTER VIII
THE ANCHORESS OF NARNI
Six days had passed. Once more the sun had tossed night from the sky
and kindled hope in the hymning east. The bleak wilderness barriered
by sea and crag had mellowed into the golden silence of the autumnal
woods. The very trees seemed tongued with prophetic flame. The world
leaped radiant out of the dawn.
"Through the reddened woods rode Francesco, the Duke of Spoleto silent"
"by his side. Gloom still reigned on the pale, haggard face and there"
was no lustre in the eyes that challenged ever the lurking shade of
Death. Six nights and six days had the quest been baffled. Near and
far armor glimmered in the reddened sanctuaries of the woods. Not a
"""I'll do anything you say,"" promised Pola. ""I'm so curious that I'm"
"fairly bursting."""
"""I don't care, but you'll have to take off your shoes and stockings,"""
"muttered Lav, scarcely looking at Pola."
"""Oh, I'll do that! I'll do _anything_!"" Pola flopped upon the beach and"
"commenced removing her sport shoes. ""And I won't even ask any questions"
"until you're ready to tell me."" Rising, her small feet pink against the"
"sand, she saluted Lav with mock solemnity."
"""There, Captain Lavender Green, I'm at your command."""
Her pretty acquiescence won the girls at once. If any doubt assailed
"them as to the prudence of letting Pola go, their admiration for Pola's"
gameness stilled it. Sidney rolled Pola's shoes and stockings and her
own in her sweater and hid them behind some logs. Then the little party
waded out to the dory and embarked.
"""We're going to the _Arabella_,"" Sidney whispered to Pola. She felt"
"Pola shiver, but the girl made no protest. ""We have to go 'round this"
"way so's no one can see us from the harbor. Sh--h!"""
"Silently they boarded the old hull, Lavender last. With the line from"
the dory in his hand the boy considered.
"""If anyone comes up and sees the dory they'll know someone's aboard."""
"""That's true. What'll we do?"" whispered Sidney, anxiously."
"""We can set her adrift. It's an old tub anyway."""
"Whereupon, Johnson went over to the window and put his face close to"
hers on the frosted panes; a great sea of white snow met his gaze!
"""This means--"" he said, turning away from the window and meeting her"
"glance--""surely it doesn't mean that I can't leave Cloudy to-night?"""
"""It means you can't get off the mountain to-night,"" calmly answered the"
Girl.
"""Good Lord!"" fell from the man's lips."
"""You can't leave this room to-night,"" went on the Girl, decidedly. ""Why,"
you couldn't find your way three feet from this door--you a stranger!
"You don't know the trail anyway unless you can see it."""
"""But I can't stay here?"" incredulously."
"""Why not? Why, that's all right! The boys'll come up an' dig us out"
"to-morrow or day after. There's plenty o' wood an' you can have my bed."""
"And with no more ado than that, the Girl went over to the bed to remove"
the covers and make it ready for his occupancy.
"""I wouldn't think of taking that,"" protested the man, stoutly, while his"
face clouded over.
The Girl felt a thrill at the note of regard in his voice and hastened
to explain:
"""I never use it cold nights; I always roll up in my rug in front of the"
"fire."" All of a sudden she broke out into a merry little laugh. ""Jest"
"think of it stormin' all this time an' we didn't know it!"""
"someone looking at her, someone different, and someone smiling."
She sat bolt upright and rubbed her eyes. Then she flung out her arms
with a low glad cry that was half sob.
"""Trude--_Oh, Trude!_"""
"Trude held her long and close, stroking the shorn head, murmuring"
soothing words. Finally Sidney wriggled from her.
"""Have you come to take me home? But how could they send for you so"
"quickly? How long have I been asleep? Oh, Lavender--is he--is he--"""
"""One question at a time, Sid. Lavender is better. He'll be all right,"
"the doctor says, after a good rest. Yes, I think I'd better take you"
"home. No, they did not send for me."" Briefly, as though now that"
"earlier concern was of little consequence, Trude told of the sketch"
that had so bewildered and alarmed her.
"""I couldn't understand,"" she finished."
"""I couldn't either, at first. You see the boarder--the man who has"
boarded here so long and is dreadfully fond of Aunt Achsa wrote that
"letter to me and wrote it _nice_ so as to please her, and, at"
"first--but, oh, Trude, Aunt Achsa _is_ wonderful and so is Lavender,"
"really, truly, even though they are poor--"""
"""Hush, Sidney."" Trude's eyes darkened with feeling. ""You do not have to"
"tell me that. I have learned _that_ in only a few hours. Oh, I have"
"seen straight into souls--those kind men on the street, as concerned as"
"though you belonged to them, and here--Aunt Achsa with her great"
courage and her love. And that Miss Vine--they're so _simple_--and so
"""You say that all I must do in the meantime is to sign some papers,"" she"
"interrupted. ""You say you won't ask me to marry you right away. Will you"
"wait--a year?"""
"""A year! I couldn't, Sallie!"" he cried, and her pale lips drooped"
piteously again.
"""How long, then?"" she asked in a whisper. ""Six months?"""
"He had made up his mind to be generous, and he felt that he had not"
"failed in his intention as he answered, ""Three months, and not a day"
"longer, Sallie."""
"She sat still and silent for a while, considering that, and then, ""All"
"right, Jasper,"" she agreed. ""Take me safe home, and I'll marry you three"
months from the day we get there--if we're both alive when the time
"comes."""
He turned away from her for a moment. He had won all he wanted in the
"meantime, and he could scarcely contain himself. When he presently held"
"out a hand to her, she took it, to bind that bargain."
"""And you won't have any cause to regret it, Sallie,"" he assured her, his"
voice somewhat hoarse in spite of his effort to speak quite naturally.
"""So now, as soon as you're ready, we'll all go ashore together, and--"""
"""I'll be ready in twenty minutes,"" she told him, clasping her hands at"
"her heart, her eyes very eager. ""And, Jasper--you must let me take"
"Ambrizette with me."""
"'North,' he whispered."
"After that they were nothing to me, but I went with the rest. Our lair"
"was in some rocks overhanging the road. By the time we looked over,"
"the horsemen were below us, and we could see nothing of them; though"
"the sullen tramp of their horses, and the jingle of bit and spur,"
reached us clearly. Presently they came into sight again on the road
"beyond, riding steadily away with their backs to us."
'That is not General Tzerclas?' my lady muttered anxiously.
'Nor any of his people!' Steve said with an oath.
"That led me to look more closely, and I saw in a moment something that"
lifted me out of my moodiness. I sprang on the rock against which I
was leaning and shouted long and loudly.
"'Himmel!' Steve cried, seizing me by the ankle. 'Are you mad, man?'"
"But I only shouted again, and waved my cap frantically. Then I slipped"
"down, sobered. 'They see us,' I cried. 'They are Leuchtenstein's"
"riders. And Count Hugo is with them. You are safe, my lady.'"
"She turned white and red, and I saw her clutch at the rock to keep"
herself on her feet. 'Are you sure?' she said. The troop had halted
and were wheeling slowly and in perfect order.
"'Quite sure, my lady,' I answered, with a touch of bitterness in my"
tone. Why had not this happened yesterday or the day before? Then my
girl would have been saved. Now it came too late! Too late! No wonder
I felt bitterly about it.
The general shrugged his shoulders and laughed grimly. 'Why not?' he
"said. 'What are waiting-women and the like made for, if not to be"
bribed--or slapped?'
She hated him for that sly hit--if never before; but she controlled
herself. She would throw the burden on him.
"He read the thought, and it led him to change his tone. There was a"
"gloomy fire in his eyes, and smouldering passion in his voice, when he"
spoke again.
"'Well, Countess,' he said, 'I am here for your answer.'"
'To what?'
"'To the question I asked you some time ago,' he rejoined, dwelling on"
her with sullen eyes. 'I asked you to be my wife. Your answer?'
"'Prythee!' she said proudly, 'this is a strange way of wooing.'"
"'It is not of my choice that I woo in company,' he answered, shrugging"
his shoulders. 'My answer; that is all I want--and you.'
"'Then you shall have the first, and not the last,' she exclaimed on a"
"sudden impulse. 'No, no--a hundred times no! If you do not see that by"
"pressing me now,' she continued impetuously, 'when I am alone,"
"friendless, and unprotected, you insult me, you should see it, and I"
do.'
"For a moment there was silence. Then he laughed; but his voice,"
"notwithstanding his mastery over it and in spite of that laugh, shook"
"with rage and resentment. 'As I expected,' he said. 'I knew last night"
"same meaning to her ear: ""You have helped to do this--this is your"
"work."""
"""No help will come,"" Mrs. Carmichael said, shaking her head at the"
"darkness. ""When a whole province rises as this has done, it takes"
"months to organize a sufficient force, and we shan't last out many"
days. I wonder what people in England are saying. How well I can see
"them over their breakfast cups! Oh, dear, I mustn't think of breakfast"
"cups, or I shall lose my nerve."" She laughed under her breath, and"
there was a long silence.
"Presently the door of the bungalow opened, letting in a stream of"
"moonlight. It was closed instantly, and soft footfalls came over the"
boarded floor.
"""Who is it?"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered."
"""I--Lois,"" was the answer. The new-comer crept down by Beatrice's side"
"and leaned her head against the warm shoulder. ""I am so tired,"" she"
"said faintly. ""I have been with Archibald. He has been moaning so. Mr."
"Berry says he is afraid mortification has set in. It is terrible."""
"""Poor little woman!"" Beatrice put her arm about the slender figure and"
"drew her closer. ""Lay your head on my lap and sleep a little. You can"
"do no good just now."""
"""Thank you. I will, if you don't mind. You will wake me if anything"
"happens, won't you?"""
"""Yes, I promise."" It gave Beatrice a sense of comfort to have Lois"
"near her. Very gently she passed her hand over the aching forehead,"
and presently Lois fell into a sleep of absolute exhaustion.
aid. The thought of either was unendurable. I hated him—yet was
dependent on him.
"“To-night I met him, in his empty apartment, alone. I knew that he had"
"what was left of his money with him, that everything was packed up. I"
went prepared. I would not elope. My plan was no less than to make him
pay the balance on the necklace that he had lost—or to murder him.
"“I carried a new pistol in my muff, one which Lynn had just bought. I"
don’t know how I did it. I was desperate.
"“He told me he loved me, that Lynn did not, never had—that Lynn had"
"married me only to show off his wealth and diamonds, to give him a"
social! position—that I was merely a—a piece of property—a dummy.
“He tried to kiss me. It was revolting. I struggled away from him.
"“And in the struggle, the revolver fell from my muff and exploded on"
the floor.
“At once he was aflame with suspicion.
"“‘So—it’s murder you want!’ he shouted. ‘Well, murder it shall be!’"
“I saw death in his eye as he seized my arm. I was defenseless now. The
old passion came over him. Before he killed—he—would have his way with
me.
“I screamed. With a wild effort I twisted away from him.
"“He raised his hand to strike me, I saw his eyes, glassy. Then he sank"
back—fell to the floor—dead of apoplexy—dead of his furious emotions.
all. 'And your gold chain is gone. I believe you have nothing but the
"frock you stand up in. Why, then, should I marry you?'"
"I felt her heart give a great leap under my hand, and a shiver ran"
"through her. But she did not raise her head, and I, who had thought to"
"tease her into looking at me, had to put back her little face till it"
gazed into mine.
'Why?' I said; 'why?'--drawing her closer and closer to me.
Then the colour came into her face like the sunlight itself. 'Because
"you love me,' she whispered, shutting her eyes."
And I did not gainsay her.
CHAPTER XXIV.
MISSING!
"We lay in the osier bed two whole days and a night, during which time"
"two at least of us were not unhappy, in spite of peril and hardship."
"We left it at last, only because our meagre provision gave out, and we"
"must move or starve. We felt far from sure that the danger was over,"
"for Steve, who spent the second day in a thick bush near the road, saw"
"two troops of horse go by; and others, we believed, passed in the"
night. But we had no choice. The neighbourhood was bleak and bare.
"Such small homesteads as existed had been eaten up, and lay abandoned."
"If we had felt inclined to venture out for food, none was to be had."
"of veal, and he’s got a cute little round bald spot on the top of his"
head. And he wants to be dignified and speaks his words impressively.
"Say, Ned,” the boy continued, “I wouldn’t mind having that fellow get"
into some kind of a mixup out here!”
“Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Oh Lord!” cried the voice from the forest.
"“That’s Gilroy, all right enough!” Ned declared. “Why don’t you go down"
"and see what he wants, Jimmie?” he added."
"“Aw, he ain’t talking to me!” cried the boy."
"“Then I presume I’ll have to go,” Ned said, rising from his seat in"
front of the barrier. “Perhaps he’s been stung by a bee.”
"“He didn’t get crippled in his shrieker,” Jimmie suggested."
Ned stepped into the cave and secured an automatic revolver to replace
"the one taken from him at the old mission, and also passed one to"
Jimmie. Then the two hastened into the forest in the direction of the
sounds.
"The call for help continued to come, although the voice of the man came"
hoarser at every call. When the boys finally came close enough to
"distinguish words spoken in low tones, they heard a warning."
“Shoot!” he cried. “There’s a lot of bears under this tree!”
"Although convulsed with laughter, the boys moved more cautiously after"
this. At last they came to the pine from which the voice proceeded.
"There was a rustle in the thicket as they advanced, and they saw a black"
object shambling away.
interpret it.
"Steve rode by me, and his face too was moody. I suppose that we should"
all of us have thanked God the peril was past. But my lady rode in
another part with Count Leuchtenstein and the Waldgrave; and Steve
"yearned, I fancy, for the old days of trouble and equality, when there"
was no one to come between us.
"I saw Count Hugo that night. He sent for me to his quarters at Hesel,"
and told me frankly that he would have let me go back had he thought
good could come of it.
"'But it would have been looking for a needle in a bundle of hay, my"
"friend,' he continued. 'Tzerclas' men would have picked you up, or the"
"peasants killed you for a soldier, and in a month perhaps the girl"
"would have returned safe and sound, to find you dead.'"
"'My lord!' I cried passionately, 'she saved your child. It was to her"
as her own!'
"'I know it,' he answered with gravity, which of itself rebuked me."
'And where is my child?'
I shook my head.
'Yet I do not give up my work and the task God and the times have
"given me, and go out looking for it!' he answered severely. 'Leaving"
"Scot, and Swede, and Pole, and Switzer to divide my country. For"
"shame! You have your work too, and it lies by your lady's side. See to"
"it that you do it. For the rest I have scouts out, who know the"
country; if I learn anything through them you shall hear it. And now
"of another matter. How long has the Waldgrave been like this, my"
“There’s Gilroy’s flock of bears!” Jimmie shouted.
"“And a little bit of a black bear at that,” Ned laughed. “If Gilroy had"
"made an ugly face at him, he’d have run away!”"
The tree into which the fat confidential clerk had climbed was not a
"large one. In fact, it was swaying dangerously under his weight. As he"
"moved his position at sight of the black back of the bear, the slender"
upshoot to which he clung gave way and he came clattering down through
the few lower branches.
“Oh my! oh my! oh my!” he shouted. “I never should have come into this
blasted country! I shall be eaten alive!”
"Instead of rushing to Gilroy’s assistance, his rescuers, boy-like, sat"
down on the mat of pine needles which strewed the ground and roared with
laughter. Gilroy eyed them angrily without attempting to rise to his
feet. His rage only made the scene more amusing.
“Why didn’t you shoot him?” he demanded at length.
“Shoot him?” repeated Jimmie. “That bear is a great deal more frightened
"than you are. At the rate of speed he’s now going, he’ll strike the"
arctic circle at exactly four-fifteen tomorrow morning!”
"“He chased me up the tree,” whined Gilroy. “He nipped at my heels as I"
"left the ground, and I heard his teeth grinding together in the most"
frightful manner. I’ll never get over this!”
“I guess he would have climbed the tree after you in about another
"minute,” Jimmie declared, with a sly wink at Ned. “You see, it’s just"
that did not feel--a happy world!
She had not long to wait before he tapped on the drawing-room window.
She got up from the tea-table to let him in.  Why do faces gazing in
"through glass from darkness always look hungry--searching, appealing for"
what you have and they have not?  And while she was undoing the latch she
thought: 'What am I going to say?  I feel nothing!'  The ardour of his
"gaze, voice, hands seemed to her so false as to be almost comic; even"
more comically false his look of disappointment when she said:
"""Please take care; I'm still brittle!""  Then she sat down again and"
asked:
"""Will you have some tea?"""
"""Tea!  I have you back, and you ask me if I will have tea Gyp!  Do you"
know what I have felt like all this time?  No; you don't know. You know
"nothing of me--do you?"""
A smile of sheer irony formed on her lips--without her knowing it was
there.  She said:
"""Have you had a good time at Count Rosek's?""  And, without her will,"
"against her will, the words slipped out: ""I'm afraid you've missed the"
"music-room!"""
His stare wavered; he began to walk up and down.
"""Missed!  Missed everything!  I have been very miserable, Gyp. You've no"
"idea how miserable.  Yes, miserable, miserable, miserable!""  With each"
"repetition of that word, his voice grew gayer.  And kneeling down in"
"front of her, he stretched his long arms round her till they met behind"
"That added the last straw. She took two steps to the table, and"
"sitting down blindly, covered her face with her hands. Her shoulders"
"began to tremble, her head sank lower and lower on the table. Her"
pride was gone.
'Heaven help us!' she whispered in a passion of grief. 'Heaven help
"us, for there is no help here!'"
"'That is better,' he said, eyeing her coldly. 'We shall soon come to"
terms now.'
In his exultation he went a step nearer to her. He was about to touch
"her--to lay his hand on her hair, believing his evil victory won, when"
suddenly two dark figures rose like shadows behind her chair. He
"recoiled, dropping his hand. In a moment a pistol barrel was thrust"
into his face. He fell back another step.
'One word and you are a dead man!' a stern voice hissed in his ear.
"Then he saw another barrel gleam in the lamplight, and he stood still."
"'What is this?' he said, looking from one to the other, his voice"
trembling with rage.
'Justice!' the same speaker answered harshly. 'But stand still and be
"silent, and you shall have your life. Give the alarm, and you die,"
"general, though we die the next minute. Sit down in that chair.'"
"He hesitated. But the two shining barrels converging on his head, the"
"two grim faces behind them, were convincing; in a moment he obeyed."
"""Mart!"" she cried. ""It's _not_ Jed Starrow! It's--it's--Cap'n Phin"
"Davies! And that means that--_Lav_--_made_--_it_!"" And happy tears ran"
down her cheeks.
Under the skilled guidance of the man at its wheel the _Sally_ soon
came alongside of the _Arabella_. Cap'n Davies promptly boarded the
schooner and the next instant Sidney was in his arms.
"""All I'll say is praise be to God!"" the old mariner muttered. ""And now"
I cal'late you and your mates here are 'bout ready to abandon your
"cruisin'--"""
"""Lav, is he--all right?"" demanded Sidney, still clinging to Cap'n Phin."
"""Well, he jest about made port and how he is now I can't say for I"
didn't waste any time shippin' in the _Sally_. Lucky for us it was
"lyin' there at Rockman's. Give us a hand, Saunders, while we load on"
"this cargo of distress!"" A roughness in the old man's voice betrayed"
that the big heart was not as light as he would have the girls think.
For hours they had searched the bay with only their knowledge of tides
and winds to guide them; more than once the others had been ready to
"abandon the search as futile, but the Captain had held them stubbornly"
to it.
Pola needed no urging but leaped into the _Sally_ and sank to its
bottom with a long gasp of relief. Sidney and Mart were about to follow
her example when a word from Cap'n Davies held Sidney.
"""We'll let a government boat pick up the _Arabella_. We'll take no"
"chances tryin' to tow her in with the _Sally_."" And then Sidney thought"
of the treasure.
"""Ha, ha, ha, ha!"" laughed the other sprout."
"Yes, truly, they had acquired dashing ways among their sporting"
acquaintances.
"It rained for three weeks; then came two fine days, and then rain again"
"for a fortnight. The sun was not to be seen, the sky was invisible, the"
mountain tops had disappeared; we saw nothing but rain. The roofs at the
Tore Peak resort began to leak more and more.
"The hay that still lay spread on the ground was black and rotting, and the"
stacks had gone moldy.
The cotters had got their hay indoors during the patient spell. They had
"carried it, man, woman, and child, on their backs."
The men from Bergen and Mrs. Brede with her children have left for home.
The little girls curtsied and thanked me for taking them walking in the
hills and telling them stories. The house is empty now. Associate Master
"Höy and Mrs. Molie were the last to go; they left last week, traveling"
"separately, though both were going to the same small town."
He went by way of the village--a very roundabout route--while she crossed
"the field. It is very quiet now, but Miss Torsen is still here."
Why do I not leave? Don't know. Why ask? I'm here. Have you ever heard
"anyone ask: ""How much is a northern light?"" Hold your tongue."
Where should I go if I did leave? Do you imagine I want to go to the town
"again? Or do you think I'm longing for my old hut and the winter, and"
Madame? I'm not longing for any specific place; I am simply longing.
"""Oh, well...."" she said. ""No, let's not tonight,"" she added suddenly;"
"""some other time. Yes? In a few days? We'll talk about it tomorrow. Good"
"night."""
"For the first time it struck me: she wants to rouse you, too, settled man"
though you are; she wants to make you as mad as the others! That's what
she's after!
"And now I remember, before the lawyer arrived, when there was Tradesman"
"Batt--I remember how during his first few days here, she would give me a"
"kind word or a look that was quite out of the picture, and as unmistakable"
"as her pride would permit. No, she had no objections to seeing old age"
wriggle. And listen to this: before this she had been intent to show a
"well-behaved indifference to sex, but that was finished; was she not at"
"this moment resisting only faintly, and raising definite hopes? ""Not"
"tonight, but some other time,"" she had said. Yes, a half-refusal, a mere"
"postponement, that I was meant to hear. She was corrupt, but she was also"
"cunning, with the cunning of a madman. So corrupt."
"Dear child, Pharaoh laughs before his pyramids; standing before his"
"pyramids he laughs. He would laugh at me, too."

Next day we three remaining guests were sitting in the living room. The
lady and the actor read one book; I read another.
"""Will you,"" she says to him, ""do me a great favor?"""
"""With pleasure."""
"We went down into the road on foot, a little party of nine--four women"
"and five men. The horsemen, as they came up, looked at us in wonder."
"Our clothes, even my lady's, were dyed with mud and torn in a score of"
"places. We had not washed for days, and our faces were lean with"
famine. Some of the women were shoeless and had their hair about their
"ears, while Steve was bare-headed and bare-armed, and looked so huge a"
ruffian the stocks must have yawned for him anywhere. They drew up and
"gazed at us, and then Count Hugo came riding down the column and saw"
us.
"My lady went forward a step. 'Count Leuchtenstein,' she said, her"
"voice breaking; she had only seen him once, and then under the mask of"
"a plain name. But he was safety, honour, life now, and I think that"
she could have kissed him. I think for a little she could have fallen
into his arms.
"'Countess!' he said, as he sprang from his horse in wonder. 'Is it"
really you? Gott im Himmel! These are strange times. Waldgrave! Your
pardon. Ach! Have you come on foot?'
"'Not I. But these brave men have,' my lady answered, tears in her"
voice.
He looked at Steve and grunted. Then he looked at me and his eyes
lightened. 'Are these all your party?' he said hurriedly.
"'All,' my lady answered in a low voice. He did not ask farther, but he"
"sighed, and I knew that he had looked for his child. 'I came north"
"upon a reconnaissance, and was about to turn,' he said. 'I am thankful"
that I did not turn before. Is Tzerclas in pursuit of you?'
"""I don't know, dearie. He used to take to spells like that when he was"
little. But lately he's got over them. I followed him once and I found
him out in the sand dunes lying flat on his face cryin' awful--out loud
and beatin' his arms. I let him be. I stole home and I never let on I
knew. When he came back all white lookin' I had a nice cake ready--roll
"jell, his favorite."""
"""Do--do you think he was out in the sand dunes--last night?"""
"""I don't know. He come in about nine o'clock, awful quiet and I didn't"
"ask him anything, but I just set his breakfast before him as though the"
morning wa'n't half over. And then he went off again and I ain't seen
"him sense. I thought mebbe it was these folks of Mr. Dugald's--"""
"""What do you mean, Aunt Achsa?"" But Sidney knew what she meant."
"""Like as not Lav's plain jealous. Mr. Dugald hasn't had any time for"
anything but toting this Pola round everywhere and Lav notices it. He
hasn't any right to be jealous as I can see for Miss Pola is Mr.
"Dugald's own cousin, but Lav thinks the sun rises and sets in Mr."
"Dugald. And like as not he misses you--"""
"""I've missed Lav dreadfully. I didn't know how much I missed him and"
Mart until today when it came over me suddenly that the things I was
doing with Pola weren't really much fun--just at first they were
"because they were different. I'm afraid, Aunt Achsa, that I love"
different things! But tomorrow I am going to play all day long with Lav
"and Mart, see if I don't. I can't wait for tomorrow to come!"""

"out Dex. ""I'll see 'em in hell before I'll talk!"""
"""And me,"" nodded Brand. ""But that doesn't cure the situation. As long"
"as ships disappear in this red inferno, so long will the Old Man keep"
sending others to find out what's wrong. The Rogans will capture them
as easily as they captured us. And eventually someone will happen
"along who'll weaken under torture. Then--"""
*       *       *       *       *
He stopped. A dread vision filled his mind of Earth depopulated by the
"feebly ferocious Rogans, of rank on rank of Earth's vast armies"
falling in stricken rows at the shock of the Rogans' tubes.
"Greca caught the vision. She nodded. ""Yes, that is what would happen"
"if they found ways of reaching your globe."""
"""But, God, Brand, we can't allow that!"" cried Dex. ""We've got to find"
"a way to spike the guns of these walking gas-pipes, somehow!"""
"Brand sighed heavily. ""We are two against hundreds of thousands. We"
"are bare-handed, and the Rogans have those damned tubes. Anyway, we"
are on the verge of death at this very moment. What under heaven can
"we do to spike their guns?"""
He was silent a moment: and in the silence the steady hum from the
domed building outside came to his ears.
"""What's in that big, round topped building, Greca?"" he asked quietly."
"""I do not know, exactly,"" replied the girl. ""There is some sort of"
"mother used to, and lifted her eyes... Oh, _madam_!"
"When Harry came I had his letters all ready, and the ring and a ducky"
"little brooch he’d given me—a silver bird it was, with a chain in its"
"beak, and on the end of the chain a heart with a dagger. Quite the"
thing! I opened the door to him. I never gave him time for a word.
"“There you are,” I said. “Take them all back,” I said, “it’s all over."
"I’m not going to marry you,” I said, “I can’t leave my lady.” White! he"
"turned as white as a woman. I had to slam the door, and there I stood,"
"all of a tremble, till I knew he had gone. When I opened the"
"door—believe me or not, madam—that man _was_ gone! I ran out into the"
"road just as I was, in my apron and my house-shoes, and there I stayed"
in the middle of the road... staring. People must have laughed if they
saw me....
... Goodness gracious!—What’s that? It’s the clock striking! And here
"I’ve been keeping you awake. Oh, madam, you ought to have stopped"
"me.... Can I tuck in your feet? I always tuck in my lady’s feet, every"
"night, just the same. And she says, “Good night, Ellen. Sleep sound and"
"wake early!” I don’t know what I should do if she didn’t say that, now."
"... Oh dear, I sometimes think... whatever should I do if anything were"
"to.... But, there, thinking’s no good to anyone—is it, madam? Thinking"
won’t help. Not that I do it often. And if ever I do I pull myself up
"sharp, “Now, then, Ellen. At it again—you silly girl! If you can’t find"
anything better to do than to start thinking!...”
"""If someone 'round here's doing it Cap'n Davies wants to catch him"
himself. He says he doesn't want the reward but he wants to punish the
man who's hurting the honest name of this part of Cape Cod. I think
"that's a grand spirit."""
Lavender's shoulders lifted. Why couldn't someone else save the fair
name of Cape Cod--someone like a crippled boy whom most of the
towns-people looked upon as a loafer?
"""I'd like to catch 'em, myself,"" he said slowly in such a low voice"
that Sidney barely caught the words.
"""Oh, Lav, why not? We have as good a chance as anyone, knowing as much"
"as we do. What'll we do first?"" For Sidney was ready for adventure."
Suddenly Lavender realized that he was gripping the knife in his hand.
He looked down at it.
"""What we ought to do first is to find out how this knife got here."
Let's put it where we found it and go back around the other side of
that schooner so's no one on the _Puritan_'ll see us. Then we can come
"out late this afternoon and if it's gone--well, we'll know someone came"
"to look for it!"""
"""And then we'd know for sure that someone had been on the _Arabella_."""
"""That's the idea. You get on quickly for a girl, Sid. Come on, now,"
"we'll pull the dory round to the starboard side."""
Sidney caught herself tiptoeing across the deck of the_ Arabella_. In
"her excitement she scarcely breathed. Every move, every act, was"
"your employ."""
"""What!"""
"""I hear you have bought them."""
"""Do you mean to insinuate--"""
"""I don't mean to insinuate anything. Listen! We are where we can talk"
"plainly, Marsh, and I am tired of all this subterfuge. You did what you"
"could to stop me, you even tried to have me killed--"""
"""You dare to--"""
"""But I guess it never occurred to you that I may be just as desperate"
"as you are."""
"The men stared at each other with hostile eyes, but the accusation had"
come so suddenly and with such boldness as to rob Marsh of words.
"Emerson went on in the same level voice: ""I broke through in spite of"
"you, and I'm on the job. If you want to cry quits, I'm willing; but, by"
"God! I won't be balked, and if any of your hired marshals try to take"
"me before I put up my catch I'll put you away. Understand?"""
Willis Marsh recoiled involuntarily before the sudden ferocity that
"blazed up in the speaker's face. ""You are insane,"" he cried."
"""Am I?"" Emerson laughed, harshly. ""Well, I'm just crazy enough to do"
what I say. I don't think you're the kind that wants hand-to-hand
"trouble, so let's each attend to his own affair. I'm doing well, thank"
"you, and I think I can get along better if yon don't come back here"
"until I send for you. Something might fall on you."""
"satellites."""
"""Their vessels are crude, clumsy things. The journey from the nearest"
satellite is the limit of their flying range. They have nothing like

"She gazed sorrowfully at them and went on: ""You see, yours is the"
fourth space ship to visit their kingdom; and that makes them fearful
because it shows they are vulnerable to invasion. They want to stop
"that by invading your planet first. Besides their fear, there is their"
greed. Their looking-tubes reveal that yours is a fruitful and lovely
"sphere, and they are insatiable in their lust for new territories."
"Thus they plan to go to your planet as soon as they are able, and kill"
or enslave all the people there as they have killed and enslaved my
"race."""
"""They'll have a job on their hands trying to do that!"" declared Dex"
stoutly.
"But Brand paled. ""They can do it!"" he snapped. ""Look at those"
"death-tubes of theirs. We have no arms to compete with that."" He"
"turned to Greca. ""So the Rogans plan to force the secret of our motors"
"from us by torture?"""
"She nodded, and caught his hand in hers."
"""Yes. They will do with you as they did with the six who came before"
"you--and who died before surrendering the secret."""
'What is it?' I asked without curiosity.
"'A little boy gave it to me at the door,' he answered. 'I was to ask"
you to be in the street opposite Herr Krapp's half an hour after
sunset this evening.'
I gasped. 'Herr Krapp's!' I exclaimed.
"Steve nodded, looking at me queerly. 'Yes; do you know him?' he said."
"'I do now,' I muttered, gulping down my amazement. But my face was as"
"red as fire, the blood drummed in my ears. I had to turn away to hide"
my emotion. 'What was the boy like?' I asked.
But it seemed that the lad had made off the moment he had done his
"errand, and Steve had not noticed him particularly. 'I called after"
"him to know who sent him,' he added, 'but he had gone too far.'"
"I nodded and mumbled something, and went on into the house. Perhaps I"
"was still a little sore on my girl's account, and resented the easy"
"way in which she had dropped out of others' lives. At any rate, my"
"instinct was to keep the thing to myself. The face at the window, and"
"then this strange assignation, could have only one meaning; but, good"
"or bad, it was for me. And I hugged myself on it, and said nothing"
even to my lady.
"The day seemed long, but at length the evening came, and when the"
"men had gone to drill and the house was quiet, I slipped out. The"
streets were full at this hour of men passing to and fro to their
"drill-stations, and of women who had been out to see the camp, and"
were returning before the gates closed. The bells of many of the
"""Give it here,"" one of the men asked. And as Si handed over the"
contraband it slipped from his hands. He caught at it quickly to save
it from the dirt of the floor. Suddenly something small and gleaming
fell from the folds and rolled upon the floor.
"""I'll be ding-blasted!"" roared Cap'n Phin. Someone swore softly. The"
man Si dropped to his knees. Sidney blinked.
Cap'n Phin seized the silk and unwound it. And among the countless
folds he found a cunningly contrived pocket filled with hundreds of the
priceless gems.
"For a moment no one spoke. The daring of it all, the wealth of the"
"glistening jewels, held each man in the room. Cap'n Phin folded the"
gorgeous silk and passed it to one of the men.
"""I guess this belongs to you in trust for Uncle Sam,"" he said gravely."
"""Our business is with one Jed Starrow."" He turned to Sidney who was"
"trembling violently. ""Now, matie, will you tell these men how you"
"happened to ship aboard the _Arabella_ last night?"""
"Sidney's story tumbled out in quick, eager words and in careful detail."
"The men listened closely. The one who had taken the diamonds ""in trust"
"for Uncle Sam"" made notes in a small black book. When she had finished"
"Cap'n Phin nodded, his face serious."
"""Reckon we'd better not question Lav Green just yet, he's pullin' out"
of the fog. We got enough as 'tis to hold Jed Starrow. If I ain't much
mistaken he'll turn yellow when we face him and squeal on the folks
higher up what's paid him to hurt the name of the Cape. That'll do for

"pointed, scriggly hand, ""To my little friend.--E. H.""  Fiorsen drew smoke"
"deep down into his lungs, expelled it slowly, and went to the piano.  He"
"opened it and began to play, staring vacantly before him, the cigarette"
"burned nearly to his lips.  He went on, scarcely knowing what he played."
"At last he stopped, and sat dejected.  A great artist?  Often, nowadays,"
he did not care if he never touched a violin again.  Tired of standing up
"before a sea of dull faces, seeing the blockheads knock their silly hands"
"one against the other!  Sick of the sameness of it all! Besides--besides,"
were his powers beginning to fail?  What was happening to him of late?
"He got up, went into the dining-room, and drank some brandy.  Gyp could"
"not bear his drinking.  Well, she shouldn't be out so much--taking"
music-lessons.  Music-lessons!  Nearly three o'clock.  If he went for
"once and saw what she really did--Went, and offered her his escort home!"
"An attention.  It might please her.  Better, anyway, than waiting here"
until she chose to come in with her face all closed up.  He drank a
little more brandy--ever so little--took his hat and went.  Not far to
"walk, but the sun was hot, and he reached the house feeling rather dizzy."
A maid-servant opened the door to him.
"""I am Mr. Fiorsen.  Mrs. Fiorsen here?"""
"""Yes, sir; will you wait?"""
Why did she look at him like that?  Ugly girl!  How hateful ugly people
"were!  When she was gone, he reopened the door of the waiting-room, and"
listened.
Chopin!  The polonaise in A flat.  Good!  Could that be Gyp?  Very good!
"He moved out, down the passage, drawn on by her playing, and softly"
turned the handle.  The music stopped.  He went in.
"As De Grammont was leaving my closet, he paused at the door, and, after a"
"moment's hesitancy, whispered:--"
"""You may expect a letter from France soon. It will come from M. l'Abbé du"
"Boise, who I hope will come soon to London on the business of my king."
"You know him not--M. l'Abbé?"" The eyebrows lifted questioningly. ""No? You"
"soon will know him, yet you will not know him. You and perhaps a lady may"
"help him in his mission. I, too, shall help him, but I, too, know him"
"not. Yet I know him. If he succeed in his mission, he will be rich, he"
"will be powerful. And I? Mon Dieu, my friend! If he succeed, my decree of"
banishment from Paris--it will be to revoke. I may return once more to
bask in the smile of my king. You must not speak; the lady must not
"speak; I must not speak when Monsieur l'Abbé comes, nor before. It is to"
"silence. Stone walls have one ear."""
"""Two, sometimes, count,"" I suggested, laughing."
"""Yes, I should have said one ears! Non, non! I forget this damnable"
"tongue of yours! When I arrive to great interest, it is to talk faster"
"than it is to think, and--"" A shrug of the shoulders finished the"
sentence.
"""Let us speak French hereafter, my dear count,"" I suggested."
"""Mon Dieu, mon Dieu! It is to me more of pain to hear my sweet language"
"murdered than to murder yours,"" answered Grammont, seriously."
"""Ah, but I speak French quite as well as I speak English. Perhaps I shall"
"not murder it,"" I replied."
"""Perhaps? We shall try,"" he said, though with little show of faith."
Travers nodded.
"""I heard you talking, but I wanted to make sure. It has all been my"
fault--every bit of it. It's decent of you not to make me feel it
"more. You are not to blame--her. You know I tempted her, I made her"
"help me. She isn't responsible. At any rate, she made a clean breast"
of it--that's something to her credit. I didn't want to--I never meant
to. I am not the sort that repents. But this last week you have been
"so decent, and Lois such a plucky little soul--she ought to hate"
"me--and perhaps she does--but she has done her best. Nicholson, are"
you listening? Can you hear what I say? It's so damned hard for me to
"talk."""
"""I can hear,"" Nicholson said kindly. ""Don't worry about what can't be"
"helped."" In spite of everything, he pitied the man, and his tone"
showed it.
"Travers lifted himself higher, clinging to the other's shoulder. His"
"voice began to come in rough, uneven jerks."
"""But it can be helped--it must be helped! Don't you see--I came"
between you and Lois purposely. From the first moment you spoke of her
I knew that you loved her--and I wanted her. I never gave your
message. I didn't dare. You are the sort of man a woman cares for--a
"woman like Lois. I couldn't risk it. But now--well, I'm done, and"
"afterward she will be free--"""
Nicholson drew back stiffly.
"""You are talking nonsense,"" he said, in a colder tone. ""No one wants"
"you to die--and in any case, you know very well we have no chance of"
"getting through this alive."""
dance-contracts.
"Next morning, she found Mr. Wagge with a tall, crape-banded hat in his"
"black-gloved hands, standing in the very centre of her drawing-room.  He"
"was staring into the garden, as if he had been vouchsafed a vision of"
that warm night when the moonlight shed its ghostly glamour on the
"sunflowers, and his daughter had danced out there. She had a perfect view"
"of his thick red neck in its turndown collar, crossed by a black bow over"
"a shiny white shirt.  And, holding out her hand, she said:"
"""How do you do, Mr. Wagge?  It was kind of you to come."""
Mr. Wagge turned.  His pug face wore a downcast expression.
"""I hope I see you well, ma'am.  Pretty place you 'ave 'ere.  I'm fond of"
"flowers myself.  They've always been my 'obby."""
"""They're a great comfort in London, aren't they?"""
"""Ye-es; I should think you might grow the dahlia here.""  And having thus"
"obeyed the obscure instincts of savoir faire, satisfied some obscurer"
"desire to flatter, he went on: ""My girl showed me your letter.  I didn't"
like to write; in such a delicate matter I'd rather be vivey vocey.  Very
"kind, in your position; I'm sure I appreciate it.  I always try to do the"
Christian thing myself. Flesh passes; you never know when you may have to
"take your turn. I said to my girl I'd come and see you."""
"""I'm very glad.  I hoped perhaps you would."""
"Mr. Wagge cleared his throat, and went on, in a hoarser voice:"
"""I don't want to say anything harsh about a certain party in your"
every moment was precious.
"'Bring nothing but cloaks and food and wine,' I said. 'We have to go a"
league on foot and can carry little.'
"The Countess heard my words, and looked at me with growing"
comprehension. 'The Waldgrave?' she muttered. 'Is he here?'
"He came forward from the door to speak to her; but when she saw him,"
"and how pale and thin he was, with great hollows in his cheeks and his"
"eyes grown too large for his face, she began to cry weakly, as any"
"other woman might have cried, being overwrought. I bade Marie, who"
"alone kept her wits, to bring her wine and make her take it; and in a"
"minute she smiled at us, and would have thanked us."
"'Wait!' I said bluntly, feeling a great horror upon me whenever I"
looked towards the general or caught his eye. 'You may have small
"cause to thank us. If we fail, Heaven and you forgive us, my lady, for"
this man will not. If we are retaken----'
'We will not be retaken!' she cried hardily. 'You have horses?'
"'Five only,' I answered. 'They are all Steve could get, and they are a"
"league away. We must go to them on foot. There are eight of us here,"
and young Jacob and Ernst are watching outside. Are all ready?'
"My lady looked round; her eye fell on Fraulein Max, who with a little"
bundle in her arms had just re-entered and stood shivering by the
"door. The Dutch girl winced under her glance, and dropping her bundle,"
stooped hurriedly to pick it up.
'That woman does not go!' the Countess said suddenly.
"""We are all here,"" she answered. ""None of us has fled. Did you not"
"know that?"""
He looked about him. A flash of scorn rekindled in his somber eyes.
"""You are alone. Have they deserted you?"""
"""They do not know that I am here. I crept back of my own free will--to"
"speak with you, Nehal."""
"Both hands clasped upon his sword-hilt, erect, a proud figure of"
"misfortune, he stood there and studied her, half-wonderingly,"
half-contemptuously. The restless forces at his back were forgotten.
They were no more to him than the pawns with which his will played
life and death. He was their god and their faith. They waited for his
word to sweep out of his path the white-faced Englishwoman who held
him checked in the full course of his victory. But he did not speak to
"them, but to her, in a low voice in which scorn still trembled."
"""You are here, no doubt, to intercede for those others--or for"
"yourself. You see, I have learned something in these two years. It is"
"useless. No one can stop me now."""
"""No one?"""
"He smiled, and for the first time she saw a sneer disfigure his lips."
"""Not even you, Miss Cary. You have done a great deal with me--enough"
perhaps to justify your wildest hopes--but you have touched the limits
of your powers and of my gullibility. Or did you think there were no
"limits?"""
The Uzi. The goddam Uzi. Why hadn't they brought it?
"It was still back in Kensington, where they'd stashed it in the false"
bottom of a new suitcase. But if the _Mino-gumi_ had been searching
"only for a computer, maybe they'd missed it. So Tanzan Mino's hoods"
could still be in for a surprise. Just make an excuse to go back.
"Vera was aware an Uzi had been part of their deal for the limo, but"
"maybe that fact had momentarily slipped her mind, what with all the"
important things she had to think about. Or maybe she'd assumed Alex
"had kept it, or maybe she thought it was still in the car. Whatever she"
"thought, things were moving too fast now."
"""I get the picture,"" he said, rising from his chair. With a"
"carefully feigned nonchalance, he strolled over to the table. ""Guess"
"it's time we got our toothbrushes."""
"""You won't have to bother, Mr. Vance,"" Vera continued. ""Your suitcases"
were sent to the plane an hour ago. We found them conveniently packed.
"Don't worry. Everything has already been taken care of."""
"Okay, scratch the Uzi. Looks like it's now or never. Settle it here."
"He shot a glance at Eva, then at Ken, trying to signal them. They"
"caught it, and they knew. She began strolling in the direction of Vera,"
"who was now standing in the doorway, as though readying to depart."
"""We appreciate the snappy service,"" Vance said. He looked down at the"
"computer, then bent over. When he came up, it was in his right hand,"
"sailing in an arc. He brought it around with all his might, aimed for"
"the nearest Japanese _kobun_. He was on target, catching the man"
"door. Stripped down for action, they were quickly and professionally"
"tallying the certificates, one handling the open cashiers checks and"
the other the bearer bonds.
"Guess they intend to keep a close eye on the details, Vance thought."
"Well, screw them. We've still got the protocol. We've got some leverage"
left.
But he was having trouble focusing on the future. He was still in shock
from the sight of Novosty being gunned down in cold blood. Alex's
"abrupt death was a tragic end to an exceptional, if sometimes dubious,"
career. He'd really wanted Novosty to make this one last score. The man
"deserved it. He was an operator who lived at the edge, and Vance had"
"always admired players who put everything on the table, no matter which"
side.
"Well, he told himself, the scenario had come close, damned close. But"
maybe it was doomed from the start. You only get so many chances to
"tempt the fates. Today everybody's number came up, Alex's for the last"
time.
"Rest in peace, Aleksei Ilyich."
"Then Vera turned back to them. ""Now, I want the computer. We know it"
"was moved to the house in Kensington, but our search this morning did"
"not locate it."""
"So they were on to us from the start, Vance realized."
"""Looks like you've got a problem."" He strolled over and plopped down in"
"one of the straight-backed chairs along the opposite wall. ""Too bad."""
"“I want to talk to you, Wallie,” said he."
"“Have a drink? No? I sha' n't want anything, Perkins,” said he to"
the waiting dresser. “Call me when I 'm on in the second act. I don't
"change,” he explained."
"“I know,” said John. “That 's why I 've come now.”"
"“What's the matter?” Herold asked, sitting in the chair before the"
"dressing-table, bright with mirrors and electric lights and sticks of"
grease paint and silver-topped pots and other paraphernalia.
"“Nothing particular. Only hell, just as usual. I saw that child to-day.”"
Herold lit a cigarette.
“Have you ever speculated on what becomes of the victims in cases of
this kind?” asked John.
"“Not particularly,” said Herold, seeing that John wanted to talk."
“What do you think can become of a human creature in the circumstances
of this poor little wretch? Her childhood is one vista of bleak
"ugliness. Never a toy, never a kiss, not even the freedom of the gutter."
"Unless you 've been there, you can't conceive the soul-crushing despair"
of that infernal orphanage. She leaves it and goes into the world.
She goes out of a kind of dreary Greek hades into a Christian hell. It
"lasted for months. She was too ignorant and spiritless to complain, and"
"to whom was she to complain? Now she's sent back again, just like a sick"
"animal, to hades. Fancy, they would n't let her have a few flowers in'"
"the room! It makes me mad to think of it. And when she gets well again,"
obstinately.
"'Wait,' he said; 'I will ask.'"
But when the old housekeeper came she had only the same tale to tell.
She was alone. No young woman had crossed the threshold for a week
"past. There was no other woman there, young or old."
'You will have it that I have a young man in the house next!' she
"grumbled, shooting scorn at me."
"'I can assure you that there is no one here,' Herr Krapp said civilly."
"'Dorcas has been with me many years, and I can trust her. Still if you"
like you can walk through the rooms.'
"But I hesitated to do that. The man's manner evidenced his sincerity,"
"and in face of it my belief wavered. Fancy, I began to think, had"
played me a trick. It was no great wonder if the features which were
"often before me in my dreams, and sometimes painted themselves on the"
"darkness while I lay wakeful, had for once taken shape in the"
"daylight, and so vividly as to deceive me. I apologised. I said what"
"was proper, and, with a heavy sigh, went from the door."
"Ay, and with bent head. The passing crowd and the sunshine and the"
distant music of drum and trumpet grated on me. For there was yet
another explanation. And I feared that Marie was dead.
I was still brooding sadly over the matter when I reached home. Steve
"met me at the door, but, feeling in no mood for small talk just then,"
"I would have passed him by and gone in, if he had not stopped me."
"'I have a message for you, lieutenant,' he said."
"not a day over forty?"""
"""I have given up wondering where the real Dawson ends and where the"
disguises begin. The man I met up north wasn't the least bit like the
"one down here."""
"""A deal younger, I expect,"" said the chief assistant, grinning. ""He"
shifts about between thirty and sixty. The old man is no end of a
"cure, and tries to take us in the same as he does you. There's an"
"inspector at the Yard who was at school with him down Hampshire way,"
"and ought to know what he is really like, but even he has given Dawson"
up. He says that the old man does not know his own self in the
"looking-glass; and as for Mrs. Dawson, I expect she has to take any"
"one who comes along claiming to be her husband, for she can't,"
"possibly tell t'other from which."""
"""One might make a good story out of that,"" I observed to Cary."
"""I don't understand,"" said he. ""Mr. Dawson told me once that I knew"
"the real Dawson, but that few other people did."""
"""If he told you that,"" calmly observed the assistant, ""you may bet"
"your last shirt he was humbugging you. He couldn't tell the truth, not"
"if he tried ever so."""
"""What is he at now?"" I asked."
"""I don't know, sir. And if he told me, I shouldn't believe him. I"
don't take no account of a word that man says. But he's the most
successful detective we've got in the whole Force. He's sure to be
"head of the C.I.D. one day, and then he will have to stay in his"
"office and give us others a chance."""

repaid me by bein' unable to see an 'ole in a ladder; and I've

"hambassador.  No, Simcox, never more!  No, Lampert, never, never"
"more!  I just speaks to that French crowd, and they are civil and"
drink fair.  They recognised they'd met their match.  Their skipper
"says, says he, 'Captain Jones, I owns fair and square I'm not your"

"And the ""old man"" rolled cheerfully for his cabin."
"""By my lone I done it!"" said the Guffin."

"She flipped down the computer's screen, then turned back."
"""Unfortunately nothing is ever that simple. I'm sorry to have to tell"
"you two that we haven't seen the last of each other."" She paused, then"
"continued. ""In fact, we are about to become much better acquainted."""
"""What do you mean?"""
"""You once told me, back when we met on the plane from Athens, you would"
welcome that. You should be happy that your wish is now about to be
"granted. You both are going to be our guests."""
"""That's kind of you."" He stared at her, startled. ""But we can probably"
"bear up to the separation."""
"""No, I must insist. You were right about the difficulties. Your death"
"now would be awkward, for a number of reasons. Alex will be trouble"
"enough to explain, but that is purely an internal Soviet matter. Moscow"
"Narodny can cover it. However, eliminating you two would raise awkward"
"inquiries. On the other hand, you represent a security risk to the"
"project. Consequently we have no option. Surely you understand."""
He understood all too well. This was the one turn he hadn't figured on.
Almost eight years. It had been that long ago. But what had Ken said?
The Tokyo _oyabun _never forgot. What this really meant was that Tanzan
Mino wanted to settle the score first hand. What did he have planned?
Vance had a sudden feeling he didn't want to know. It was going to be a
zero-sum game. Everything on the table and winner take all.
"""Oh, yes, a scratch. I hardly feel it. It isn't anything. It can't be"
"anything. There's nothing vital thereabouts, is there, Berry?"""
The missionary shrugged his shoulders. He had flung open the glass
"doors which led on to the verandah, and the brightening dawn flooded"
in upon them.
"""Come and help me carry this poor lady,"" he said. ""We have not a"
"minute to lose."""
"Travers tried to obey, but he had no strength, and the other thrust"
him impatiently on one side.
"""Mrs. Carmichael, you are a strong woman,"" he appealed. Between them"
"they managed to bring Mrs. Cary's heavy, unconscious frame down the"
"steps. It was a nerve-trying task, for their progress was of necessity"
"a slow one, and the sound of the desperate fighting seemed to surround"
them on every side. It was with a feeling of intense relief that the
little party saw Nicholson appear from amidst the trees and run toward
them.
"""That's right!"" he cried. ""Only be quick! They are at us on all sides"
"now, but my men are keeping them off until you are out of the"
bungalow. The old ruin at the back of the garden is our last stand.
"Carmichael is there already with a detachment, and is keeping off a"
"rear attack. I shall remain here."""
"""Alone?"" Berry asked anxiously."
"""Yes. I believe they will ransack the bungalow first. When they come,"
"the Rajah is sure to be at their head, and--well, it's going to be"

"""Speak to me from the Bible.  There are no such men there."""
"Then the teacher began criticising the Bible.  The old man listened,"
and interrupted him after a long while.
"""Stop ...  Wait!  That means that among people known to God there are"
no Russians?  We are not known to God?  Is it so?  God knew all those
"who are mentioned in the Bible ... He destroyed them by sword and fire,"
He destroyed their cities; but He also sent prophets to teach them.
That means that He also pitied them.  He scattered the Jews and the
"Tartars ...  But what about us?  Why have we prophets no longer?"""
"""Well, I don't know!"" replied the teacher, trying to understand the old"
"man.  But the latter put his hand on the teacher's shoulder, and slowly"
"pushed him backwards and forwards, and his throat made a noise as if he"
were swallowing something....
"""Tell me!  You speak so much ... as if you knew everything.  It makes"
me sick to listen to you ... you darken my soul....  I should be better
"pleased if you were silent.  Who are we, eh? Why have we no prophets?"
"Ha, ha! ...  Where were we when Christ walked on this earth?  Do you"
"see?  And you too, you are lying....  Do you think that all die out?"
The Russian people will never disappear....  You are lying....  It has
"been written in the Bible, only it is not known what name the Russians"
are given.  Do you see what kind of people they are?  They are
numberless....  How many villages are there on the earth? Think of all
"the people who live on it, so strong, so numerous! And you say that"
"they will die out; men shall die, but God wants the people, God the"
Creator of the earth!  The Amalekites did not die out.  They are either
"German or French....  But you, eh, you!  Now then, tell me why we are"

"He walked unsteadily, toward Piccadilly.  A girl of the town passed and"
"looked up at him.  Staring hard, he hooked his arm in hers without a"
"word; it steadied him, and they walked on thus together.  Suddenly he"
said:
"""Well, girl, are you happy?""  The girl stopped and tried to disengage her"
arm; a rather frightened look had come into her dark-eyed powdered face.
"Fiorsen laughed, and held it firm.  ""When the unhappy meet, they walk"
together.  Come on!  You are just a little like my wife.  Will you have a
"drink?"""
"The girl shook her head, and, with a sudden movement, slipped her arm out"
of this madman's and dived away like a swallow through the pavement
traffic.  Fiorsen stood still and laughed with his head thrown back.  The
second time to-day.  SHE had slipped from his grasp.  Passers looked at
"him, amazed.  The ugly devils!  And with a grimace, he turned out of"
"Piccadilly, past St. James's Church, making for Bury Street.  They"
"wouldn't let him in, of course--not they!  But he would look at the"
"windows; they had flower-boxes--flower-boxes!  And, suddenly, he groaned"
aloud--he had thought of Gyp's figure busy among the flowers at home.
"Missing the right turning, he came in at the bottom of the street.  A"
fiddler in the gutter was scraping away on an old violin.  Fiorsen
"stopped to listen.  Poor devil!  ""Pagliacci!""  Going up to the man--dark,"
"lame, very shabby, he took out some silver, and put his other hand on the"
man's shoulder.
"""Brother,"" he said, ""lend me your fiddle.  Here's money for you. Come;"
"lend it to me.  I am a great violinist."""
"""Vraiment, monsieur!"""
as little to your mind as to mine.  We can flatter and fool and make
mock with the best; but when it comes to marriage!  Faugh! one’s soul
sickens at the thought.  What man in his senses would trust his
happiness or his honour in the hands of that tawdry crew?  Gilt and

"asks for gold."""
Grey’s heart seemed to stand still within him.  He felt growing numb and
"cold.  As they passed beneath the gateway, and the lamp shone upon his"
"face, Lord Sandford saw that it was white as death, and a strange gleam"
came into his own eyes.
"""Come, my friend, you do not answer.  What think you of the wife that I"
have chosen?  What think you of the Lady Geraldine Adair?  Is she not a
matchless creature?  Who would have believed such a sport could come
"from such a tree?"""
Grey commanded himself by a great effort.
"""Is the Lady Geraldine Adair, then, your affianced wife?"""
"""That, or next door to it.  My suit is approved of her parents.  We"
shall be betrothed ere long.  I thought you might be learning as much
from her own lips to-night.  Did I not hear my name pass between you

"""She did ask some question anent you,"" answered Grey, who had no desire"
"to fence or parry—he felt too stunned and bewildered; ""but she spoke not"
"of any troth-plight.  Why should she?"""
"""True, why should she?  She is not one of your empty-headed chatterers."

Mrs. White took the sketch forcibly from Trude. She frowned over it.
One of the girls certainly did look like Sidney as she remembered the
child from their one meeting.
"""How do you explain it, Trude?"""
"Trude sighed heavily. ""I can't explain it. There's something wrong"
"somewhere. And it's my fault, Aunt Edith. I--I consented--we all"
consented to let Sidney go off down there just so that we could go
ahead with our own plans. But we thought--we felt _certain_ that these
cousins were very nice--I--I mean had a lovely home and were rich so
that Sidney might get something out of her visit that she couldn't get
"at home. It sounds shameful to _say_ it."""
"""I understand, my dear. But what made you think so?"""
"""The--the letter this Cousin Achsa wrote. It _was_ a very nice letter!"""
"""Well, _I_ have always thought you could judge anyone's character and"
"background by a letter. There must be something wrong. This girl--"""
"pointing to the sketch, ""is positively shocking! At least she would be"
"around here."""
"""I remember now something Sidney said--when she was begging us to let"
her go away. 'I want to be different! I want to go somewhere where I
won't be Joseph Romley's daughter. I want adventure and to do exciting
"things--' Those were her very words! I didn't take them seriously then,"
"but, oh, Aunt Edith, perhaps she meant them more than we guessed!"" Poor"
"Trude rose quickly to her feet. ""Aunt Edith, I simply _must_ go to"
Provincetown at once. May I ask Pepper to find out about trains?

"I see the child. I feel that it's all my fault."""
'The second from the door end of the house?' he asked.
"'No, the third.'"
He nodded with an air of quiet triumph. 'Just so!' he said. 'I thought
"so afterwards. But the fact is, my friend, my house ends with the"
"second gable. The third gable-end does not belong to it, though"
doubtless it once did.'
"'No?' I exclaimed. And for a moment I stood taken aback, cursing my"
"carelessness. Then I stammered, 'But this third gable--I saw no door"
"in it, Herr Krapp.'"
"'No, the door is in another street,' he answered. 'Or rather it opens"
on the churchyard at the back of St. Austin's. So you may have seen
"her after all. Well, I wish you well,' he continued. 'I must be"
going.'
"The crowd was beginning to separate, moving away by twos and threes,"
talking loudly. The lights were dying down. He nodded and was gone;
while I still stood gaping. For how did the matter stand? If I had
really seen Marie at the window--as seemed possible now--and if
"nothing turned out to be amiss at home, then I had not been tricked"
"after all, and the message was genuine. True she had not kept her"
"appointment. But she might be in durance, or one of a hundred things"
might have frustrated her intention.
"Still I could do nothing now except go home, and cutting short my"
"speculations, I forced myself through the press, and with some labour"
"managed to reach the door. As I did so I turned to look back, and the"
"sight, though the people were moving away fast, was sufficiently"
"'em as they were talking to Peasley. You'd better 'beat' it, quick!"""
"""How? I couldn't get through that crowd. They know me. Listen!"" Outside"
the street broke into a roar at some taunt of the fishermen high up in
"the rigging. ""I can't run away, and if those detectives get me I'm"
"ruined."""
"""Well! What's to be done?"" demanded Fraser, sharply. ""If you say the"
"word, we'll shoot it out with them, and get away on the ship before--"""
"""We can't do that--there are a dozen policemen in front here."""
"""Well, you'll have to move quick, or they'll 'cop' you, sure."""
"Boyd clinched his hands in desperation. ""I guess they've got me,"" he"
"said, bitterly. ""There's no way out."""
His eyes fell upon the letter containing his boastful assurance of
victory. What a mockery!
"""From what they said I don't think they know you,"" Fraser continued."
"""Anyhow, they wanted Peasley to point you out. When they come off,"
"maybe you can slip 'em."""
"""But how?"" Boyd seized eagerly upon the suggestion. ""The wharf is"
"empty--see! I'll have to cross it in plain sight."""
Through the rear door of the office that opened upon the dock proper
they beheld the great floor almost entirely clear. Save for a few tons
"of freight at which Big George's men were working, it was as"
"unobstructed as a lawn; and, although it was nearly the size of a city"
"block, it afforded no more means of concealment than did the little"
Besides--in a hundred years it will all be forgotten. Why do we struggle?
In a hundred years someone will read about it in memoirs and letters and
"think: ""How she wriggled, how she fussed--dear me!"" There are others about"
whom nothing at all will be written or read; life will close over them
like a grave. Either way....
"What sorrows she had--dear, dear, what sorrows! The day she had been"
"unable to pay the bill, she thought herself the center of the universe;"
"everybody stared at her, and she was at her wits' end. Then she heard a"
"man's voice outside saying: ""Haven't you watered Blakka yet?"" That was"
_his_ preoccupation. So she was not the center of the universe after
all.
"Then she and her companion had left the house, and set out on their tour."
"The center? Not at all. Day after day they walked across fields, and"
"through valleys, had meals in houses by the way, and water from the"
"brooks. If they met other travelers, they greeted them, or they did not"
"greet them; no one was less a center of attention than they, and no one"
"more. Her companion walked in vacant thoughtlessness, whistling as he"
went.
At one place they stopped for food.
"""Will you pay for mine for the time being?"" he said."
"She hesitated and then said briefly that she could not pay ""for the time"
"being"" all the way."
"""Of course not, by no means,"" said he. ""Just for the moment. Perhaps we"
"can get a loan further down the valley."""
friend?'
"'Like this, my lord?' I muttered stupidly."
"He nodded. 'Yes, like this,' he repeated. 'I have heard him called a"
"brave man. Coming of his stock, he should be; and when I saw him in"
"Tzerclas' camp he had the air of one. Now he starts at a shadow, is in"
"a trance half his time, and a tremor the other half. What ails him?'"
"I told him how he had been wounded, fighting bravely, and that since"
that he had not been himself.
"Count Hugo rubbed his chin gravely. 'It is a pity,' he said. 'We want"
all--every German arm and every German head. We want you. Man alive!'
"he continued, roused to anger, I suppose, by my dull face, 'do you"
know what is in front of you?'
"'No, my lord,' I said in apathy."
He opened his mouth as if to hurl a volley of words at me. But he
"thought better of it and shut his lips tight. 'Very well,' he said"
grimly. 'Wait three days and you will see.'
"But in truth, I had not to wait three days. Before sunset of the next"
"I began to see, and, downcast as I was, to prick up my ears in wonder."
"Beyond Romhild and between that town and Bamberg, the great road which"
"runs through the valley of the Pegnitz, was such a sight as I had"
never seen. For many miles together a column of dust marked its
"course, and under this went on endless marching. We were but a link in"
"a long chain, dragging slowly southwards. Now it was a herd of"
"oxen that passed along, moving tediously and painfully, driven by"
half-naked cattle-men and guarded by a troop of grimy horse. Now it
"hard work must be strong and healthy, and they should have strong and"
"healthy children....  Do I speak truly?"""
"""Yes,"" assented the listeners."
"""But all this will never happen,"" says Yashka, becoming rather"
"frightened at the prospect held out to him by the teacher.  ""She is"
"healthy, and I cannot have reached the child ...  She is a devil--a"
"hag!"" he shouts angrily.  ""I would ...  She will eat me away as rust"
"eats iron."""
"""I understand, Yakov, that you cannot help beating your wife,"" the"
"teacher's sad and thoughtful voice again breaks in.  ""You have many"
reasons for doing so ... It is your wife's character that causes you to
"beat her so incautiously ...  But your own dark and sad life ..."""
"""You are right!"" shouts Yakov.  ""We live in darkness, like the"
"chimney-sweep when he is in the chimney!"""
"""You are angry with your life, but your wife is patient; the closest"
"relation to you--your wife, and you make her suffer for this, simply"
"because you are stronger than she.  She is always with you, and cannot"
"get away.  Don't you see how absurd you are?"""
"""That is so....  Devil take it!  But what shall I do?  Am I not a man?"""
"""Just so!  You are a man....  I only wish to tell you that if you"
"cannot help beating her, then beat her carefully and always remember"
that you may injure her health or that of the child.  It is not good to
beat pregnant women ... on their belly or on their sides and chests....
"Beat her, say, on the neck ... or else take a rope and beat her on some"
"soft place ..."""
expressed intention of hiding this terrible discovery from him. He had
"been duped, not by her, but by his own romantic folly."
Yet what would his life be without her--or rather without his illusion?
An icy hand gripped his heart. He turned to the glimmering window and
stared at the blank wall.
"Presently a moan struck upon his ear. He wheeled round sharply, and"
distinguished her lying with helpless outspread arms on the couch. Mere
humanity brought him to her side.
"“I am so tired,” she moaned."
"“You must go to bed,” he replied in a gentler voice than hitherto. “We"
"had better part now. To-morrow, if you are well enough to travel, we"
will leave for England.”
"“Let me go alone,” she murmured, “and you go on to Switzerland. Why"
should your holiday be spoiled?”
"“It is my life that is spoiled,” he said ungenerously. “The holiday"
matters very little. It is best to return to England as soon as
possible. Between now and to-morrow morning I shall have time to reflect
upon the situation.”
He struck a match and lit the candles and drew down the blind. The
light revealed her to him so wan and exhausted that he was moved with
compunction.
"“Don’t think me hard, my child,” he said, bending over her. “It is the"
bitterest day of our lives. We must pray to God for strength to bear it.
I shall leave you now. I shall see that you have all you want. Try to
"""I'm here with a message from your mistress, Betty.  Keep your head;"
"don't look round, but listen to me.  She's at Bury Street and going to"
"stay there; she wants you and baby and the dogs.""  The stout woman's eyes"
grew round and her mouth opened.  Winton put his hand on the
"perambulator.  ""Steady, now!  Go out as usual with this thing.  It's"
about your time; and wait for me at the turning to Regent's Park.  I'll
come on in my cab and pick you all up.  Don't get flurried; don't take
"anything; do exactly as you usually would. Understand?"""
It is not in the nature of stout women with babies in their charge to
"receive such an order without question.  Her colour, and the heaving of"
that billowy bosom made Winton add quickly:
"""Now, Betty, pull yourself together; Gyp wants you.  I'll tell you all"
"about it in the cab."""
"The poor woman, still heaving vaguely, could only stammer:"
"""Yes, sir.  Poor little thing!  What about its night-things?  And Miss"
"Gyp's?"""
"Conscious of that figure still at the window, Winton made some passes"
"with his fingers at the baby, and said:"
"""Never mind them.  As soon as you see me at the drawing-room window, get"
"ready and go.  Eyes front, Betty; don't look round; I'll cover your"
"retreat!  Don't fail Gyp now.  Pull yourself together."""
"With a sigh that could have been heard in Kensington, Betty murmured:"
"""Very well, sir; oh dear!"" and began to adjust the strings of her bonnet."
"With nods, as if he had been the recipient of some sage remarks about the"
"baby, Winton saluted, and began his march again towards the house.  He"
"to glitter with a queer metallic sheen. Then, from each of the three,"
as they passed over the boundary--nothing! All radio communication
"ceased as abruptly as though they'd been stricken dead."""
"He stared at Brand. ""That's all I can tell you, little enough, God"
knows. Something ominous and strange is contained in that red spot:
"but what its nature may be, we cannot even guess. I want you to go"
"there and find out."""
"Brand's determined jaw jutted out, and his lips thinned to a"
purposeful line. He stood to attention.
"""I'll be leaving to-night, sir. Or sooner if you like. I could go this"
"afternoon: in an hour--"""
"""To-night is soon enough,"" said Stone with a smile. ""Now, who do you"
"want to accompany you?"""
Brand thought a moment. On so long a journey as a trip to Jupiter
there was only room in a space ship--what with supplies and all--for
one other man. It behooved him to pick his companion carefully.
"""I'd like Dex Harlow,"" he said at last. ""He's been to Jupiter before,"
"working with me in plotting the northern hemisphere. He's a good man."""
"""He is,"" agreed Stone, nodding approval of Brand's choice. ""I'll have"
"him report to you at once."""
"He rose and held out his hand. ""I'm relying on you, Captain Bowen,"" he"
"said. ""I won't give any direct orders: use your own discretion. But I"
would advise you not to try to land in the red area. Simply fly low
"over it, and see what you can discern from the air. Good-by, and good"
"The android advanced with his knife raised. In desperation, Taber fired"
at the lethal fist that held the weapon. And he was lucky. The hand
snapped open under the ripping impact of the bullet and the knife rang
sharply against the wall as it ricocheted to the ground.
"Only then, did the patrolman obey the order to drop. He went to one knee"
and Brent Taber fired three shots into the chest of the android.
He hesitated. There was only one slug left in the revolver. If the three
"didn't spot the android, he planned to wait for closer contact and put"
the sixth slug into the forehead.
The android shuddered. The fire and frenzy went out of him. He tried to
lift a leg and was surprised when it didn't move. He looked down at it.
"Completely bemused, he peered down at his crimson chest. He looked up at"
"Taber without anger, only with surprise. A distinct expression of"
wistful regret crossed his face as he sank to the ground.
The tenth android was dead.
The patrolman came shakily to his feet. His face was as pale as death.
"""I--I don't know what happened. Buck fever. Pure buck fever, and I've"
"been on the force for ten years."""
"""Don't worry about it,"" Taber said."
"""Don't _worry_. All of a sudden I freeze under pressure and he says,"
"'Don't worry.'"""
"""I meant it. This is no ordinary man. It wasn't buck fever at all. I"
couldn't have faced him myself if I hadn't rattled him with that lucky
"'I do not know,' my lady answered, and told him shortly of our flight,"
and how we had lain two days and a night in the osier-bed.
"'It was a good thought,' he said. 'But I fear that you are half"
"famished.' And he called for food and wine, and served my lady with"
"his own hands, while he saw that we did not go without. 'Campaigner's"
"fare,' he said. 'But you come of a fighting stock, Countess, and can"
put up with it.'
"'Shame on me if I could not,' she answered."
"There was a quaver in her voice, which showed how the rencontre moved"
"her, how full her heart was of unspoken gratitude."
"'When you have finished, we will get to horse,' he said. 'I must take"
"you with me to Nuremberg, for I am not strong enough to detach a"
"party. But this evening we will make a long halt at Hesel, and secure"
you a good night's rest.'
"'I am sorry to be so burdensome,' my lady said timidly."
"He shrugged his shoulders without compliment, but I did not hear what"
he answered. For I could bear no more. Marie seemed so forgotten in
"this crowd, so much a thing of the past, that my gorge rose. No word"
"of her, no thought of her, no talk of a search party! I pictured her"
"forlorn, helpless little figure, her pale, uncomplaining face--I and"
no one else; and I had to go away into the bushes to hide myself. She
"was forgotten already. She had done all for them, I said to myself,"
and they forgot her.
"Then, in the thicket screened from the party, I had a thought--to go"
"back and look for her, myself. Now my lady was safe, there was nothing"
with more flowers.
'Ha!' I said foolishly. 'What is it?'
"'My lady sent me to you,' she answered."
"'Yes,' I asked eagerly. 'Does she want me?'"
"But Marie hung her head, and played with the flowers. 'I don't think"
"so,' she whispered. 'She only sent me to you.'"
Then I understood. The Waldgrave had gone to the farther end. Steve
and the men were tending the horses half a dozen paces beyond the
"screen of willow-leaves. We were alone. A rat plashed into the water,"
"and drove Marie nearer to me; and she laid her head on my shoulder,"
"and I whispered in her ear, till the lashes sank down over her eyes"
"and her lips trembled. If I had loved her from the first, what was the"
"length and height and breadth of my love now, when I had seen her in"
"darkness and peril, sunshine and storm, strong when others failed,"
"brave when others flinched, always helpful, ready, tireless! And she"
"so small! So frail, I almost feared to press her to me; so pale, the"
blood that leapt to her cheeks at my touch seemed a mere reflection of
the sunlight.
I told her how Steve had made the guards at the prison drunk with wine
bought with her dowry; how the horses he had purchased and taken out
of the camp by twos and threes had been paid for from the same source;
"and how many ducats had gone for meats and messes to keep the life,"
"that still ran sluggishly, in the Waldgrave's veins. She listened and"
lay still.
"'So you have no dowry now, little one,' I said, when I had told her"
"No one spoke, and I looked from one to another. The men had returned"
"from the search, and stood in a dark group round the body, which they"
"had drawn to the side of the road. It wanted an hour of daylight yet,"
"and I could not see their faces, but I read in their silence the"
answer that no one liked to put into words.
"'Be a man!' Steve muttered, after a long pause. 'God help the girl."
But God help us too if we are found here!'
"Still my lady did not speak, and I knew her brave heart too well to"
"doubt her, though she had been the first to talk of going. 'Get to"
"horse,' I said roughly."
"'No, no,' my lady cried at last. 'We will all stay, Martin.'"
"'Ay, all stay or all go!' Steve muttered."
"'Then all go!' I said, choking down the sobs that would rise. And I"
turned first from the place.
I will not try to state what that cost me. I saw my girl's face
"everywhere--everywhere in the darkness, and the eyes reproached me."
"That she of all should suffer, who had never fainted, never faltered,"
whose patience and courage had been the women's stay from the
"first--that she should suffer! I thought of the tender, weak body, and"
"of all the things that might happen to her, and I seemed, as I went"
"away from her, the vilest thing that lived."
But reason was against me. If I stayed there and waited on the road
"by the old crone's body until morning, what could I do? Whither could"
I turn? Marie was gone and already might be half a dozen miles away.
"So the bonds of custom and duty held me. Dazed and bewildered, I"
"""Sidney Romley, you're _crazy_!"" cried Aunt Achsa, in a quavering"
"voice. ""Go away! How _can_ he go away when we ain't even the money to"
"go 'sfar as Orleans. And he ain't plannin' to go on anyone's _charity_!"""
"""Oh, I don't mean he's going away _soon_! I shouldn't have told anyway"
for Lav told me as a secret. But I thought maybe it would make you
happier knowing he had great ambitions. And he'll tell you sometime
"himself."""
"When Aunt Achsa spoke it was in a thin, grieved voice."
"""It's what I didn't want him to ever take into his head. Goin' off"
"somewhere--alone. For I'm too old to go with him and he'll need me!"""
"""Oh I wouldn't have told you if I'd thought it would make you unhappy."
"He won't go for a long time, Aunt Achsa. And when he does he'll come"
"back real often."""
Now Aunt Achsa sat so still that Sidney thought she had consoled her.
But Aunt Achsa was facing in her own way this at which Sidney had
"hinted, drawing for it from that courage of hers that had not yet been"
"exhausted. Well, if it was best for Lavender some day to go away she'd"
"send him away with a smile even though the heart that had taken him, a"
"wee baby, from the dying mother did burst with loneliness. Besides,"
even if Lavender went away she could go on praying to the Lord to keep
"him ""happy""--no distance could keep her from doing that!"
"""It's like as not his plans in his head that's makin' him act so quiet"
like and short-spoken. And last night he didn't sleep in his bed at
"all!"""
"""Why, Aunt Achsa, where _was_ he?"" gasped Sidney, really startled."
"""You know what I mean. They probably don't realize it yet, but you're"
going to end up with the Soviet Far East in your wallet. For the price
"of a hot airplane, you get to plunder the region. They're even going to"
be thanking you while you reclaim Sakhalin for Japan. This _Daedalus_
spaceship is going to cost them the ranch. Have to admit it's
brilliant. Along with financing the whole scheme by swindling Benelux
"tax dodgers."""
"""You are too imaginative for your own good, Dr. Vance,"" he said, a thin"
"smile returning. ""Nobody is going to believe your interpretation of the"
"protocol."""
"""You've got a point. Nobody appreciates the true brilliance of a"
"criminal mind. Or maybe they just haven't known you as long as I have."""
"""Really, I'd hoped we would not descend to trading insults."" He reached"
"to refill Vance's sake saucer. ""It's demeaning. Instead I'd hoped we"
"could proceed constructively."""
"""Why not."""
"""Well then, perhaps you'll forgive me if I'm somewhat blunt. I'm afraid"
my time is going to be limited over the next few hours. I may as well
tell you now that we are about to have the first hypersonic test of the
_Daedalus_. Tomorrow morning we will take her to Mach 25. Seventeen
thousand miles per hour. A speed almost ten times greater than any air-
"breathing vehicle has ever before achieved."""
"""The sky's the limit,"" he whistled quietly. Alex hadn't known the half"
of it. This was the ultimate plane.
"""Impressive, I think you'll agree."" Mino smiled and poured more sake"
a nice room. It ain’t often vacant. I had some most elegant people in
"it last summer—no trouble at all, and paid in advance to the minute."
The water’s at the end of the hall. Sprowls and Mooney kept it three
months. They done a vaudeville sketch. Miss B’retta Sprowls—you may
"have heard of her—Oh, that was just the stage names—right there over"
"the dresser is where the marriage certificate hung, framed. The gas is"
"here, and you see there is plenty of closet room. It’s a room everybody"
likes. It never stays idle long.”
“Do you have many theatrical people rooming here?” asked the young man.
“They comes and goes. A good proportion of my lodgers is connected with
"the theatres. Yes, sir, this is the theatrical district. Actor people"
"never stays long anywhere. I get my share. Yes, they comes and they"
goes.”
"He engaged the room, paying for a week in advance. He was tired, he"
"said, and would take possession at once. He counted out the money. The"
"room had been made ready, she said, even to towels and water. As the"
"housekeeper moved away he put, for the thousandth time, the question"
that he carried at the end of his tongue.
“A young girl—Miss Vashner—Miss Eloise Vashner—do you remember such a
"one among your lodgers? She would be singing on the stage, most likely."
"A fair girl, of medium height and slender, with reddish, gold hair and"
a dark mole near her left eyebrow.”
"“No, I don’t remember the name. Them stage people has names they change"
"as often as their rooms. They comes and they goes. No, I don’t call"
that one to mind.”
No. Always no. Five months of ceaseless interrogation and the
won your love by a trick. I had to show you the lowest and worst part
"of myself before the best in me could grow--the best in me, which is"
"yours."""
"""You are raving!"""
"""I am not raving. You must see I am not. Look at me. I am calmer than"
"you, though I face certain death. I knew when I came here that the"
"chances were I should be killed before I even saw you, but I had to"
"risk that. I had to win your trust back somehow, honestly and fairly."
"I can not live without your trust."""
"""Beatrice!"" The name escaped him almost without his knowledge. He saw"
tears spring to her eyes.
"""It is true. Your love and your trust have become my life. Then I was"
unworthy of both. I tried to make myself worthy. I did what I could. I
told you the truth--I threw away the only thing that mattered to me. I
"could not hold your love any longer by a lie--I loved you too much!"""
"For that moment the passionate energy of her words, the sincerity and"
"eloquence of her glance, swept back every thought of suspicion. He"
"stood stupefied, almost overwhelmed. Mechanically his lips formed"
themselves to a few broken sentences.
"""You can not know what you are saying. You are beside yourself. Once,"
"in my ignorance, I believed it possible, but now I know that it could"
"never be. Your race despises mine--"""
"""I do not care what you are nor to whom you belong!"" she broke in,"
"exulting. ""You are the man who taught me to believe that there is"
"something in this world that is good, that is worthy of veneration;"
Slyne silenced him with a contemptuous gesture.
"""Whatever you do will make no difference to anyone in the wide world but"
"yourself,"" said Slyne. ""If you do what you're told you'll get a great"
deal more than you deserve out of it. If you don't--D'ye think I'd have
"taken you into the team if I didn't know how to drive you!"" he asked,"
"his eyes beginning to blaze. ""Why, my good fellow, if you refuse, if"
"you don't travel up to your collar, if you so much as shy at anything"
you see or hear--I won't even hurt you; I'll just hand you over to the
police.
"""So make up your mind now, quick!"""
"""You've nothing against me,"" quavered the lawyer."
"""No, I've nothing--not very much, at least, yet,"" Slyne agreed, knotting"
"his tie neatly before the glass. ""But--that may be because you haven't"
"embezzled any of my money--yet."" He had most opportunely recalled what"
the detective Dubois had told him about his new friend.
Mr. Jobling's face was almost green. He got up with an evident effort.
"""I was only joking,"" he declared with a most ghastly grin. ""I'll be"
"quite satisfied with ten per cent. of the accumulated income--in fact,"
"we'll call it a couple of hundred thousand pounds, if you like."""
"""All right,"" Slyne agreed imperturbably. ""Make it that amount if you'd"
rather. How long will it take you to get the papers drawn out? It's
"nearly one o'clock. And--you won't be safe till they're signed."""
"""An hour,"" said Mr. Jobling. ""I'm a quick writer."""
gallants. But it may not be.  I may not give you such a right. A maiden
is not free to choose her friends; and the knights of chivalry are long
"since vanished from the earth.  I would that I might call you friend,"
that sometimes we might meet and hold converse together. I trust that I
"may learn a good report of you, that one day I may speak with pride of"
having known you in your youth.  But that must suffice us.  Let it be
"enough for both.  I may not—"""
"She hesitated, and her voice died into silence. She spoke with a"
repressed emotion which he scarcely understood.  The tumult of his own
heart was such that he could not seek to gauge the depths of her
feelings.
"""If I may not be your knight, let me at least be your friend—your"
"servant!"" he pleaded.  ""And if there is anything wherein I can serve"
"you—"""
She seemed struck by the phrase.  She lifted her bent head and gazed
earnestly at him; but the words she spoke seemed strange.
"""You are the friend of Lord Sandford; is it not so?"""
"""I have been his comrade these many weeks.  He has shown me much"
"kindness and good-fellowship. I owe him gratitude."""
"""And you must know him well, I doubt not.  Tell me, Sir Grey—and I pray"
you deceive me not—what kind of a man is this same Lord Sandford?  Is he
"leal and true, faithful, loving, and loyal?  Is he better than the crowd"
"who follow at his heels and ape his manners, use his name as a"
"watchword, and fawn upon his favour?  Tell me, what think you of him?  A"
"friend must needs speak sooth."""
But after a little it came to him that the yellow gleam did not seem
"any closer; in fact, it grew fainter; he knew then, with a moment's"
"panic, that the tide and wind were too strong for him. He cursed his"
"frail strength, with a smarting in his eyes that did not come from the"
salt water.
There was only one thing he could do. Turn his back on the friendly
light and strike out in the direction of the beach. It would be
"further, but the cross currents of the tide would not impede his"
progress so much.
"For a long time he fought ahead stubbornly, changing his strokes, even"
"swimming on his back. But his breath came with increasing difficulty, a"
sharp pain stabbed at his side. He labored on. The pain grew sharper
and caught at him like a horrible vise. Once he yielded to it and sank
"down, down into the black water. But it passed and, as he rose, he"
"struck out again, blindly, now, for he had lost all sense of direction."
"""Oh, God! Oh, God!"" he shouted in his heart. His Aunt Achsa's God,"
whose All-embracing Love he had questioned because that God had made
"him crooked, must help him now! ""I _got_ to get help!"" God _must_ hear"
him.
A great exhaustion seized him. He sank again with a quivering breath.
But now his feet touched sand. With new strength he plunged ahead.
Again he was in deep water but he swam with eager strokes. The dreadful
pain stabbed but he did not heed. Now he saw moving lights. He was near
the beach! With a heartbreaking effort he fought the strength of the
"water, finally gaining the shallow depths. He heard voices nearby in"
the darkness.
"""The Rajah has a charmed life,"" he said somberly. ""He is always in the"
front of his men--we can recognize him by his dress and figure--he is
"always within range, but we can't hit him. Not that I ought to wish"
"his death, though it's our only chance."" He put his hands distractedly"
"to his head. ""Heaven knows, it's too hard for a Christian man! Every"
"time I see an enemy fall, I rejoice--and then I remember that it is my"
"brother--"" He stopped, the expression on his face of profound trouble"
"giving way to active alarm. ""Hush! Some one is coming!"""
"A second time the door opened, and Travers rushed in. Lois saw his"
"face, and something in her recoiled in sick disgust. Fear, an almost"
"imbecilic fear, was written on the wide-open, staring eyes, and the"
hand that held the revolver trembled like that of an old man.
"""Quick--out by the back way!"" he stammered incoherently. ""I will lock"
the door--so. That will keep them off a minute. They are bound to look
for us here first. Nicholson is retiring with his men--they are going
to have a try to bring down the Rajah. It's our one chance. It may
"frighten the devils--they think he's a god. I believe he is, curse"
"him!"" All the time, he had been piling furniture against the door with"
"a mad and feverish energy. ""Help me! Help me!"" he screamed. ""Why don't"
"you help? Do you want to be killed like sheep?"""
Lois drew him back by the arm.
"""You are wasting time,"" she said firmly. ""Come with us! Why, you are"
"hurt!"""
He looked at the thin stream which trickled down the soiled white of
his coat. A silly smile flickered over his big face.
"striking. Almost opposite us in a beetling archway, the bowed head and"
shoulders of a man stood up above the common level. There was a little
"space round him, whence men held back; and the red glow of the"
smouldering links which the executioners had cast on the ground at his
"feet, shone upwards on his swollen lips and starting eyeballs. As I"
"looked, the body seemed to writhe in its bonds; but it was only the"
wind swayed it. I went in shuddering.
"On the stairs I met Count Hugo coming down, and knew the moment I saw"
"him that there was something wrong. He stopped me, his eyes full of"
wrath.
"'My man,' he said sternly, 'I thought that you were to be trusted!"
Where have you been? What have you been doing? _Donner!_ Is your lady
to be left at dark with no one to man this door?'
"Conscience-stricken, I muttered that I hoped nothing had gone amiss."
"'No, but something easily might!' he answered grimly. 'When I came"
here I found three as ugly looking rogues whispering and peering in
"your doorway as man could wish to see! Yes, Master Martin, and if I"
"had not ridden up at that moment I will not answer for it, that they"
would not have been in! It is a pity a few more knaves are not where
"that one is,' he continued sourly, pointing through the open door. 'We"
could spare them. But do you see and have more care for the future.
"Or, mein Gott, I will take other measures, my friend!'"
So it had been a ruse after all! I went up sick at heart.
"""It's too bad I've got somebody in the best room,"" said Eilert. ""They're"
"gentlefolk from the city. They came down here through Stordalen, and they"
had to walk because the cars have stopped for the season. They've been in
"my house for quite some days, and I think they'll be staying on a while"
"yet. I think they're out now, but of course it means I can't let you have"
"my best room."""
"I looked up, and saw a face in the window. A shiver ran through me--no, of"
"course not a shiver, far from it, but certainly this was a fresh surprise."
"What a coincidence! As we were about to enter the door, there was the"
"actor, too--standing there looking at me: the actor from the Tore Peak"
"resort. It was his knees, his coat, and his stick. So I was right--I"
"_had_ recognized her face at an upper window. Yes, indeed, the world"
is small.
The actor and I greeted each other and began to talk. How nice to see me
"again! And how was Paul, the good fellow--still soaking himself in liquor,"
he supposed? Funny effect it has sometimes; Paul seemed to think the whole
"inn was an aquarium and we visitors the goldfish! ""Ha, ha, ha, goldfish; I"
"wish we were, I must say!--Well, Eilert, are we getting some fresh haddock"
"for supper? Good!--Really, we like it here very much; we've already been"
"here several days; we want to stay and get a good rest."""
"As we stood there, a rather stout girl came down from the loft and"
addressed the actor:
"""The missis wants you to come right upstairs."""
"""Oh? Very well, at once.... Well, see you later. You'll be stopping here,"
"too, I expect?"""
He hurried up the stairs.
abandoned by God?  Have we no punishments nor prophets from the Lord?
"Who then will teach us?"" Tyapa spoke strongly and plainly, and there"
"was faith in his words.  He had been speaking a long time, and the"
"teacher, who was generally drunk and in a speechless condition, could"
"not stand it any longer.  He looked at the dry, wrinkled old man, felt"
"the great force of these words, and suddenly began to pity himself.  He"
wished to say something so strong and convincing to the old man that
Tyapa would be disposed in his favour; he did not wish to speak in such
"a serious, earnest way, but in a soft and fatherly tone.  And the"
teacher felt as if something were rising from his breast into his
throat ...  But he could not find any powerful words.
"""What kind of a man are you? ...  Your soul seems to be torn away--and"
you still continue speaking ... as if you knew something ...  It would
"be better if you were silent."""
"""Ah, Tyapa, what you say is true,"" replied the teacher, sadly. ""The"
people ... you are right ... they are numberless ... but I am a
stranger to them ... and they are strangers to me ... Do you see where
the tragedy of my life is hidden? ... But let me alone!  I shall suffer
"... and there are no prophets also ...  No.  You are right, I speak a"
great deal ...  But it is no good to anyone.  I shall be always silent
"...  Only don't speak with me like this ...  Ah, old man, you do not"
"know ...  You do not know ...  And you cannot understand."""
"And in the end the teacher cried.  He cried so easily and so freely,"
"with such torrents of flowing tears, that he soon found relief."
"""You ought to go into a village ... become a clerk or a teacher ..."
"You would be well fed there.  What are you crying for?"" asked Tyapa,"
sadly.
He went back into the drawing-room.  There they were--just passing the
"side of the house. Five minutes, and they would be down at the turning."
"He stood at the window, waiting.  If only that fellow did not come in!"
Through the partition wall he could hear him still tramping up and down
the dining-room.  What a long time a minute was!  Three had gone when he
"heard the dining-room door opened, and Fiorsen crossing the hall to the"
"front door.  What was he after, standing there as if listening?  And"
"suddenly he heard him sigh.  It was just such a sound as many times, in"
"the long-past days, had escaped himself, waiting, listening for"
"footsteps, in parched and sickening anxiety. Did this fellow then really"
"love--almost as he had loved?  And in revolt at spying on him like this,"
he advanced and said:
"""Well, I won't wait any longer."""
Fiorsen started; he had evidently supposed himself alone.  And Winton
thought: 'By Jove! he does look bad!'
"""Good-bye!"" he said; but the words: ""Give my love to Gyp,"" perished on"
their way up to his lips.
"""Good-bye!"" Fiorsen echoed.  And Winton went out under the trellis,"
conscious of that forlorn figure still standing at the half-opened door.
Betty was nowhere in sight; she must have reached the turning.  His
"mission had succeeded, but he felt no elation.  Round the corner, he"
"picked up his convoy, and, with the perambulator hoisted on to the taxi,"
"journeyed on at speed.  He had said he would explain in the cab, but the"
only remark he made was:
"""You'll all go down to Mildenham to-morrow."""
"And Betty, who had feared him ever since their encounter so many years"
"the water for him to fetch, this being in his view the only reason why"
anything was carried in the hand.
"She found Monsieur Harmost fidgeting up and down the room, whose opened"
windows could not rid it of the smell of latakia.
"""Ah,"" he said, ""I thought you were not coming!  You look pale; are you"
"not well?  Is it the heat?  Or""--he looked hard into her face--""has"
"someone hurt you, my little friend?""  Gyp shook her head. ""Ah, yes,"" he"
"went on irritably; ""you tell me nothing; you tell nobody nothing!  You"
"close up your pretty face like a flower at night.  At your age, my child,"
one should make confidences; a secret grief is to music as the east wind
"to the stomach.  Put off your mask for once.""  He came close to her."
"""Tell me your troubles.  It is a long time since I have been meaning to"
"ask. Come!  We are only once young; I want to see you happy."""
But Gyp stood looking down.  Would it be relief to pour her soul out?
Would it?  His brown eyes questioned her like an old dog's. She did not
want to hurt one so kind.  And yet--impossible!
Monsieur Harmost suddenly sat down at the piano.  Resting his hands on
"the keys, he looked round at her, and said:"
"""I am in love with you, you know.  Old men can be very much in love, but"
"they know it is no good--that makes them endurable. Still, we like to"
feel of use to youth and beauty; it gives us a little warmth.  Come; tell
"me your grief!""  He waited a moment, then said irritably: ""Well, well, we"
"go to music then!"""
"It was his habit to sit by her at the piano corner, but to-day he stood"
"as if prepared to be exceptionally severe.  And Gyp played, whether from"
"overexcited nerves or from not having had any lunch, better than she had"
'Where is Marie?' I cried.
She did not answer. No one answered; and I knew. Steve swore again. I
think he had known from the beginning. I began to tremble. On a sudden
my lady lifted up her voice and cried shrilly--
'Marie! Marie!'
Again no answer. But this time I did not wait to listen. I ran from
"them into the darkness the way we had come, my legs quivering under"
"me, and my mouth full of broken prayers. I remembered a certain"
"solitary tree fronting the poplars, on the other side of the way,"
"which I had marked mechanically at the moment of the fall--an ash,"
whose light upper boughs had come for an instant between my eyes and
"the sky. It stood on a little mound, where the moorland began to rise"
"on that side. I came to it now, and stopped and looked. At first I"
"could see nothing, and I trod forward fearfully. Then, a couple of"
"paces on, I made out a dark figure, lying head and feet across the"
"road. I sprang to it, and kneeling, passed my hands over it. Alas! it"
was a woman's.
"I raised the light form in my arms, crying passionately on her name,"
"while the wind swayed the boughs overhead, and, besides that and my"
"voice, all the countryside was still. She did not answer. She hung"
"limp in my arms. Kneeling in the dust beside her, I felt blindly for a"
"pulse, a heart-beat. I found neither--neither; the woman was dead."
And yet it was not that which made me lay the body down so quickly and
stand up peering round me. No; something else. The blood drummed in my
"ears, my heart beat wildly. The woman was dead; but she was not Marie."
"She was an old woman, sixty years old. When I stooped again, after"
"we damned well need to know the inside story."""
"""Nikolai, if I see her, I'll be sure and ask."" He winked. ""And if she's"
"the hot number you say, maybe I'll find time to warm her up a little."
"Get her to drop her . . . guard."""
"""If you succeed in that, _moi droog_,"" he said as his heavy eyebrows"
"lifted with a sly grin, ""you'll be the envy of the facility. You've got"
"to see her."""
"""I can't wait."" He shrugged and moved on toward the Hangar Security"
"station, at the end of the long corridor. When he flashed his A-level"
"priority ID for the two Japanese guards, he noticed they nervously made"
"a show of scrutinizing it, even though they both knew him perfectly"
"well, before saluting and authorizing entry."
"That nails it, he told himself. Out of nowhere we suddenly have all"
"this rule-book crap. These guys are nervous as hell. No doubt about it,"
the big _nachalnik_ is on the scene.
Great. Let all those assholes on the Soviet staff see the expression on
his face when the truth comes out. That's the real history we're about
to make here.
"As he walked into the glare of neon, the cavernous space had never"
"seemed more vast, more imposing. He'd seen a lot of hangars, flown a"
"lot of experimental planes over the years, but nothing to match this."
"Still, he always reminded himself, Daedalus was only hardware, just"
more fancy iron. What really counted was the balls of the pilot holding
the flight stick.
"That's when he saw them, clustered around the vehicle and gazing up. He"
For him also there seemed no other escape. He pointed to the revolver.
"""For whom is that?"" he asked."
"""I do not know--but I will make them kill me."""
"""Why do you not shoot me, then?"" he demanded, between despair and"
"bitterness. ""That would save you all. If I fell, they would turn and"
fly. They think I am Vishnu. Haven't you thought of that? I am in your
power. Why don't you make yourself the benefactress of your country?
"Why don't you shoot her enemy?"""
"She made no answer, but her eyes met his steadily and calmly. He"
"turned away, groaning. In vain he fought against it, in vain stung"
himself to action by the memory of all that she had done to him. His
love remained triumphant. In that supreme moment his faith burst
"through the darkness, and again he believed in her, believed in her"
"against reason, against the world, against the ineffaceable past, and"
against himself. And it was too late. He no longer stood alone. His
word was given.
"""Have pity on me!"" he said, once more facing her. ""Let me save you!"""
"""I should despise myself, and you would despise me--even more than you"
do now. I can not do less than share the fate of those whose lives my
"folly has jeopardized."""
"""At least go back to them--do not stay here. Beatrice, for God's"
"sake!--I can not turn back. You have made me suffer enough--."" He"
"stood before her now as an incoherent pleader, and her heart burned"
with an exultation in which the thought of life and death played no
part. She knew that he still loved her. It seemed for the moment all
from above.  No sound of the dogs.  He would go up and see the baby.
"While he was crossing the hall, there came a ring.  He opened the door"
himself.  A telegram!  He tore the envelope.
"""Gyp and the baby are with me letter follows.--WINTON."""
"He gave a short laugh, shut the door in the boy's face, and ran upstairs;"
why--heaven knew!  There was nobody there now!  Nobody! Did it mean that
she had really left him--was not coming back?  He stopped by the side of
"Gyp's bed, and flinging himself forward, lay across it, burying his face."
"And he sobbed, as men will, unmanned by drink.  Had he lost her?  Never"
to see her eyes closing and press his lips against them!  Never to soak
"his senses in her loveliness!  He leaped up, with the tears still wet on"
"his face. Lost her?  Absurd!  That calm, prim, devilish Englishman, her"
father--he was to blame--he had worked it all--stealing the baby!
He went down-stairs and drank some brandy.  It steadied him a little.
"What should he do?  ""Letter follows.""  Drink, and wait? Go to Bury"
Street?  No.  Drink!  Enjoy himself!
"He laughed, and, catching up his hat, went out, walking furiously at"
"first, then slower and slower, for his head began to whirl, and, taking a"
"cab, was driven to a restaurant in Soho.  He had eaten nothing but a"
"biscuit since his breakfast, always a small matter, and ordered soup and"
a flask of their best Chianti--solids he could not face.  More than two
"hours he sat, white and silent, perspiration on his forehead, now and"
"then grinning and flourishing his fingers, to the amusement and sometimes"
"the alarm of those sitting near.  But for being known there, he would"
"have been regarded with suspicion.  About half-past nine, there being no"
"more wine, he got up, put a piece of gold on the table, and went out"
without waiting for his change.
The Lady’s Maid
_Eleven o’clock. A knock at the door._
"... I hope I haven’t disturbed you, madam. You weren’t asleep—were you?"
"But I’ve just given my lady her tea, and there was such a nice cup"
"over, I thought, perhaps...."
"... Not at all, madam. I always make a cup of tea last thing. She"
drinks it in bed after her prayers to warm her up. I put the kettle on
"when she kneels down and I say to it, “Now you needn’t be in too much"
of a hurry to say _your_ prayers.” But it’s always boiling before my
"lady is half through. You see, madam, we know such a lot of people, and"
they’ve all got to be prayed for—every one. My lady keeps a list of the
names in a little red book. Oh dear! whenever some one new has been to
"see us and my lady says afterwards, “Ellen, give me my little red"
"book,” I feel quite wild, I do. “There’s another,” I think, “keeping"
"her out of her bed in all weathers.” And she won’t have a cushion, you"
"know, madam; she kneels on the hard carpet. It fidgets me something"
"dreadful to see her, knowing her as I do. I’ve tried to cheat her; I’ve"
"spread out the eiderdown. But the first time I did it—oh, she gave me"
"such a look—holy it was, madam. “Did our Lord have an eiderdown,"
"Ellen?” she said. But—I was younger at the time—I felt inclined to say,"
"“No, but our Lord wasn’t your age, and he didn’t know what it was to"
"have your lumbago.” Wicked—wasn’t it? But she’s _too_ good, you know,"
"madam. When I tucked her up just now and seen—saw her lying back, her"
hands outside and her head on the pillow—so pretty—I couldn’t help
"thinking, “Now you look just like your dear mother when I laid her"
out!”
pillowed on her arm. Her hair spread as in a dusky halo beneath it.
Her bosom moved with the rhythmic calm of dreamless sleep. Her lips
were parted in a smile. One hand was hid in the dark folds of her
robe.
"Francesco knelt with upturned face, his eyes shut to the sky. He"
seemed like one faint with pain; his lips moved as in prayer. A
hundred inarticulate pleadings surged heavenward from his heart.
Again he bent over her and watched the pure girlish face as she slept.
A strange calm fell for a time upon him; his eyes never wavered from
the white arm and the glimmering hair. Vast awe held him in thrall. He
"was as one who broods tearless and amazed over the dead, calm face of"
one beloved above all on earth.
"Hours passed and Francesco found no sustenance, save in prayer. The"
unuttered yearnings of a world seemed molten in his soul. The moon
waned. The stars grew dim. Strange sounds stirred in the forest-deeps;
the mysterious breathing of a thousand trees. Life ebbed and flowed
with the sigh of a moon-stupored sea. Visions blazed in the night-sky
and faded away.
Hours passed. Neither sleeper nor watcher stirred. The night grew
faint. The water flickered in the mere. The very stars seemed to gaze
upon the destinies of two wearied souls.
Far and faint came the quaver of a bird's note. Gray and mysterious
stood the forest spires. Light! Light at last! Spears of amber darting
in the east. A shudder seemed to shake the universe. The great vault
kindled. The sky grew luminous with gold.
It was the dawn.
"""The depth ... seventy-three feet."""
"""What?  Have you guessed, you shaved ugly face?"""
"""Of course, Aristid Fomich!  If you have eyes you can see a thing or"
"two,"" shouted Vaviloff, joyfully."
"A few minutes afterwards they sat side by side in Vaviloff's parlour,"
and the Captain was engaged in drinking large quantities of beer.
"""And so all the walls of the factory stand on your ground,"" said he to"
"the eating-house keeper.  ""Now, mind you show no mercy! The teacher"
"will be here presently, and we will get him to draw up a petition to"
the court.  As to the amount of the damages you will name a very
"moderate sum in order not to waste money in deed stamps, but we will"
"ask to have the factory knocked down.  This, you see, donkey, is the"
result of trespassing on other people's property.  It is a splendid
"piece of luck for you. We will force him to have the place smashed, and"
I can tell you it will be an expensive job for him.  Off with you to
the court.  Bring pressure to bear on Judas.  We will calculate how
much it will take to break the factory down to its very foundations.
"We will make an estimate of it all, counting the time it will take too,"
"and we will make honest Judas pay two thousand roubles besides."""
"""He will never give it!"" cried Vaviloff, but his eyes shone with a"
greedy light.
"""You lie!  He will give it ...  Use your brains... What else can he do?"
"But look here, Egorka, mind you don't go in for doing it on the cheap."
They are sure to try to buy you off.  Don't sell yourself cheap.  They
"will probably use threats, but rely upon us..."""
my rifle and hopped towards the dressing-station. I think it was the
happiest moment in my life. I lost the sensation of weariness for the
time being. But my foot began to hurt very badly and I got someone to
help me along. My wound was dressed. I got on to a stretcher and I
didn't know anything more until I was taken out of the motor ambulance
"here at the C.C.S. Anyhow, I'm all right now and I'm going to try and"
"get across to Blighty and swing the lead as long as I can."""
There was silence for a while. It had grown dark outside. But the call
from the theatre sounded again. Gradually the waiting-room emptied
itself until at last there were only two men left sitting in front of
the fire. They both seemed depressed and gloomy. Then one of them broke
the silence and said:
"""We was goin' over when a 'eavy one burst. I didn't 'alf cop a packet in"
"me shoulder. It's the third time too, an' I've got the wind up about"
"goin' up the line agin when I'm out o' dock. The third time's yer last,"
"yer know. Fritz'll send one over with me number on it, that's a bloody"
"cert!"""
"""If yer number's up it's up,"" said the other, who had a big patch over"
"his right ear. ""If yer've got ter die yer've got ter die, an' it's no"
"use worryin' about it."""
Their turn came before long and I helped each one to get on to a table.
Then I went over to the Prep. to see if any more walking wounded had
"arrived, but there were none at all."
I stood out in the open for a few minutes in order to breathe the fresh
air. There was a roar and rumble of distant drum-fire. The trees behind
the C.C.S. stood out blackly against the pallid flashes that lit up the
entire horizon.
"""What! Is that you, Mr. Dawson? Yes, Copplestone is here. The"
"_Antigone_? What about her? She is a sister ship of the _Antinous_,"
"and was in with damage to her forefoot, which had been ripped up when"
"she ran down that big German submarine north of the Orkneys--Yes, I"
know; she was due to go out some time to-day. What do you say? Wires
"cut? Whose wires have been cut? The _Antigone's?_ Oh, the devil! Yes,"
we will both come down to your office this afternoon. Whenever you
"like."""
"Cary hung up the receiver and glared at me. ""It has happened again,"""
"he groaned. ""The _Antigone_ this time. She has been in dry dock for"
the past fortnight and was floated out yesterday. Her full complement
joined her last night. Dawson says that he was called up at
eight-o'clock by the news that her gun-wires have been cut exactly
like those of the _Antinous_ and in the same incomprehensible way. He
"seems, curiously enough, to be quite cheerful about it."""
"""He has had a few hours sleep. And, besides, he sees that this second"
"case, so exactly like the first, makes the solution of his problem"
"very much more easy. I am glad that he is cheerful, for I feel"
exuberantly happy myself. I was kept awake half the night by a
persistent notion which seemed the more idiotic the more I thought all
"round it. But now--now, there may be something in it."""
"""What is your idea? Tell me quick."""
"""No, thank you, Dr. Watson. We amateur masters of intuition don't work"
our thrilling effects in that way. We keep our notions to ourselves
"until they turn out to be right, and then we declare that we saw"
"through the problem from the first. When we have been wrong, we say"
"nothing. So you observe, Cary, that whatever happens our reputations"
"""No,"" he answered breathlessly.  ""But we must not lose a single"
"instant.""  And I saw that with a lancet he had made an incision in her"
"delicate wrist, and there was blood there.  ""She is in a state of"
"catalepsy, and we must do all in our power to bring her round."""
"""But do you think you can?""  I cried."
"""I hope so."""
"""Do your best, Dick,"" I implored.  ""Save her, for my sake."""
"""Rely upon me,"" he answered calmly, adding: ""Run along to Number 18 in"
the boulevard--the corner house on the right--and bring Doctor Trepard
"at once.  He lives au troisieme.  Tell him that I sent you, and that the"
"matter is one of life or death.""  He scribbled some words on a card,"
"and, giving it me, added: ""Tell him to bring this.  Meanwhile, I will"
"commence artificial respiration.  Go!"""
"""But do you think she will really recover?""  I demanded."
"""I can't tell.  We have already lost so much time.  I had no idea of the"
truth.  It has surprised me just as it has surprised you.  This moment
"is not one for words, but for actions.  Don't lose an instant."""
"Thus urged, I snatched up my hat and tore along the boulevard like a"
"madman.  Without difficulty I found Trepard's appartement, and on being"
"admitted found him a grave-faced, rather stout old Frenchman, who, on"
the instant I mentioned Dick's name and gave him the card with the words
"upon it, naming some drugs he required, went into an adjoining room, and"
"fetched a phial of tiny red pillules, which he held up to the light."
"Then he put on his hat, and descended with me to the street.  A fiacre"
"was passing, which we took, and five minutes later we were standing"
"""Don't be afraid, Sidney,"" Mart spoke calmly. ""You sort o' belong to"
the Cape and we Cape folks don't think anything of drowning. We sort of
"expect to, sometime--"" But here her voice broke with a tremble. ""I--I"
was thinking of gran'ma. I wish I'd been better to her. I talk back to
"her lots of times when I shouldn't."""
"""But you _are_ good to her, Mart. And--_I_ was thinking of Aunt Achsa."
I shouldn't have deceived her--about coming out here. I fooled myself
into thinking that even a lie didn't matter considering what we were
trying to do. But the honor of Cape Cod isn't worth anything happening
to Lav. And if anything does happen there won't be anyone to tell about
"Jed Starrow, anyway! Oh, Mart, I can't bear to _think_ about Lav. Why"
"did we let him do it? Dear old Lav. I've been mean to him, too. He"
adores poetry and I--I never even told him that my father was a poet
and that I know lots and lots of poems and--and--that I've written most
"a book myself."""
"""Honest, Sid, was your father a poet? And you can write it yourself?"
"Gee,"" softly. ""I wish I could do something like that. I'd rather be"
like that than anything else. I just pretend that I hate school and
books and such things--it's because I had to stop going to school to
stay with gran'ma that I've put on that I didn't have any use for it.
"Even when I was sort of laughing at you, Sid, down in my heart I was"
feeling aw'fly proud that you'd want to fool 'round with anyone like
"me--I'll _always_ be proud."""
"""Oh, Mart--"" Sidney faltered. ""I wish I could put into words what Mr."
Dugald taught me when I first came here. That it's the big inside
things that really count. He told me so's I'd see Aunt Achsa and Lav as

the table-cloth.
... But one day I managed to get a pair of scissors and—would you
"believe it, madam? I cut off all my hair; snipped it off all in bits,"
like the little monkey I was. Grandfather was _furious_! He caught hold
of the tongs—I shall never forget it—grabbed me by the hand and shut my
fingers in them. “That’ll teach you!” he said. It was a fearful burn.
I’ve got the mark of it to-day.
"... Well, you see, madam, he’d taken such pride in my hair. He used to"
"sit me up on the counter, before the customers came, and do it"
"something beautiful—big, soft curls and waved over the top. I remember"
"the assistants standing round, and me ever so solemn with the penny"
grandfather gave me to hold while it was being done.... But he always
"took the penny back afterwards. Poor grandfather! Wild, he was, at the"
fright I’d made of myself. But he frightened me that time. Do you know
"what I did, madam? I ran away. Yes, I did, round the corners, in and"
"out, I don’t know how far I didn’t run. Oh, dear, I must have looked a"
"sight, with my hand rolled up in my pinny and my hair sticking out."
People must have laughed when they saw me....
"... No, madam, grandfather never got over it. He couldn’t bear the"
"sight of me after. Couldn’t eat his dinner, even, if I was there. So my"
"aunt took me. She was a cripple, an upholstress. Tiny! She had to stand"
on the sofas when she wanted to cut out the backs. And it was helping
her I met my lady....
"... Not so very, madam. I was thirteen, turned. And I don’t remember"
"ever feeling—well—a child, as you might say. You see there was my"
"uniform, and one thing and another. My lady put me into collars and"
cuffs from the first. Oh yes—once I did! That was—funny! It was like
this. My lady had her two little nieces staying with her—we were at
"""I can not trust you,"" he said again, ""nor can I turn back. But there"
is one thing from the past which can not be changed. I love you. It
seems that must remain through all my life. And because of that love I
"must save you from the death that awaits your countrymen."" He smiled"
"in faint self-contempt. ""It is not for your sake that I shall save"
"you; it is because I am too great a coward, and can not face the"
"thought that anything so horrible should come near you."" He turned to"
two native soldiers behind him and gave an order. When he faced
Beatrice again he saw that she held a revolver in her hand.
"""You do not understand,"" she said. ""You say you mean to save me, but"
"that is not in your power. It is in your power to save us all, but not"
"one alone. I know what my people have resolved to do. There are weak,"
"frightened women among them, but not one of them will fall into your"
"hands alive. Whatever happens, I shall share their fate."""
"Though her tone was quiet and free from all bravado, he knew that she"
"was not boasting. He knew, too, that she was desperate."
"""You can not force me to kill you,"" he said sternly."
"""I think it possible,"" she answered. She was breathing quickly, and"
"her eyes were bright with a reckless, feverish excitement. But the"
hand that held the revolver pointed at the men behind him was
steady--steadier than his own.
Nehal Singh motioned back the two natives who had advanced at his
order.
"""You play a dangerous game,"" he said, ""and, as before, your strength"
lies in my weakness--in my folly. But this time you can not win. My
"... Yes, madam, it was all left to me. Oh, she did look sweet. I did"
"her hair, soft-like, round her forehead, all in dainty curls, and just"
to one side of her neck I put a bunch of most beautiful purple pansies.
"Those pansies made a picture of her, madam! I shall never forget them."
"I thought to-night, when I looked at my lady, “Now, if only the pansies"
was there no one could tell the difference.”
"... Only the last year, madam. Only after she’d got a"
"little—well—feeble as you might say. Of course, she was never"
dangerous; she was the sweetest old lady. But how it took her was—she
"thought she’d lost something. She couldn’t keep still, she couldn’t"
"settle. All day long she’d be up and down, up and down; you’d meet her"
"everywhere,—on the stairs, in the porch, making for the kitchen. And"
"she’d look up at you, and she’d say—just like a child, “I’ve lost it,"
"I’ve lost it.” “Come along,” I’d say, “come along, and I’ll lay out"
your patience for you.” But she’d catch me by the hand—I was a
"favourite of hers—and whisper, “Find it for me, Ellen. Find it for me.”"
"Sad, wasn’t it?"
"... No, she never recovered, madam. She had a stroke at the end. Last"
"words she ever said was—very slow, “Look in—the—Look—in—” And then she"
was gone.
"... No, madam, I can’t say I noticed it. Perhaps some girls. But you"
"see, it’s like this, I’ve got nobody but my lady. My mother died of"
"consumption when I was four, and I lived with my grandfather, who kept"
a hair-dresser’s shop. I used to spend all my time in the shop under a
"table dressing my doll’s hair—copying the assistants, I suppose. They"
"were ever so kind to me. Used to make me little wigs, all colours, the"
"latest fashions and all. And there I’d sit all day, quiet as quiet—the"
customers never knew. Only now and again I’d take my peep from under
"""So it is, after all, a bargain that you offer me!"" he said. ""You are"
"trying to save them. You offer a high price, but I am not a merchant."
"I can not buy you, Beatrice."""
"""It is not a bargain!"" For the first time she faltered, taken aback by"
"the pitiless logic of his words. ""Can't you see that? Can't you see"
"that, however much I loved you, I could not act otherwise than implore"
you to turn back from a step that means destruction for those bound to
"me by blood and country? Could I do less?"""
"""No,"" he said slowly."
She held out her hands to him.
"""Oh, Nehal, turn back while there is yet time! For my sake, for yours,"
"for us all, turn back from a bloody, cruel revenge. The power is"
"yours. Be generous. If we have wronged you, we have suffered and are"
"ready to atone. _I_ am ready to atone. I _can_ atone, because I love"
you. I have spoken the truth to you. I have laid my soul bare to you
"as I have done to no other being. Won't you trust me?"""
"His eyes met hers with a somber, hopeless significance which cut her"
to the heart.
"""I can't,"" he said. ""I can't. That is what you have taught me--to"
"distrust you--and every one."""
"She stood silent now, paralyzed by the finality of his words and"
gesture. It was as though the shadow of her heartless folly had risen
"before her and become an iron wall of unrelenting, measured"
retribution against which she beat herself in vain. He lifted his head
"higher, seeming to gather together his shaken powers of self-control."
"gone in."""
"I stand there waiting to be at hand, to rush in to the rescue, for after"
"all I am a human being, not a brute. Several minutes pass. He has not even"
"bothered to be very quiet, for I hear him clicking the key in the lock."
"Surely I ought to hear a cry now? I hear nothing, nothing; a chair"
"scraping across the floor, that is all."
"""But good heavens, he may do her some harm! He may injure her; he may"
overpower her with rape! Ought I not to tap on the window? I--what for?
"But at the very first cry, I shall be on the spot, take my word for it."""
Not a single cry.
The hours pass; I have settled down to wait. Of course I cannot go my way
and desert a helpless woman. But the hours wear on. A very thorough
"business in there, nothing niggardly about this; it is almost dawn. It"
"occurs to me that he may be killing her, perhaps has killed her already; I"
am alarmed and about to get up--when the key clicks in the lock again and
"Solem emerges. He does not run, but walks back the way he came, down to"
the veranda of my own house. There he hangs the actor's raincoat where it
"hung before, and emerges again. But this time he is naked. He has been"
naked under the coat all this time. Is it possible? Why not? No
"inhibitions, no restraint, no covering; Solem has thought it all out. Now,"
"stark naked, he stalks to his room."
What a man!
I sit thinking and collecting myself and regaining my wits. What has
"happened? The south wing is still wrapped in silence, but the lady is not"
"dead; I can see that from Solem's fearless manner as he goes to his room,"
"lights the lamp, and goes to bed."
thought that she might go to the arms of another man made him put down
his violin with a feeling of actual sickness.  Why not?  That deep and
fearful whipping of the sexual instinct which makes the ache of jealousy
so truly terrible was at its full in such a nature as Fiorsen's.  He drew
"a long breath and shuddered.  The remembrance of her fastidious pride,"
"her candour, above all her passivity cut in across his fear.  No, not"
Gyp!
"He went to a little table whereon stood a tantalus, tumblers, and a"
"syphon, and pouring out some brandy, drank.  It steadied him.  And he"
began to practise.  He took a passage from Brahms' violin concerto and
"began to play it over and over.  Suddenly, he found he was repeating the"
same flaws each time; he was not attending.  The fingering of that thing
was ghastly!  Music-lessons!  Why did she take them?  Waste of time and
"money--she would never be anything but an amateur!  Ugh!  Unconsciously,"
he had stopped playing.  Had she gone there to-day?  It was past
lunch-time.  Perhaps she had come in.
He put down his violin and went back to the house.  No sign of her! The
maid came to ask if he would lunch.  No!  Was the mistress to be in?  She
"had not said.  He went into the dining-room, ate a biscuit, and drank a"
"brandy and soda.  It steadied him.  Lighting a cigarette, he came back to"
the drawing-room and sat down at Gyp's bureau.  How tidy!  On the little
"calendar, a pencil-cross was set against to-day--Wednesday, another"
"against Friday.  What for? Music-lessons!  He reached to a pigeon-hole,"
"and took out her address-book.  ""H--Harmost, 305A, Marylebone Road,"" and"
"against it the words in pencil, ""3 P.M."""
Three o'clock.  So that was her hour!  His eyes rested idly on a little
"old coloured print of a Bacchante, with flowing green scarf, shaking a"
"tambourine at a naked Cupid, who with a baby bow and arrow in his hands,"
was gazing up at her.  He turned it over; on the back was written in a
and the framed photographs on the walls and the array of grease paints
on the dressing-table. John walked up and down the narrow space in great
perplexity of mind. Herold was right. He could not introduce Unity Blake
"into lodgings, saying that he had adopted her. Landladies would not"
"stand it. Even if they would, what in the world could he do with her?"
Could he move into a house or a flat and persuade a registry-office
to provide him with a paragon of a housekeeper? That would be more
"practicable. But, even then, what did he know of the training, moral and"
"spiritual, necessary for a girl of fifteen? He was not going to employ"
her as a servant. On that he was decided. What sort of a position she
"should have he did not know; but her floor-scrubbing, dish-scraping days"
were over. She should have ease of life and loving care--his own phrase
stuck in his head--especially loving care; and he was the only person in
the world who could see that she got it. She must live under his roof.
That was indisputable. But how? In lodgings or a flat? He went angrily
round and round the vicious circle.
"When Herold returned, he dragged him round and round, too, until Perkins"
appeared to help him to change for the third act. Then John had to stop.
He clapped on his hat. He must go and work.
“And you have n't a single suggestion to make?” he asked.
"“I have one,” said Herold, fastening his shirt-studs while Perkins was"
buttoning his boots. “But it's so commonplace and unromantic that you 'd
wreck the dressing-room if I made it.”
"“Well, what is it?” He stood, his hand on the door-knob."
"“You 've got a maiden aunt somewhere, have n't you?”"
"“Oh, don't talk rot!” said John. “I'm dead serious.”"
Once again I am at an age when I walk in the moonlight. Thirty years ago I
"walked in the moonlight, too, walked on crackling, snowy roads, on bare,"
"frozen ground, round unlocked barns, on the hunt for love. How well I"
remember it! But it is no longer the same moonlight. I could even read by
it the letter she gave me. But there are no such letters any more.
"Everything is changed. The tale is told, and tonight I walk abroad on an"
"errand of the head, not of the heart: I shall go across to the trading"
center and dispatch a knapsack by the steamer; after that I shall wander
"on. And that requires nothing but a little ordinary training in walking,"
"and the light of the moon to see by. But in those old days, those young"
"days, we studied the almanac in the autumn to find out if there would be a"
"moon on Twelfth Night, for we could use it then."
Everything is changed; I am changed. The tale lies within the teller.
They say that old age has other pleasures which youth has not: deeper
"pleasures, more lasting pleasures. That is a lie. Yes, you have read"
"right: that is a lie. Only old age itself says this, in a self-interest"
that flaunts its very rags. The old man has forgotten when he stood on the
"summit, forgotten his own self, his own _alias_, red and white,"
"blowing a golden horn. Now he stands no longer--no, he sits--it is less of"
"a strain to sit. But now there comes to him, slow and halting, fat and"
"stupid, the honor of old age. What can a sitting man do with honor? A man"
on his feet can use it; to a sitting man it is only a possession. But
"honor is meant to be used, not to be sat with."
Let sitting men wear warm stockings.

"""Oh, no, we shan't,"" I remarked calmly, for I had moved to a position"
"of tactical advantage on the Marine's port beam. ""We will have the"
"story here, if you don't mind, Dawson."""
"He stamped pettishly on the floor, whipped off his cap, and spun it"
"across the room. ""Confound you, Mr. Copplestone!"" he growled. ""How"
"the--how the--do you do it?"" He could not think of an expletive mild"
"enough for Mrs. Cary's ears. ""There's something about me that I can't"
"hide. What is it? If you don't tell, I will get you on the Regulation"
compelling all British subjects to answer questions addressed to them
"by a competent naval or military authority."""
"""You don't happen to be either, Dawson,"" said I unkindly. ""And,"
"beside, there was never yet a law made which could compel a man to"
"speak or a woman to hold her tongue. Some day perhaps, if you are"
"good, I will show you how the trick is done. But not yet. I want to"
have something to bargain with when you cast me into jail. Out with
"the story; we are impatient. If I mistake not, you come to us Dawson"
"triumphant. You haven't the air of a broken man."""
"""I have been successful,"" he answered gravely, ""but I am a long, long"
"way from feeling triumphant. No, thank you, Mrs. Cary, I have had my"
"breakfast, but if I might trouble you for a cup of coffee? Many"
"thanks."""
"Dawson sat down, and Cary moved about inspecting him from every angle."
"""No,"" declared he at last, ""I cannot see the smallest resemblance, not"
the smallest. You were thin; now you are distinctly plump. Your hair
was nearly white. Your cheeks had fallen in as if your back teeth were
"missing. Your lower lip stuck out."" Dawson smiled, highly gratified."
"""I took in all my people at the office this morning,"" he said. ""They"
"have left him long ago,' she said, 'but I tried to save him. Thank God"
"we have no children,' That seemed to be her most insistent thought,"
for she repeated it over and over again. 'Thank God that we have no
"children.'"""
"""I hope that you were gentle with her, Dawson,"" said I, deeply moved."
Long ago the wife had come to me and pleaded for her husband. She had
"shed no tear; she had admitted the justice, the necessity, of my"
"sentence. ""Can you not give him another chance?"" she had asked. ""No,"""
"I had answered sadly. ""He has exhausted all the chances."" When she had"
"risen to go and I had pressed her hand, she had said, still dry-eyed,"
"""You are right, sir, it is no use, no use at all. Thank God that we"
"have no children."""
"""I hope that you were gentle with her, Dawson,"" I repeated."
"He astonished me by the suddenness of his explosion. ""Damn,"" roared"
"he--""damn and blast! Do you think that I am a brute. Gentle! It was as"
"much as I could do not to kiss the woman, as your little daughter"
"kissed me, and to promise that I would get her husband off somehow."
"But I should not be a friend to her if I tried to save that man."""
"So Dawson had soft spots in his armour of callousness, and little"
Jane's instinct was far surer than mine. She had taken to him at
"sight. When I tried to get from her why, why he had so marked an"
"attraction for her, her replies baffled me more than the central fact."
"""I love Colonel Dawson. He is a nice man. He has a little girl like"
me. Her name is Clara. Her birthday is next month. I shall save up my
pocket money and send Clara a present. I like Colonel Dawson better
"even than dear Bailey."" I tore my hair, for ""Bailey"" is a wholly"
"imaginary friend of little Jane, whom I invented one evening at her"
bedside and who has grown gradually into a personage of clearly
"assuring myself that there was no other body near, and peered into her"
"face, I saw that it was seamed and wrinkled. She was barefoot, and her"
clothes were foul and mean. She had the reek of one who slept in
ditches and washed seldom. Her toothless gums grinned at me. She was a
horrible mockery of all that men love in women.
"When I had marked so much, I stood up again, my head reeling. Where"
was the man I had seen scouting up and down? Where was Marie? For a
"moment the wild idea that she had become this thing, that death or"
"magic had transformed the fair young girl into this toothless hag, was"
"not too wild for me. An owl hooted in the distance, and I started and"
shivered and stood looking round me fearfully. Such things were; and
"Marie was gone. In her place this woman, grim and dead and unsightly,"
lay at my feet. What was I to think?
"I got no answer. I raised my voice and called, trembling, on Marie. I"
"ran to one side of the road and the other and called, and still got no"
"answer. I climbed the mound on which the ash-tree stood, and sent my"
voice thrilling through the darkness of the bottom. But only the owl
"answered. Then, knowing nothing else I could do, I went down wringing"
"my hands, and found my lady standing over the body in the road. She"
had come back with Steve and the others.
"I had to listen to their amazement, and a hundred guesses and fancies,"
"which, God help me! had nothing certain in them, and gave me no help."
"The men searched both sides of the road, and beat the moor for a"
"distance, and tried to track the horse--for that was missing too, and"
there lay my only hope--but to no purpose. At last my lady came to me
and said sorrowfully that nothing more could be done.
'In the morning!' I cried jealously.
"themselves together, back to her breast, higher than which they dared not"
mount.  Their infinite embarrassment struck Gyp.  She could almost hear
"him thinking: 'Now, how can I discuss it with this attractive young"
"female, wife of the scoundrel who's ruined my daughter?  Delicate-that's"
what it is!'  Then the words burst hoarsely from him.
"""This is an unpleasant business, ma'am.  I don't know what to say. Reelly"
"I don't.  It's awkward; it's very awkward."""
Gyp said quietly:
"""Your daughter is desperately unhappy; and that can't be good for her"
"just now."""
"Mr. Wagge's thick figure seemed to writhe.  ""Pardon me, ma'am,"" he"
"spluttered, ""but I must call your husband a scoundrel.  I'm sorry to be"
"impolite, but I must do it.  If I had 'im 'ere, I don't know that I"
"should be able to control myself--I don't indeed.""  Gyp made a movement"
"of her gloved hands, which he seemed to interpret as sympathy, for he"
"went on in a stream of husky utterance: ""It's a delicate thing before a"
"lady, and she the injured party; but one has feelings.  From the first I"
said this dancin' was in the face of Providence; but women have no more
sense than an egg.  Her mother she would have it; and now she's got it!
"Career, indeed! Pretty career!  Daughter of mine!  I tell you, ma'am, I'm"
angry; there's no other word for it--I'm angry.  If that scoundrel comes
"within reach of me, I shall mark 'im--I'm not a young man, but I shall"
"mark 'im.  An' what to say to you, I'm sure I don't know. That my"
"daughter should be'ave like that!  Well, it's made a difference to me."
An' now I suppose her name'll be dragged in the mud.  I tell you frankly
"I 'oped you wouldn't hear of it, because after all the girl's got her"
punishment.  And this divorce-court--it's not nice--it's a horrible thing
"for respectable people.  And, mind you, I won't see my girl married to"
offence had only been that of loving her.
"Fiorsen had been taken to her room, which was larger and cooler than his"
own; and the maid was standing by the side of the bed with a scared face.
Gyp signed to her to go.  He opened his eyes presently:
"""Gyp!  Oh!  Gyp!  Is it you?  The devilish, awful things I see--don't go"
"away again!  Oh, Gyp!""  With a sob he raised himself and rested his"
forehead against her.  And Gyp felt--as on the first night he came home
drunk--a merging of all other emotions in the desire to protect and heal.
"""It's all right, all right,"" she murmured.  ""I'm going to stay. Don't"
"worry about anything.  Keep quite quiet, and you'll soon be well."""
"In a quarter of an hour, he was asleep.  His wasted look went to her"
"heart, and that expression of terror which had been coming and going"
until he fell asleep!  Anything to do with the brain was so horrible!
Only too clear that she must stay--that his recovery depended on her.
"She was still sitting there, motionless, when the doctor came, and,"
"seeing him asleep, beckoned her out.  He looked a kindly man, with two"
"waistcoats, the top one unbuttoned; and while he talked, he winked at Gyp"
"involuntarily, and, with each wink, Gyp felt that he ripped the veil off"
one more domestic secret.  Sleep was the ticket--the very ticket for him!
Had something on his mind--yes!  And--er--a little given to--brandy?  Ah!
all that must stop!  Stomach as well as nerves affected.  Seeing
things--nasty things--sure sign.  Perhaps not a very careful life before
marriage.  And married--how long?  His kindly appreciative eyes swept Gyp
"from top to toe.  Year and a half!  Quite so!  Hard worker at his violin,"
too?  No doubt!  Musicians always a little inclined to be immoderate--too
much sense of beauty--burn the candle at both ends!  She must see to
"that.  She had been away, had she not--staying with her father?  Yes."
But--no one like a wife for nursing.  As to treatment?  Well!  One would
"being like a chest of drawers, or pigeon holes to hold the dead. Tufts"
of dark and plumy cypresses rise among the flat graves of the enclosure.
"In the south, cemeteries are walled off and isolated very tight. The"
"dead, as it were, are kept fast in pound. There is no spreading of"
"graves over the face of the country. They are penned in a tight fold,"
with cypresses to fatten on the bones. This is the one thoroughly
"strange note in the landscape. But all-pervading there is a strangeness,"
"that strange feeling as if the _depths_ were barren, which comes in the"
"south and the east, sun-stricken. Sun-stricken, and the heart eaten out"
by the dryness.
"""I like it! I like it!"" cries the q-b."
"""But could you live here?"" She would like to say yes, but daren't."
We stray back. The q-b wants to buy one of those saddle-bag
arrangements. I say what for? She says to keep things in. Ach! but
"peeping in the shops, we see one and go in and examine it. It is quite a"
"sound one, properly made: but plain, quite plain. On the white"
cross-stripes there are no lovely colored flowers of rose and green and
magenta: the three favorite Sardinian colors: nor are there any of the
fantastic and griffin-like beasts. So it won't do. How much does it
cost? Forty-five francs.
There is nothing to do in Mandas. So we will take the morning train and
"go to the terminus, to Sorgono. Thus, we shall cross the lower slopes of"
"the great central knot of Sardinia, the mountain knot called"
Gennargentu. And Sorgono we feel will be lovely.
"Back at the station we make tea on the spirit lamp, fill the thermos,"
"pack the knapsack and the kitchenino, and come out into the sun of the"
"platform. The q-b goes to thank the black-cap for the white bread,"
aside o' me an' smothers me with earth. Then another'n bursts an' I
"'ears a man 'oller out--krikey, 'e didn't 'alf scream. I gets up and"
"another'n bursts, so I flops down agin, but it didn't come so near that"
time. I waits a bit an' then I gets up an' goes to see what they done. I
"couldn't see nothin' at first, but I sees some fellers runnin' about wi'"
"lights. There was a noise in one o' the wards, so I goes in. A bomb must"
'a' burst on the roof--there was a big 'ole in the canvas. The bed
"underneath was all twisted an' torn, but there wasn't nobody in it."
"There was some wounded lyin' in beds at the fur end of the ward, an' one"
of 'em was cryin' somethin' chronic. Then someone brings a light an' I
sees an orderly lyin' by the side o' the bed with a big 'ole in 'is face
an' the blood pourin' out. I goes roun' to the other side--gorblimy--an'
there I sees the Sister lyin' on the floor with 'er 'ead blown clean
"off--I dunno where it was blown to, I couldn't see it nowhere. Krikey,"
it wasn't 'alf a sight to see 'er body without a 'ead lyin' in a pool o'
"blood. It made me feel sick, so I ran orf an' came 'ere."""
Private Trotter was trembling in every limb. He was the pluckiest man I
ever knew and capable of any piece of foolhardy daring. But this time he
was near a nervous breakdown.
"We went to bed full of anxiety. For a long while we lay awake, straining"
our ears to catch the sound of firing or the drone of German propellers.
"But no sound broke the stillness of the night, and one by one we dropped"
off to sleep.
The next morning was clear and sunny. The sky remained blue all day. Not
"a cloud could be seen. ""Our turn next""--that was the thought in"
everybody's mind.
The evening was starlit once again. As we lay on the floor of the
"marquee, wrapped up in our blankets, we heard the sound of bombing and"
"After they had eaten, the king's daughter said: ""O, do look at the"
"handsome apples up there on the tree! If you were really kind, you would"
"fetch me down a couple of them!"" The youth was not lazy, and climbed up."
"But he had forgotten his table-cloth and his purse, and these she took."
And while he was shaking down the apples his cap fell off. She at once
"put it on and wished herself back in her own room, and there she was"
that minute.
"""You might have known it,"" said the youth to himself, and hurried down"
the tree. He began to cry and did not know what to do. And as he was
"sitting there, he sampled the apples which he had thrown down. No sooner"
"had he tried one than he had a strange feeling in his head, and when he"
"looked more closely, he had a pair of horns. ""Well, now it can do me no"
"more harm,"" said he, and calmly went on eating the apples. But suddenly"
"the horns had disappeared, and he was as before. ""Good enough!"" said the"
"youth. And with that he put the apples in his pocket, and set out to"
search for the king's daughter.
"He went from city to city, and sailed from country to country; but it"
"was a long journey, and lasted a year and a day, and even longer."
"But one day he got there after all. It was a Sunday, and he found out"
that the king's daughter was at church. Then he sat himself down with
"his apples before the church door, and pretended to be a peddler."
"""Apples of Damascus! Apples of Damascus!"" he cried. And sure enough, the"
"king's daughter came, and told her maidens to go and see what desirable"
"things the peddler from abroad might have to offer. Yes, he had apples"
"of Damascus. ""What do the apples give one?"" asked the maiden. ""Wisdom"
"and beauty!"" said the peddler, and the maiden bought."
"When the king's daughter had eaten of the apples, she had a pair of"
horns. And then there was such a wailing in the castle that it was
"back of her hand with a most unchildlike gesture, and forthwith"
concealed it in her silken _faja_. Then she laid her hand once more on
the Sergeant's arm.
"""You will lead us, will you not, José Maria?"" she said pleadingly. ""I"
can trust you. You have done many great deeds. My nurse was a woman of
Ronda and told me of your exploits on the road from Madrid to Sevilla.
You will lead us to-night. Only you must leave these three in the palace
"to me. If you will, you shall have also my share of the plunder. But"
"what do I say, I know you are too noble to think only of that--as these"
"wolves do!"""
She cast a haughty glance around upon the gipsies at their card-play.
"""I, that am of Old Castile and noble by four descents, have demeaned"
"myself to mix with _Gitanos_,"" she said, ""but it has only been that I"
might work out my revenge. I told Pépe there of my plan. I showed him
"the way. He was afraid. He told ten men, and they were afraid. Fifty,"
"and they were afraid. Now there are a hundred and more, and were it not"
"that they know that all lies open and unguarded, even I could not lead"
"them thither. But they will follow you, because you are José Maria of"
"Ronda."" The Sergeant took the girl's hand in his. She was shaking as"
"with an ague fit, but her eyes, blue and mild as a summer sky, had that"
within them which was deadlier than the tricksome slippery demon that
"lurks in all black orbs, whether masculine or feminine."
"""Chica,"" he said, ""your wrongs are indeed bitter. I would give much to"
help you to set the balance right. Perhaps I may do so yet. But I cannot
be the commander of these men. They are not of my folk or country. They
have not even asked me to lead them. They are jealous of me! You see it
"as well as I!"""
"the slightest; is it not so?  Have you met before, since that evening in"
"the water theatre when I did first present you to each other?"""
"""I have seen her but once between,"" answered Grey, still in the same"
"quiet, stunned fashion; and when they had entered the house, he made"
"excuse to go at once to his room, declining all proffer of refreshment"
or further converse.
"Lord Sandford looked after him with an intent look upon his face, which"
"slowly clouded over, till there was something almost malignant and"
ferocious in his aspect.
"""So it is as I thought.  He has been hit, and hard hit.  Where can he"
"have seen her in the interim?  They would not have been standing thus,"
"talking thus, if some bond had not been established between them.  Yet I"
thought I had kept an eye upon him.  I knew there might be danger.  I
saw it the first moment that they met.  There is something akin in their
natures.  They feel it themselves. Hr-r-r-rr! that must be put a stop
to.  I will have no rival in Geraldine’s heart.  She does not love me
"yet; but she fears me a little, and she thinks of me. That is no bad"
"basis to build upon.  I shall win her yet, if I have a fair field.  But"
"a rival—no, that must not be!  And yet I read somewhat in her eyes"
to-night which had not been there before.  The fiend take all false
"friends!  I must rid myself of this one, and that speedily.  I have"
"liked him; but he shall not stand in my way.  Well, ’tis I have made"
him: I can quickly unmake him.  Let me but think of the way and the
"means.  Grey Dumaresq, you are a pretty fellow and a pleasant comrade;"
but you shall never be suffered to stand in the light of Sandford’s
"hopes and plans and desires.  Look to yourself, my friend; for evil is"
"abroad for you!"""
"""Yes, master, and so I am; and this is the hostelry at Hampstead where I"
have taken up my quarters with the horse; and hither it was that you
"came yestere’en, with Lord Sandford and his friends, to be ready for the"
match to-day.  But beshrew me if I did think yesterday you would be fit
for the saddle to-day!  Is it strange I should mutter and grumble to
"myself when such things happen?"""
"""Nay now, what things, good Dicon?  I pray you tell me,"" spoke Grey, as"
"he drained at one draught the ice-cold water, and drew a long breath of"
"relief. ""I feel like a man waking from a strange and fevered dream; for,"
"in sooth, I know but little of what has been passing these last days."
Some strange madness seems to have possessed me.  I had meant to say
"farewell to Lord Sandford and his world, and seek mine own fortunes in"
some other field.  Yet methinks I have not made the break.  I have
visions of wild orgies and furious gaming—such as I held aloof from
"before.  Dicon, I fear me I have made a desperate fool of myself, and of"
"my fortunes too.  Tell me, what money have I with me now?"""
"""Not much, master.  I took what you had—a matter of some twenty guineas"
perhaps.  I have it safe in a bag.  But surely that is not all.  You had
"won a fortune, you did tell me—"""
"""Ay, and now I have lost it.  I can recollect how the guineas flew, and"
"how the stakes were doubled, and how I lost again and yet again.  I take"
"it I am a ruined man, good Dicon.  These twenty guineas saved from the"
"wreck are all the fortune I possess, and belike it is better so—better"
"so."""
"""Better!"" echoed the dismayed Dick; ""nay, my master.  But you will win"
it back again.  The luck cannot always be against you.  Think how it was
"at the first!"""
"Fiorsen, who had leaped out of bed, put his hand to his head.  The cursed"
"fellow!  Cursed be every one of them--the father and the girl, Rosek and"
all the other sharks!  He went out on to the landing.  The house was
"quite still below.  Rosek had gone--good riddance!  He called, ""Gyp!""  No"
answer.  He went into her room. Its superlative daintiness struck his
fancy.  A scent of cyclamen! He looked out into the garden.  There was
"the baby at the end, and that fat woman.  No Gyp!  Never in when she was"
"wanted.  Wagge!  He shivered; and, going back into his bedroom, took a"
brandy-bottle from a locked cupboard and drank some.  It steadied him; he
"locked up the cupboard again, and dressed."
"Going out to the music-room, he stopped under the trees to make passes"
with his fingers at the baby.  Sometimes he felt that it was an adorable
"little creature, with its big, dark eyes so like Gyp's. Sometimes it"
"excited his disgust--a discoloured brat.  This morning, while looking at"
"it, he thought suddenly of the other that was coming--and grimaced."
Catching Betty's stare of horrified amazement at the face he was making
"at her darling, he burst into a laugh and turned away into the"
music-room.
"While he was keying up his violin, Gyp's conduct in never having come"
there for so long struck him as bitterly unjust.  The girl--who cared
about the wretched girl?  As if she made any real difference!  It was all
"so much deeper than that.  Gyp had never loved him, never given him what"
"he wanted, never quenched his thirst of her!  That was the heart of it."
No other woman he had ever had to do with had been like that--kept his
thirst unquenched. No; he had always tired of them before they tired of
him.  She gave him nothing really--nothing!  Had she no heart or did she
give it elsewhere?  What was that Paul had said about her music-lessons?
"And suddenly it struck him that he knew nothing, absolutely nothing, of"
where she went or what she did.  She never told him anything.
"Music-lessons?  Every day, nearly, she went out, was away for hours.  The"
"cold, frosty; Gyp hurried down the path.  Four little icicles had formed"
"beneath the window of the music-room.  They caught her eye, and, passing"
"round to the side, she broke one off. There must be a fire in there, for"
she could see the flicker through the curtains not quite drawn.
"Thoughtful Ellen had been airing it!  But, suddenly, she stood still."
There was more than a fire in there!  Through the chink in the drawn
curtains she had seen two figures seated on the divan.  Something seemed
to spin round in her head.  She turned to rush away.  Then a kind of
"superhuman coolness came to her, and she deliberately looked in. He and"
Daphne Wing!  His arm was round her neck.  The girl's face riveted her
"eyes.  It was turned a little back and up, gazing at him, the lips"
"parted, the eyes hypnotized, adoring; and her arm round him seemed to"
"shiver--with cold, with ecstasy?"
Again that something went spinning through Gyp's head.  She raised her
"hand.  For a second it hovered close to the glass.  Then, with a sick"
"feeling, she dropped it and turned away."
Never!  Never would she show him or that girl that they could hurt her!
Never!  They were safe from any scene she would make--safe in their nest!
"And blindly, across the frosty grass, through the unlighted drawing-room,"
"she went upstairs to her room, locked the door, and sat down before the"
fire.  Pride raged within her.  She stuffed her handkerchief between her
teeth and lips; she did it unconsciously.  Her eyes felt scorched from
"the fire-flames, but she did not trouble to hold her hand before them."
Suddenly she thought: 'Suppose I HAD loved him?' and laughed.  The
"handkerchief dropped to her lap, and she looked at it with wonder--it was"
"blood-stained.  She drew back in the chair, away from the scorching of"
"the fire, and sat quite still, a smile on her lips. That girl's eyes,"
"like a little adoring dog's--that girl, who had fawned on her so!  She"
"had got her ""distinguished man""!  She sprang up and looked at herself in"
"thorns? If we could gather the flowers and find no thorns, we should not"
"care for them. The more the thorns, the more valuable the blossoms.'"
"So they said, and they gathered the blossoms, and they faded. But the"
thorns did not fade; they were ever there. The more blossoms a man had
"gathered, the more thorns he had to wear, and Time was ever behind him."
"They wanted to rest in the glades, but Time willed that ever they must"
"go forward; no going back, no rest, ever and ever on. So they grew very"
weary.
"'These flowers,' they said at last, 'are always the same. We are tired"
of them; their smell is heavy; they are dead. This forest is full of
thorns only. How shall we escape from it? Ever as we go round and round
"we hate the flowers more, we feel the thorns more acutely. We must"
"escape! We are sick of Time and his whip, our feet are very, very weary,"
"our eyes are dazzled and dim. We, too, would seek the Peace. We laughed"
at those before who went along the rocky path; we did not want peace;
but now it seems to us the most beautiful thing in the world. Will Time
never cease to drive us on and on? Will these lights _never_ cease to
flash to and fro?'
Each man at last will turn to the straight road. He will find out. Every
"man will find out at last that the forest is hateful, that the flowers"
"are deadly, that the thorns are terrible; every man will learn to fear"
Time.
"Then, when the longing for peace has come, he will go to the straight"
way and find it; no man will remain in the forest for ever. He will
"learn. When he is very, very weary, when his feet are full of thorns,"
"and his back scarred with the lashes of Time--great, kindly Time, the"
schoolmaster of the world--he will learn.
much in all my life and I implored him not to report me. I don't
"remember what happened next, I was in such a state. But he did report"
me. I got a court martial and was sentenced to death for sleeping at my
post. They put me into the guard-room and I expected to be shot the next
"day. It was a rotten feeling, I can tell you. I didn't think about"
myself so much as about the wife and the little boy. I wouldn't go
through a night like that again for anything. But I went to sleep all
the same. I woke up the next morning when someone came into the
"guard-room. I didn't know where I was for a second or two, and then in a"
flash I realized I'd got to die. I don't mind admitting that I rested my
face against the wall and blubbered like a kid. Anyone would have done
"the same, I don't care what you say. But the man who'd just come in"
said:
"""'Pull yourself together, old chap--you're all right for to-day,"
anyhow.' I sat bolt upright and stared at him.
"""'They're not going to shoot me?'"
"""'Not to-day,' he answered. 'Cheer up, all sorts of things might happen"
before to-morrow.'
"""The joy I felt was so big that I can't tell you how big it was. But I"
soon felt miserable again. I couldn't understand what had happened. I
didn't know whether I was going to die or live. The uncertainty became
so terrible that I wished I'd been shot that morning--all would have
"been over then. They brought me a meal, but I couldn't eat. I asked"
"them what was going to happen, but they didn't know. Another night came,"
"but I didn't get any sleep at all. I lay tossing about on my bed, now"
"hoping, now despairing. I thought of home mostly, but once or twice I"
thought of the kids in the school where I taught--to die like this after
"the send-off they gave me! Still, they wouldn't know, they'd think I was"
"the glass; shuddered, turned her back on herself, and sat down again.  In"
her own house!  Why not here--in this room?  Why not before her eyes?
Not yet a year married! It was almost funny--almost funny!  And she had
her first calm thought: 'I am free.'
"But it did not seem to mean anything, had no value to a spirit so"
bitterly stricken in its pride.  She moved her chair closer to the fire
again.  Why had she not tapped on the window?  To have seen that girl's
face ashy with fright!  To have seen him--caught--caught in the room she
"had made beautiful for him, the room where she had played for him so many"
"hours, the room that was part of the house that she paid for!  How long"
had they used it for their meetings--sneaking in by that door from the
back lane?  Perhaps even before she went away--to bear his child!  And
there began in her a struggle between mother instinct and her sense of
"outrage--a spiritual tug-of-war so deep that it was dumb, unconscious--to"
"decide whether her baby would be all hers, or would have slipped away"
"from her heart, and be a thing almost abhorrent."
"She huddled nearer the fire, feeling cold and physically sick.  And"
suddenly the thought came to her: 'If I don't let the servants know I'm
"here, they might go out and see what I saw!'  Had she shut the"
drawing-room window when she returned so blindly?  Perhaps already--! In
"a fever, she rang the bell, and unlocked the door.  The maid came up."
"""Please shut the drawing-room, window, Ellen; and tell Betty I'm afraid I"
got a little chill travelling.  I'm going to bed.  Ask her if she can
"manage with baby.""  And she looked straight into the girl's face.  It"
"wore an expression of concern, even of commiseration, but not that"
fluttered look which must have been there if she had known.
"""Yes, m'm; I'll get you a hot-water bottle, m'm.  Would you like a hot"
"bath and a cup of hot tea at once?"""
Sheldon at the time—and there was a fair on the common.
"“Now, Ellen,” she said, “I want you to take the two young ladies for a"
ride on the donkeys.” Off we went; solemn little loves they were; each
had a hand. But when we came to the donkeys they were too shy to go on.
So we stood and watched instead. Beautiful those donkeys were! They
were the first I’d seen out of a cart—for pleasure as you might say.
"They were a lovely silver-grey, with little red saddles and blue"
bridles and bells jing-a-jingling on their ears. And quite big
"girls—older than me, even—were riding them, ever so gay. Not at all"
"common, I don’t mean, madam, just enjoying themselves. And I don’t know"
"what it was, but the way the little feet went, and the eyes—so"
gentle—and the soft ears—made me want to go on a donkey more than
anything in the world!
"... Of course, I couldn’t. I had my young ladies. And what would I have"
looked like perched up there in my uniform? But all the rest of the day
it was donkeys—donkeys on the brain with me. I felt I should have burst
if I didn’t tell some one; and who was there to tell? But when I went
"to bed—I was sleeping in Mrs. James’s bedroom, our cook that was, at"
"the time—as soon as the lights was out, there they were, my donkeys,"
"jingling along, with their neat little feet and sad eyes.... Well,"
"madam, would you believe it, I waited for a long time and pretended to"
"be asleep, and then suddenly I sat up and called out as loud as I"
"could, “_I do want to go on a donkey. I do want a donkey-ride!_” You"
"see, I had to say it, and I thought they wouldn’t laugh at me if they"
knew I was only dreaming. Artful—wasn’t it? Just what a silly child
would think....
"... No, madam, never now. Of course, I did think of it at one time. But"
it wasn’t to be. He had a little flower-shop just down the road and
across from where we was living. Funny—wasn’t it? And me such a one for
"""I do not recognize you when you talk like that!"" she exclaimed."
"""That is surprising, seeing that you have made me what I am,"" he"
"answered. Then he made a quick gesture of apology. ""Forgive me, that"
sounded like a reproach or a complaint. I make neither. That is not my
"purpose."""
"""And yet you have the right,"" she said, drawing a deep breath, ""you"
"have every right, Nehal. It does not matter what the others did to"
you. I know that does not count an atom in comparison to my
"responsibilities. You trusted me as you trusted no one else, and I"
deceived you. So you have the right to hate me as you hate no one
"else. And yet--is it not something, does it not mitigate my fault a"
"little, that I deceived myself far, far more than I ever deceived"
"you?"" He raised his eyebrows. There was mockery in the movement, and"
"she went on, desperately resolute: ""I played at loving you, Nehal. I"
played a comedy with you for my own purposes. And one day it ceased to
be a comedy. I did not know it. I did not know what was driving me to
"tell the truth, and reveal myself to you in the ugliest light I could."
I only knew it was something in me stronger than any other impulse of
"my life. I know what it is now, and you must know, too. Can't you"
"understand? If it had been no more than a comedy, you must have found"
me out--months ago. But you never found me out. It was _I_ who told
"you what I had done and who I was--"""
"""Why did you tell me?"" He took an involuntary step toward her."
Something in his face relaxed beneath the force of an uncontrollable
emotion. He was asking a question which had hammered at the gates of
"his mind day after day and in every waking hour. ""Why?"" he repeated."
"""I have told you--because I had to. I had to speak the truth. I"
couldn't build up my new life on an old lie. You had to know. I had
"This wood was never quite dark, it was so full of these lights that"
flickered aimlessly.
There were men in this wood who wandered to and fro. The wood was full
of them.
They did not know whither they went; they did not know whither they
"wished to go. Only this they knew, that they could never keep still;"
"for the keeper of this wood was Time. He was armed with a keen whip, and"
kept driving them on and on; there was no rest.
"Many of these when they first came loved the wood. The glades, they"
"said, were very beautiful, the flowers very sweet. They wandered down"
"the broad roads into the glades, and tried to lie upon the moss and love"
the flowers; but Time would not let them. Just for a few moments they
"could have peace, and then they must on and on. But they did not care."
"'The forest is full of glades,' they said; 'if we cannot live in one, we"
"can find another.' And so they went on finding others and others, and"
each one pleased them less.
Some few there were who did not go to the glades at all. 'They are very
"beautiful,' they said, 'but these roads that pass through them, whither"
do they lead? Round and round and round again. There is no peace there.
"Time rules in those glades, Time with his whip and goad, and there is no"
"peace. What we want is rest. And those lights,' they said, 'they are"
"wandering lights, like the summer lightning far down in the South,"
moving hither and thither. We care not for such lights. Our light is
firm and clear. What we desire is peace; we do not care to wander for
"ever round this forest, to see for ever those shifting lights.'"
"And so they would not go down the winding roads, but essayed the path"
"upon the cliffs. 'It is narrow,' they said, 'it has no flowers, it is"
"And without so much as turning his head again, Grey Dumaresq walked off,"
"his head held high, neither observing nor returning the many salutes and"
bright arch glances shot at him from the lane of bystanders through
"which he needs must pass, but walking like a man in a dream, and so"
disappearing from view along the white road which led Londonwards.
Round Lord Sandford men were buzzing like bees disturbed.
"""Insolent young jackanapes!""  ""What did he mean?""  ""What was his motive"
"in such an insult?""  ""What will you do, my lord?""  ""Whither has he gone?"
"Whither will he go?""  ""Is it true that he is ruined?""  ""He has lost his"
"horse, at least. None will give him a score of guineas for the beast"
"now.""  ""How did it chance?""  ""Was it an accident?""  ""What meant he by"
"his words?""  All were pouring out these and like questions; but there"
"was none to answer them, till Lord Sandford himself spoke."
"""The fellow’s wits are gone astray,"" he cried in his loud, dominating"
"tones.  ""It is the Dumaresq blood.  Sir Hugh was just such another—mad"
"as a March hare half his time, flinging his gold to the winds, and"
"quarrelling with every man he met.  Like father, like son.  It has been"
coming on for days. I misdoubted me if ever he would ride this race. He
"came and told me he must reform.  That was ever his father’s cry, and he"
"would disappear into the country for a while, and reappear again as gay"
"as ever.  ’Tis the same with the son.  I saw it then, and I strove to"
combat the madness; but ’tis ill dealing with the lunatic.  You see what
we get for our pains!  Tush! let the fellow alone.  I did wrong to
"answer him.  Let him go his own way, and we will think of him no more."""
"And Lord Sandford, with a heavy cloud upon his brow, and a look about"
"the corners of his mouth which warned those about him to say no more,"
"but leave matters as they were, flung away from them, and made his way"
"back alone to the inn, from which he was presently seen to issue forth"
Then I reached my own hut of last winter where I had passed so many lonely
months. I did not enter it.
"Or rather, I did enter it, for I had to spend the night there. But I shall"
"skip this, so for the sake of brevity, I call it not entering. This"
"morning I wrote something playful about Madame, the mouse I left here last"
spring; but tonight I am taking it out again because I am no longer in the
"mood, and because there is no point in it. Perhaps it would have amused"
"you to read it, my friend; but there is no point in amusing you now. I"
must deject you now and make you listen to me; there is not much more to
hear.
"Am I moralizing? I am explaining. No, I am not moralizing; I am"
"explaining. If it is moralizing to see the truth and tell it to you, then"
I am moralizing. Can I help that? Intuitively I see into what is distant;
"you do not, for this is something you cannot learn from your little"
schoolbooks. Do not let this rouse your hatred for me. I shall be merry
"again with you later, when my strings are tuned to merriment. I have no"
power over them. Now they are tuned to a chorale....
*       *       *       *       *
"At dawn, in the bright moonlight, I leave the hut and push on quickly in"
order to reach the village as soon as possible. But I must have started
"too early or walked too fast, for at this rate I shall reach the village"
at high noon. What am I chasing after? Perhaps it is feeling the nearness
"of the sea that drives me forward. And as I stand on the last high ridge,"
"with the glitter and roar of the sea far beneath, a sweetness darts"
"through me like a greeting from another world. ""_Thalatta!_"" I cry;"
and I wipe my eyeglasses tremblingly. The roar from below is sleepless and
"fierce, a tone of jungle passion, a savage litany. I descend the ridge as"
though in a trance and reach the first house.
"""Tell it straight,"" interrupted Cherry. ""They don't understand you."""
"""Well, there ain't any Pullmans running to this resort, so I stow away"
"on a coal-burner, but somebody flags me. Then I try to hire out as a"
"fisherman, but I ain't there with the gang talk and my stuff drags, so"
I fix it for a hide-away on _The Blessed Isle_--that's her name. Can
"you beat that for a monaker? This sailor of mine goes good to grub me,"
"but he never shows for forty-eight hours--or years, I forget which."
"Anyhow, I stand it as long as I can, then I dig my way up to a hatch"
"and mew like a house-cat. It seems they were hep from the start, and"
"battened me down on purpose, then made book on how long I'd stay hid."
"Oh, it's a funny joke, and they all get a stomach laugh when I show."
When I offer to pay my way they're insulted. Nix! that ain't their
"graft. They wouldn't take money from a stranger. Oh, no! They permit me"
"to _work_ my way. The scullion has quit, see? So they promote me to his"
"job. It's the only job I ever held, and I held it because it wouldn't"
"let go of me, savvy? There's only three hundred men aboard _The Blessed"
"Isle_, so all I have to do, regular, is to understudy the cooks, carry"
"the grub, wait on table, wash the dishes, mop the floors, make the"
"officers' beds, peel six bushels of potatoes a day, and do the laundry."
"Then, of course, there's some odd tasks. Oh, it was a swell job--more"
"like a pastime. When a mop sees me coming now it dances a hornpipe, and"
I can't look a dish-rag in the face. All I see in my dreams is
"potato-parings and meat-rinds. I've got dish-water in my veins, and the"
whole universe looks greasy to me. Naturally it was my luck to pick the
"slowest ship in the harbor. We lay three weeks in the ice, that's all,"
"and nobody worked but me and the sea-gulls."""
"""You deserted this morning, eh?"""
"""I did. I beat the barrier, and now I want a bath and some clean"
clothes and a whole lot of sleep. You don't need to disturb me till
"flowers. We were having a lot of company at the time, and I was in and"
"out of the shop more often than not, as the saying is. And Harry and I"
(his name was Harry) got to quarrelling about how things ought to be
"arranged—and that began it. Flowers! you wouldn’t believe it, madam,"
the flowers he used to bring me. He’d stop at nothing. It was
"lilies-of-the-valley more than once, and I’m not exaggerating! Well, of"
"course, we were going to be married and live over the shop, and it was"
"all going to be just so, and I was to have the window to arrange...."
"Oh, how I’ve done that window of a Saturday! Not really, of course,"
"madam, just dreaming, as you might say. I’ve done it for"
"Christmas—motto in holly, and all—and I’ve had my Easter lilies with a"
"gorgeous star all daffodils in the middle. I’ve hung—well, that’s"
enough of that. The day came he was to call for me to choose the
furniture. Shall I ever forget it? It was a Tuesday. My lady wasn’t
"quite herself that afternoon. Not that she’d said anything, of course;"
she never does or will. But I knew by the way that she kept wrapping
herself up and asking me if it was cold—and her little nose looked...
pinched. I didn’t like leaving her; I knew I’d be worrying all the
"time. At last I asked her if she’d rather I put it off. “Oh no, Ellen,”"
"she said, “you mustn’t mind about me. You mustn’t disappoint your young"
"man.” And so cheerful, you know, madam, never thinking about herself."
It made me feel worse than ever. I began to wonder... then she dropped
her handkerchief and began to stoop down to pick it up herself—a thing
"she never did. “Whatever are you doing!” I cried, running to stop her."
"“Well,” she said, smiling, you know, madam, “I shall have to begin to"
"practise.” Oh, it was all I could do not to burst out crying. I went"
"over to the dressing-table and made believe to rub up the silver, and I"
"couldn’t keep myself in, and I asked her if she’d rather I... didn’t"
"get married. “No, Ellen,” she said—that was her voice, madam, like I’m"
"giving you—“No, Ellen, not for the _wide world_!” But while she said"
"it, madam—I was looking in her glass; of course, she didn’t know I"
could see her—she put her little hand on her heart just like her dear
"there, I still would not know how much to ask for."" ""I will tell you"
"what you must do,"" said the Master Girl. ""You must go to the rock behind"
"the pasture, and take the club that is lying there, and strike the rock"
"with it. Then one will come out whose eyes flash fire, and you must tell"
"him your business. And if he asks how much you want, you must tell him"
"as much as you can carry."" He would take good note of it, said the"
"king's son, and he sat there with the Master Girl all day long until"
"evening, and he might be sitting there yet, if the Master Girl had not"
reminded him that he must still go to the devil about the tribute before
"the giant came home. So he set out, and did exactly as the Master Girl"
"had told him: he went to the rock, took the club and beat against it."
"Then one came out from whose eyes and nose the sparks flew. ""What do you"
"want?"" he asked. ""The giant has sent me to fetch his tribute,"" said the"
"king's son. ""How much do you want?"" the other again inquired. ""I never"
"ask for more than I can carry,"" was the reply of the king's son. ""It is"
"lucky for you that you did not ask for a whole ton at once,"" said the"
"one on the hill. ""But come in with me, and wait a while."" This the"
"king's son did, and saw a great deal of gold and silver lying in the"
hill like dead rock in an ore-pile. Then as much as he could carry was
"packed up, and with it he went his way. When the giant came home in"
"the evening with his goats, the king's son was running about the room,"
"whistling and singing as on the two preceding evenings. ""Did you go to"
"the devil for the tribute?"" asked the giant. ""Yes, indeed, master,"" said"
"the king's son. ""Where did you put it?"" asked the giant again. ""I stood"
"the sack of gold outside on the bench,"" was the reply. ""I must see that"
"at once,"" said the giant, and went over to the bench. But the sack was"
"really standing there, and it was so full that the gold and silver"
"rolled right out when the giant loosened the string. ""You surely must"
"have spoken to my Master Girl,"" said the giant. ""If that is the case I"
"will tear your head off."" ""With your Master Girl?"" said the king's"
"son. ""Yesterday master talked about that Master Girl, and to-day he is"
"talking about her again, and the day before yesterday he talked about"

Yes!
That's it!
Ah!
She's perfect.
The girl of my dreams.
Wait!
More sugar.
But that is not the recipe.
"Trust me, Muffin Man, this girl's gotta be real sweet."
I want someone who will love me forever.
"I must warn you, Gingy."
No one has ever made cookies with this much sugar.
You are tampering with forces far beyond your comprehension!
Just put her in the oven!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha...
Ow!
Ha ha ha ha!
- Might need a little help.
- Uh...
OK.
You got your tow cable?
"Well, yeah, I always got my tow cable."
Why?
"Oh, just in case."
Ow!
Ow!
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow."
"No, no, no, no, no!"
"- Oh, man!"
- Whoa.
- Ow!
"- Bad trip, man."
Hey!
Was that floating' like a Cadillac or was that stinging' like a Beemer?
I'm confused.
You drive like you fix roads.
Lousy!
"Have fun fishing', Mater."
Ah!
I'm startin' to think he knowed you was gonna crash!
"Thank you, Mater."
Thank you.
I can make a little turn on dirt.
You think?
No.
And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!
"Hey, ése!"
"You need a new paint job, man!"
Precisely 499.
- I'd say 300.
- Let's have a look.
"No, sorry."
This wonderful casserole set costs 499 marks.
"Sorry, Hilde."
Better luck next time.
Otto.
Don't take it so hard.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I'm going over there.
Take care of him.
I saw him applauding.
- What's your name?
- Rene.
"Oh, yes."
I'm Laura.
- You work at the movie theater?
- Yeah.
- You're the... what's it called?
- Projectionist.
"Yeah, right."
- Don't do it.
- What?
Don't ask me.
Ask you what?
- Whether I liked it.
- I wasn't going to.
"Well, did you like it?"
"Yeah, it was really good."
"I thought so, too..."
- He'll be all right.
- He's bounced back before.
"- Actually, he died."
"- Way to start the day, huh?"
- Yeah.
Can I buy you some breakfast?
Okay.
"So, what's that you're reading?"
The workplace sensitivity manual.
Weaver wants me to learn it.
- What's-?
"What's ""schmuck""?"
- Schmuck?
It's one of the inappropriate words.
"""Schmuck,"" ""puts"" -"
"- No, I think you mean ""putz."""
- Putz.
"""Peckerwood."" Is that a tree?"
Hello?
Anybody here?
Hello?
"Oh, my God."
Gray matter.
No pulse.
We should get the police.
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, God."
GSW to the head.
Exit wound through the spine.
They're gone.
Trina.
"Oh, my God."
MAN:
"Stand back, please."
Give us a chance.
"Stand out of the way, please."
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)
We swept that all away.
"Oh, good."
"Come on, Dud."
Let's get to the wallets.
"Watch your feet, lieutenant."
I'm sorry.
I need a name.
"Okay, let's do this body first."
I think this is our stranger.
Who we got?
"John, meet Robert Post."
"How do you do, Robert?"
"Excuse me, Lieutenant."
Watch your feet.
We're out of here.
JOHN:
Isn't that a light in Robert's window?
DUD:
Yeah. 10:00 in the morning.
"Oh, fuck."
"Aw, shit."
John!
DETECTIVE:
You got anything on that tape?
DUD:
Some background voices.
Clear ones?
You alright?
Yeah.
Okay.
Where is she?
This way.
Hey baby.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah?
You're okay.
Okay.
Everything's gonna be alright.
"Oh god, what would I do without you?"
"C'mon, daddy's got you."
Let's get outta Zurich.
Not yet.
We got one more thing to do.
Damn it.
Jacob?
Jared.
"What's goin' on, buddy?"
Where are you?
Turn around.
"This isn't working out the way you wanted, is it?"
Let's go in the church.
You need to repent.
Keep going.
"You probably don't go to church much, do you?"
What the fuck is this all about?
How about Paolo?
Great.
Great.
So--
"So you'll drive me to work, pick me up, get Jake at school..."
-... dothegroceryshopping--
"-Okay, I may have misspoken."
"Charlie, you have to."
You know I can't drive.
I don't see why not.
"-Oh, look who's here."
-Who?
A girl I used to go out with.
Over there.
"Hey, Sherri."
"-Hey, Charlie, long time."
-Yeah.
Good to see you.
"-This is my brother, Alan."
-Hi.
-Hi.
-What happened to your eye?
"Well, I wanted a piece of toast, and--"
Bar fight.
-Nice to meet you.
"-Well, nice meeting you too."
"-Good to see you, Charlie."
-Good to see you too.
"-Wow, you went out with her?"
-Yep.
Why would you stop?
I don't remember.
I probably got bored.
Let's have our picture taken with Mr. Chiu.
Fine.
Mr. Chiu!
Mr. Chiu!
Sister!
You worked too hard.
Did I perform well?
- It was superb!
- Really?
Let's have our picture taken.
Fine.
Can you take a picture of us?
Move closer.
Look at here!
Say cheese!
Ready...!
Go to hell!
Damn it!
You dare to offend Mr. Chiu?
You'd be dead if not for Master Tam.
Scream!
Tiger...
I'll buy you a meal tonight.
Empty promises!
I don't believe you.
"Bi...gg...ie, Biggie."
What do these words say?
"""Bastard"""
Compliment?
Sure!
"It reads : ""Biggie is Bastard""!"
Damn you!
"Balls deep, spearheading the whole thing."
"- Well, I like that."
- Joe:
"Yeah, we do, too."
"Now, uh, can we please get back to this Vernon situation?"
"Hmm, let me go put some clothes on first."
- He wants to put clothes on.
- A robe counts as clothes.
TTD:
"Here we go, Rick."
You got him.
- Man:
Go!
- Ricky:
You got him.
"Come on, he gained too much space."
Look at that route.
- What the hell was that?
"- One, two, three, throw."
He got it.
"He's nervous, man."
You're Ricky Jerret.
TTD:
"Off the line, got him."
Do it!
"Oh, my God."
Damn!
TTD:
Bam!
"He done, he done."
There it is.
There it is.
"London, it's our first time."
Okay?
- It's picking up on your an-- - [crying continues]
- She's picking up on our anxiety.
- I am so sick of sick!
- Okay.
- Please just get this off me.
- Okay.
Lift.
- Don't get it on my hair.
Yeah.
"I won't, I won't, I won't."
There you go.
There you go.
Okay.
We got it off.
There we go.
- And my shorts.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
Okay.
"- Oh, God."
- All right.
We got this.
- Gross.
- There we go.
There we go.
Yeah.
"There we go, baby."
There we-- [crying continues]
"- Nice, you guys."
- [infant screams]
[Wren] I can't.
I got you here!
I got you the compass!
I got the compass.
And you're just gonna leave me here to die?
"Have that beast eat me, to crush my bones?"
He's not a beast.
And you're not gonna die.
"I just need a head start, that's all."
Swan.
Swan!
Swan!
(BLADE ZINGS)
Whoa!
Wait.
What are you doing?
Just stay back.
Emma gave me 10 hours.
No!
"No, no, no!"
"What, you're just gonna leave her to die?"
Ten hours.
She may already be dead.
No...
No!
"You, stop!"
(GRUNTS)
Stop!
Stop!
- Aah!
- It was your daughter's wish.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
I don't care what you say.
- Yeah.
"- Phew, it smells."
- [boys cough]
It's some kind of a gas.
Come on.
[inhales deeply]
You ok now?
"Yes, thank you."
This is some kind of Science place.
- How'd you get here?
- It was Tony.
He was here.
I saw something!
What was it?
It's where Tony is.
I'm sure of it!
"A big, round shape."
A doughnut!
He's eating a doughnut.
No way!
Is it like a ball?
A great big ball?
- Yes.
- I know where he is.
Let's go!
"Hurry, let's go."
[Alfred bleats]
"Oh, thank you."
And thanks for everything.
"Come on, let's go."
We are about to make scientific history.
"[Letha] and some money, too, I hope."
"I'm gonna take them, because I know I'm not a very good mommy."
"I wasn't a very, very good mommy at all."
"And now I'm gonna be so, so good."
And I'm gonna take them all.
I just...
Okay.
Therapist to Room 5.
Therapist to Room 5.
Okay.
Best girl ever.
Mommy's best girl.
Hm?
Maybe I sh...
I should have just... watched you.
"Your meds, it's just..."
My med...
My meds?
My meds?
You watch my meds?
Why would you watch my...?
They're my...
"They're my meds, honey."
"They're my meds, huh?"
"They're Mommy's meds, not baby's meds, okay?"
- Yeah.
- It's my job.
My responsibility.
"Look at me, baby girl."
You don't do nothing wrong.
- Robin Joffe?
- Just a minute.
"Just a minute, all right?"
That is a problem.
Yeah.
Now what you wanna do is you wanna go all the way south.
You have to take 5 all the way south towards Salem.
- That's right down there.
You see that?
- Hey.
- Okay.
- That's where you're going.
You got it?
"- Hey, mister, that guy's stealing that..."
"- Oh, God!"
"Oh, God."
- Honey?
(Panting)
- Oh.
Oh.
I think...
- I think it's time.
- He's ready?
"- Oh, yeah."
- You didn't see him take the...
- Oh!
Oh!
It hurts really bad!
- You guys need help?
"- No, no, mister, you didn't see..."
"- Oh, my God!"
- It hurts really bad!
- Whoa.
Whoa.
Okay.
The room is freezing.
-Didn't he tell you?
-Who?
-Burke is--
-What's Burke got to do with it?
Nobody was here.
When I went to get the Thorazine...
-...
"I had him stay with her, and...."
-Oh.
-I should have known better.
Sorry.
-I guess you should have.
How were the tests?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
"Hi, Chuck."
Come on in.
I suppose you heard.
Heard what?
You haven't heard.
Burke's dead.
He must have been drunk.
He fell from the top of the steps right outside.
"By the time he hit M Street, he broke his neck."
"Oh, God."
No!
"Yeah, I know."
Sharon--
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
"When I touch your forehead, open your eyes."
"Are you comfortable, Regan?"
Ow!
Bill?
Is it really you?
"Well, there's only one of me in all the world."
You taught me that.
"Aw, Bill!"
What are the chances?
"About one in a krillion, Will."
KRILL 1:
"Quiet, you two."
I'm trying to sleep.
"Hey, everyone!"
It's Will!
KRILL 2:
"Wow, it's him!"
It's wee Willy Williams!
KRILL 3:
I thought he'd be taller.
He's back!
Will's back!
[KRILL CHEERING]
"Welcome home, Will."
But how did you find them?
They found me.
I was on my last nine legs.
"I was such a fool, Bill."
"Will, you're a legend."
"Those days are gone, my friend."
The carnivore is over.
No.
It's because of you we're all here.
It is?
I'm holding you responsible for this.
Apologize.
"Kill him, Vic."
Apologize!
Kill him!
"Vic, you're a fucking coward."
Come on you wanna fucking kill me?
You think I'm scared of dying?
"Ha, fuck you!"
Fuck your people.
Fuck your whole fucking race.
Shu!
Yo yakuza.
"So, what is your real name?"
David.
I like Nick.
"Stay still, stay still."
Get my sword.
Get it.
You picked the wrong fucking side.
I'm sorry.
We were supposed to do this in the next life.
I understand.
Watch my back.
Oh man.
Oh man.
Oh man.

Oh.
"So, what's troubling you is the nature of my game?"
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Ohhh.
Oh my God...
I'm seeing myself as a child.
I'm seeing myself being conceived.
Uhn...
I got it worse than that.
I'm seeing the night before I was conceived.
My dad's jerking off.
"Well, this guy checks out clean."
A guy like you could never murder anyone.
That's okay.
"No, go back to your thoughts."
Changwook is still in the shower.

He's the Jindo breed.

"Oh, you cutie."
Sorry for keeping you.

"- Let's go, Dori."
"Good-bye, Dori."
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
How's this place?
It looks pretty cheap.
What's the rate?
"On weekdays 60,000 Won, 80,000 Won on weekends."
"Oh, it's cheaper here."
Would you like some tea?
"And, here's some dessert as well."
Good job!
Here I go!

- In person.
This is a pleasant surprise.
- You...
- What?
- I don't know.
Not what I expected.
- My voice doesn't match my face?
CONOR:
Your voice does not match your face in a good way.
In a...
"Yeah, I mean..."
That sounded terrible.
Amazing.
I don't know how all this stuff fit in here before.
"Keep practicing, then."
Watch out.
"Are you hungry, sweetie?"
I have some cookies here in my purse.
So sweet!
"Keep this for me, dear."
My word!
These feet are killing me.
"If I only knew, I'd have changed shoes."
My goodness.
- Barbuda.
- Number 70.
"Hold on, Foguinho."
I'm looking for the place.
"Look, I did it!"
Didn't I tell you I had it?
"You'll be a great magician someday, honey."
"We're here, Maria."
Number 70.
- What floor?
- Fourth.
Shall we?
Come on.
"Howdy, we're going up to see Mrs. Maria Cecilia."
Let me see.
Lovely.
Come on.
Hi.
We're here.
Here?
- Let me see.

Good.
Is Tony here?
We need to speak to him.
Tea?
"Coffee, anyone?"
"- Er... no, thanks."
"- Er, no, I'm fine."
Tony?
"No, thank you."
"You OK, Tony?"
"You seem a little under... well, under the bed."
I'm fine.
"Tony, come out."
I'd prefer not to.
Listen.
I think we need to talk about this.
I really don't know what you mean.
"Well, me and Sid are together now."
Yeah.
I know.
And you're obviously not OK with it.
Who says I'm not?
"Well, er, you did, pretty much."
Last night.
"Oh, come on."
I was only taking the piss.
You know...
cos it's funny?
"Listen, do you mind?"
I've got an interview.
Got to get ready.
All right.
It's two full-time jobs.
Now I got Bo.
She's a handful on her own.
Bo.
"Oh, man."
Bo.
"Oh, man."
You hit that?
"- Yes, you did."
- I need a drink.
"Fine, but you're my wingman."
I'm tired of being with the ugly chick.
"Oh, my God."
That is good.
That is good.
- It makes my throat tingle.
- I don't think I have a throat left.
"That is some good shit, Mr. T."
"Oh, you."
You are the Kenziest Kenzi ever.
And Dyson...?
- Dyson is a scratchy-faced...
- Yes.
-...
"Grouchy, cooch-tease."
- Yes.
And I should've bit it off when I had the chance.
"Oh, unneeded visual, baby."
"But yes, let it all out."
Let it out.
What else?
What else?
"Ah, monsieur, let us toast our success in the desert."
To the Ark.
When we are very far from here.
That will do.
"Hey, you now..."
Come here!
Come here!

"Matthew, would you please help me?"
Sorry.

"Oh, so.. so you think dumb people are funny?"
"If they're that dumb, yeah."
You know who I think is funny?

Why?
You get jumpy when you smoke.

Bring the girl to me and you'll get it back.
Sounds like a fair trade to me.
Where you wanna meet?
I need to know the girl is still alive.
Her brother isn't.
"Listen, I'm a businessman."
The death of the little girl is trouble I just don't need.
I need proof of life.
"All right, just a minute."
Hey.
Kid.
Say hi to somebody.

-It was not me.
"There were many of us, and ..."
It's complicated.
Complicated?
"Either you have made it, or you have not done it."
You are a fucking jerk.
-OK.
You have house arrest.
-Drag to hell.
-Are we bad parents?
He's 16.
It's just a phase.
-You're home early.
-Yes.
-What is it?
-Nothing.
-Are you OK?
-Yes.
I must return to the office.
Can it wait?
No.
This has waited too long.
No.
"Leong, you always trust my instincts."
We got Eva here.
Get on back to work.
Delaney?
Need that steam shovel built.
Psalms.
Bullet went clear through.
This one's still in him.
"Well, I know you ain't going fishing."
You don't know shit.
- Ahh!
- He's bleeding out.
"We don't get that bullet out, he gonna die."
I need some coffee grounds.
Much as you got.
He needs a doctor.
"Well, he's got us."
Do you?
- You lie to us.
You lie.
- Dad!
Stop!
What are you doing?

- You go behind our backs.
- Stop it!
Why?

Does this book tell you to do that?
!
Phillip.
Does it?
!
- And... and... and that's the...
- I understand.
last thing in the whole world I...
I accept your apology.
Rose!
Rose!
"Please let me finish, this is important for me to say."
Okay.
That night...
That... that terrible night...
I...
I...
"I wanted you so much, I couldn't see straight."
I have to make sure you know that.
"Rose, it wasn't YOU."
No!
"It wasn't you, Rose."
You're a very... a very sexy girl.
"And... and I know that it's unfair of me to say, now you're with Alex, but..."
"Who said I... who said that I am, I was with Alex?"
Your mother.
My mother?
"Oh, great."
"Oh, Greg!"
I'm not with Alex.
You're not?
Well...
Talk to me.
Rose...
I love you.
And...
I...
- Yes?
- Chef says you must continue to go to the therapist.
I was waiting for 1 hour.
I think o. ..
John ...?
Hello?
Doctor?
Doctor?
Maybe I should not up.
God knows what you did.
Doctor ...
John?
!
John!
- What?
!
- Are you insane?
"Is He sold the house, John?"
Why are you still living there?
This will bring them back.
"That night I must have died, the doctor."
Well ... not dead.
You see?
...
"I can not escape anything, doctor."
You were right.
I certainly am.
"Yes, ladies!"
This is a very definite ...
"We're fine, right?"
I'm still here.
In this absurdity.
You are gonna love this.
"Because, sir... you're gonna get to pick..."
your own voice.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hello, Henry."
- Robbie.
"- Oh, come on, they're options."
What white guy wouldn't wanna sound like Louis Armstrong?
Just one more.
Quick.
"Luke, I am your father."
"Robert, enough."
"- Sorry, Mom."
- How about we use Henry's voice?
"- Yeah, whatever you say."
You're the boss.
- Boring.
"Security breach, level four."
- Is this a drill?
- What is this?
- Level four.
- Lock the door.
It's probably a mistake.
"Estelle, call the base."
...level four.
"Oh, no."
Yes.
Spasiba.
Get up.
"Henry, right?"
"- Please, don't."
Yeah.
Ido San.
Ow!
That hurts.
Sorry.
Thanks for everything.
"Such a shame, you're still popular."
You could keep making money.
What's this?
The pizza that the porn crew ordered.
Why didn't you deliver it?
It'll get cold.
Can't abandon the front desk.
What room?
211.
I brought your pizza.
Come in.
Coming in.
You like moustaches?
Moustaches?
They're okay.
It'll be fine.
Where should I put the pizza?
Just right there.
Sure.
"The AD will pay you, so hang on."
Sure.
Miyu?
What're you doing here?
Come here.
"Hey, wait, stop!"
Who are you?
- You're hilarious.
"- Hey, you know I'm good for it."
"- Hey, Griffin,"
"I come out here late at night, my 13-year-old is watching my baby..."
"I appreciate that, man, I really do."
"I don't expect gratitude, man."
I expect you to have the money.
"Go home, Conner."
I got this.
What about your beauty rest?
"I'll exfoliate, I'll be fine."
"Plus, she's getting better."
- Call me when she wakes up?
- Mm.
Hey...
"Hey, Nik."
How you doin?
- Hi.
"- Hey, Nicole."
Hey.
Good news.
Your vitals are strong.
Your dad's gonna let me live.
- You fixed my heart.
- Yeah.
"You know, most of it."
- Thanks.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah...
I miss her.
"It's OK, it's OK."
It's OK.
I thought I just went to bed.
Yeah.
"Hey, what are we doing, scene 61 ?"
Okay.
"Oh, just remind Flo about that blue belt, huh?"
All right.
"Yeah, I'll see you."
What are you doing here?
My bed was shaking.
I can't get to sleep.
"Oh, honey."
Goddamn it.
Jesus.
There's nothing.
"Oh, Karl."
"Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that."
"Very sorry, but you see, no rats."
No rats.
Thanks a lot.
That's terrific.
"Oh, my God."
Okay.
Unroll your fist.
Arm up.
Very good.
"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
Remain perfectly still.
Breathe normally.
Tell me if you feel a vibration.
Regan?
You feel anything?
Can you feel this?
In Brussels.
This is your house?
Where is your house?
In Sofia.
- Sofia?
"Yes, we are Sofia."
This means we are in this region.
We shot here somewhere.
I see.
"We are headed there, we are not far from the Serbian border."
Mr. Lloyd?
Mr. Lloyd?
It looks like we're with a jury.
- A jury?
Yes.
A jury for yogurt.
Now we have to go.
Now we have to go.
"Sorry,  but..."
Ok.
"Okay, okay."
Ok.
No problem.
- Thanks for everything...
It was really nice.
- No problem.
Do not worry.
"- No, no."
Be happy.
You have our support.
"Farewell to all, ladies and gentlemen."
- Thanks for everything.
You do not put my daughter in danger!
EMMA:
Stop!
(GRUNTS)
Emma!
Oh.
You okay?
Two earthquakes and a jump from a beanstalk.
I think my brain is still rattling around a little.
I did what you ordered.
Nothing more than that.
- Did you get it?
- EMMA:
Yep.
Where...
Where's Hook?
He's detained.
"Let's go, get your stuff."
We got 10 hours before he follows us.
SNOW:
What?
How?
I got a friend looking after him till then.
(PANTING)
You told her to cut it down?
Yes.
I couldn't risk...
We go back together.
That is the only way.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Good.
You know that.
- Yeah.
All right.
- [Whistle Blows]
"- Yeah, say good-bye."
Come on.
What's he got now?
- Hudson Terraplane.
That's what he got.
"- No, no."
Uh-uh.
"- Easy, easy."
- Okay.
Go to work.
"Cloudy, lay odds he takes us to Dago town."
"We'll take him, Popeye."
He's nothin'.
[Cloudy] 7:00 in the morning.
I don't believe this.
[Jimmy] Relax.
"You're having fun, ain't you?"
[Engine Starts]
"[Jimmy] Man, if that's not a drop..."
I'll open up a charge for you at Bloomingdales.
Make it Alexander's.
I like the toy department.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Engine Starts]
He's coming back.
Pass him.
Make a left.
[No Audible Dialogue]
- To get your money offWeng.
I'll meet you in the church.
- Are you going alone?
"- Yes, ofcourse."
I must keep my promise.
Weng won't hurt me.
I still deserve some respect.
"Sidney, I don't need the money."
I do need your friendship.
Chang!
Chang!
I followed him to 6 Horizon Drive.
I almost got him.
I know.
I could have... got him.
"Don't worry, I'll find him."
"Chang, don't worry."
Eddie.
You can't win all the time.
"But you can't lose forever, either."
Chang...
Chang...
"Inspector Li, did he give us anything?"
Go ask him yourself!
-Jeffrey!
"-Jenny, what is it?"
Why is it so dark this morning?
It'sjust a cloudy day.
"Relax, it'll be all right."
- Are we leaving today?
- Yes.
Freeze!
Are... are you okay?
Are you okay?
Dad!
"Hey, baby."
It's me.
I...
There's something strange going on in here.
There's a zoo in your fridge.
You okay?
"No, I think I ate something bad."
So I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get out of here.
This is to be continued.
Bye.
Peter.
He's going.
"He can still hear you, if you have anything you'd like to say to him."
Dad.
I love you.
But what about Jackson?
I don't want to leave him.
He'll be fine.
"Come on, Arthur."
It's time.
Wow.
- Who is this?
- It's Owen.
Arthur just passed.
Knew you'd want to know.
It was very peaceful.
His son was with him.
"Oh, thank you."
Yeah.
(♪ CLUB MUSIC PLAYING)
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- You're late.
- Yeah.
- It's OK.
- Yeah.
You lost?
Goddamn it.
"Well, at least there's one pinball player in the family."
(LAUGHS)
- That's a triple take.
- Yeah?
Is that with the spin?
You do that...
"Wait, let me try."
- You missed mine.
- Let me see it again.
I was...
We were both double-taking at the same time.
"Hey, that was three."
That was pretty good.
That was good.
Erm...
What do you get if you cut a bra in half?
- (CHUCKLES) What?
- A yarmulke with a chin strap.
- MAN:
"Can you guys keep it down, please?"
- What?
Can you please keep it down?
Jimmy...
Your father and I need to talk to you.
"Come on, Jimmy."
Hey.
Jimmy.
"Hey, partner."
How you doing?
Hey.
"Hey, Dad."
Jimmy.
Hmm?
I had a good game -- 13 strikeouts.
Did you win?
I just found out there's a chance we may be restationed again.
-
- How much of a chance?
-
- It's in West Texas.
The Navy wants me to be a recruiter there.
Texas?
When?
Three weeks.
"But, Dad..."
We still got half our season to play.
I'm aware of that.
"Well, maybe I could stay with the Johnsons."
Unh-unh.
We move as a family.
I don't have a choice in this.
What kind of baseball do they have?
They don't.
I hear they might be starting some summer ball.
I think it'd be a neat idea.
"- Stand up, Josh."
- OK.
- I'm gonna show you how to take a punch.
- I know how to take a punch.
I'm gonna show you the right way to take a punch.
"OK, hit me."
- Where?
- Right in my stomach.
"Hit me as hard as you can, just at my stomach."
That wasn't as hard as I can.
I know.
I hope not.
Hit me again.
Harder.
Seriously.
"- Yeah, OK."
- Go.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Harder?
- Go.
Harder.
I'm fine.
"What I did was essentially, breathing is key."
"- Think of it as, like..."
- Just hit me.
"- All right, you ready?"
OK.
- Yeah.
One...
Two...
- Peet stop!
- Uh...
"The race is only one lap, guys."
Uno lappo!
Don't need any help.
- I work solo mio.
- Fine.
Race your way.
- No pit stoppo.
Comprendo?
- OK.
Gentlemen start your engines!
- Hijole!
Check that out!
- Whoa.
"Great idea, Doc."
Now the road will never get done.
Luigi?
"On your mark, get set..."
"Uno for the money, due for the show, tre to get ready, and quattro to..."
I can't believe it.
Go!
Huh?
Doc... the flag means go.
Remember the fl...
Here we go.
Go.
"Doc, what are you doing, man?"
"Oh, dear."
It would seem I'm off to a poor start.
"Well, better late than never."
"Come on, Mater."
I might change the title.
You should totally record it.
"No, it's not there yet."
Still needs some tweaks.
Not from what I've just heard.
Let's do it.
Olivia does all the recording.
I don't know how to work the equipment.
It's easy.
"All you do is press ""Record,"""
this button right here.
I guess.
It'll be fun.
We need to capture the moment.
The world needs to hear Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.
Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.
"Oh, Yeah."
Exactly.
Okay.
Here goes.
Oh.
Out of sight.
Really?
Let's play it back.
- No.
- Mom.
- No.
"- Mom, no."
"No, no!"
"Mom, this is for Casey's own good!"
Casey?
"Take my hand, Casey, I'm right here."
"Well, I think I'll be off."
Why?
"I don't confuse you, do I, lvy?"
"I believe I do confuse you, don't I?"
I ain't confused by nobody.
Let go.
Do you hear?
Let go.
"Let go, you hear?"
"- What's he doing, lvy?"
"- Oh, you let go too!"
"Watch out, lvy love."
"- Here, here."
What's this all about?
- It's him.
He insulted her.
"- He's lying, I tell you!"
- He tried to break her arm.
"- He did, did he?"
"- Yes, yes."
Tried to break her arm.
You will?
You want another one?
No!
No!
Stop it!
Stop it!
"I'll stop it, sir."
"Hey, boys!"
"Now, boys!"
"Boys, will you...?"
I can't understand what happened.
Changed my name.
I never told her where I went.
I never saw her again.
I...
I reinvented myself.
But it didn't matter.
"No matter what I did,"
I chose
Angela.
Angela.
Like a name would protect me.
"That I dreamed I could have a life, a chance."
Didn't matter.
It wasn't done with me.
"It's coming for me, Father, I know it."
_
My name is Regan MacNeil.
I'm Chris MacNeil.
I've come to see my daughter.
I don't want to go.
Go home.
You know the way.
I don't want to go.
You'll be fine.
"Trust me, just go."
"You're too young to come, Jesse."
You won't even like it.
*Jesse:
Mark!
*
Just go!
Hey!
- Hey!
Hey!
"- Jimmy, over here!"
- Hey!
"- Hey, Tillie."
- Dammit!
- Did he see us?
Is he coming back?
- Forget it.
- What's up?
- Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
- I didn't expect this to happen.
"- Yeah, sure!"
We've only got 50 yards to the bottom.
"Now, let's move."
- Come on!
- I can't move.
- What?
- I can't move.
"All right, let me look."
It's probably broken.
Great!
"- Here, take one of these."
- What is it?
- A pain pill.
- I don't want it.
- Shut up and take it.
- I don't want it!
Now I'll have to think of something else.
We're going to lower you down.
She's got to be French.
I'm parked on Kattegat Road.
A red Ferrari.
- You called for some company?
- You're Chinese.
"- I'm French, honey."
- Say something in French.
- Je t'aime.
- Fucking tart.
That was school French.
You're not from France.
Do you want company or not?
"300, cash in advance."
- What's that?
- 1500.
Say your name is Michelle and say you love me in French.
- And then I'll break your arm.
- Like hell you will.
- 3000.
"- No, I said."
4500.
That's more than you make in a week.
- You're sick.
- I own you.
I'II do anything I want.
Fucking cow.
"I'll get you, bitch."
Hey!
- Let me go.
- I'm going to kill you.
Michelle...
Michelle...
She is going to Mumbai.
Party is fine.
But till 2 o'clock?
Her lifestyle here is such.
What will she do in Mumbai?
I worry when I think about it.
Her friend Pia has found her a job.
In a fashion house.
She will be busy in Mumbai.
I don't think so.
"Well, she is our daughter."
She will make us proud.
And keep your diary with you.
It pricks me the whole night.
Shobha.
"Mother, catch."
"- Oh, God."
Gul.
Stop it.
Shobha.
- Yes.
Coming.
Sit.
"Gul, how many clothes will you take?"
Yes.
- Yes.
Mother and daughter's meeting is over?
- Yes.
It's over.
Gul.
Last night you returned home very late.
I didn't like that.
Cheol-yeong couldn't come.
His sow is farrowing.
What's with your face?
This ain't a joke?
"You're serious, right?"
Yeah.
"Cross your heart, or your mom's a whore?"
You prick!
This is no time for jokes.
What a fucking loser.
Go!
- Nothing?
- No.
Don't just stand around.
Check the back.
What's that?
Fucking bastard...
Byeong-gyu!
Over here.
Hurry UP-
Is that him?
Over there.
Where?
Follow me.
Where?
What the...?
Who's that?
What is that thing?
Don't come any closer.
Back off.
Back off.
Stop it.
The same voice that I heard two nights ago.
He said...
"""Do not be afraid."
"My name... is Indrid Cold""."
And he said to me...
"""In a place this size."
Equator.
Three hundred.
Three hundred will die.
Wait for me.
I will return.
"I will see you in time""."
And that was it.
It's a Iittle...
Have a look.
She knew.
I didn't see anything.
You want to hear the chief's latest phone call?
Yes?
- Thank God you're there.
- Gordon?
"I know I sounded crazy the other day, but things are getting weird out here."
"Slow down, Gordon."
- He's here.
- Who's here?
Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.
"Gordon, let me talk to him."
Sure.
Hang on.
I saved my job.
That's good.
But how?
"Well, last night I showed my work."
I will be promoted soon.
Congratulations.
So today's dinner is your treat.
Okay?
Done.
Tell Carol as well.
Cool.
How did you come here?
"Wow, Carol!"
It's amazing!
I also feel like doing something.
Shall I go for a shoulder massage?
Very funny.
Go out.
We will meet for dinner.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
We will meet for dinner.
But what about lunch?
I am very busy right now.
I can't.
Please go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Give me some money then.
What?
Is good.
It make you relax.
(GROANS)
Get me out of here!
Get me out!
"Oh, pardon moi!"
"Oh, pardonnez-moi, monsieur."
Let me out.
"Wait, I shall get the button."
WILBUR:
Easy!
One moment.
Stop this thing.
"Voila, we stop."
"Good, oui?"
And now to get you down.
Just one moment.
"One moment, monsieur."
"Monsieur, one moment."
(SIGHS)
And now for the landing.
(GASPING)
"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Let me go!
Let me go!
"There we are, monsieur."
You are next.
Shampoo?
You're a sick man.
That's it!
"I've got the merchandise all right, but I can't deliver it."
They're checking everyone in and out of the hotel.
Thank you.
"Alright, say ""kimchi""."
Kimchi.
Here.
Thanks.
No!
Get away from me!
I said don't!
Don't!
Let me go!
Please!
Please!
Don't do this!
"No, no..."
Where's the vibrator?
"Sorry, I'll go get it."
Found it.
Ready.
And... action!
"Wait, no..."
Stop...
"Please, let me go."
No streetwalkers allowed here.
You talk big for a kid.
Thanks.
See you in a bit.
But you allow that?
Delivery girls are fine.
They're not filthy like you.
"I used to be a call girl, you know."
That's an ancient term.
You're showing your age.
What are you going to do with him?
"What do you mean, ""do with him""?"
He can't stay here forever.
No.
"When he's recovered, that's for him to decide."
"You look a little flushed, dear."
Do I?
Perhaps you should get some fresh air.
"Well, when it's a little cooler, I will."
"Well, it's time for my rest, I think."
I'll look in on the patient.
Hello.
Hello.
I've had an idea.
"Now, look."
"I say the word, and you repeat it after me."
You understand?
Never mind.
You'll soon catch on.
"""Chair."" Now you say it."
"""Chair."""
Chair.
Very good!
Very good!
"""Door."""
Door.
Oh!
"Uh, ""clock."""
- Clock.
- Yes.
"""Mirror."""
- Mirror.
It smells good.
I'll just go get the clothes.
That machine's thunking again.
Paulie!
"How are you, Frank?"
"-l'm good, considering."
"-Yeah, of course."
Of course.
Coffee?
Nettie's down with the laundry.
Stay for lunch?
Osso buco.
Osso buco.
Nettie fixes it piemontese.
Peppers and everything.
"No, that's all right. I had my lunch."
-Can I get coffee?
"-No, thanks."
So.
What do you think?
"Well, same old thing."
This time it's this Calhoun guy.
I never liked him.
-He's a cracker.
-Of the worst kind.
He's out of here tomorrow.
"No, I don't think so."
What are you talking about?
He's a reed.
You push him and he bends.
Not this one.
This one's a terrier.
"Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase."
"Me, you, dinner."
Pi-cha-kow!
- What the...?
Ow!
Oh!
- Ka-chow!
- Please!
- I know.
I get that reaction a lot.
I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand.
Agh!
Ow!
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Did I scare you?
"A little bit, but I'll be all right."
OK.
I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
"Do what you gotta do, baby."
But listen.
Be careful.
"Folks around here are not firing on all cylinders, if you know what I mean."
Ka-ching!
Ah!
I'll keep that in mind.
"- Hey there, Mater."
"- Howdy, Sally."
"- Hi, folks!"
- Good morning!
You know her?
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.
What?
I think I'll stay here for a while.
It's peaceful.
Go home.
It was good to meet you.
Thank you.
"Don't look back, Tony."
"Hey, Tone."
Where are Sid and Michelle?
No idea.
"You're a terrible liar, Jal."
Anybody can see you've got something going on.
- Shit!
- Christ!
What the fuck?
!
Tony!
- What the fuck are you...?
- Shut up!
"- Sid, are you gonna let him?"
"- Tony, I'm objecting to..."
You're always fucking objecting!
Can't you do something?
OK.
"OK, Jesus."
"Tony, what?"
"Are you trying to scare me, because it's not working?"
I love you.
I'm saying it again.
OK?
And you.
"I love you too, you little fucker."
This is wrong.
In our hearts you are today...
You're thirty three.
The age of Christ.
- Cheers.
Here's to you.
Bottoms up!
I bet you had forgotten.
Call us when you wake up.
Cheers.
Yes.
Psychomot.
It's you.
You are Mister...
Thomas.
Right?
- Yes.
How are you?
I just woke up.
I didn't call you.
Excuse me?
- I didn't call you.
How are we in contact?
It's normal.
Do you see the small cube next to you?
It's a narco-stopper.
It calls us when you wake up.
Dr Sorensen wanted to talk to you.
I'll go get him.
Doctor Sorensen!
Mr Thomas.
Hello.
I imagine you don't recognize me.
There it is!
"It'll soon be a steak, poor ostrich."
Let's scare it off.
-With what?
With these.
Here it comes...
We'll make you run for your feathers.
Senna.
The firefighters said that a cigar started the fire.
I don't buy it.
It was an accident.
Let me make you feel better.
Think.
-No.
"Please, think."
All grown-ups suck.
-Right.

They bumped the meeting till tomorrow night.
"Eddie, look, I... she's not Mary."
Not by a mile.
But you know what?
No one everwill be.
"Hey, Ed."
I'm sorry about today.
I'm sure Gwen is very nice.
Maybe some other time.
It's about 1:00 in the morning.
"I'm a little wired, so I'm driving down to Richmond tonight."
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
"I know it's really late, but my car broke down just up the road."
I wondered if I could use the phone.
Hello.
It's him.

"Well, hey, Gordon."
She said she doesn't wanna talk.
"Yeah, just go back to work, ok?"
Work?
I don't care about work.
"Oh, you see this?"
"This is work, ok?"
Dad...
"Ok, what else?"
My cell phone?
Work.
Definitely work.
Garbage.
"And uh, what, watch?"
You take that.
"No more work, ok?"
"Dad, what's gotten into you?"
You're embarrassing yourself.
I want you to come and have some lunch with me.
Just lunch--
"One hour, that's all."
Please.
"Ok, I'll meet you back at the van, Martin."
Ok?
Don't let him do this.
He's just messing with you again.
I'll be fine.
I promise.
Ok?
Just go.
We leave at 5:00.
Don't be late.
"Hey, you ready?"
No.
For safety.
What?
"God, you are killing me with that booty."
Talk to me.
"Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?"
"Come on, just tell me what you want."
Jesus!
"Oh, no, no, no!"
"No, it wasn't me."
It was Ignacio.
He's the one.
"Oh, no."
"Oh, no, no, no."
"Shut up, dude."
"Shut up, all right?"
Just speak English.
Lalo didn't send you?
No Lalo?
- Who?
"- Oh, thank God!"
"Oh, Christ!"
"Oh, I thought..."
What can I do for you gentlemen?
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.
"This afternoon, an associate of ours offered you $10,000."
You should have taken it.
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?
Badger!
Brandon Mayhew.
If either of you have a photo of Molly it would help him repair the laceration on her cheek.
- Same picture.

It was a great vacation.

"- Please, my brother needs help!"
- Why?
Why?
- Hurry!
He's gonna drown!
Okay.
"Hang on, hang on."
Hang on!
We were playing in the tunnel.
My brother got trapped.
Come on.
There you go.
Give me your hand.
"Hang on, we're coming in!"
- Are you hurt?
- My leg's stuck.
Hang in there.
Don't panic.
I don't know.
That's what we have to find out.
I hate it when she says that.
(Angela) Whoo!
"Oh, oh."
I forgot you were coming.
Hi.
You must be Sondra.
Hi.
"Yeah, sorry."
"I, uh..."
I brought cookies.
"Oh, wow."
Uh...
Cookies.
Thank you.
"I know, that's weird, isn't it?"
Is--is that weird?
"No, it's--it's great."
It's great.
I love cookies.
[clears throat]
"So you want to just, uh, come into the kitchen with me, and we'll get us all something to drink?"
Sondra?
Water?
Milk?
"Uh, I, whatever."
Okay.
"She's hot, right?"
Seems...sweet.
I've been dying to find out if anything panned out with Dad's lead.
I tracked down a guy named Henry who encrypted the papers.
"It's not a ghost, okay."
You have to run.
"Why would I think it's a ghost, Blair?"
Come on!
Whoa!
Blair!
"No, Blair, no!"
Connor!
"Don't you touch him, you motherfucker!"
Connor!
Connor!
What the hell is that?
"Blair, the cops."
"Blair, the cops are here."
We...
"The phone call went through, hon."
We have to warn 'em.
Can you get the door open?
"Blair, I have an idea."
Okay?
"We have to stay away from the wall, all right?"
"Okay, here we go."
Ready?
Oh shit.
"Come on, come on, come on."
It's not working.
I have an idea.
"Okay, hurry."
He's talking to the sheriff.
"I sure do appreciate you letting me take a look around, Mr. Tucker."
Please.
Call me Jack.
"We do have a male masseur available, madam."
"Daddy, I can't wait to get my drink on tonight!"
Damn!
Is this whole thing uphill?
Where's the downhill part?
We gonna get our groove on tonight.
"Right, Daddy?"
"Of course, baby."
You know how we do it.

I need you to come with me.
Just a minute.
It's Sophie.
Sophie thanks I have a mistress.
You're worried about that?
"If you lived with Sophie, you'd understand."
Sometimes I yearn for our bachelor days in the army.
"We were happy there, no?"
"Well, I was happy!"
But you-
I wonder If you've ever been happy.
No.
It's not Sophie that worries me today.
I'd rather not.
Okay.
The girls are here now.
Bring them in.
There's plenty of room.
No one's coming in here.
"Don't you want to take a look at the girls, Franz?"

Things die.
It's part of life.
It's bad to kill.
But it's not bad to die.
You die?
"Well, yes, someday."
I die?

You're made of metal but you have feelings.
And you think about things.
And that means you have a soul.

As long as you want.
The kids wake you up?
No.
I just couldn't sleep.
You want to talk?

- Yes.
- You can't stay here.
I know.
"But what have they done to you, Allan?"
"They didn't do anything, Mum."
It was an accident.
Something's happened.
All the old shit has to change.
I've made a decision.
My life's going to be proper now.
I'll lead a proper life.
With a job.
An apartment.
Maybe a girlfriend.
There are four walls.
You can even look out the window.
I'll take it.
I have to see whether my car will start.
It's a Ford Mustang '73.
Can I get you a beer?
"- An FF, please."
- An FF?
I'm Allan.
- Maja.
- Maja?
She's still not answering.
"Yeah, Morgan."
We're on our way to Hilary Ross' house now.
She's still not answering her phone.
"All right, call local police."
He's not going to go quietly.
Do you have Mayor Wennington?
Yeah.
Keep me posted.
You got it.
Hello.
You've reached Hilary Ross.
I'm still getting nothing.
That's her car.
"All right, you two go around back."
I'll draw his fire while you flank him.
You sure you want to split up?
We gotta cover the back and the front in case he runs.
Let's go.
Aah!
Aah!
FBI!
Ohh!
Oh!
You're hit!
I'm good.
"Go, go!"
He's upstairs.
Aah!
Get in here!
Trevor Mills!
FBI!
Yeah.
DUD:
That's Ray.
JOHN:
"So that's got to be our mystery girl, Fantasia."
Her name's not Fantasia.
It's Lila Walker.
"Hey, Pluto."
"What's happening, man?"
"How you doing, Beaver?"
Uh...
They're cool.
"Well, come on in."
Come on in.
Go ahead.
(DOOR LOCKING) This is Fantasia and that's Ray.
"That's Joey, and the whining one there on the couch is Kim."
She had a couple teeth yanked out.
"Fuck you, Beaver."
Why don't you grab yourself a chair?
(SNORTING)
You want to sit down?
"No, that's all right."
I'm fine.
"So, where's this multitude of coke?"
Where's Billy?
He ain't here.
"I can see that, but where is he?"
"Well, he's still in New Orleans."
PLUTO:
New Orleans.
"Well, when's he going to be here?"
Loud.
It's loud.
- You are ruining my pre-game mix.
- What am I gonna say?
"- Hey, Spencer, give me my TV back."
"- Hi, Spencer."
"- Give me my TV back, buddy."
"- Hey, No ""buddy."""
"- How about ""jerk"" or ""idiot""?"
- Mr. Crabs.
- Mr. Crabs is an option.
- Your hand is on my leg.
"- Oh, your hand's on my leg."
"- No, it really isn't."
"Classic he said, she said."
"Okay, Jess, just pull over right here."
- Whoa!
- Come on.
What are you doing?
"Okay, you know what?"
Just one more shot.
"One more time around, Jess, and then we're good."
You got this.
- Good.
- Here we go.
"- All right, you got this, Jess."
- Come on.
Come on.
Just one more time.
Gonna...
- This is the time.
This is the time.
I don't believe Miss Morgan would care to be disturbed at this hour.
- You don't believe?
- It's six o'clock in the morning...
- I believe...
- I don't CARE what you believe.
- I know her a lot better than you do.
"- Go home, Pal!"
Rose!
- Rose!
- Hey!
Hey!
Do you hear that?
What the hell is going on?
"It's him, isn't it?"

"Oh, my God!"
Oh!
Oh!
Do you believe this?
Rose!
Where are my shoes?
What does he think he's doing out there at this hour?
I'm gonna...

He's insane.
"I know, isn't it wonderful?"
Get the hell out of here!
Don't ya know people are trying to sleep!
Yeah!
Pipe down!

Yes.

I think the... that's not her mother.
- So she talks?
- We're communicating.
Communicating.
Take these now.
We have to get out of here.
It's not safe here anymore.

She needs our help.
She's not a mutant.

Charles?
Eating?
Pipe throwing?
It's okay.

Take the gun.
Dump the body.
Text me when you're on the way back.
You have anything else you need?
Food for the kid?
mutie.
It's okay.
I got a vest.
See?
"Hey, I thought I told you guys to stay put."
Her fault.
We need to check for other victims.
"Pete, take this floor."
"John, you're with me."
Don't you die.
Don't you die on me.
Come on.
You're gonna live and see what you did.
You're gonna live.
Come on.
Don't you die.
Come on.
Don't you die.

"Hey, I got it."
I know.
You don't have to say it.
You don't have to say it.
It's okay.
"It's okay, babe."
It's okay.
Okay.

"Indy, Indy, we have no time."
"If you still want the Ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo."
Truck?
What truck?
Let's go!
Get back to Cairo.

All done.
You said something about an autograph?
That would be great.
Thank you so much.
Would you mind...
Would you mind...
Perpendicular.
Put your head down.
Your hair is in the way.
Head down.
Head down.
Are you okay?
"Oh, she's fine."
She looks mad.
"Yeah, that's just her look."
What's that?
"""It looks like her number came up."""
It's a zinger.
She's a lotto girl.
Her number came up.
Get it?
Mmm-hmm.
"Do you remember last year,"
Holy shit!
A fucking...
Uh...
Hard to explain.
It's like a huge-ass spider with a face and dicks coming out of his mouth.
It's...
Peters.
Peters is inside.
Like a Peters-spider mash-up.
"Ah, Katie!"
"Are you doing this, or is this fucking me?"
- I think that's all you.

God!
Fuck!
"Holy shit, you're fucking gross."
Yeah...
"Sorry, can you say again?"
"Katie, hello?"
"Damn it, Katie!"
"Whenever you come back online, just say the word."
"No, I'm not scared, just... bored."
That you guys?
Coming to fix the earpiece?
That's probably a good idea.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Fuck it, man!"
Come on!
You're in danger.
Sonja?
Now we're talking.
"Hey, uh..."
I'm sorry you kids had to see that.
"But, uh... it's a hard life on the rails."
"Yup, yup, so true."
So wise.
You should teach a class.
Bye!
I should.
You guys sure you don't want any more juice?
We don't want any more juice.
"Get out of here, Ethan."
"Okay, okay."

Who are you?
I know we've met.
You're embarrassing me.
"All right, Rick."
Stop stalling.
"Oh, no!"
We don't want any today.

We're through!
Finished!
Finito!
Understand?
"Good afternoon, sir."
(Upper class accent) Good afternoon.
I'm having a day's rough shooting and want some bullets.
"As long as I don't eat a piece of food for a month, I'll be fine."
"Yeah, I thought you said you wore a size six."
Daisy:
She was a size six.
"Like 12 years ago, right?"
"- Hey-- yo, that ain't funny."
Shit.
- I'm sorry.
Maggie:
Don't be like that.
You know you look gorgeous.
Daisy:
"You do, you're beautiful."
"- Hey, Carlos."
"- Hi, baby!"
Bride:
"I said, uh!"
The bitch is four feet tall.
And her man is supposed to have...
- Maggie:
Here you go.
-...a 10-inch dick!
Baby?
- You're sure?
- No.
"Do you want some of this, Carlos?"
- No.
I'm not into that shit.
What are you into?
Are you sure?
- I'm out of here.
- Carlos?
I have new story lines...
- Yes.
Make your selection.
Thomas.

"""poker game"""
There.
You won.
I have nothing left.
But I can bet something else.
You want me to?
- Yes.
I'll bet my body.
Do you want my body?

You'll have my body if you win the next hand.
Or I'll take all your money.
OK?
OK.
You're brave.
You like to play.
I like that.
Two cards.
No cards for you?
You think you're stronger than me.
don't you?
What do you say to that.
little bastard?
Bastard.
Go ahead.
Take me.
Go ahead.
"So long, morning!"
Don't let the door hit your tits on the way out!
"See you around, Matt!"
Don't trip on your...
your giant dick!
Your... giant dick.
I'm exhausted.
Long day.
Long week.
Very.
"Oh, this does feel like heaven."
Should come with a warning...
"""may cause drowsiness."""
"""Do not operate heavy machinery."""
Mm.
Anyway...
Yeah.
Mm.
Fresh sheets.
Mm.
"Yeah, real fresh."
"Well, sleep tight."
You too.
Night.
Night.
Love you.
"Love you, too."
Something's broken here.
I'm not saying that it's not.
I...
We don't...see things the same way anymore --
- Oh.
Um...
"He was here a couple of minutes ago, but I know he's going on soon."
"- I was just wondering, is he okay?"
"- Yeah, he seemed fine."
- Tell him to call me after.
- Okay.
All right.
Y'all having fun?
Good.
Good.
I'm glad.
"Well, our next performer is Eddie Tennenbaum, and, uh..."
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
"Yes, we all love him."
"No, he's not..."
Okay...
"He's not here, though."
I'm sorry.
He's not here.
- But he is...
"- Come on, Eddie."
I don't know where he is.
We can't find him.
Which is fine.
I'm sure he'll be here any second.
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
Eddie?
"Are we back there, Eddie?"
Anywhere?
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hyo-jin?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.
"I'm gonna consult with him, just so you know."
Got that?
Okay.
Good.
Hey.
Say hello.
This is my nephew.
"What, a priest?"
"Not yet, he's in training."
A deacon.
We'll need a translator to talk to the man.
You speak Japanese?
Just a little.
He lived in Japan when he was young.
What's that on your neck?
Nothing.
You've gotta be kidding me.
"What's your name, son?"
Yang E-sam.
Two-three
Is that your real name?
"Yes, sir."
Yeah.
Sure.
I'm down.
Totally cool.
We can just bypass the whole little coffee thing.
Yeah right.
Kind of awkward yeah...
I know.
Wash?
Hola!
Wash?
No I didn't pee on my hands.
Yo mama.
Hey did you see ZACH?
He's over there in the corner booth.
Ah no I didn't see him.
Did you see JP?
Yep.
I saw him.
He looks really hot tonight.
Did you talk to him?
Did you just say he looks hot?
Sorry it was really tacky.
Wasn't it?
So what's the deal with you and ZACH?
Have you guys ever hooked up before?
ZACH?
- Yep.
"Um, no not really."
Seriously?
"Yeah seriously, why are you asking?"
I just can't believe you've never hooked up with him before.
How are you?
Good.
Ow!
Richie!
It was cute when you were five.
Shut up and help me.
Ah!
Freed.
"Hey, ab..."
Sent-minded.
What is he doing here?
You know Brody's my partner.
He comes with the car.
I'll catch you later.
Could he be any more disgusting?
Ha ha.
You don't want to know.
Did you tell Steve you knew?
"Hell, no."
This is your mess.
I'm just a shoulder to cry on.
I appreciate it.
Mom knows.
Is she mad?
"You know, more hurt than mad."
I told you to tell 'em last night.
I couldn't.
The Bears were winning.
Everybody was really happy.
Exactly!
Always take advantage of a good mood.
"Well, you could always quit."
Oh.
Oh.
# Do-do-do-do do-do-do
# Do-do-do-do-do
# Do-do... #
"So, you get a turkey baster and you..."
Is that singing?
I can't hear anything.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
HE GROANS
Where's the fucking remote?
"Oh, no."
"It's all right, you don't have to go."
"I'm sorry, Norma."
I can't do it.
It's my babies here I need.
What are you talking about?
"I'm not coming back, Norm."
"And I am sorry to you three an' all, you went to so much trouble."
"Food was lovely, though."
It's all right.
I understand.
Here.
Cheers.
So what are you going to do now?
Are you gonna go home?
Nah.
She'll come round.
She's just not thinking straight.
Who?
A strange man.
He's trying to get in.
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hvo-jm?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.
"I'm gonna consult with him, just so you know."
Got that?
Okay.
Good.

Just a little.
He lived in Japan when he was young.
What's that on your neck?
Nothing.
You've gotta be kidding me.
"What's your name, son?"
God.
I want this baby.
"But it's not that simple, is it?"
"I mean, it might turn out to be... brownish."
"Oh, right."
And is Moz racist?
No.
"That's not the point, is it?"
It's just... (KNOCK AT DOOR)
I'm comin'!
"'Ey, that's what got you into trouble in the first place."
- Hiya.
Is Moz in?
- He's off hunter-gathering.
He's out gettin' some cigs.
- Can I wait for him?
- Who are you?
Craig.
Friends call me Craigie.
Moz calls me Craigie.
I've got a delivery for him.
Really good gear.
He's been asking us to come round for ages.
- Shall I spark up a doobie?
- I suppose that's the least you could do.
Yeah.
- You haven't got a beer?
"- I have, yeah."
"- You two lesbos, then?"
- What?
- I'm bi.
She's bi-curious.
Call my assistant to set up a meeting.
Know what?
I'm good.
"Besides, I think your next picture's gonna be a prison drama."
"- Hey, still pissed at me?"
- Yep.
"Oh, come on."
I'll make it up to you the next time I'm in town.
You better.
"[Doors close, engine starts]"
That was really cute.
"Oh, stop it."
Kendall.
Ha... nice to see you.
How was San Pedro?
"Wasn't too much traffic, was there?"
What freeway did you take?
"Well played, Castle."
"You beat me, unfair and square."
All right.
Let's get this over with.
Where is she?
Her text said it was important.
I don't know.
"- Let's go, then."
- Yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What?
I don't know.
"Ah, now, Jesus..."
"- No, I do know."
- Well?
I'm not telling.
"Now, look..."
"Jesus, do you hear that?"
Gobshite!
"Now, don't start that."
Just tell us.
- I can't.
- Why not?
"- I just can't, right?"
"- Well, is he married?"
"No, he's not."
"Well, that's something I suppose."
"Ah, Kay..."
"Jesus, stop it, will you?"
"The music getting to you, is it?"
They're inside watching the telly.
"Go on, get in there."
Go.
Get in.
Go on.
Will he marry you?
"No, I don't think so."
"Ooh, the Iouser."
"That's cheatin', that is."
- It's not a game.
"- I know that, Kay."
"I mean, it's his fault as much as Sharon's... isn't it, whoever he is."
Everybody leaves.
"First, my father."
"Monk, don't do this now."
"- Then, Trudy."
Trudy didn't leave you.
Sharona.
"Now, Dr. Kroger..."
I can't blame Natalie for leaving.
"I'd leave me, too, if I had the chance."
"God, I am the king of Garfunkel."
I am oozing Garfunkel.
"She'll be back, Monk."
She just needs time to cool off.
That's right.
She probably feels worse than you do.
She looks pretty happy to me.
"Oh, would you just turn it off?"
Please.
It's just...
It's too painful.
"No, no."
Wait.
Did she just say 15?
I've got four numbers here.
Our next number is 33. 3-3.
"So nice, they named it twice."
Oh.
- My God.
"God, I can't stand it anymore."
All right...
And our final number for $212 million is... 54.
54.
The next departure will be Los Angeles to Chicago.
"Help you, sir?"
"Change, sir."
Sir!
Change.
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.
"-I've got 'em all, what do you want?"
-You want one?
"Okay, new shooter comin' into the game."
"All right, guys, four."
I got it.
Who wants a hard-ways four?
-Two to one.
-Two to one on the hard ways?
Right.
You got it.
What about you?
Dollar here.
"Okay, roll 'em."
Come on.
Don't touch this money.
-Where does he think he's goin'?
-I don't know.
"-Hey, buddy, we ain't got all night."
"-Honey, gimme some money."
"Come on, we're gettin' lucky."
These guys don't know craps from wheat or somethin'.
Come on!
"No, I'm not giving it to you."
What?
"No, you don't understand."
- Piss off
- I´m at the dancefloor.
- We're out of coke.
- I'II never last the night.
I've just seen Danny.
Yugo Danny.
Over there.
- What's up?
"- What's up, Simon?"
Happy Birthday.
- Thanks for the drinks.
- Order whatever you like.
- How can I help you?
- We need some blow.
- That hard-hitter blow?
- I haven't any on me.
- Can you get some?
- Maybe.
But I've no wheels.
- I'II drive.
- When do we get it?
I've got pussy going.
You'll have to take 10 grams minimum.
- We'll take 20.
If we go now.
- That'll be 2500 in cash.
- I haven't got it.
- We haven't got that much.
Then I can't help you.
Here.
- What's the PIN?
- 1632.
There's your answer.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Come with me.
Let's confirm this.
"Schmidt, how you doing?"
"Uh, not -- not -- n-not good."
I'm -
- I'm woozy.
C-can't -- can't feel my legs.
You look nervous.
Nervous?
No.
"Well, you should be nervous, because if he's lying -- if I learn that he's wasting my time --"
"Hey, guys!"
Come here!
There's something wrong!
What?
What's wrong?
What's wrong with him?
I don't know.
He must be having some kind of allergic reaction to the drug.
I ca-
- I ca-- I can't...breathe.
He's dead.
You killed him.
What if he was lying?
!
He wasn't lying!
He gave you the answer!
Ask your guy!
Rashad!
Because this sleeping in all day till you go to work at night is not gonna fly on my day off.
- Okay?
"- Look, can I just sleep right now?"
Honey?
What?
You okay?
I'm...
Yeah.
I'm tired.
Okay.
"Handcuffs might seem like overkill, but they're going on."
"They're going on, okay?"
You have the right to remain...
- This is a stupid law.
- Ha-ha-ha.
"Hey, Twister."
Eddie?
"Daddy didn't let you out, huh?"
Good boy.
I am sure...
Ed.
"Jeez, it's almost 2:00."
Are you kidding me?
You didn't feed Twister.
You didn't let him out.
Peed all over the floor.
- What time is it?
- It's almost 2.
"I don't care if you don't wanna eat, but the dog's gotta eat."
- Wow.
Okay.
"- All right, get up."
"Oh, God, it hurts!"
Worst porn ever!
Worst porn ever!
"-Oh, make it stop!"
-I am trying!
Get the ball.
Ready?
Get the ball!
"You're cute, but you're not too smart."
Did I just throw this?
-Hi.
-Hi.
I accidentally packed these with my stuff.
-Who is this?
-Phoebe's friend's dog.
I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.
You are so cute.
"I wish I could play, but I've gotta go to work."
I hope I stop talking like this before my meeting.
"Yes, I do."
"Bye-bye, Joey."
"Seriously, I can't stop it."
Come here!
Hey!
That's Rachel.
She used to live here.
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.
But we can't have her.
I really miss her.
"Hey, you understand, right?"
So we'll skip class tomorrow and go hiking?
I was kind of hoping to give my legs a day off.
Come on.
It'll be fun.
I know this off-leash trail.
"- Oh, I don't have a dog."
- I do.
Lola.
My pug.
- You have a pug named Lola?
"- Yeah, short for Lolita."
"- And she's getting pretty fat, dude."
- Let's get those heart rates up!
"- All right, let's go!"
"Come on, now!"
Ten rounds of jumping jacks!
"Yo, up!"
Up!
Up!
Come on!
"- Ah, hello, ladies."
"- Hi, Mrs. Whedon."
"- Hey, Mom."
- Where's Dad?
He's in the kitchen with Nicole's mom.
"OK, those two fingers on those..."
That...
Yeah.
Second fret.
Your pinky goes on the third fret there.
Hit it.
Hit again.
Everything's kind ofhot.
I feel like I can't catch...
catch my breath.
He looked human.
But there was just something... wrong about him.
That's when I heard the voice.
The same voice that I heard two nights ago.
He said...
"""Do not be afraid."
My name... is Indrid
"Cold""."
And he said to me...
"""In a place this size."
Equator.
Three hundred.
Three hundred will die.
Wait for me.
I will return.
"I will see you in time""."
And that was it.
"Gordon, all that..."
It's a Iittle...
Have a look.
Earthquake in Ecuator.
More than three hundred deads.
She knew.
I didn't see anything.
You want to hear the chief's latest phone call?
"Yes, sure."
$%#
Yes?
- Thank God you're there.
"Pardon, my Mariska."
Which on side shall we start it?
"Below or above, totally all the same."
One.
Two.
- Now from there.
- Three.
- Now this.
- Four.
Very good.
Now like this.
Some.
Now that.
Great.
Ready.
Come on.
What's it like?
What?
Ow.
Well beautiful.
I did not see one like this yet.
"Newer cardboards, Ágika!"
Wow it no.
Not at all.
Our kindest guest humiliates himself with so inferior work.
This can not be.
"Me, not spare, my Mariska."
"Now, when I feel well finally."
"Cardboards, Ágika!"
Here you go.
"If it is for major lord, has desire for him really."
What his blessed hand yes.
"Don't worry, my doll."
Don't cry.
Forget about it.
"No, grandma."
I don't want to forget.
"Wake up, Maria."
Get up already.
Get up!
What's the matter?
- I'm leaving.
"- So soon, Quico?"
When are your parents coming for you?
I don't know.
Did you ask grandma?
"- Bye, Maria."
"- Bye, Quico."
"Don't step on the lines, Barbuda."
"Goodness, Maria!"
I don't know if I'll make it.
"Look, the cotton candy man."
Spin it around.
This one.
- We have a winner.
- Two reais.
- It's cheaper in the circus.
- Life is expensive these days.
I want a piece of this cloud.
"Look at the seagulls, Maria!"
Can we shoo them away?
- Want to get your feet wet?
- Yeah.
I've missed you so much!
Where the hell did he go?
"Oh, wait."
"Wait, wait, wait."
Got him.
- Looks like it's going down.
- Take him.
Freeze!
"Hey, right there."
Don't move.
"Come on, let's get him up."
Jesus!
I think they bought it.
Absolutely.
"Textbook bust, sir."
"Yes, sir."
Looks like we got a full pound of the blue stuff.
"Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?"
James Kilkelly.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.
Hey.
"You weren't home, so I let the delivery guys in."
- I hope that's okay.
- Absolutely.
So you bought a bed.
Yeah.
"What is that, a king?"
Pillow top?
"Oh, my God."
You really are a chemistry teacher.
You mind?
Wait.
This guy's Ollie?
They fucking talk about Ollie all the time.
I thought they made him up.
What?
"It's always like, ""we went to the zoo with Ollie."
"We built a fort with Ollie."""
"""Yeah, okay."""
Nope.
He's real.
And he's really all right?
"No, I'm gonna marry some douchebag."
"Uh, hello?"
He's a good guy.
"Well, he better be."
He is.
He's good with the boys.
He likes my mother.
He likes your mother?
Sober?
Go figure.
Pain in the ass.
"Well, you know, if I don't like him, this whole thing is off."
Right.
Seriously.
Okay.
"Better, right?"
You know it's better.
"Mmm, mmm."
Fuck ratings.
I don't care about ratings.
"Well, that's easy to say..."
About me.
About my diagnosis.
And you're not.
I have schizophrenia.
Ha-ha-ha.
I hear you.
I hear you.
I know.
I know.
"Go, go, flow."
"Joe, Joe."
Doe.
Go.
I hear you.
Hear...
Hear...
Hear you.
Don't eat that.
It's wicked gross.
Try the pancakes.
They come with a cherry.
Good morning.
Welcome to kindergarten.
I couldn't feel stupider.
I graduated magna cum laude.
Obviously not from art school.
- How long do we have to do this?
"- What, you don't like art therapy?"
"Nice, Edward."
I see you've chosen to draw a house.
- Is this your childhood home?
"- Yeah, that's where I was born."
"Hey, little man."
You've been through a lot lately.
How you doing?
I have nightmares sometimes.
I get scared.
You do?
?
Sure.
So do i.
"Hey, i have an idea."
How about i sleep in here tonight
Just in case i get scared?
Okay.
I'll protect you.
Oh!
Okay.
What if i get scared?
"I'll protect you, too."
My hero.
"Oh, geez."
Ohh.
I didn't know it was gonna get that crowded!
"So, what do you think of the book so far?"
"Dude, seriously."
Quit asking me.
I will throw this book out the window.
That's the only signed one in the world.
It's a collector's item.
"We'll always have omaha, mouth."
You just said a mouthful.
Nice.
Charlie's taking care of it.
"Come on, come on!"
"Dale, Dale..."
Dale!
CHARLIE:
"This is 2-11 to base, 2-11 to base."
I need an ambulance out here on Sulphur Springs road right away.
That son of a bitch nailed him.
Yeah.
Dale?
"Hey, man, hey."
Hang in there.
I've got an ambulance on the way.
"I'm going to run in the house and get you some blankets, okay?"
"Are you dead, mister?"
Hmm?
"Are you dead, mister?"
"No, not quite."
Where's the lady at?
She's over there.
"Don't go away, come back."
Come back here and stay with me.
Yeah.
Just stay here with me.
How did you get the blood on yourself?
I got in a fight.
(GROANING)
What do you do with your keys?
Oh...
I lock things up.
Come here.
I can't see your face.
- It w... it was terrible!
- Yes.
- They took my wallet and my skates and my tie.
- No.
What... what homeless person needs a tie?
"Oh, my God."
"I am so sorry, Mitchell!"
"Okay, um..."
Can you give me my phone?
"'Cause I got to, you know, cancel my cards."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Oh, God."
I hope you have juice.
That thing has been buzzing like crazy.
"- Oh, God!"
Okay.
- Okay.
My meeting's been pushed up.
It's in 15 minutes.
"Okay, okay."
"Okay, okay."
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Look at me.
Look at me.
- Huh?
Yeah.
"- Hey, hey."
"This is a test, and we don't sweat the small stuff."
- Just let it go.
- Stop it!
Stop it.
"I know you think you discovered the new you, but you are controlling even when you're trying to not be controlling."
Go to the warden and tell him about me having that shiv.

You going stir-nuts to o?
This is a sure out for you

"Hey, dummy u"
Take it.
"Get out of he re, before I change my mind."

"All right, Ross."
Sit here.

[WHISPERS] I've missed you so terribl
.
Mm
I've brought her here.
You can't send her away.
ht.
"All right, all rig"
"All right, madam."
I got the ice cream across the street from a little shop.
They're sure they can get you out.
"They'll take care of me, all right."
[SOBBING]

"Please don't worry, will y"
t.
"Just a minute, ladies."
"No, no, no, no."
Fired?
"Wait, no."
Don't fire him.
Look.
See?
I'm moving it.
I'm moving the cable.
I'm moving...
Get him out of here.
Stan.
"Stan, don't do this, please."
Not now.
Okay?
Come on.
"It's too late, Billy."
I'm sorry.
I'm apologizing.
Mr. Logan has been terminated.
I don't want him back in the building.
You make sure you get his security pass and keys.
Get him out of here!
Stan.
Listen to me.
"It was my fault, too."
I tripped over the cable.
I...
"Natalie, this is not about you."
I've been warning this guy all summer.
"Come on, people!"
Let's get that stage reset.
Make it look good.
- Oh!
"- Okay, all right."
"Time to go, time to go."
- Okay.
Horace:
Let's go.
"- Okay, I'm going."
- Let's go.
"- Hey, wait, wait, wait."
Where's my twenty?
- Look under Pete's watch.
- Holy shit.
- All right.
That's enough.
- Fucking scumbag!
What the-- Horace:
That's enough of your shit.
"Let's go, goodbye."
"- What the fuck was that, huh?"
- Yeah.
Mary Ann: (quietly) Iâm just gonna go.
- Where are you going?
- I'm-
"- See my sister, I told you."
- Why are you going there?
- Iâm just gonna go to my sister's house.
I can go where I want.
"- No, you're not."
"- I don't need your permission, Horace."
"- No, you're not."
- You have no right to keep me here like a fucking prisoner.
"Just let me go, please."
- Is my brother going to die?
"- No, he is not!"
"No, he is not!"
- What are you doing?
- I'm a doctor.
I need to clear an airway.
- You got a pen?
- What?
A pen?
Do you have a pen on you?
Here we go.
Come on!
All right.
Come on.
"Breathe, damn it!"
"All right, here we go."
Come here.
Help me out.
"Get him up, get him up."
I got him.
I got him.
- What do you got?
- A 12-year-old trapped in a culvert.
Possible fracture to the left lower extremity.
Don't jostle him.
He's hypothermic.
You can cause an arrhythmia.
I'm Dr. Ross.
I work in County ER.
I need a number six ET tube.
There we go.
- I need a portable O-2 and an ambu-bag.
You can't force things.
"I mean, relationships, they either work, or they don't."
I could be your last chance at happiness.
Come inside.
I can't.
Okay.
Good night.
- Jenna?
- Where are you?
Where are you?
No!
No!
No!
"Oh, fuck!"
"- Jenna, I had an accident."
- You asshole!
I had a car accident!
"Who the fuck are you with, you bastard?"
Jenna!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew this was gonna fucking happen.
I'm here.
I'm here.
"Why would you lie to me, Michael?"
What are you talking about?
What were you doing all night?
I was with Chris.
"God, you lying bastard."
You make me so sick.
You know?
I'm really lucky you became my husband.
Really?
Well now is the start of our new life.
Oh come on!
You're so handsome!
And you...
You're the fairest of them all!
Promise me that it'll only be me.
You're the only one I will love.
Promise me that you won't leave me.
I'll always be here by your side.
"You're my life, Migs."
"I love you, Joy."
"Here, I've already prepared it because I knew you were coming."
-Nice.
-There you go.
Is it nice?
.
Thank you.
-Hey Migs!
Your change!
-Buy load instead!
Thank you Migs!
-Joy!
Stay here first.
-What happened?
-We'll take care of that.
"-Migs, wake up!"
It's too low.
-Why did you come inside?
-Alex please!
What is that?
I hear balloons.
"I'm actually, uh..."
I'm doing birthday parties now.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
"- Well, that's good."
"- Yeah, yeah, it is good."
"So, okay, uh, take Meemaw to the doctor, got it, and I'll do a good job of that."
"I won't let you down, okay?"
I promise.
"- Thank you, Chip."
"- Thank you, Mom."
"Where are you, by the way?"
- I gotta go.
- You outta town?
Mom?
- You doin' okay?
- Hi.
"- Hey, Mom, what's goin 'on?"
"How are you, Cody?"
All is well.
"How are you, Mom?"
- Where's Logan?
"- Uh, he's sleeping."
"Oh, God, he always was a sleeper."
"- Man, you know that."
"- You have a lot of energy, more than him."
[Chuckling]
"Um, I have a little surprise."
Please share.
"What is it, what is it?"
F...
"Unbelievable, man."
- She's fucking impossible.
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
What happened?
She's worse than Audrey.
Or maybe it's you.
Can I buy you a drink?
"Uh, are you supposed to smoke around pressurized oxygen?"
No.
That's why I turned it off.
Dip shit.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
That was the wrong way to start this.
- Gee.
"- Maggie, my name is Lance."
"I'm, uh... in a relationship with your niece."
I know your mother very well.
I've been on the wrong end of her wrath a good many times.
"- And, uh..."
- Up-up-up.
Shit.
Shit!
Fuck!
She lose the lisp?
Pardon me?
Julia.
Had a bad lisp as a kid.
I only rooted for her.
Yeah.
She told me about that.
- Yes Sir!
Got a big shadow though!
She's the biggest woman in Japan.
Here's name's Amelian.
- Amelian!
- Yes Sir!
Beat him up!
Don't pull me!
Stay away from me...
I've got B.O.!
I'm getting dizzy.
Please let me go!
Let me down!
What a B.O.!
You still want Amelian?
No...!
I wouldn't dare...!
Give me the money!
"Some more, don't you try to fool me!"
Where's the 'Beast'?
I won't tell you.
Amelian has been again!
I can't hear your death bells ringing!
"You wouldn't tell the lady, I'll get you a man!"
Hiroshima!
Why is it taking so long?
Have you got it yet?
In a second!
Soon!
It is hot!
It's time!
"Let me do the introductions,"
Stay up.
Stay up!
- Most home runs?
- Most home runs?
Hank Aaron beats Babe Ruth.
That's nothing.
That's an easy one.
Here we go.
Are you ready?
"Okay, we got it."
We got it.
"All right, come here."
- You gotta push your leg out.
Ready?
- I can't feel....
"It's okay, I'll help you."
"All right, here we go."
"All right, buddy."
It's okay.
Come here.
Come here.
"All right, listen, give me your hands."
You gotta hold on right here.
Hold on with both hands.
You hold on!
You gotta keep your head up above water.
Do you understand?
"- Yes, you do."
- I can't....
- I can't hold....
- I'll knock out these hinges.
- I can't.
Thanks.
- Nice isn't it?
- Yes.
Can we go out and try?
Yes?
Yes?
What is it?
- Can you help us?
- Yes.
What is it about?
- Are you a priest?
"- No, I'm the sexton."
Where is the priest?
He is not here.
- Can we call him?
- Yes.
Of course that's possible.
You can go with us to the police station?
And talk to the agent and explain to him?
No problem.
Open the door!
Get out!
Come one!
Thanks.
Don't you owe me any explanation?
It was all a little bit too much.
The accident.
The divorce.
What is this?
What is this?
Where is our mother?
I'm going crazy.
What special way?
You've got your heart in the wrong place.
I must open your chest and put it right.
Then I'll sew up your chest.
Then you'll be okay.
He can stand it.
"Master Huang, this knife alright?"
Just about.
Ah Foon!
Hold him down!
I'm fine!
I'm okay.
Mousy...
Ah Foon!
Drink to the Marshal!
I'm generous.
I don't bear grudges.
I thought you're really clever.
Master Huang.
Stop drinking.
You're on duty now!
"Master Huang, see you later."
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
So long...
White Tiger!
Give yourself up!
We'll get you!
There's no escape!
Be careful!
You just scared me dead!
I wouldn't mind going to the toilet myself.
"Listen, not your money."
Understand me?
Let us not minds.
"Drãguþo,siton thefloor!"
"And you, bro."
Give it up.
Without alarm.
Open it clean.
No stalling.
This guy is friends with you?
Come on!
Faster!
"No hurry, right?"
Breathe.
- Finally!
- Give yourself a hand.
At the door.
What's going on?
You open
We have to go.
Let's go.

"- Come on, move that up."
Let's go.
Ah station standby
They pulled the alarm at this address.

- Nobody has done nothing.
What?

- No a. ..
- You have triggered the alarm?
[Grunts]
Jab out.
Always jab out.
"When you get in trouble, just jab out."
"No, you're telegraphing those kicks."
You're staring right at his leg that you're kicking.
"Jab, jab."
Constantly moving.
"Jab, jab, jab, jab."
Ah.
Hips.
Hips.
Get out of there.
Hips.
"All right, all right, all right."
- Fuck!
- You okay?

- Yeah?
- Fuck.
- Relax.
Just relax.
"Stop saying ""fuck."""
"Jay, show her how to do it."
Show her how to chamber the kick.
Jay:
See how the knee comes off?
This is the only part I'm worried about.
Turn it.
There you go.
Take a little distance.
Get in.
Let's kill them!
That was the deer in my dream

I don't know what to do.
I...
I need to talk to you.
I...
"Hey, Marie."
It's me.
What's up?
Yesterday I got home and found him.
He didn't even tell me he was coming.
- A man was killed?
"- A Federale, right in front of him."
"Three agents wounded, one lost his leg."
It's like what you hear about from Iraq or something.
- The IEDs.
"- Oh, Jesus."
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.
Hank talked to his ASAC for about an hour.
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.
"He hangs up the phone, goes right back to bed."
"And all he keeps saying is, ""I'm fine."
I'm fine.
"Leave me alone."""
"Baby, not now."
It's...
"It's me, Hank."
Sorry.
"Hey, buddy."
What's.?
What's up?
I just...
Do you mind if I.?
What are you doing?
- I cloned your card as you were asleep.
- Whoa.
Okay.
Put the knife down.
What are you going to do with that?
I drew your attention to this job.
"Sonja, put the fucking knife down, okay?"
It's not funny.
"Should've called your mum, Cooper."
"- But you called me, and I led you here..."
- Sonja.
- You know what?
- ...
like a breadcrumb trail.
Put the knife down.
Drop the act.
"Okay, seriously, drop the knife, Sonja."
It's not fucking funny.
Put the knife...
This isn't what I signed up for.
"I'm fucking done, okay?"
Fuck!
What the fuck?
"Oh, fuck!"
Oh!
Holy fuck!
Stop!
Fuck!
"Oh, fuck!"
"Oh, fuck!"
-  Cooper.
Let's go.
-We're not leaving.
Enough now.
-Now what are we supposed to do uh?
How are we supposed to get him back?
"This is all your fault, this whole thing is your fault."
"You wanna play that game, you really wanna go there?"
"Take a hard look at yourself, son."
"Come on, let's go."
Get your hands off me.
Don't touch me.
Fuck all of you.
Come on.
I left money on the table.
I'm sorry about this.

"-No, you'll burn yourself."
"Come on, give me..."
-Stop.
"Hyder, stop."
You can't tell me I'm not paying for it.
What do you want?
"Coke, speed, anything."
You might as well have the good stuff.
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Leave me.
Just get away from here.
Get help.
Get help.
"Paul, Paul, Paul..."
"Stop being so bloody noble, okay?"
Fuck!

"Make an effort, Paul, please!"
"Hey, Mr. Gimp."
"Hey, Mr. Gimp."
"Still got one bullet left, soldier boy."
Use it.
Good idea.
You're magnificent.
I'm not finished yet.
Let's just go.
I want a word with Felix first.
He's crippled now.
He's bloody paralysed.
Just let him be.
"- Wait in the car, Paul."
I won't be long
"- No, no."
"Just go, please."
Here you go.
Thanks.
Hey.
You come here a lot?
"Yeah, 2 or 3 times a week."
You wanna sit there?
There?
Yeah.

- How about you?
- I'm fine.
- Let's get out of here.
"- Yeah, let's."
- Were you surprised?
It's not such a bad thing to keep a man waiting.
You don't want him to think he's the only date you've had in years.
- It's not a date!
- Give me the bow.
Where's the bow?
"Hey, your mother did you up again."
"Looks terrific, Miss Morgan."

Yeah.
We're in the money.
I filed the claim.
We're rich

No trouble at all.
I went right in and signed the names.

"Lisa, please."
No more talk.
"But all day long, you haven't eaten enough for a sparrow."
And now it's late.

What is it?
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.

Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
"What's wrong, Selena?"
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I've gotta tell someone."
I can't keep it to myself any longer!
- Every time I go out in that yard...

Lucas didn't desert.
How do you know?
Because I killed him!
I killed him Christmas Eve in the shack!
- I don't believe it.
- I did.
I buried him in the sheep pen!
"Selena, you've gotta call the state police."
No.
"No, I can't!"
You've got to.
You should've done it long ago!
Please don't make me!
"Listen to me, Selena."
Listen.

Thanks for all your help.

"Well, goodbye."
Goodbye.

I don't think I'm capable of taking care of myself right now.
I need help.
I know that's a lot to ask of an ex-wife.
"David, I think that you should sleep in my basement."
Ok?
Come on.
"Oh, angel."
You're the best.
You're the best in the land.
"- Stop, please."

"We'll do things, like before."
But you have to believe me that I'm your mom.
You won't really do that.
I promise.

It's not your fault Lukas died.
The accident wasn't your fault.
Do you really believe her?
Hmm?
Hmm?

She'd know what he's doing.

I can not take her with me.
Can not do that.
Not possible.

You can tell me.

Hannah G. got dumped because she liked too many of Jonty Crawford's pictures.
"Hannah's such a ""like"" whore."
"She'll, like, ""like"" anything."
"Even, like, a gross tuna sandwich you, like, made or whatever."
"That was super interesting, Jenna, but it added nothing to the conversation."
Just a tip.

I can't see it.
- Zoom in a little.

"No, sweetheart."
Even I have to meet my old friends.
But you can do one thing.
- What?
Go with Aakash.
- Who is Aakash?
You don't know Aakash (Sky)?
I know.
It's above.
- Correct.
He is always above her.
She is Aakash's ground.
Thank you.
"- Yes, sir."
Hi.

"Baby, where were you?"
You said you will come in ten minutes.
See this.
Whole 25 minutes have passed.
You are always late.

And see this.

Let's go.

Where are you Dad?
Where did he go?

Are you all right?
I've been better.
"Daddy, what is doing down there?"
Go back to here.
I do not know if I can.
There's a way.
More you do not like.
"Do you want I pull back, right?"
"Hurry up, you can."
"Least we will not like from you, Dad."
"Well, I presume technically is a tactical retreat,"
I think it will just a bit.
"-Yeah, Dad."
-It is going well.
-It.
Volta.
That's right.

Now see if you can turn to the other side.
-All right.

"Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone."
- We'll talk about it later.
Just floor it.
- Should I back up?
- Go that way.

I'll be out of the way there.

"I'm sorry, all right?"
I'm sorry.

You do something with your hair?
Would you help me with this bag?
"Just open it up, take everything..."
"- Dude, dude, take your meds."

"Pete, sit."
- You saved at least?
Thank you.

Where's Furio?
"He couldn't get a flight out of Rome, so I'm driving again today."
"Come on in, he'll be right down."
No coffee.
I gotta go.
Okay?
-What did you do to your hair?
-I cut it.
What do you think?
I thought we agreed that you'd talk to me before doing something to your hair.
What do you think of it?
-It's short.
"-Good, he eats his carrots."
-Makes you look younger.
-Benny's waiting for you.
All right.
"Well, here."
You fat honey dripper.

- Who's your connection?
- What's his name?
- What?

"No, man."
No.
I ain't never-
Is it Joe the barber?
"Joe the barber, right?"
"That's who it is, isn't it?"
"- Aw, don't give us any shit."
What's Joe's last name?
"- I don't know, man."
"I know you,II do your best to help."
"You,II also be helping your fellow citizens - and France!"
FRANCE!

(screaming)
"Get off her, let go, let go!"
Pang!
I've been waiting for you!
Get him!
Listen.
Spare my life.
"Last time I spared you, you didn't learn."
It's not my idea.
I disobeyed orders.
Who's orders?
Talk!
We're all hired.
Who by then?
"Lun, Lun Sanye."
(groaning)
(whipping)
(going ringing)
The great whip.
Good.
Great whip.
That's some great throwing.
But I'll never be able to do anything as good as he does.
Sanye!
What's wrong?
"Wide-Eye, Tiger-Wang and Playboy, all of them killed by that young kid!"
What?
Where is he now?
"He's out front, fighting like mad with our men."
Let's go.
No.
Like this.
"I thought this makeup thing was gonna be hard enough, but now-- ok."
Like what?
Um...
Your accent.
My accent?
"It's a little thick, honey."
"Ok, well, what the hell am I supposed to do?"
It's the way I talk.
"""Talk."" See?"
"That right there, ""talk."""
So what are you saying?
"After 7 years all of a sudden, my accent bothers you?"
It's not a question of it bothering me.
"I mean, look, are you smart?"
Sure.
Do you sound smart?
[Grunting]
O-ok.
"Um, so what else?"
Your laugh.
My laugh?
Yeah.
Ha!
"Well, I thought people think my laugh is fun."
"Yes, if you think loud, scary noises are fun."
O-ok.
So what else?
What else?
Nothing else.
Come on.
Tell me!
There's nothing else!
It's great.
Fucking brilliant.

We need to just have Toxie get up and leave.
[Chatter]
He's just the stand in so they could try to get some
Shots off that don't really--
"That guy is like 6'2"", if that."
I know.
That's what I'm talking about.
MAN:
It's just the shoes.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Morning, David."
What's that?
"We need to have Toxie move, remember?"
TRENT HAAGA:
"Yes, I--"
"He can't stay on his knees, otherwise there's no movie."
So how do we-- let's just get the next move.
I'm very wide.
INTERVIEWER:
-Sir.
"-Oh, thank you."
-Would you like the wine list?
-No.
I'll have the Woodbridge Pinot Noir.
Or should we get a bottle?
"Oh, definitely get a bottle."
Coffee for me.
"You know, Sherri, I'd really like to see more of you."
Maybe we should wait and see how tonight goes.
"No, I mean, I've only got one good eye."
Could we change places?
"Oh, sure."
-Are you okay?
"-Oh, yes, yes."
Fine.
-This is a nice place.
-Yeah.
It's my favorite.
You ever come here with Charlie?
I don't know.
Probably.
He's a big steak-eater.
I'm more of a fish guy.
"You know, I'm surf, he's turf."
And we're cops.
-You're very cute.
-You too.
All right.
So tell me about yourself.
"Well, there's not a lot to tell."
I was San Fernando Valley Chiropractor of the Year...
"Alright, Julie."
"- Happy birthday, son!"
- Happy birthday!
Cheers!
Sorry
Don't be sorry.
Are you OK?
I love you.
Me too.
"Mom, I'm just gonna go say 'hi' to Danny, okay?"
Two secs.
"Hey man, you OK?"
"- Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late."
- It's alright mate.
"Yeah listen, I need to talk to you about something."
Alright then.
What is it?
It is a...
There's a case I'm working on.
It's a murder.
And we've found something at the scene.
What?
It's blood but it's not the victim's.
We ran some DNA tests and there's a match.
"Mark, it's Jesse."
"The DNA, it's Jesse."
He's alive.
- So you're saying he's a murderer?
"- No, nobody is saying anything."
"20 years, 20 years, what the hell!"
I don't know.
Nobody knows.
Let him go away.
-Get away.
"- OK, guys, off I go."
Go away!
What crap they consume!
"When he comes to his senses, he'll take us directlyto her."
Do you still think a lady sniper is after us?
This sucker smells of a woman.
A lucky one.
Bitches!
Dirty scum!
Smelly beasts!
I'll tearyou to pieces.
You thought you'd finished Malakhov off!
Up yours!
Dirty scum!
Beasts.
Up yours.
Fuck you.
Get down!
Mines!
Get down!
Mines!
Get down!
Where are you going?
Get down!
"Come here, I'll kill you."
I'll kill you.
Olya!
Olya!
-You are alive!
"Alive, Olenka!"
"Well, when Michelle came to me, she and Darren wanted a sibling so badly for Tammy."
"When they finally got pregnant, they seemed so..."
"So happy, I know."
Yeah.
"Hey, listen, thanks for coming with me today."
"Yeah, well, you know, I wanted to see Violet, and this gives us a chance to hang out."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Things have been a little awkward, you know?"
"Well, no."
"It's just, uh..."
It's nice to see you... outside of the office.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Mnh-mnh.
Apparently... there's a closet situation.
Violet.
"Hey, it's me."
"Uh, Nai and I are outside."
Okay.
Hello?
Vi?
"Could you... could you shut the front door, please?"
And... and lock it.
Both locks.
It's closed and locked.
Okay.
"Hey, you guys."
Hi.
It's so good to see you.
Hi.
After you.
Hmm.
"Oh, thank God."
(LAUGHS)
Let's see them.
There's not as many as I thought.
"Yeah, but they're super pricey."
"That's $20,000 easy."
Twenty thousand?
(WHISPERING) Tallahassee.
"Listen, I'm gonna go meet the fence."
I'll meet you with the money.
Mm-hmm.
- Do you remember where?
- Mm-hmm.
- The parking structure by the tracks.
- Yes.
9:00 sharp.
This is so there's no mix-ups.
So I guess we're keeping this one?
How can we not?
Look at how good it looks on you.
"Tallahassee, baby."
We're almost home.
Home.
Hey!
Hey!
"(GRUNTS) You got the wrong guy, officer."
I wasn't even jaywalking.
It's not like that.
You wanna protect Emma?
Come with me.
What did you tell her?
"Nothing, that it was progressing."
Progressing?
What is?
Eating strawberries is work.
- She didn't want any?
- No.
The strawberries are better in Tehran.
"Fresh air, fresh milk."
I haven't seen any milk.
We're not allowed milk here.
He's right.
Don't be long.
Don't go too far!
"No, we're just here."
Good-bye.
I have bread for you.
Are you well?
Thank you.
That's kind.
You're welcome.
- How are you?
- l'm okay.
How is she?
Who?
You still ask who?
She's well.
- She's well?
- Yes.
How do you know?
My mother went to see her.
And?
- She gonna be okay in there?
Put that down!
"No, come on, come on!"
"Jess, wait!"
"Let's just talk about this, okay?"
Hold on.
"No, that's mine."
You can't take that!
"Jess, hold up."
What are you doing?
I got it!
"It's really heavy, but I got it!"
"Oh, my God, we created a monster."
- She looks like Helena Bonham Carter.
"- Oh, gosh."
"- Soft hands, Jess."
"- Jess, come on, let's share it."
"- You know, work out a system."
- Hey.
"Hey, that's my shirt."
"- No, this is my T-shirt."
- That is my shirt.
It has my name on it.
- Don't drop it.
"Jess, don't..."
"- Come on, everybody out now."
- Give me my shirt!
- I like this shirt.
"Hey, Jess, no, no, no, stop."
- Don't mind us.
We're just here for the TV.
- Who are these guys?
-Rocco.
"Anthony, everything is going to be all right."
Try to sleep.
-Did you like your party?
-I got lots of presents.
I know.
Did you like them?
Yeah.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
"Well, they were friends."
-Did you see my present for you?
-It was on my pillow.
I'm going to be leaving very early tomorrow.
-Will you take me?
"-No, I can't, Anthony."
-Why do you have to go?
-I have to do business.
I could help you.
I know.
Some day you will.
Get some sleep.
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.
I left Naples.
I left Mama.
For a no-good tramp!
"Now here I am in America, in New York."
Alone!
Thinking of my mother.
Without news from home.
You gonna be angry 'cause she lied to you again or what?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm angry."
"You know something, Danny, if I'm honest with myself,"
I also understand why she did it.
"I mean, given the circumstances,"
I probably would have done the same thing.
"Yeah, see, 'cause I think that maybe she just didn't want you worrying about her."
Little hard not to now.
Huh?
I think that she is gonna be fine.
She's gonna be fine.
She's a very tough lady.
She can handle herself.
Everything'll be okay.

They massacred us and destroyed our beans.
I heard it the other way.
That's because the victors get to tell the story.
(GRUNTS)
Okay!
Stop!
Here.
See?
I'm not the bad guy.
Maybe you are telling the truth.
It doesn't really matter.
I have to go.
Are there any more of you?
No.
I'm alone.
What's this?
Is this a bean?
Can this make a portal?
Not anymore.
It was destroyed like the rest of them.
I wear it as a reminder.
A reminder that you're all killers.

May I touch it?
You want to touch it?

"- No, thanks."
- Because of the colour?
- Yes.
Listen...
I'd like to ask you a question.
I'd like to take you out for dinner somewhere.
- Your choice.
- You're strange.
I'll give you my phone number.
"Call me, if you change your mind."
I won't.
I'm a drug addict.
I'm definitely a drug addict.
I'm hooked.
"Hey, easy, easy!"
Right in the nuts!
"Bitch, you asked for it..."
"Hey, Tom, looks like she's not your kind, dude."
Stop the truck and get your paws off her!

That's Maria Concetta.
Bring the gurney here.
She needs a transfusion.
Take her to the ambulance right away.
Deborah?
"But as you drive like a maniac, it helps to pass the time."
- Like a maniac?
- We ought to be dead by now.
I've a daughter too.
I need 2 hours for her.
Spare me!
Not your daughter.
The bypass will be jammed.
I don't know where to go.
- Any idea?
- No.
- I'll go north.
"- OK, go north."
- Where shall I drop you?
- In the north.
OK.
At least you're not complicated.
There.
It was nice talking to you.
- It was mostly me who...
- So...
Thanks for the adventure.
You're welcome.

Little.
Yeah. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Wait a minute.
You can talk to him?
Kinda.
He can't say a lot of words yet but he understands things pretty good.
DEAN:
"Oh, yeah."
I see.
- (METAL CLANGING) - (BOTH CHUCKLING)
He needs food and shelter.
You got plenty of room here.
This place is perfect.
DEAN:
Go away.
I can have him push the door down.
You know I can.
Hogarth.
I can't hide it here.

"God, I'm tired."
"So, he can stay?"
Tonight.
"Tomorrow, I don't know."
- Max is gone?
- Yeah.
I see you flirt with all the ladies here.
Why not?
- [Laughs]
- That's good.
- Is it?
- Make her happy and you ha -
You know what?
You're absolutely right.
That's what does it.
- I love it.
- So you do that to make other people happy.
- Oh yeah.
- That's
-That's nice.
- If you want to.
- Mm-hmm.
Some people don't like women.
I love 'em!
[Laughs]
Look at that smile.
Your eyes are starting to -
What are they starting to do?
Tear?
- They make you feel good.
- [Chuckles]
- Do you like it?
"- Oh, you must have been some devil when you were younger."
- I was never a devil.
"- Aw, I don't know."
"- You don't like me, eh?"
So let 'em wait.
Get rid of the cigar.
- Why?
- Because I said so.
That was a new cigar.
You stay here.
"If anything happens, whistle."
- Whistle?
- Don't you understand?
- What's wrong?
- Let me outta here!
Hey!
Shut up!
Let me out!
I gotta get outta here!
I want out!
I gotta get out!
Out of the way!
"Come on, let's go!"
That's not one of ours!
- It's a different car!
- Someone squealed on us!
Looks like the police!
Police?
Push him out!
- He won't squeal on us again!
- He'll slow down the cops.
I told you he'd be trouble.
"What was that, Karl?"
It's an awful road.
You can't see a thing.
- Who's there?
Stuck in her throat.
- She's a vegetable.
The Gimp has to feed her three times a day.
He has to wipe her.
She shits like crazy.
"Well, she does."
"Diapers don't come in ""size Bodil""."
She needs a double diaper.
- I'm off.
- Give her my best.
"You don't get it, Claire."
Bodil is..!
You can't get through.
She ate a fruit and turned into a vegetable.
- An olive isn't a fruit.
It's a nut.
"- No, an olive is a fruit."
- Anything above ground is a fruit.
- Chestnuts aren't fruit.
- Yes.
"- No, they're nuts."
- Nuts are fruit.
"- No, they aren't."
"Yes, they are."
Glad we got that straightened out.
- There's more if you...
- Thank you.
"Oh no, Bodil..."
- The meat balls are good.

"Way past intros, David."

The slump buster?
You didn't call me back.
"Rita Palandino, Alan, really?"
I'll take my chances.
Go ahead.
Take your chances.
You've lost yours with me.
- Good.
- Fine.
I was fine until he made me call you.
- He made you call?
- Yes.
"Well, yeah, mom, 'cause I was worried about you"
After the one night gross you guys had.
You didn't call me back.
"I didn't call because it was nice to feel wanted by you,"
To be desired and paid attention to.
"We need to jump on now, guys."
Come on.
Hobos do this everyday.
I don't understand it.
Cliff!
You think my name is Cliff?
"Oh, my God, I love it."
I'm Cliff now.
Call me Cliff.
"No, just to clarify:"
Cliff!
We have to get on that train now!
We're running out of dry land!
I have to go back for my bandana.
It's made of cotton!
Leave it!
Leave it!
"Oh, damn it!"
You chose chocolate.
It's what your bandana

"Oh, no."
Now my overalls are stuck.
What's going on with my outfit?
"Do something, Gene!"
He's almost here!
Aah!
We have to hide the chocolate.
Oh...
Where are we going to hide it?
I don't know.
"Oh, no."
And live off what?
The Lord will provide.
I'm still waiting for the Lord to provide me with a new thresher.
I'd love to travel someday.
And I bet you will.

We're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be okay.

- Keep moving!
Castle South clear.
Clear!
We have Castle Sky.
"Five agents in the East Gate, four in the garden."
The rest should be on the South Lawn.
And two policemen on the South Gate.

Keep moving!
Shots fired.
Code Black!
Code Black!

Say again.

You serious?
Look around.
- Stand back!
- The threat is out there!
Go out and do your job!
"Donnie, where'd you send my daughter?"
I'm sure she's fine.
We're in the safest house in the world.
"Well, not today, it's not."
Aah!
You're dead!
"You better not touch me, Sonny Curley!"
I've witnesses!
What did you do to him?
Nothing!
I just gave him a piece of advice!
I dare ya.
I bleeding' dare ya.
I told him to stop fiddling' with himself... when he thought there was no one looking!
I'll batter you!
Sorry.
You'll have to make an appointment.

"You're pregnant, you said?"
Yeah.
"That's lovely, that is."
You sure?
Yeah.
Sort of.
How much did you see?
"Don't worry, I won't tell."
So you saw everything.
No big deal.
It's not the first time.
What?
Here.
What?
It's okay.
Have a sip.
Hurry up!
Son of a bitch!
What took you so long?
Ignoring my calls?
My mother-in-law got sick.
Now you're using your mother-in-law as an excuse?
"You were taking a nap, I can tell!"
"No, I wasn't."
I swear.
Get to work.
"Excuse me, ma'am?"
What the hell?
What are you doing?
Stop her.
"Yes, sir."
"Come with me, ma'am."
Get off me!
"Sergeant, get her out of here."
"Back off, people."
What's wrong with her?
"Please, calm down."
That idiot...
He goes nuts.
Shoves her up against the wall.
Me and my buds step in to try and help...
"Next thing I know,"
I'm in E.R. getting stitches.
We're gonna need the names of all your buds.
"- Hey, Richie."
- Batten down the hatches.
Brother big-mouth strikes again.
Damn it.
Did Steve call you?
Uh-huh.
I told him not to tell anyone.
Does dad know?
"Well, I haven't heard any yelling, so I'd say no."
You want to meet for lunch?
Yes.
Usual?
Richie?
Richie!
"Yeah, I'll see you there."
All right.
- Boyfriend?

Another brother.
How many you got?

And my dad.
You had to know they'd be upset.

You always hurt the one you love.
Artie?
No!
No!
No!
- Artie.
- Yeah.
"Oh, my God. okay, we have to get you to a hospital."
Wh--what did you do to yourself?
"Well, it was the only way I knew how to get the sword."
What if we didn't get here in time?
"Yeah, I thought you would."
"So just--right now, could you just hurry up,"
Pull it out?
Wait.
Wait.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Wait a minute.
Now wait a minute.
Are you sure?
"Yeah, it's the sharpest sword ever made."
It should slide out just like butter.
"Just--just do it really, really, really, really fast."
Okay!
Not like butter!
You all right?
"You'll be back on Monday, right?"
Not for three weeks?
Thailand?
!
Say hi to dad.
'Bye.
I want to cancel my card.
It got stolen tonight.
Where is your friend?
Just get it over with.
Stay down.
Is that all you've got?
Hi.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Fine.
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.
I've felt weird lately.
Are you feeling better now?
It was a crazy night.
Maybe too crazy.
What happened to your face?
Nothing I didn't ask for.
It's Marc.
There's an after-party at Peter Skjoldmark's.
Maybe we should just stay here.
I'm quite tired.
Marc's got coke.
Come on.
I'll look after you.
Can I come back to your place afterwards?
I can't go home.
What?
I'm not pretty no more.
You are beautiful.
You hear me?
Why did he have to come back?
I wish he could have just stayed up there.
You could have married Hector.
You're just saying that.
"You're just saying that, okay?"
*
"You all right, B.?"
Huh...
"oh, yeah."
"I'm shakin', I'm shaking."
"Nah, I'm just getting started though."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
You ain't won nothin' all day.
Come on...
"That's what I'm talking about, yo."
What's good?
"How you doin', can I get in?"
My money good?
"Yeah, fuck it."
All right.
Cuanto?
"$100. a game, man."
$100.?
"Man, roll 'em, man, roll them dice, dude."
Shaking them down ain't gonna make no difference.
"(Man) All right, watch me."
"Come on six... here we go, baby, here we go."
"Four, five, six..."
"Catch that brat, be quick!"
- Whom do you mean?
-That Major!
Be quick!
I was at the door.
Nobody came in or out.
Nobody?
"You slept on duty, didn't you?"
No.
Nobody came in.
The second post.
We're clear.
There is nobody here.
The third post.
We're clear.
"Really, Igor Alexandrovitch..."
Nobody came in.
Get out of here!
This is me!
Igor?
What...
Where are you going?
Stop!
Stop!
Igor!
It's fine.
We need to backdate the papers for title to the mega-centre in your name.
What for?
We need to backdate the papers in your name!
Calm down please.
It's all right.
They won't get anything.
"Okay, guys, we'll let him go and take her."
Out!
I'm also poor.
That's not true.
"She owns a ten story building, a farm and livestock."
That's enough!
- We'll take her.
- Yes...
"And you, douche bag, take off your pants."
"Yes, yes."
I'll take them off right away...
- I can't.
- Why not?
I crapped myself.
Drop your pants.
Now!
Faster!
Pig!
Wimp!
Put on the hood.
- No!
"- Put on the hood, bitch."
- No!
- Dammit...
Let go of me!
Help her down.
We are gentlemen.
We won't do anything to a woman.
"Come on, get out."
Count to one hundred and take off the hood.
Let's go!
Miss...
Don't do this.
What happened is not on you.
I was supposed to have his back.
How is that not on me?

Lucy.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Lucy.
Listen to me.
- You can't run away.
- You can't.
- We're right here.
- You can't run.
- Your life.
"- Please, please, let me out."
- Please let me out.
- Why don't you listen to me?
- We're everywhere.
- Don't follow.
Let me out!
- You did?
- I sold flowers pretending to be blind.
"Helene, you have to tell her."
Jorgen doesn't want us to.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Here comes breakfast.
It turns out I was hungry after all.
May I see?
You look so beautiful.
You're so lovely.
"Yes, you are."
And you're so soft.
And you smell so nice.
I forgot your juice.
That's all we needed.
That dumb juice.
I'm sorry...
There.
Jacob.
Right there.
- There.
- Thank you.
"Jorgen, here you go."
Thanks.
Does anyone have a pen?
Thanks.
"Anna signed yesterday, so now I'm a poor man."
Almost.
- Your daughter is here.
- Anna?
Then show her in.
- No.
"I'll wait here, okay?"
- Hi.
- Hi.
Would you like to come in?
"I mean, please come in."
Thanks.
I don't know what to say.
It's a little new to me.
For me too.
Didn't you know I existed?
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't say sorry.
You're the only one who can't be blamed.
- Would you like a Coke?
"- Yes, please."
I think we've got one here.
- There aren't any more.
Some water?
- That's fine.
- He's nice...
Christian.
"- Yes, Christian."
He's waiting in the car.
- Mom said you were dead.
"- Well, okay."
But apparently I'm not.
Would you like a glass?
It's a little tight.
It needs a...
How long are you staying?
Do you have time to meet?
Hey!
Where did he go?
Jong-gu!
I gotta catch him.
Gotta catch that bastard.
Catch that bastard.
I can't believe this...
- Gotta save my baby.
- Come on.
Let's go down.
I gotta save my little girl.
- We'll get him.
"- I've gotta find him, and save my baby."
"- Don't worry, we will."
- Okay?
"Get your act together, man."
We gotta save her.
"I know, man."
I know.
I have to save my daughter...
"Come on, man."
I have to catch that bastard.
"Don't cry, man."
"Dammit, Jong-gu!"
- Wife
"- Please, pick up."
Shit!
Was that a person?
Wife
The rat fell into the trap.
"You all right, baby?"
You okay?
I didn't say that to be mean.
I know.
"Um, I'm sorry."
What was it like?
[Sighing]
Um... it was bad.
"Not as bad as New York City, but it was bad."
"Hey, mama."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"All right, grandma, let's hand it over."
Please.
"My check was late, so I couldn't buy any food."
"I need my money, please."
"Lady, you are breaking my heart, here."
Gimme that.
[Screaming]
[Belching]
"This is for you, and, uh, this is for you, and this is for you, and this is also for you, and this is for me."
And this is for you.
[Sobbing]
[Giggling]
"Shut up, you old bitch!"
What the fuck is going on here?
Whoa.
Tryin' to be some kinda hero or somethin' here?
"Huh, huh?"
"No, man."
"Come on, man..."
Let's go.
Come on...
let's go!
[Groaning]
This has got to be Air...
Airdrie?
..drie?
What does that leave us?
That leaves this Igle down the bottom .
"Let's go for that now, and see what happens."
Bung that one in now.
And...
It might be the red herring.
What's going on down here?
Nigle?
50 seconds.
"No, that's not working, is it?"
I don't...
I'm wondering whether...
Aberdeen?
Aberdeen!
Aberdeen...
I think...
That would put... 30 seconds.
We'd have to have a lot wrong if it were going to be Aberdeen.
I think that's a red herring.
What's this Y for then?
Something-dray?
20 seconds.
Bay?
There's Ayr...
No.
Yeah!
"Yes, Ayr, yes."
You said that before.
"No, no!"
I was thinking Antigua.
Always wanted to go there.
"Nope, nope."
"Nope, nope, nope."
No.
I dated a girl from there once.
What?
So the whole country's off-limits?
The whole West Indies is off-limits.
"Well, who's this girl?"
It's a long story.
"If we ever make it out of the U.S. alive,"
I'll tell it to you.
All kinds of craziness.
Good crazy?
No.
Is that Mike?
"No, it's Schmidt."
"Hey, Schmidt."
What's up?
You have to help me!
They're coming!
Okay...
"Schmidt, hang on."
What -- what's the problem?
Is somebody at the motel?
"No, I'm not at the motel, okay?"
"I mean, I was at the motel."
Then I went back to my warehouse --
Wait a minute.
What -- y-you went to the warehouse?
Why?
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!
Did I ever bust his balls?
I could've dropped a dime a million times.
Don't call the cops.
You're talking crazy.
You got money for that commercial!
You don't got my fucking money?
"Jimmy, he's gonna pay you."
I'll fucking kill you!
"Give me the money, cocksucker."
Pay me!
"He'll pay, he'll pay."
Morrie's.
Who's this?
He's here.
"Jimmy, I'm sorry."
You should be sorry.
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!
You hear me?
Give me the fucking money!
I'll give you....
"You've got it, kid."
"You've got it, believe me."
"Karen, slow down."
Where?
Stay there.
Don't move.
"It's Karen, Jimmy."
What happened?
What happened?
I made a promise to my friend.
- We are not having sex.
"- Right, we're not having sex."
Why don't we go inside?
Want me to cook you some hot soup?
I have the ingredients in my room.
Hot soup?
"Yeah, maybe with bean sprouts."
I'm a great cook.
But your friend may be sleeping now.
Who cares?
I can really cook well!
Sure.
Want to try something?
I saw somebody doing it before.
- Do what?
- I wanted to do it really bad.
What is it?
I love you!
I love you!
You're really drunk.
"Oh, no."
- Try it.
Come on.
"- No, I can't."
I can't.
I love you!
Wait.
I love you!
I love you!
Satisfied?
- I love you!
- [Laughs]
- Went on and on and on.
"- Okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high security."
'Cause we mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
- Hi.
"- Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.
I didn't want to go home.
- Clark.
"- Yeah, I know, I know."
This is my home.
[Sighs]
It is!
Rough day?
Y-Yeah.
Were you...
Were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
Most people think she's a lot younger than that.
"Hello, I'm Olga."
"Olga, I'd like you to meet my good friend Bob Hartley"
How old do you think I am?
"Forty, 41."
I am 65.
- That's amazing.
- Yes.
"Now, what is it that you want to work on?"
"The legs, the thigh, the hips, the bust?"
A little below the bust.
"Well, just follow along."
We start very slowly in the beginners group.
All right.
Line up.
Arm's distance.
Good.
"We'll start with a little, stretching."
"Well, so much for the stretching."
"Now, we go."
And... run!
"One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two."
Bicycle.
Bicycle.
"Hartley, you're behind."
"One, two."
"One, two."
"One, two, one, two."
Kitty cat.
One more.
Fill it off.
And run.
That's him.
"Wong Fei-hung, I'm not afraid of you!"
You're not?
How about this?
It's time to build up your confidence!
"Relax, follow me."
- Lock him up!
- Yes!
"Marshal, which one?"
"- Numbskull, the one behind you!"
"- Yes, Marshal!"
Nothing to do with you.
Excuse me!
You dare to retaliate?
!
Don't be afraid.
Fight!
- You bast...
"- Sorry, sorry, sorry!"
"Marshal, are you OK?"
Nifty footwork.
You ambushed me with your No Shadow Kick!
Give me my weapon!
Let me go!
Lift your leg.
You told me to lift my leg.
Here's a punch-bag.
You want to practise?
"- No, not really."
- Come here.
Go on.
Harder.
Master Huang!
Where?
Where is he?
She was just calling you.
"Yes, I'm here!"
That's my wallet!
Here!
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
Can you go out with Master Huang?
"Sure, but don't too night."
I'll make you look like Master.
Liang Foon!
Master!
It's hot in this.
You've got to look smart for your date.
What if we fail?
Don't worry!
Keep your cool!
I'll give you a chance to save her.
How?
The masked killer that you most scared at will appear to-night.
Huang...you want to hit me?
No.
I was trying to get this mosquito.
Don't be afraid...
Let me teach him a lesson.
Ward me off!
Kick me!
How?
A kick below the belt!
You've kicked at the wrong place.
I knew that.
So we're going to Dallas.
Together.
But first  we sleep.

- It's so pretty.
- I got to go.
That's convenient.
- What?
- Where?
"Uh, town."
I'm meeting some friends.
How are you getting there?
"Well, I was hoping to get a ride from either Grandpa or Taylor, but obviously that's a no-go."
Or we miss our chance to cross.
Please.
You have to.
Please.
Please.
- I like those.
- Huh?
They make you look younger.
listen.
okay?
I got a long ride for some good money... we're gonna get outta here.
We're gonna drive down to Yelapa.
We're gonna get ourselves a boat.
And we're gonna go live on the ocean.
Will you be safe there?
Yeah.
We'll be safe.
Charles.
Be back in a few days.
Shit.
- Logan.
- Yeah?
What happened?
Did something go wrong?
The job was wrong to begin with.
Logan!
Logan!
What?
Who does this belong to?
Who's that?
Thought you were supposed to see shit coming.
I can track mutants.
Wilbur!
"Come on, let's have a fight like you see in the movies!"
En garde!
Wilbur!
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
Wilbur!
See?
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, no, spare me, sir."
Give me that.
"Oh, please, spare my life."
Be a good boy!
"Oh, thank you."
"Thank you, sir."
Thank you very much.
Kill you!
"And you, men, take the helm and take over!"
It's not loaded!
(WOMEN SCREAMING)
That's the signal!
"Board the boat, men!"
"Board the boat, men!"
"All right, rocket service!"
Let's drink a toast.
That was a successful voyage.
Throw it down!
No!
Throw it down!
(WHINING) Throw it down!
Oh!
Call the meeting to order.
Young man!
- Why did you do it?
- He was blackmailing Mumsie...
- Ethel!
"Good night, Constable."
- Good night.
"Once he's in the pond, we'll go to the barge and destroy the cabinet's contents."
- Can't we do it without killing him?
- Of course not.
He'd just hide himself away and write it all over again.
Of course we must kill him.
Whoops!
Steady.
We mustn't hurt him.
"Come along, Ethel."
Give us a hand.
Come along!
We'll tip him out from here.
"Come along, Ethel."
Right.
Up.
There!
Give him a pull.
Come on.
Botheration!
He's stuck.
You'll have to launch him!
"Come along, Ethel!"
Shh!
You'll wake him!
Shh!
"Hurry, girl."
Hurry!
We don't connect on a single thing.
It's over.
It's not...
G...
"Look, Carly, I gotta tell you something."
I just...
I don't see a future here.
"Oh, my God."
Are you dying?
"Oh, that is so hot."
Wait.
Is that R2-D2?
Do you like Star Wars?
I love Star Wars.
Me too.
"I mean, I've only seen the new ones."
Close enough.
- So?
- Yeah.
I knew it!
I could feel it.
It's almost like we were hooking up with her together.
"You felt that, right?"
- I couldn't have performed if I did.
"- Don't you see, Ted?"
We had a bronnection.
"All right, I gotta know what she looks like."
Show me a picture.
"Well, normally, I'm above such things, but it's been a while, and, uh, Teddy's braggin'."
"Uh, here she is."
Okay.
Scrolling up.
"Oh, uh..."
I don't know why it's hit me so hard.
We weren't close.
He was...
"A brute, a cheat."
"He was disrespectful, rude..."
But he was good at his job.
"I'm really sorry, honey."
What can I do?
Man:
"Miss, could I get a refill?"
Um...
Do you still have that schnapps?
Miss?
"Let me get this jerk his refill, and I'll clock out."
I think that jerk quite fancies you.
"Shut up, english."
You talk too much.

"I went for a swim, boss."
- I got into difficulties.
- Got into difficulties!
"- Yes, boss."
"I was in the blouse, too!"
"She was there, too."
I see.
That's all right.
"You aren't hurt, are you?"
"I'll tell you, if I'm hurt."
She'll tell us.
Let me take a look.
What are you doing?
Will she cook for me?
What misbehaviour is this!
Go away!
Just go away...!
Don't forget!
I own the place!
And you owe me the rent!
And you're driving me out!
Don't misunderstand me!
What do they consider guests to be in India?
They're called guests!
Yes.
That's right!
Yes!
Guests are like God!
Yes.
You're right!
"So, what is it?"
I've got to know your secret.
Really?
What secret?
You're not a dance assistant alone.
Joseph and I share the secret now.
Have you ever waited tables?
But it can't be that hard.

Thanks.
You can start tomorrow?
You want a drink?
Come on.
Beer?
Their daughter died.
– She was 15.
– That's horrible.
you're at the right place.
Do you know a place where I could stay?
Stay here until you find something better.
It will be fine.
Thanks.
I'll let you unpack.
You want a drink?
I don't think this is a good idea.
Here.
Cheers.
I'm gonna go.
Just relax.
What is it?
Camille is here.
What?
She says she loves you.
She misses you.
She misses Léna too.
What happened to her wasn't your fault.
Tell her I love her.
She's gone.
Then I'll hold it.
What do you see?
I sense something else.
A picture?
His?
He's not wearing much.
"He's not into the sex industry, I hope?"
No.
I see him on the beach waves and...
What's up?
What did you see?
"I drifted off, I think."
"His name was there, letters."
"H and E, HENK..."
HERBERT...
HERMAN
Herman!
"Gee, I didn't know you were so good at it."
Look... ls that him?
Well now...
You're going to tell me all about this Herman.
I've known Herman for years.
From when I first met Johan.
Johan?
Who's this Johan?
- My dead husband I told you about.
"- Oh, yes."
"Herman wanted me, but I married Johan."
That's life.
Sure.
But tell me about this Herman?
I'd rather not.
I am not crazy.
- Leave me.
"Let me go, you psycho."
I'm not..
I'm not psycho.
You don't believe me.
Come here.
Just let me go.
Look!
Look at them.
"That's you, age 6."
Right?
And this one...
Look at this..
"This is you, age 18."
I tried.
The nose is a little..
What are you saying?
I have never met you before.
- But the smile is the same.
- You're crazy.
"- Saira, am I right?"
- I have to go just...
- I'm going to call the cops.
I'm going to..
- Saira!
Saira!
Don't you want answers to your dreams?
It will take some time.
But you will understand everything.
"And until then, be my guest."
It's perfect.
It could end up being a hit.
We'll see.
Step by step.
"Yes, step by step."
So...
"Good night, Yitzhak."
Good night.
Get up.
Daddy.
What's wrong?
- Why didn't you get up?
What time is it?
Five after ten.
I gave you the alarm clock.
I forgot to set it.
"We're late, that's not good."
"No, it's not."
Get up.
Good morning.
"Please tell Alex we're running a bit late, we'll be right there, I just can't get a cab."
"It's Goni, Yitzhak Ben-Shmuel's daughter, I'm sorry."
Yes.
"Okay, then don't bother Alex about it."
"Okay, we'll be right there."
What are you doing?
I have to take my pills.
Come on!
Would you please hurry up?
I'm almost ready.
All I need is my shoes.
Alex.
Goni.
"Happy Birthday, Linda!"
"Oh, it is my birthday..."
"Don't worry, I'm gonna get you out of here."
Yay!
And then I'm gonna eat you.
No...!
Shush!
Where is she?
She should be out there by now!
Who's that?
I don't know... it's too early for Ethan to come back.
Aah!
I'm not decent!
Come back later!
Thank you!
I must use the kerplunker!
There's a line for the other one.
Make it fast.
"Don't tell me, make it fast."
Just go.
"Don't tell me, just go."
Just da... ah...
Make some noise.
Sing songs or something.
"Look, look..."
look at the legs on the glass.
You see the legs?
I see fe... it looks like feet.
"Oh, Linda."
"You're such a sweet, simple person."
Thanks.
"Wait, what?"
I'll care of it tomorrow.
Christine!
Anything I should know?
You come and go...
We cross paths.
I have a lot of work.
I have work too.
We managed before.
There's nothing.
If you want to talk...
I'm looking for Gilles.
Alain!
Gilles went to London.
Andrew knows Leslie's parents.
This is his place.
He's back for the trimester.
It wasn't planned.
His kids are coming.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
When did Gilles leave?
Last week.
I wrote him.
I know.
I don't have his address.
I'll forward the letter once I do.
- A number?
- We can't call him.
He calls.
You left Jean-René?
You can spend the night.
No thanks.
I'd rather not.
"Yes, please."
I'd be grateful for some fresh milk.
All right.
I'm disturbing you.
Don't worry.
- Are you well?
"- Yes, thank you."
What a fine house.
Make yourself at home.
is this Kakrahman's house?
No.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I was told to get milk from him.
It's next door.
Where is Kakrahman's house?
Next door.
"Sorry, I didn't understand."
It's next door.
Thank you very much.
is this Kakrahman's house?
Welcome.
Good luck.
I was sent here for milk.
Can you give me some?
Go down to the cellar...
Watch your head.
This way?
Go on down.
Mind your head.
All right.
Why is it so dark here?
"There's a hurricane lamp, it's not dark."
We'll get you out.

Wait a minute-- did you have sex?
"Marly, I think you're right."
"Look, her neck muscles have relaxed and she's not doing that crazy thing with her eyes."
Admit it.
Maybe I did... and maybe I didn't.
You did.
When did you get a boyfriend?

"Oh, yes."
Don't get angry!
Don't get angry!
"Batlya brother, you don't interfere."
"Look, you are like my younger son."

Now where did Hiralal hide the jewellery?
We don't know!
Tell me!
You know something.
Memory has become weak!
Which diamond?
What diamond?

"Papa, they both are the one!"
Tell me!
Where is the diamond?

I gave my life to you.
"It was hard, but I did it."
I put my trust in you because I knew
You would take care of us.

I just want my family.
Can I talk to him?
Son.
–Where are they?
–They're in the waiting room.
–I gotta see 'em.
–I won't let you.
Not like this.
–Corrine... –I don't want them to be scared.
–They won't be.
Vic.
Daddy!
–Hi.
–Daddy.
I missed you so much.
Kiss.
"Hey, Matty."
Give Daddy a kiss.
"Hey, Vic, I really need you in here now."
"–Dad, don't go again."
"–Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
I have to.
"Listen, someone was hurt really bad... and I have to stay here until he feels better."
"But as soon as I can, I'm gonna come and see you again, okay?"
I promise.
I love you.
–Where is he?
–Who?
Fleetwood.
You're packing his goddamn suitcase.
"Now, where is he?"
–I forget.
–Where's your boyfriend at?
–I don't even hear you.
–He just shot my partner.
- Maybe I just feel insulted.
- Insulted?
What I do is hard.
I am out there.
I am sweating out every clue.
I'm putting killers behind bars.
What does she do?
What does she do?
!
91.
Number 91!
91.
Number 91.
"91, number 9."
"I mean, how hard is that?"
A talking monkey could do her job.
- It's embarrassing.
"- Actually, that's 16."
You're holding it upside down.
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
- I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
- It's no big deal.
- I've seen it my whole life.
- I've never seen it under the six.
Why don't we ask Natalie then?
She's the expert.
"Okay, okay."
But I see your point.
About the monkey.
Excuse me.
"Oh, impressive wingspan!"
Very good!
"Oh, what?"
What?
These are plastic.
He can't fly!
"They are a terillium-carbonic alloy, and I can fly."
"-No, you can't."
"-Yes, I can."
-You can't.
-Can.
Can't.
Can't.
Can't!
"I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!"
"-Okay, then, Mr Light Beer, prove it."
"-All right, then, I will."
"Stand back, everyone!"
To infinity and beyond!
-Can!
-Whoa!
"Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!"
-I found my moving' buddy.
-Thank you.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.
"Man, the dolls must really go for you."
Can you teach me that?
-Golly bob howdy!

Please hold.
"Blackleg Miner, what's going on?"
Terminal was compromised.
What's your status?
Terminal secure.
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
Numbers secure?
Of course.
That's all that matters.
Yeah.
And the girl?
All assets retired.
She's dead?
Yes.
"All right, then."
Get out!
Get out of the car!
"Hey, don't shoot, don't shoot."
I got money.
I don't want your fucking money.
Help me get her in the car.
We gotta get into town.
We need to get to a hospital.
- What happened to her?
- She's shot?
- Shot?
Out here?
- Help me!
Help me get her in.
"Okay, come on."
"Come on, come on, come on."
I can't let...
I'm sorry.
"I can't stay here, Henry."
I'm sorry.
"Ah, shit."
Fuck yeah!
"Fuck yeah, Akan's boys are here."
"I'm gonna hold them off, yeah?"
"I'm gonna hold them off, yeah?"
"More guns for you in the drawer, yeah?"
Whoo!
"This is fucking war, baby, yeah!"
Whoo!
"Oh, fuck yeah!"
I fucking had that!
"Go, go, go!"
The floor is fucking lava!
I'm gonna burn it!
"Oh, Olga, Katya!"
"Oh, please, please!"
Please don't hurt me.
- I've got a family.
- Is that your wife?
"Um, uh..."
"Don't mind her, Henry."
She's mourning her late husband.
I wasn't betting on seeing you again.
Your persistence is unparalleled.
And quite exciting.
Slick Dimitry's services were excellent.
I'm just glad I never paid upfront.
I'll tell Estelle you did well.
- I'll be fine.
- You come with me.
You first.
I'm right behind you.
Miss Voss.!
Miss Voss.!
"Okay, stay down."
"Oh, you're a lucky girl."
You're a lucky girl.
Just get behind the door there.
Just get right behind the door there.
We will take care of him.
Don't worry.
"Boy, I hope he tries something now."
"Come on, Hammond."
Just give me one reason.
"Way to go, Jack."
Way to go.
"Come on, Hammond!"
You're in a no-win situation!
Put your hands out of the car where I can see them!
"- Stand up, Hammond.!"
Stand up.!
- Get up.!
"Turn around, turn around.!"
Turn around.!
Hands on your head.!
On your head.!
You know the drill.
- You got him?
You got him.
"- We got you now, my friend."
"It's true, he freed me."
You dug a hole in the wall.
And I also have a job.
Oh!
What a tall tale!
"""If you think the night is nice, the day will be worse. """
Balla is a liar.

Believe me!
Balla is a joker.
It's been a long time.
Haven't seen you around lately.
Is it ready?
Yes.
Let's celebrate the reunion.
Where?
Come sit with me.
They're waiting for me.
I'm in a rush.
"So, don't forget:"
"- Tuesday, at ""3 Caïmans""."
- All right!
We'll have a good time.
- How much is it?
- 1200 FM.
Where are you going tonight?
"To the ""3 Caïmans""."
We could go together.
"You need to rest, you've had a hard day."
Sure!
There's always an excuse.
"- All right, then, get dressed!"
What was the matter with you?
"I don't know, exactly... but..."
I need help.
Don't go any closer.
Why?
"What is it, Tony?"
"Tony, stop it!"
"Stop it, Tony, stop it!"
Exert a force greater than hers.
"Why are you doing this, Tony?"
Stop.
Crush her.
Kill her!
Crush her!
Crush her!
Crush her!
Finish her!
Now!
Tia.
Where are we?
What's happened?
Tony.
"Tony, we can still do it."
We can still make use of molecular control.
"OK, doc, let's do it."
Letha!
"Why don't we all go and have some... some candy and, uh, sodas and ice cream?"
Next time...
- ...next time I'll...
- Forget it.
I've lost my faith in science.
Sickle!
"This is a club, not a boxing ring."
The cunt walked right into us.
- Where's your booze?
- So you beat him up?
- You let too many losers in.
- He owns three restaurants.
I'm spending 30 grand here tonight.
I can beat up anyone I want.
Have we finished?
Come on.
"Hey, T!"
Send up a couple of bottles.
"Fuck, man."
- Fucking Paki.
- We taught him good.
- Hi.
"- What's up, Hanne?"
I was wondering...
can I have a line?
Help yourself.
- I'm in the mood now.
- For what?
A fuck.
- Who says I am?
- You were just now.
That was then.
But if you want you can give me a hand job.
- OK.
Where shall we go?
- Do it right here.
- Here?
- Hey?
She brought me some milk.
There.
Do you want me to give you some?
"No, thank you kindly."
She brought it for you.
I think Farhad dug Biston on his own.
Do you know him?
Yes.
"He's a local, he lives three miles away."
A local?
Well done.
But it wasn't Farhad who dug Biston.
I know.
Who then?
It was love.
The love of Shirin.
Bravo.
You know love too.
A man without love cannot live.
How are you?
I'm okay.
Where are you going?
"As usual, we're going to eat strawberries."
- Where's Jahan?
"- Sleeping, as usual."
You'll bring him back?
"You know, he doesn't eat strawberries."
Who called?
- Mrs Godarzi.
- What did she say?
Greetings.
She wanted news.
This is to make amends.
Around 7 grand.
I'll see you out.
"Thanks, Leo."
I won't forget.
"The guy you're looking for, Dragan."
I know where he is.
At a chick's place on Borrego St.
Don't ask how I know.

Freeze!
Stay there!
Get up!
Let me hug my kid.
Your wrists!

Watch the road.

You kept Dragan to yourself.
Was that wrong?
"Don't they say, it takes two to tango?"
We're not dancing anymore.
"Anyway, he was a bum lead."
How do you know?
I know.
That's all.
Silien here.
Not red.
"Ok, bye."
Hey.
Sounds like we got here just in time.
"How can we help, maid of honor?"
I am so late.
Talk to Seven.
I'll be right back.
Hello.
Hello.

"Oh, thanks."
I'm gonna follow her.
Make sure she makes it all the way to the elevator and out the front door.
Today's the big day!
"Ok, so the funny thing about pantyhose is, there isn't a... tag."
How do you tell which way...
is the front?
You really can't with these things.
Hi.
Is there a beautiful bride in here?
"Oh, look at you."
Nice suit.
"Oh, shut up."
You're the one who looks beautiful.
It's your day.
Gosh.
"Becca, what the hell are you doing?"
It's 7-4-6-3.
Can you remember?
Everything's all right. lt's all right. lt's okay.
"-Go, go..."
-Okay.
Can you keep your pressure on it?
Okay.
(breathing heavily)
-Did we do it?
-l think so.
-Will I die?
"-No, you can live a long time like this."
I need a doctor.
(GRUNTlNG)
Can you take the bullet out?
It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Oh!
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.
Not the bullet.
You.
You wouldn't...
What?
"You wouldn't do that to me, would you?"
No.

PHILIP:
"All right, the good stuff."
"Philip, I've, er..."
I got something special for you.
I don't talk to her mother anymore.
Did I tell you that?
I guess I just sort of assumed it.
She asked me about it the other day.
I didn't know what to say to her.
"Oh, God."
She can be such a pain in the ass.
"Anyway, here's to us."
Cheers.
Philip.
"Seems like it's just you and me left now, Norm, huh?"
"Oh, hey."
I forgot to tell you.
I saw this the other day.
Hmm?
"The guy you were supposed to do the journalism piece on, that snake?"
It seems he took his own life.
- Jesus.
- Who is it?
Who's that?
IKE:
What's he called?
PHILIP:
"Josh Fawn, the writer."
"I mean, I'm glad he's dead and all, but..."
Me making dinner while you vacuum the rug?
Exactly.
And here's the other thing.
"If I let you take a night off, I have to let everybody take a night off."
Who's everybody?
What are you talking about?
It's just me.
"Mr. Monk, come on."
It's one night.
"Well, then"
I'll guess i'll just have to say no...
Kay.
No kay.
No kay.
Which is it?
"""No"" or ""okay?"""
Nokay.
Noookay.
He's trying to say okay.
That's as close as he's ever gonna get.
No kay.
- Nokay.
- I'll do it.
Nokay.
- She looks nervous.
"- I don't care, as long as she's lucky."
- Is it too much?
- You look great.
"Excuse me, new girl."
"New girl, you're off your mark."
- My mark?
"- Yeah, the big ""X"" on the floor."
"Stay with him, Stoke, stay with him!"
"Oh, it's a high fly ball, folks, right along third-base line."
Palmer is after it.
He's after it.
He's got it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Let me see that cut!
Stoker's through!
He's through!
How many more beatings do you have to take?
Better lay down.
Better than having your brains knocked out.
- Better than having you dead.
- You gotta lay down.
Lay down.
Lay down!
Six!
Seven!
Ten!
Fight!
Let them fight!
What a switch!
Stoker gave him one under Nelson's chin!
- Knocked him right over the ropes!
"- You got him, Stoker!"
"Hold on, Nelson!"
"Stop him, Nelson!"
"You got him, Stoker!"
You got him!
Stoker!
Stoker!
- I would do bad things.
- I do not believe.
You're only a child.
Have to believe me.
My brother worked for a very long time.
You know.
Always been interested in him ...
I like that.
I love you.
- I do not believe.
- But it's true.
- Where is my brother?
- Good question.
"This, we also want to know."
We believe that some kind of trouble.
"Us, we found him want to help?"
- Okay.
- Fine.
- Cookie?
Here you go.
- Milk.
I need to find a statue.
In this sculpture.
A very special statue.
Angel?
Have you seen anything like this before?
- Yes.
- Well done to you.
"- Where, honey?"
Where did you see?
One church.
-Dad.
"Your Sharon, like?"
Yeah.
"Gas, isn't it?"
But she's not married.
I know that.
Who did the damage?
We don't know.
She won't tell us.
"You'd want to find out, wouldn't you?"
"Excuse me, compadre."
What's it to you who it was?
I couldn't give a shite who it was.
"I'm not gonna buy the food, the nappies... or the little bleedin' track suits."
Dessie is!
I am in me hole!
Hang on a sec.
"Maybe I will, what?"
"Ah, so what?"
I don't care.
It's only a baby.
"Snapper, what?"
Compadre...
I can let you have some very good baby clothes.
Mucho goodo stuff.
Benetton.
- Ha ha!
Benetton.
- Very competitive price.
"Sorry, lads."
Will you take a few of these raffle tickets off me?
What for?
This.
- Mm-hmm.
"- Well, see you after lunch."
"- Right, Bob."
Later.
"- You're going down, right?"
"- Oh, yeah."
Down.
No place to eat up there.
"Why don't I, just press the button again?"
"- Oh, thanks, Bob."
See you soon.
- Right.
Later.
See you then.
"Uh, this elevator's broken."
You'll have to use that one.
"Well, that's about it for me, Bob."
"I'll be, moving along now."
- Right.
- Right.
"Hey, Bob?"
What are you doing for lunch?
"I'm doing it, Jerry."
Where are you going?
I'd better not tell.
I don't think you want to know.
Go ahead Jerry.
It won't bother me.
"Well, I'm going to a new smorgasbord place:"
Mr. Bulk.
They got all-you-can-eat for an hour.
- That's it.
Huh?
"Well, seems we still mean more to him than- than that old memory."
Yeah.
"Hey, hey, wait a minute."
You better come inside before you change your mind.
"Come on, tough guy."
Come on.
"All right, kid, shake it up."
Shake it up.
"Oh, that's grand music."
Yes.
That's grand music.
"Aw, that's grand music."
Yeah.
That's grand music.
That's lovely.
Come on.
Shake it up.
All right.
You tired?
Hmm?
"All right, come on now."
Let's pull.
Together.
"One, two..."
- three-
- Oh!
"Well, we weren't together."
"- Oh, I wish you hadn't."
- Why not?
I haven't let myself think about us.
- I didn't dare.
- Can you feel me squeezing your hand?
- A little.
Good.
All right.
Now all you gotta do is just think warm thoughts.
You gotta think Hawaii and you gotta think the Sahara Desert.
You gotta think about....
Come here!
Come on!
You listen to me.
You gotta stay awake!
"You gotta stay awake for me, all right?"
Okay.
All right?
- I'm so tired.
- I know that.
Why don't we just sing a song.
"- You know songs, don't you?"
- No.
"All right, yeah."
Yeah.
"How about ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game""?"
"All right, listen."
Come here.
I've gotta get some help.
- No!
Don't go.
Don't!
- It's okay.
"Please, don't."
"You gotta sing as loud as you can, so I can hear you."
All right?
"I know, I know, I got it."
No phones inside.
"Hey, if it were up to me, I couldn't care less."
Gone.
Done.
Okay?
Should be out by now.
Yeah.
Probably just got a last-minute broadcast.
What?
Nothing.
One sec.
No...
I can't hear.
Okay.
Eardrums.
"- Stay quiet, okay?"
- Okay.
Stay quiet.
Stay here.
"Be quiet, okay?"
Katherine.
- We're clear.
- Are you sure?
We'd know by now if somebody else were in here.
Whose hand is that?
I don't know.
- Can you hear?
- Yeah.
"If they know the code from before, they're gonna come back in."
They're gonna use it again.
"No, the codes change with every shift."
I'm not the one who has the explaining to do.
Dale's son--explain that.
Explain cancer.
Explain war.
Explain the whole damn thing to me just one time... so I can understand why everything has to be so hard.
"( sobs ) Oh, God."
I'm sorry I hurt him.
"Oh, God, I'm so sorry."
Allie...
LISA:
Allie...
"What are you doing, Allie?"
Charlie...
Look at me.
Look at me.
"Look at me, Dad."
He's all right?
What do you think we ought to do now?
.
( cell phone rings )
"Yes, Ray?"
"Heiio, Ray?"
No.
This is Allie.
We're all going to come out of the building now.
Please tell everybody not to shoot.
I'll go with you.
All right.
They're coming down.
She says she'll come with us if we let the others go.
Everybody set?
- Mary...you can't do this.
She'll pick you up later.
Don't go!
Maria!
Where are you?
"Hold on, Quico."
Come back already!
Now you can blow out the candles.
Should I make a wish first?
"Sure, my darling."
Help!
Get me away from here!
Well done.
Let's eat the cake now.
Doesn't your doll get a piece?
She doesn't know how to eat.
You never talk to me.
- Talk about what?
- Anything.
"I put together this huge party for you, yet you don't say a word to me."
Tell me what's on your mind.
- When?
- Now.
Where is my mom?
Where is my dad?
What?
Where are my mom and dad?
- Time for your presents!
"- Tell me, grandma."
"What, darling?"
Where are my mom and dad?
I told you already.
They left you with me.
Do you want to see?
- Yes.
- Come along.
- Look at the fun.
- All right.
"- Hey, Go Through!"
- Go Through?
"The voice enters his ear from here, and goes out the other way."
He's deaf.
He can't hear.
Sir!
You want to eat mangoes?
Aam (Mangoes)?
Shall I die?
Go to sleep?
Shall I late (lie down)?
I see...
late...
You mean...
Aam late...
Aam late...
Aha!
You want to eat an Omlette!
Then say so!
I will get it!
"Come, be seated."
- This waiter...
- Forget it. lt's a daily routine.
"- Tell me, where's Baba?"
- He must be on his way.
I swear...if I don't see the two of you together I feel as if life is incomplete.
Pay heed to what I say.
Go.
Please.
Go.
"Hey, Allen."
I'm good.
"I know it's late, but I need to transfer some money."
"Sure, I can hold on a sec."
Seth!
I'm up here!
You get the bus ticket?
You're not going anywhere.
"What are you doing here, man?"
What are you doing with my girlfriend?
Nothing.
Didn't look like nothing.
Tell me.
Or I'll kill you.
Then kill me and quit talking about it.
"Dude, this place is on fire!"
We gotta go!
"Let's go, man!"
Run!
I thought basketball season was over.
"No, this is ESPN Classic."
They play all old games.
It's the Lakers-Pistons.
Right?
1986.
The finals.
Game Seven.
You remember watching this.
You were pregnant... you were pregnant with Marissa when this was on.
You should have let me break your arm.
Help!
Let go of me!
Help!
- So you're not seeing anyone?
- Nobody regular.
- Why?
- Would you like to?
Maybe.
How about going down to the car?
On your front.
Not anal.
You whore.
You're hurting me.
You bastard.
My pleasure.
I want to report a rape.
- 26000.
- I expected it'd be more.
Thursdays are never that full.
- Have you seen Sofie?
- She OD'ed on X.
The ambulance came.
- Which hospital?
- Bispebjerg.
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
Hello?
"Hi, mummy."
I'm in a bit of a rush.
"No, my birthday was yesterday."
"Yes, I'm sure."
How's Tetty?
Be careful.
"Let's find those parts, okay?"
Okay!
We're going.
It's okay.
I'll do it.
You mean your Mom will...
Thanks for having us.
Um...
It's kinda dark.
I'll walk you home.
Really?
Don't bother.
She lives near me.
"Misaki, let's go!"
"Okay, I'll come back soon."
"Bye, Tetty."
See ya.
An unexpected rival appears...
His chances are good.
Yusuki is on the defensive...
Get lost!
"Ooh, I'm scared."
Why get in the way?
"They're so soppy, it makes me puke."
Really?
Really what?
What're you saying?
Don't you like her as well?
"Childhood friends, blossoming into more..."
No way!
He even gave her a fur.
A fur collar?
I gave her that!
The little minx!
Then where is she?
We have to look for her.
"Ah, she'll come back."
"No, you have to look for her."
Me?
I'm not running after no woman.
She'll be back.
- I need a hundred.
- How much?
A hundred.
Watch your step!
You watch yours!
Miss Cilly!
Where's Reinhold?
Pretty as a painted rocking horse!
I'll see you boys later.
"What is it, doll?"
Where's Mieze?
Who?
You know where she is.
I spoke with Franz's landlady.
You were upstairs with Mieze... alone.
Look at me!
I brought Franz to work for you.
Do I have something else on my conscience now?
Tell me!
Do I?
Dumb broad!
We can't live with that.
We should have done what Connor was saying all along.
Play dead.
Go on offence.
Go on offence.
"Blair, I know what you're thinking, but I am putting you first."
"If we don't stop them, we'll never be safe."
"No, I know."
We have to do the right thing.
Hey guys.
Look.
"I know you don't have any reason to trust me right now, but, I think I have a plan."
We should pull a heist on them.
Shit.
What happened?
Tripped.
"Oh, go go go."
Blair.
Okay.
Shit.
First door.
Connor.
Open the door.
I don't know.
Don't just stand there.
C'mon.
Open the door.
Wrong door.
"Wrong door, Connor."
C'mon.
I'm trying.
Hurry.
Just hold it right there.
"Yeah, he's young."
"He's not tall, but he's young."
Philip.
"Philip, get over here."
"No, now, as quick as you can."
Get here now.
"So there was these two old men sitting in deck chairs on the beach, and one of them turns to the other and he says, ""It's nice out today,"""
"and the other one says, ""Sure, I'll get mine out in a minute."""
(LAUGHTER)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
"Hey, let's hope it's a boy!"
Huh?
Philip!
"Come on, stand up."
"Oh, you are standing. (LAUGHS)"
"Come in, come in."
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Oh!
In you come.
(WHISPERS) We will be social with these women tonight.
"Son, you're young."
Come on.
Huh?
What are you?
- Old.
- Yeah?
Wise.
"And also rich, which helps."
"Yeah, one day you'll be old, wise and rich."
"- Okay, you're welcome."
Where's your car?
Okay.
I'm gonna wear the hat.
"Oh, you are?"
"This way, ladies."
Okay.
Do I look like a lady?
It's tough to tell in this light.
[ Laughs ]
"Bobby Pin and Rutledge's lost brother had a ram, which was ironic, yet somehow fitting."
"Which door are you getting in, Bob?"
Oh.
I'm in over here.
Are you gonna roll my fat ass in here?
No.
Not if I can help it.
What does that mean?
Are you calling me fat?
I didn't call you fat.
I just agreed with you.
Which word?
We're doing fine.
Leg up.
Okay.
"Wait, where'd my other purse go?"
- Can I have my glasses?
- Sure.
- And my jacket?
- And your jacket.
Okay.
Okay.
"Dads, dads, dads!"
You call me that if you want to call anybody dads!
"You're my kid, see?"
Joey!
"Joe Krozac, jr.!"
"You'll get that into your head right now, or-"
"Please, don't!"
"Don't, Joe!"
You're getting all sick again!
Please!
Guess this will have to wait.
Now you've hurt your sore eye.
Here-
I've got some adhesive in my emergency pocket.
I'll just clean it up a little.
"Here's your medal, Kid."
"I can't now, I'm too busy."
I'll keep it for you.
"Well, we got a croaker."
Always come in handy in our family
"- Eh, kid?"
Huh?
"Oh, yes."
Come on.
"Wake up, kid."
"Come on, Come on, kid."
We got to walk in in style.
Oh-oh!
Honey child!
He's back!
"Oh, my darling's back!"
My boy!
I'm Matt's Elena backup.
I'm your Bonnie backup.
Now it's about me and Bonnie?
You don't get it.
Why would you?
You're everyone's first choice.
Piece of cake.
You know what?
Why don't you guys go ahead and take it for a spin?
- Really?
- Yeah.
Caroline.
You all right?
"- Lf it's not vampires, it's girlfriends."
- Mm.
"All right, roast beef, turkey."
What do you want?
"Oh, let's do the works."
Pile it high.
"All right, I like your style."
Will you grab the bread for me?
Okay.
- What are you doing?
- Just a cut.
Will you hand me that towel?
I can't.
"You got a problem with blood, Anna?"
Mm-mm.
What's the matter?
"It's just blood, Anna."
- What are you doing?
- I knew it.
You were there?
Yep.
"You know, before I touched down here, I moved around a lot."
"New Orleans, New York, Chicago."
Been here the longest.
Ah!
Hold on.
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.
Ahh.
Yo?
I'm stripes.
That's right.
What?
You're kidding me.
"No, no, I can't switch shifts with you."
I've been drinking.
"Oh, you could tell?"
All right.
"All right, thank you very much."
All right.
"I've never seen anything like that, Tyler."
That's all I'm saying.
"Well, you're right."
It was insane.
"All right, Cory."
"Tony, please?"
Just keep 'em coming.
"You know, I could be wrong,"
But I think they call that self-medicating.
I'm a trained professional.
"- I'll have what he's having, Tony."
Whoa!
Yes.
Oh!
Ah-ha-ha!
Bleah!
Oh!
Wow.
What is this place?
Wheel Well.
Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.
This place?
"Yeah, imagine."
"Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here."
"You know, I don't get you."
How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?
"Well, it's really pretty simple."
"I was an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and..."
"Oh, you were, were you?"
Were you rich?
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.
"Yeah, OK."
"Well, that was my life."
And you know what?
It never felt... happy.
Yeah.
I mean... really?
Yeah.
So I left California.
Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here.
"Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in."
"Well, they all did."
My sister?
Danielle.
"You mentioned her earlier, no?"
- No.
- Oh.
"It must have been Simon, then."
He talks about you a lot.
Thanks for the dance.
Anytime.

I'm warning you.
Let this go.
I have it under control.
There you are.
Sorry.
I-I think I had too many mojitos.
I just... needed to lie down.
"Well, I hope tonight wasn't a complete waste."
Did you at least manage to have some fun?
"- I mean, Blanca's great."
- Mm.
"And Hector's, uh..."
He's an acquired taste.
What did you and Blanca talk about?
Honestly... you.
She said she'd never seen you so happy.
She's right.
I've never met a woman like you... ever.
And I don't think I ever will again.
I'm sorry.
Is that too forward?
8!
"1, 2, 3!"
"3, 4!"
You!
"Chao Fun, if you want to taste delicious food, give me the Sword Book."
Lock him up with crazy girls?
"Then he'll become crazy, too!"
"I never knew what a fierce, filthy fellow His Highness is."
What's the situation inside?
He's exhausted now.
Then!
I have a request!
Jumping Dragon!
Facing the moon!
Falling sun!
Falling sun!
I won't tell you... no!

Do you hear?
You crazy women!
Remember my strikes!
Use this to save him!
Can't you hear?
Let me go!
Yeah.
Lock down all these doors.
- Do it quickly.
"- Go, go, go!"
- Sir.
- The residence.
Bear with us.
"Sir, we have a tour group on the State Floor."
Hold them in the Blue Room.
Maintain positions.
Keep the hallways clear.
- Everybody stay where you are.
- My daughter's downstairs.
No one goes anywhere till we lift the crash.
- She's just a little girl.
I gotta get her.
- Step away from the door.
"Keep moving, please."
Everybody.
"Gentlemen, we're on lockdown."
You can't be in here.
- Let's go.
- Sorry?
- We're on lockdown!
- Can't hear you!
You gotta be kidding me.
Movie time is over.
Shut this down!
Let's go.
"Bobby, sync watches, 60 seconds."
Silencer.
Let's go.
"- Say, if my wife answers, don't tell her."
- I won't.
- I'm getting this as a surprise for the family.
- I'm wise.
- Wait till you meet.
I got the cutest wife and kid you ever saw.
So long.
"Congratulations, Joe."
"Good luck, kid."
Good luck.
Congratulations.
I'm glad to see you get it.
Best to you.
"- Hey, Frank."
"Come here and meet out new foreman, Joe Dombrowski."
"- Nice going, Joe."
- Thank you.
He won't feel like going.
Best thing is to leave him alone.
He'll get over it.
"Oh, come on."
At least we can try and help him.
- Come on.
- All right.
"- Hey, anybody home?"
"Hello, Ed."
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Come on.
How about a movie?
"- No, thanks."
- Why don't you and Buddy go?
I seem to have left my keys in the lab.
You're gonna get it.
Who 's there?
Come on!
Stupid antenna.
Invaders from Mars!
Honey?
help!
help!
Stop!
help!
Don't you know better than to wander off at night alone?
What if something happened?
"I'm sorry, Mom."
Don't you ever do that to me again.
I was so scared.
I thought I'd lost you.
You won't believe this.
Something ate our TV antenna.
No!
I'm serious!
"It's not Sputnik, Iike Mr. Stutz thought."
"No, it's a robot!"
"No, really, it is!"
"And the robot, it's 1 00 feet high!"
And it eats metal!
Stop it!
Just...
... stop.
I'm not--
I'm not in the mood.
Come on.
You can't back out now.
Get the money for the ritual.
Where is she?
At home.
Where else would she be?
I asked the old lady next door to watch her.
You left her alone with a stranger?
Are you out of your minds?
Don't move.
Hyo-jin.
Baby.
- What's the matter?
- Oh my God!
Hyo-jin!
Hyo-jin!
Hyo-jin!

Don't cry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It'll be okay.
Quick!

This is all the work of that Jap.
"Ever since we went to his house, my body's been in pain."
I'm burning up.
I'm seeing things.
A man's face comes out of the wall.
I don't think he's alive.
"We've gotta do something, or that bastard will get us first."
Shut the damn door!
What's in that jar?
I do!
I do!
All gone!
That's all... the next one!
Gé!
That's for Gerrit of course!
A real clodhopper's name.
Damn it!
"Christine, my girl..."
She's had...
She's been married twice!
She's been fucking married twice!
Why didn't you tell me?
What a god awful movie... I don't like nature films...
Gé... I've had Gé... I'll try Henk.
Hello Henky!
I'm the first talking goldfish.
Another one!
Another wedding?
She didn't tell me!
Why didn't you tell me?
Three times why didn't you tell me?
Married three times...
What a mess!
I'd prefer porn!
I'm in there too...
"Tiddle-dee, tiddle-door, who is number four?"
"Christine, darling..."
What's this?
What are you doing here?
"Sorry, I thought you were Christine."
The back's the same.
- Malakai ?
Are you all right ?
"- Yeah, yeah, man."
Anybody catch one ?
"It ain't over, bitch."
"I don't even know why it started, bitch."
'Cause you always in my way.
I'm only in your way when it comes to Derek.
That's what this is about.
"No, it's about you."
White girls like you.
"Creepin' up, takin' our men."
"The whole world ain't enough, you got to conquer ours too."
"Whatever, Nikki."
"Derek and I like each other, and if you have a problem with that, screw you."
[Train Clacking]

"- Yeah, I'm coming."
"- Oh, hi."

Let me see.
I'm really okay.
I'm fline.
"Well, what did she do ?"
"Um, now is really not a good time to talk."
- Okay.
Well-- - l'll call you.
"Oh, no."
"Here, let me see."
"Oh, OK."
"See you later, Tone."
"Bye, Tony."
Bye.
Fuck!
Take this.
It's stuff.
Maps and shit.
OK.
"You look really good, Tony."
Like you're ready for anything.
Thanks.
See you later.
I'm gonna tell you a story.
"A bloke, he wakes up one morning."
He gets dressed.
He goes down the stairs.
He makes himself a little bit of breakfast.
"He walks to the garage, he gets in his car."
He starts his car.
"Drives off, I don't know, a couple of miles."
Stops.
Gets out his car.
Has a couple of blokes pour petrol over his head and...
Sets fire to himself.
He...
What?
He sets fire to himself.
Fucking boom!
What's in the bag?
My sandwiches.
So what we got?
This is your pass.
Where are we going?
Let's go!
Wait!
Come!
Good morning.
"Minmin, you're late."
Who's this?
This is Rin.
Rin Sakurazawa.
I'm here to observe your practice.
Grade?
An SIU student?
Ever played lacrosse?
I will play lacrosse.
So you'll learn Shaolin Kung Fu.
"""ShaoIin Kung Fu""?"
What is it?
It's a martial art.
This is weird.
"What's ""a martial art""?"
Like kendo?
Or karate?
"I've heard about ShaoIin, but..."
I think it's geeky.
It's not!
What do you wear?
I hate ugly uniforms.
Is it practiced outside?
Even the UV creams don't help anymore.
I bought a good moisturizer.
Show us!
"Lovely, no way."
"Hey, no one's here."
Hello?
Hello?
This sushi place is really big.
I'm starving.
"Excuse me, is anyone here?"
What the hell?
Are you open?
- Here to eat?
- Yes.
So you're open?
"Yes, we are."
Have a seat.
"Oh, man."
Let's sit.
But where?
Sit here?
Anywhere.
Sit anywhere.
Forget it.
We're leaving.
What's wrong?
"Fuck, learn how to run a business right."
Let's go!
What did you just say?
You should be fucking nice to your customers.
When was I ever not nice?
And why are you swearing at me?
You don't have the right!
You little prick!
Fuck off!
Reason why should be showing her
Off in public anytime soon.
"OK, bye bye."
Sir.
Sir!
Yes?
You have to pay.
"No, no."
It's OK.
I'm a fireman.
With 62 truck.
We already don't get paid enough
As it is.
And God forbid this store catch
"On fire, I would be the one to"
Run in here and save all of you.
"So, I mean, I think"
The least that you can do is
"Offer me some free food, you"
"Know, as reward."
"OK, and buddy, that comb over,"
It's not fooling anyone.
"Good luck, God bless."
"Good night, new York."
"Hey, what's up, man?"
This your car?
"Yeah, it's cool, right?"
Sorry?
The car.
"It's cool, right?"
You know what color that is?
Copper.
.
I just got tired earlier.
Would you like me to take you home?
.
"That is if it's okay with you, Bela."
Don't worry about me.
"Come on, I'll take you home."
"Bela is beautiful, isn't she?"
Yes.
"Yes, and she's kind."
She's really kind.
Don't tell me you're jealous.
Not really but I just didn't know she was your ex.
Come on Joy!
"Joy, Joy..."
Listen to me.
Listen...
"Don't ever think about her, okay?"
She's gone.
"She's past, as in already erased."
It's gone.
And you...
You are my present and my future.
It's only you.
Is that okay?
-What?
Want to go inside?
"-No, I still have duty tomorrow."
-Are you sure?
.
-I might lack sleep.
Go ahead.
- Fuck from there!
"I inference here, or he dies!"
Did you hear me?
!
Bring me a car!
S.ktirip go from here!
"Jesus Christ, John!"
- John ...
- What are you waiting for?
You can not do!
"God damn it, John!"
No!
Let me go!
Let me go!
- John!
- Get off of me this wicked guy!
Damn!
Jesus Christ.
- Took my gun!
- Do you eat out of my mind?
!
- Are too!
Officially the head eaten.
"- That's it, John!"
- I heard he had in his hand the quality of goods.
- Are you Searching for?
- If you is good.
- Let us go to my office.
"Here you go, chief."
- Before you why do not you?
- I do not use.
- Do you hear that?
"Baby, I'm thirsty."
Give me your drink.
Please.
One sip.
It's poison.
It was a joke.
"Okay, he.."
He caught me on that.
"- But everyone copies my style, baby."
- Please.
- Everybody.
- You can flaunt your style...
But I'll be the one taking her home.
Wow!
You're learning pretty quick...
- I like him.
- Yeah?
He's learning pretty quickly.
Very very quickly.
Zak a.k.a. Zakir Merchant.
Multimillionaire.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
I have found out everything.
Are you thinking about him?
Are you drunk?
It's a ladies' loo.
You'll get beaten up.
"No, I am not going anywhere."
I am missing you a lot.
"Anyway, I won't be able to meet you for a week."
Why a week?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hello.
"Oh, it's you."
I...
"I'm awful sorry, Skeets, that I didn't talk to you in the lab, but, you see, Aunt Nancy was watching."
"Oh, that's okay, Wilbur."
"Are you going to dance with me tomorrow night, Wilbur?"
"Sure, I'd like that."
You like to dance?
"Oh, gee, I..."
I'd rather dance than eat.
Would you like to see a real good step?
"Oh, I'd love to, Wilbur."
All right.
"Real gone, man."
"Oh, that was nothing."
I could dance a lot better if I had music.
"Hey, wait a minute."
I got a portable radio in my room!
Yeah?
Only it's against the rules for me to leave the switchboard.
(SCATTING)
I'll be right back.
Crazy.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Siri?
"The number you called, not ..."
You see?
Whether they find?
-We Need to confess.
"-No Need, no!"
My father would kill me.
-what Are you doing?
-help Me.
Play more.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-was Zana.
She was alone in the E6 after the killing.
-Five Miles away?
There is logic?
-Geir Tangen is on the line.
This is not the best time.
-And About Zana ...
-I do not think she was in shoals.
It was a professional as the gunman.
She would not escape.
Or be released.
What if she has been freed before?
-So How she made it to the E6?
She wanted to find her father.
Were you looking for me?
Not here!
You brought your stuff?
The car is there.
Why do you not answer me?
-The Battery is dead.
Kaan?
Take Sinan and get out.
Candan is coming out.
I can't believe this.
What was it?
I can't believe it...
I have lost my voice too.
"Try a little harder, Candan."
Hello?
Candan just left.
Okay.
Continue with the operation.
God damn it.
Is it okay?
Did you get it?
"Yeah, you wish."
We are screwed.
It's a different bag.
"What do you mean ""a different bag""?"
I'm saying that it's a different bag.
The old one had 2 digits and this has 3.
Why is she changing her bag?
Okay.
Wait a second.
What is it?
They've finished.
They're leaving.
How are things with you?
It's not good at all.
Try and delay her.
I'm hanging up ...
How am I going to delay her?
Pastures new?
No?
"Anyway, I'm leaving this behind."
Do you want to take it?
What is it?
It's a gramophone.
"Go on, take it."
Who have I to give it to?
No-one.
You.
It's for you.
It's new.
"There's a record in it, Happiness Street."
I'm singing on it.
"All right, Sal?"
What's this?
I'm sailing to Canada.
I've brought him this.
Right.
"I'll send you my address, shall I?"
"Well, I will."
"Jimmy, go and get washed."
"And remember, always hold a record by its edges."
Yes?
"Is this all right, Mam?"
Yeah.
Go on.
"Well, I'll probably not see you."
No.
You know how I'm fixed.
Yeah.
Is she going with you?
You can't face the world?
Why not?
You think I'm a traitor like you!
Traitor?
Help me break his chain.
What chains?
"These chains, of course."
"Gosh, it's broken already!"
Why didn't you tell me before?
What a waste of time!
I should have left you sleep away!
Where's Hiroshima?
B must have chased him into a secret passage!
How do we get in?
I always manage.
Let me try!
Open sesame...!
I get it...!
You can't get me!
"Hiroshima, don't run!"
Bi Boo...!
Bridget!
Bi Boo!
Bi Boo!
What does she mean by that?
A mechanical chair!
Open sesame...!
That's out of fashion.
Watch this.
Bi Boo is the latest password!
Watch me!
Bi Boo!
All right!
I want to finish soon.
"And those crustaceans, known those little ones who do ..."
Yes.
"We do not know swimming, others have fluff."
What?
Fur-sinks.
More is too high.
I have acrophobia.
"Dude, the water is right there, right there!"
I do not care!
It's too cold for me!
"Atticus, for."
He is eating his wing.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Count to three.
Push me in two.
But do not let me know.
"One, two ..."
Why pushed me.
Cute penguins.
But cruel.
Will!
Will!
-What are we looking for?
-This is where're my friend.
I do not know.
"Will, please come back."
I fear the worst.
Also I fear the worst.
Why fear the best is a waste of time.
Which dude?
- That dude?
- Yeah.
No way.
He'd kick my ass.
True that.
"This is so hard, you know?"
Yeah.
I know.
It's simple.
"If you ask a cop if he's a cop, he's, like, obligated to tell you."
It's in the Constitution.
Constitution of America?
So go ahead and ask.
- Are you a cop?
- Not like that.
"Ask it, like, official."
Are you a police officer?
No.
I am not a police officer.
"Okay, then."
175 for a teenth.
"The price is the price, yo."
All right.
There you go.
Enjoy.
"Thanks, man."
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest!
Get on the ground!
Get on your stomach now!
"On your stomach, get on the ground!"
Angle out.
There you go.
"Show me you can throw one, two, three."
You need to get that elbow over your shoulder.
Not this.
This.
"One, two, three."
- All right?
- Can I do that again?
"""Let's do it again,"" she says."
You want to do it again.
"One, two, three."
Good.
Look where you're standing.
All right?
- In and out.
- Okay.
Right?
Get used to missing.
"I want you to throw one, two, and then just keep it away from me, all right?"
"One, two."
Good.
That's it.
See?
"You're moving, you're moving, you're moving."
Keep me away from you.
Move that head.
Good.
And keep moving.
Right-hand hook.
Nice!
Again.
Nicely done.
That's a good look.
"Don't laugh at me, Drew."
Come on.
What happened to your eye anyway?
My eye's fine.
Just let me...
"Let me have your shirt, please."
What?
Just let me have your shirt.
I'm not gonna give you my shirt.
I can't go in to Gates like this.
You shouldn't have spilled coffee on it then.
"Okay, well, I did."
"And now I need your shirt, please."
Just...
All right.
All right.
Spill anything on your pants?
"You want me to give you those, too?"
Come on.
Stop being like that.
"Hey, everybody, I made it."
Just kidding.
"Big day, huh?"
Everybody pretty excited about it?
"Hey, Allan made it."
Whoa.
"What happened with your eye, bud?"
"Nothing, man."
I'm okay.
Yeah?
This is the birthplace of weird.
But why today?
This guy was a lottery nut.
Isn't tomorrow night the big jackpot?
Yeah.
"Yeah, he probably knew he'd never win, which makes him a whole lot smarter than me."
What have you got?
A contact lens case.
With only one lens.
Fluid!
It's fluid!
I need a wipe.
What?
I don't have a wipe.
Give...
Give me a wipe.
Just...
I need a wipe.
Where's Natalie?
I'm your biggest fan.
I never miss a show.
"Oh, thank you."
That means a lot.
"Natalie, what's your favorite number?"
My gosh.
There are so many.
Mine's 19.
That's a good one.
Do you think it's going to come up on the show tomorrow?
Excuse me.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Monk."
I got a little distracted.
"Apart from you, we don't have anyone here."
I don't know. I have exams.
"All right, off you go."
I'll see what I'll do.
Thanks anyhow.
Good-bye.
Take care.
All right.
Hello.
Have a good day.
I've brought water from the spring.
Thank you. I've brought fresh bread.
Thank you very much.
Put it over there.
I'll put it here!
I'll get breakfast.
I'll go and wake my colleagues then.
"Yesterday, I asked your sister to bring us milk."
She probably forgot.
It was me.
"No, I spoke to your sister."
"No, it was me."
- lt was you?
- Yes.
She was pregnant.
I was pregnant.
It was you?
"Yes, in person."
Seriously!
"Yes, I've had the baby and I've come back here to work."
Where is it?
- ls that your baby?
"Too risky to call, especially for Dana."
"Cut over to Magnolia, we'll box them in."
(tires squeal)
(tires screech)
Heads up!
I think we're being followed.
Call it in.
What're you doing?
Wasn't me.
The truck just shut down.
(tires screech)
Move and you're dead.
Locks!
Now!
Come on!
"Take it, take it easy."
- Move it!
"- Okay, okay, all right, all right."
Get the money!
(tires screech)
(shouts)
"Go, go, go!"
NCIS!
I got this.
Go get Dana.
(siren wailing)
(tires squeal)
"Wait, i-is she signaling us?"
She wants us to cut around.
Why?
One way to find out.
Hang on.
No.
"No, my mom's out of town, and my dad's working late."
You busy?
For you?
Never.
I just want to say that I thought you were great with the Myers.
"Well, they're good people."
I owe them a lot.
Tracy told me that you were the one that introduced them that shelter in Haiti.
People are complicated.
"Well, you maybe."
Not me.
- I think you're complicated.
"- Well, you're wrong."
You just don't understand me.
Where are you headed?
Got a date.
Does that give you a twinge?
No.
Bye.
"Honey, you home?"
Shh!
Okay.
Shh!
"Hi, dad."
"Um, this is my friend Miles."
You think I don't recognize the smell of weed.
Dad.
Get out.
Hey.
What is it?
What do you mean?
- Two months?
Two weeks.
Two months?
Connor.
"Connor, come in."
I don't see him.
How long has it been?
Just a few minutes.
Did he forget how to pick a lock?
That's not a rhetorical question.
"Yeah, no, I agree."
That's a fair question.
Hang on.
You stay in the van.
You don't need to bring that.
You're not the boss.
"Hey, Blair, maybe I should come down there."
"No, we got this, all right."
"It just, something's not right."
"Stay put, stick with the plan."
"Blair, can you hear me?"
Blair?
"Blair, Blair."
Hello?
"Hello, hello, hello, hello."
"Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair."
Shit.
Just stick to the plan.
Just stick to the plan.
"Yeah, we'll stick to the plan."
We're good.
We'll just ah...
Where'd he go?
Where is that bastard?
"Hey, man!"
Get down here.
Do you see him?
Hey!
Where did he go?
Jong-go!
I gotta catch him.
Gotta catch that bastard.
Catch that bastard.
I can't believe this...
- Gotta save my baby.
- Come on.
Let's go down.
I gotta save my little girl.
- We'll get him.
"- I've gotta find him, and save my baby."
"- Don't worry, we will."
- Okay?
"Get your act together, man."
We gotta save her.
"I know, man."
I know.
I have to save my daughter...
"Come on, man."
I have to catch that bastard.
"Don't cry, man."
"Dammit, Jong-go!"
- (Wife)
"- Please, pick up."
Shit!
"I love you, too."
Where's Nick?
He's downstairs.
Apparel was half-off at the gift shop.
Oh.
"So glad you finally made it, bro."
"Thanks for being here, man."
"Yeah, man."
I got this scene under control.
She's at nine centimeters... and I'm at 16.
Why are you two holding hands?
They slept together.
You will do anything to steal focus.
"Okay, we're getting close now."
I'm gonna need you to push.
The breathing's not working.
I don't think I can do this.
Rub her back.
Get her some ice chips.
Rub her back with ice chips.
"Oh, I'm passing out."
What?
He's passing out.
Are you okay?
Gone.
Oh!
"Okay, yeah, get him out of here."
"In fact, everybody out."
But...
Yeah.
"Bye, everyone."
Come on.
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
- This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here.
This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
"I'm sorry, John."
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
- Hey.
- Dad!
"- Hey, pal."
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mind if I use your bathroom?
I've got to make a pit stop.
Not a full pit stop-- just an oil change.
I'm going to pee.
So do you like the zipper bags better than the pinchy kind?
We don't have to do the small talk.
"- Oh, thank you."
- Okay.
"Buddy, put your backpack on."
"Okay, have a good day at school."
"I'll call you tonight to tell you that I love you and to say good night, okay?"
"Okay, Mom."
I love you.
"Oh, that is so sweet."
Reminds me of my mom.
Not that you're as old as my mom.
My mom is young.
She looks great.
You look great.
- We're going to go wait in the car.
"- Great, great, great."
"- Bye, Mom."
- Bye.
"# Oh, baby, I love your way #"
# Every day #
# Wanna be with you night and day #
# Every day #
I don't know.
You set the bar pretty high.
Oh.
That's funny.
I'm Carol...
Rance.
I know.
I just came in to look at the space.
How are you with decorating?
"Uh, try me."
Okay.
"When you were thinking of taking this job, where were you gonna put your desk?"
Uh...
I always thought here.
So you could see the view...
Plus it's more convenient for jumping.
"Clearly, you've given this some thought."
I have.
Just so you know...
Mm.
"...the reason I didn't take the job is,"
I really think I'm at my best when I'm supporting someone else.
I'm a great number two.
"Yeah, I don't want a great number two."
Sure.
I get that.
I want a partner.
"Hey, mertala."
Is she here?
Who is it?
!
It's Mr. Matt!
Then start acting like an adult.
I'm done here.
Go.
(DIALING)
Alice?
"Uh, It's me."
It's Leo.
"Oh, hi, Mr. Boykewich."
You have Ben's phone?
"Yes, I do."
"Oh, no, did you tell him that you know?"
"Yeah, but I told him, uh, Dylan's dad told me."
Oh.
Thank you.
"No, thank you for telling me."
You did the right thing.
And I just wanted to let you know you don't need to come over.
He's not going anywhere.
Okay.
Thanks.
Henry!
Hi!
Come in.
I want you to meet my parents.
I never smoked weed.
Marijuana.
Thank you for the clarification.
And I've never had a drink.
Filipino parents are very strict.
What time would you like me to bring your daughter home?
We haven't said she can go out with you yet.
"Uh, how do you two know each other?"
Not this time.
What are you talking about?
Everything.
Wait!
Laura!
Wait for me!
- Laura!
- Come on!
- Come on!
- I'm thirsty!
Shall we go to the movies tonight?
The movies?
I have free tickets.
From that weird guy?
"He works there, doesn't he?"
Weird?
"He looks a bit strange, don't you think?"
Yeah.
Did you talk to him?
A bit.
At least he gave you free tickets.
Right.
So do you want to come?
I can't.
Marco's coming.
"You don't like Marco, do you?"
"Yes, I do."
It's just that...
I don't really understand what he wants.
From me?
No... just generally.
"Sometimes I don't know, either... if he's honest."
"Yeah, I skated away and called you a big baby."
"Sophie threw a rock at me and you yelled, ""you're so gay."""
I did do that.
"Oh, didn't I?"
We used to use that word a lot.
You used to be able to call anything gay.
Ugh.
Do you ever miss that?
- No.
- No.
That's hurtful.
Yeah.
"I'm sorry, Mitchell."
"You were scared, and I should've held your hand through the tunnel, and I was..."
I was not a good big sister.
I'm so sorry.
Will you forgive me?
"- Yes, yes."
- You do?
- Yes!
I forgive you.
- I love you.
"- Love you, too."
- Love you!
"- Okay, okay."
- Okay.
- Let's do this.
"- Yes, let's do this."
- Come on.
- What?
What's happening?
"No, no, no, we're going..."
-Would you give me the friggin lighter.
Jacob let me do it.
"Don't hit anyone, Hyder."
D'you shut up.
The retard's gonna hit his own face.
Shut up you asshole.
-Holy shit no more house arrest.
"Gimme the bat, let me show you how it is done."
Alright.
Hold that for me.
Fuck you.
Stop being such a little bitch.
"-Lance stop motherfucker, quit it."
Obviously it's you.
-Fuck you.
Come on don't be a pussy just hold...
-Stop lance this isn't funny.
Get it away from me.
-Stop lance.
Fuck you.

Stop Jacob.
-Leave me alone .
Can you stop?
-Fuckin go away.
Stop.
-Fucking go away.
Get the fuck off me.
The fuck.
"- Say your prayers, mugs."
"- On the level, mister!"
"Shut up, rats!"
Stop your squealing.
- Who's the leader?
- I am.
Come here.
"Collect that dough, and fast."
Come on.
Hand it over.
You too.
Come on.
Here.
Now get them up and turn around.
- Hey!
- Hey!
What's the matter?
"Next time you roll a guy for his poke, make sure he don't know your hideout."
How did you know?
"Come here, suckers."
- How do you know this place so good?
"- Yeah, how do you know?"
Let me show you.
Here.
Look at this.
"- ""R.S.""?"
"- Hey, you ain't Rocky Sullivan!"
Rocky Sullivan!
"Hey, did you get that?"
It's Rocky Sullivan!
We tried to hook you!
What a boner!
But no handcuffs this time.
You've gotten a lot harder since you've been away.
Lvan was all over me after you left tonight.
He kept asking me stuff.
Did I talk to you?
What did I say?
He's like something that crawls out of an old pipe.
It's okay.
"in a few days, this will all be behind us."
"Uh, I can't do It."
I'm not Mikhail.
He's dead.
Come here.
Shit!
"Look, I'm positive the girl went up to 323."
The room is empty.
I was just up there.
You saw her come in.
When did she leave?
I don't-
Do you recognize this man?
Yeah.
He checked in across the hall.
- Room 305.
- Room 305.
"Okay, good."
Let's go.
Found this.
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Where did he go?
Tell me!
"Actually, I wouldn't..."
I wouldn't mind if we just cemented over the ocean.
I hate fish.
"Speaking of oceans, who wants to take a dip?"
Oh!
"- Yeah, now we're talking."
- Here we go.
Get in.
Get in.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid to swoop.
I feel like such a man right now.
Oh.
"Guys, you might wanna start small,"
- because I just put a piece in...
- Oh.
- And I'm already buzzing.
- Whoo!
"Is that mint, or is that just, like, coffee?"
I'm buzzing really hard right now.
That's good.
"Oh, my brain hurts a little."
I'm tingling.
We should s'go right now.
S'go!
- S'go!
- Yeah.
Ooh.
[Grunting]
"Yeah, baby!"
"Oh, this song..."
- Actually sucks pretty bad.
Ooh!
Now all we gotta do is find it.
Oh...
"Let's go, Larry."
Very good.
"Yes, here we are."
No one sees us.
"Good, good."
Yes.
"Okay, Larry."
Here we go.
Let's go.
That's good.
Okay.
Oh.
Larry.
"Oh, pardon my vigor."
"Now, Larry, if we meet any other boaters, let me do the talking."
"Hang on, Larry, I'll be right back."
"Don't go anywhere, lover."
Everything will be fine.
"I've got everything under control, Larry."
One day we'll look back on this and laugh.
"Ah, there we are, perfect."
"Okay, Larry, here we go."
"Help me out here, Lar."
Scooch over.
That's good.
Okay.
What?
"Oh, don't be ridiculous, Larry."
Of course you'll still be attractive to me after the autopsy.
"Yes, to Lázaro Cárdenas."
How long is it going to take?
OK.
Bye.
How much money do you think the Old Lady has?
I bet it's a lot.
I don't know.
"Where were you, Beto?"
"Yeah, it's really good."
It's like...
It comes out sizzling.
Sizzling?
"Yeah, it'II..."
It'll save your life.
It's amazing.
Weird.
It'll definitely help with physics.
Hi.
Hey.
What are you gonna get?
Hi.
I didn't know you were...
Didn't know you were working today.
This is a surprise.
"Yeah, shift change."
"So, can I start you all, you know, with some water before I come and take your order?"
It sounds great to me.
Yeah.
Just water.
All right.
Just working on some physics here.
"So, we need some..."
"Go, move."
"Chin, go, go, go."
I got you covered.
Stay down.
You're gonna be fine.
Hey.
Craig?
I wanna see him.
Please?
Dana.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
I was afraid you'd leave me if I did.
You were wrong.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I not be angry?
"But the man I fell in love with was Craig Ellers, not Paul Stark."
Everybody deserves a little forgiveness.
"Hey, where's Mary?"
- I got good news and bad news.
"- Oh, no, no."
"The good news, I got back with my girlfriend."
- That's good.
- Bad news is you lost Mary.
"Sorry, she confused me with a Jedi mind trick."
- You want me to put out an APB?
- No.
I think I know where she is.
What's that?
Lunch.
Open it or he dies!
Open it.
MAN:
Step on it!
"Quiet, boys, quiet!"
"Meuller, Johnny, Ross, you come with us."
"Carr, you stick here."
"I told you, I didn't want any part of this."
[MEN SHOUTING]
Quiet!
"Oh, we get it."
"You want the warden to think you're too good to stick with your pals, huh?"
"No, I don't wanna make the Hole for life."
"Listen, Ross."
"Get moving or I'll bump you, Stacey or no Stacey."
MAN:
Come on!
[MEN SHOUTING]
Come on.
"Move aside, Ross."
They're all screwy.
I'm glad you use your head.
I'll make my own break when the time comes.
So the picnic is on.
This is it.
"And there's Polecat, like you asked."
I'll get to him later.
"Hello, Frankie."
I been waiting to see you for a long time.
I got a surprise for ya.
"All right, boys."
Right here.
[EXPLOSION]
[GUNFIRE]
You know I'm your mother.
I can't untie myself.
"Go to the bathroom, grab a pair of scissors and untie me."
Nothing bad happened.
Untie me.
I want you to repeat 10 times:
"""I don't listen to my brother."""
I don't listen to my brother.
I ...
"Louder, please."
I don't listen to my brother.
I don't listen ...
I said louder.
Our mother wouldn't do that.
More convincing.
Elias ...
Sorry.
Again.
"I'm sorry, Elias."
Come on.
Please?
Untie me.
What happened to your nose?
Nothing.
Nothing serious.
See?
If you let me go I can make you breakfast.
"Untie my feet, they hurt."
Lukas?
"I know it's difficult, but we're gonna make it."
"Come on, untie my feet."
"Go ahead, then I'll make breakfast."
- Does Kim know about this?
Yeah.
From you?
I haven´t had the chance to talk to her myself yet.
"You square this with her, Chase."
You understand me?
You just make it right.
And get back to me as soon as Nina gives you anything.
I will.

Yeah.
- We set?

All right. I want you to do a high res on her eyes.
She´s tired.
We might be able to pick up a tell.
OK.
"Shoulder's killing me, man."
"Hey, I've been meaning to ask"
You.
How's Keela?
"Ah, you know, they're in"
Disneyland for 10 days.
I'm gonna see her when she
Gets back.
"Right, right."
I guess that's better than
"Nothing, right?"
Can you do me a favor?
Can you doublecheck on Lou cause
I'm worried about him.
Yeah.
I'll take care of this shit.
All right.
"Hey, man."
You wanna grab a beer after
Work?
I gotta go see my uncle red.
"Oh, yeah."
How's he doing?
Face cancer.
Spread to his balls.
How did that happen?
Sucking his own cock.
Too much.
"Sorry about tonight, frankie."
"Oh, hey, man."
"Don't even sweat it, you know"
What I mean.
Wait.
They check on your private communications?
They can do it.
They always find out anyway.
What if you called from outside.
from a public place.
Why would I do that?
- We could talk freely.
About what?
Take down my code.
Who knows.
You may need me.
I need no one.
- It's Denis.
Xavier.
Bernard. 612.
And my name is Thomas.
Thomas?
That's a nice name.
Eva is also a pretty name.
Maybe.
But it's not mine.
You're beautiful.
Why do you say that?
- Why what?
You can't say that.
It hurts me.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I find you beautiful.
That's all.
You just want to fuck me with your damn suit.
So my being pretty or ugly.
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
Blond hair ― that's all I can tell.
It was in the young woman's left fist.
But she herself had brown hair?
So add that to the poster:
"""Suspect has fine blond hair."""
Take this to the chief.
Room 62.
What's wrong?
What is it?
It's not my fault.
What's wrong?
"You mustn't get upset, Franz."
Don't start yelling right away.
What is it?
What is it?
It's not my fault!
"""Murder in Freienwalde."""
It's not my fault!
It's...
"It's Mieze, isn't it?"
Our little Mieze.
It's all over now.
Now they've done it.
Who was it?
Who was it?
I don't know.
"All I read was ""blond hair,"""
and blond hair has to mean Reinhold.
I don't know.
I don't want to accuse anyone.
It was Reinhold.
Drop the bat.
-Lance.
Sit the fuck down.
"-What the hell are you doing, lance?"
Put that gun down.
"-Are you okay, man."
Oh shit Hyder.
"-Is he okay, roger?"
"Well, I hope he's okay, bitch."
-Just put the gun down please.
This bitch hit Hyder.
-No I didn't know it was him.
Where the hell 'd'you get a gun?
Stop talking.
-Lance.
What are you doing?
"-She's gonna call the cops, man, we're all going to Juvie."
I'm not calling anybody.
-Sit the fuck down.
Jacob.
"-Lance, chill out."
"Shut the hell up, sit back."
Lance I got it chill out.
Okay.
What are you doing.
-I'm sorry.
"[Muffled] What are you doing, Jacob stop."
"Stop that, stop fighting him."
"Quit moving, quit moving."
"Quit moving, lay the fuck down."
"It's okay, it's okay."
What are you doing?
I think the heat's startin' to get to the boy!
"Well, I'll say!"
Look how red he is.
"I think he needs a new coat of poly, man."
"- Are you sick, buddy?"
- You are lookin' peaked.
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!
- Hey!
What are you doin'?
- It's OK.
"You can trust me, right?"
"I trust you, all right."
It's him I'm worried about.
Hmm...
I trust him.
"- Come on, let's take a drive."
- A drive?
"Yeah, a drive."
Don't you big city racecars ever just take a drive?
Ah...
No.
"No, we don't."
"Hey, Stickers!"
You comin' or what?
Mm-hm!
- And you thought he was gonna run.
"- Hey, can you believe it, man?"
He actually thought Doc was a famous racecar!
That's so too much!
"OK, you got me out here."
Where are we goin'?
I don't know.
Er...
Maybe I should let you talk.
You tell me what you feel
- and... and... and how I let you down.
"- Please, not now."
"Right, right."
It's not my call.
Er...
"Erm... the thing is, Frances..."
I hate meself for what I've done.
Much more than you ever could.
You know?
I know that doesn't change anything or make it better...
"God, I'm terrible at this!"
All I want to say is...
"I've been... a terrible father... but... that doesn't mean I, er... don't care or... feel..."
What the fuck?
Jesus!
You...
Get out!
Get out!
- Get out of my room!
- Stop it!
- Don't start!
- Get out!
He was in the bed!
"I don't care, don't even..."
- What do you mean?
- Paul!
Bastard.
"Oh... oh, fuck!"
"Come back, you little bastard!"
"Yeah, Jacob!"
- Fuck.
- Jacob!
- Jacob!
"You all right, man?"
"Dude, take the helmet off."
"Dude, you hit that corner way too fast."
"- Yeah, no shit."
- Shut up.
- Come on.
Get up.
Get up.
I'm going again.
- Are you sure?
"- Yeah, I just fucking..."
I turned too quick.
"- So, uh, talk to Lauren yet?"
"- Yeah, I talked to her yesterday."
- So what'd she say?
- I don't know.
- Y'all dating?
- Yeah.
- Since when?
- Since yesterday.
- Where'd you guys go?
- We really didn't go anywhere.
"Went to her house, but..."
"- What do you mean, nowhere?"
- It's... nowhere.
- Wait.
"So you haven't been on a real date yet, but you're dating?"
"- Yes, it's been one day."
I might be back of house.
"Wrong gift, then?"
Good luck.
Hena.
Thanks.
"I plan to forget everything that happened here, too."
Goodbye.
Later.
May I come in?
It's open.
I'm coming in.
"Hello, I'm Ilia, nice to meet..."
Don't turn the light on.
But...
Leave it off.
Okay.
I need to call the office first.
"Sir, would you like a one-hour or two-hour session?"
It's up to you.
"A two-hour session, then?"
Sure.
Great.
"I'm here, it'll be a two-hour session."
"Yes, got it."
Would you wear that eye mask?
I don't like being seen.
This?
Okay.
Will you give me the body shampoo?
Not easy washing you without seeing you.
Let me wash you.
"Is it you, Chong-su?"
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
He's not gonna l...
Over here.
I think she's having a seizure.
He's alive.
"Hey, we need to get her to a hospital."
Derek... only to Derek.
When we get her to the hospital... to Derek.
To Derek.
Go.
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Hello?
Over here.
Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
But first... did you bring the flower?
I couldn't find it.
That's okay.
You seem like you do.
-Cut it out.
-What?
She wants to swim.
-She's afraid to get wet.
-I'm not afraid.
You little tart.
"You know what, you've had it."
-Shit!
God!
I can't believe you!
-See what I have to put up with?
"-It's not so bad, is it?"
-It's freezing.
"That's because your clothes are wet, silly."
-You really are a jackass.
God!
-No.
No name-calling now.
We're all adults here.
"-That's better, isn't it?"
"-Well, it's definitely warmer."
I'd much rather be in here than out there in that cold world.
"You're so polite, Alex."
It's okay to leave the ivory tower and live a little.
-Yes.
I can drive.
"-Well, you shouldn't."
You're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
I drank less than you.
"No, you did not."
- Your dad?
- No.
You mean John?
Are you talking about John?
"Tell me, David."
What happened?
If it was John... why?
Cos I told her about the job.
I told her about the fucking job and he found out.
It was me who found her body in the car park.
It was me who made the phone call.
"David, let me help you."
Please.
Julie-Ann wouldn't want you to do this.
"If what you're saying is true, and it was John, then this needs to come out."
"- David, we need to go."
- No.
We can help you.
Shut up.
"Come on, son."
Let's go.
What about John?
Is he with you?
He got caught in the explosion.
"- He's dead, David."
- Shut up!
But you made it out all right?
Come on.
"- David, if you leave..."
- One more word from you...!
Dad!
- Dad!
"We finally got it to stop growing, but I can tell  it still hurts her."
And there's not a goddamn thing i can do about it.
That's my job: to protect her.
And I am completely powerless.
You make me feel safe.
What?
You make me feel safe.
I just thought you should know that.
-Can I see it?
- [SUSAN] Not yet.
"[SUSAN] All right, you ready?"
Close your eyes.
[LAUGHTER]
"[SUSAN] OK, you ready?"
"Turn, turn."
Stop.
"- [SUSAN] Ready, OK, open."
"- [LING] Oh, my room!"
My room!
I love it!
"Oh, my god."
Come here!
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
I'm calling Bender!
[EVAN] Hey.
"It's OK, it's OK."
She's happy.
You made her really happy.
Look at her.
Who would do that to someone?
I don't know.
I just don't understand.
Come to the front desk.
Yes or no?
We're here.
"Fine, we don't have to."
You're leaving?
Not like I'm desperate for girls.
Nice shot.
You suck.
Watch and learn.
"""Hello dear I have to work overnight"""
"""so please take Miki to day care tomorrow."""
Hey.
Feel how hard I am.
Your room's ready.
Go ahead.
Excuse me.
Here.
"Oh, thank you."
"Oh, and this too."
What's wrong?
The cleaning lady...
She looks familiar.
"She's not your neighbor, is she?"
"If she is, we're in trouble."
"Darn, where have I seen her?"
What if we're caught?
"Hey, hey..."
I don't care anymore.
"So you can't pay up, huh?"
Maybe call the police.
She doesn't even have an ID on her.
She can't pay.
"Condom in the eye, Waterfalls."
She's a classic.
She's a cla...
She's still around.
He has no idea.
He knows.
"No, that's okay if you don't know who Rihanna is, Adam."
"No, I know..."
I want to go to the concert.
- I know who she is.
- It'll be fun.
I haven't seen a concert in forever.
"Last concert I went to was that Green Day cover band, the Basket Cases."
- Pretty talented.
- That was cool.
We got high.
I'm gonna go get some more Molsons.
- You guys want one?
- Yes!
I would love a Molsons.
- More Molsons.
- Favorite beer.
I'm gonna go sing some Rihanna right now.
That's how much I...
I love her and know who she is.
- Right.
- Excited.
Do... what do you think?
Poker Face.
That's a hit of her's.
One word or two words?
- I don't know.
"Sure, let's go."
I can't figure this out anyway.
Reinhold's a fine young man.
"We can all be wrong about people sometimes, you know?"
Let's go.
- You go.
I'll be right there.
All right.
See you later.
- Where are we going?
- Pankow.
But first we're picking up two guys.
I can't be gone long.
Cilly's waiting.
We'll go get her later.
Good Lord!
She'll be furious!
Henschke?
Henschke.
Isn't Reinhold here?
They all drove off together.
- What about Biberkopf?
- Him too.
What's wrong?
"Why so upset, Miss Cilly?"
They just want to have a little fun.
Nothing wrong with that.
- What's wrong?
- What if Franz messes things up?
We've just gotta help him.
"God, I'm thirsty!"
The boys are waiting.
-l'll think about it.
"But it'll cost you, Hill."
A lot.
She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.
At least that's what I thought.
"Hello, Henry."
-Ready?
-Yeah.
Come on.
"-Oh no, wait a minute."
-What?
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that--
Karen...
Mom.
"I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill."
How do you do?
My daughter says that you're half Jewish.
It's just the good half.
See you later.
You're leaving your car?
He watches the car for me.
It's easier than leaving it at a garage and waiting.
It's a lot quicker that way.
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.
How are you doin'?
What's up?
Here you go.
"-How are you doin', Gino?"
-Good.
How are you?
What do you mean going off and leaving Regan by herself?
Are you crazy?
Her window's wide open!
-Didn't he tell you?
-Didn't who tell me?
What's Burke got to do with it?
Nobody was here.
"When I went to get the Thorazine I had him stay with her, and...."
-I should have known better.
-I guess you should have!
How were the tests?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
"Hi, Chuck."
Come on in.
I suppose you heard.
Heard what?
You haven't heard.
Burke is dead.
He must've been drunk.
He fell from the top of the steps outside.
"By the time he hit M Street, he broke his neck."
"Oh, God!"
"Yeah, I know."
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
It's him.
"It's him, he's my friend."
"Here, hold onto it."
For your son.
Don't lose it.
"Don't lose it, Pedro."
Well?
How about that drink?
You're a hero now.
Your photos.
There's somebody else but you can't see who.
It's just a spot.
To Truman Capote.
To Truman Capote.
You were misinformed.
It wasn't him.
It was an accident.
A gift.
This enlargement came out better.
Taken the day the girl was killed at the protest.
They called him the Crow.
He alone tortured over 100 people.
And he was the best at it.
"Take care, Pedro."
Jesus made us some food for the road.
"- Here, I owed you this."
- What is it?
Bambi stew.
- Watch yourself.
- You too.
"We're good, right?"
[LAUGHS]
[SOBBING]
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said.
"Oh, please, give me another chance."
I just couldn't stand it.
Couldn't...
I can't do any more time.
"Please, turn me out of here."
We'll do what we can for you.
Go along now.
Next man.
[¶¶¶]
I don't know.
I don't know anything about it.
Honest.
I didn't have anything to do with it.
That's the truth.
"You gotta believe me, fellas."
I'm waiting.
I don't know.
"Don't, Stacey, don't."
"All right, I'll tell!"
Spill it!
"It was Carlisle, Polecat Carlisle."
Hanley had him do it.
I didn't have no part in it.
I just fingered him.
I didn't know what they was gonna do with him.
You can't blame me.
Polecat.
Yeah.
"- Hi, girls."
- Hi.
Look who I found!
"Hi, Simon!"
- Can I have a drink?
- Have mine.
- So sweet.
- As always.
So I'd noticed.
Too strong?
- Where's my sister?
- Sofie?
- I haven't seen her for days.
- We thought she was with you.
Hasn't she been home?
"Tommy, my top was brand new."
I told you to come on my tummy.
You've ruined it.
- Dry clean it.
- In the middle of the night?
- Look what Tommy did!
- I told you to use a rubber.
- He didn't want to.
- Wear this.
- Josephine's got a bottle for us.
- You forgot something.
What?
- Give me a break.
- What's up with you?
I'm not kissing a sperm mouth.
It was your sperm.
- I'm not a fucking faggot.
Swear you'll get it right back.
I won't do--
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you have a-- Could I--
Yeah?
"Here, you take the twenty, I don't want to touch his money."
His money.
"Your money, I don't do anything."
Just-
- Just fold it.
"No, no, no."
"Fold it, fold it, fold it."
"And then again, this way."
Crease it.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Like this.
"Yeah, yeah, good, good, good."
"Here, so if I rub the twenty, just like this, here."
"Can you see, your twenty?"
- Yeah.
- Look.
"If I rub the twenty against the one, see, the ink'll start to change."
See?
"Here, you see your twenty?"
"I'm going to give you my one, but look."
If I just place the little piece on top like this and I do that.
"See, now, actually--"
No...
I kinda messed up.
George:
Oh!
That's a--
"Me too, buddy."
Me too.
"Me too, buddy."
Me too.
It's just I promised the girls I'd be there.
It's just I promised the girls I'd be there.
"Barb, I told you."
It's not a problem.
Just go to the meeting.
It's fine.
"Barb, I told you."
It's not a problem.
Just go to the meeting.
It's fine.
I don't want to be late.
I don't want to be late.
Well...
"Yeah, he'll be OK."
Well...
"Yeah, he'll be OK."
(DINGS BELL)
(DINGS BELL)
He will.
(MOUTHS SILENTLY)
He will.
(MOUTHS SILENTLY)
"Look, I'll be home at 7:00 on the dot, and that is a solid promise."
"Look, I'll be home at 7:00 on the dot, and that is a solid promise."
Will you give Horrie his tablet?
"Yeah, leave it with me."
Will you give Horrie his tablet?
"Yeah, leave it with me."
Shut up.
Shut up!
- l--
"- No, I'm trying to explain it!"
Harold!
"- Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
Shut up!
Do we have the right to make a phone call?
Yeah.
Yeah!
I'm sorry.
You want rights now.
You want freedoms right now.
Is it time?
Is it freedom o'clock?
- Guess what.
- What?
"Where you guys are going, they have never even heard of rights."
"Well, where are we going?"
We're innocent men!
We're innocent men!
I'm an innocent man.
I donate blood.
And toys for tots.
And now I'm in Guantánamo Bay.
See why I'm against paying taxes?
Hey!
Hey.
Fuck you!
"Dude, calm down, OK?"
Look on the bright side.
There's a sink.
Get rid of it.
Not there!
"No, not there!"
Get rid of it!
"Here, get rid of it!"
Don't let her catch you with it!
"Drink it, drink it!"
Good boy.
"Oh, it's you."
Come in.
"Well, the sign says..."
"Oh, come on in."
What are you doing?
A little spying.
"Spying, on who?"
On Gretchen.
"You see, Bob can't figure out why he hasn't been called back to active duty."
Mr. Miles?
Yeah.
Bob?
Yeah.
He's in the Army?
"Well, sure."
He's in the reserves.
"Gee, now, if they called him back to active duty, then Nancy and me..."
What?
"Oh, I was just wondering to myself."
How come he wasn't called back?
"Well, read this."
It's from Gretchen to Colonel Blair's wife.
You shouldn't read other people's mail.
That's not very nice.
"- Come on, man!"
What I'm supposed Did the police or something?
So will you do?
There are other clients.
- When you want to see a line.
- It will not.
Fuck!

"Hi, you've reached Michael and Jenna..."
"Hey, he's not there and his cell's still turned off."
You told him you were coming here.
"He knows, right?"
I told him.
"Or, I mean..."

"Chris, can't do what?"
"- Jenna, please."
"- Can't do what, Chris?"
- You should just talk to Michael.
"Talk to him about what, Chris?"
What the hell are you talking about?

This sieve is steaming hot!
It could hurt you.

What are you messing with the refrigerator for?
I want a fruity.
"It's over, I say."
Go away.

I just come over to deliver Wilbur.
"Well, if you can't."
Have a good time.
Thank you.
I have problems with food in my house.
"Could you ask aunty to cook for me, too?"
How could I do that?
You don't have to cook!
Ask her to cook for me!
It's the same thing!
God!
She must have fallen!
I'll take a look!
Where to?
Aren't you ashamed to watch a woman bathing?
!
And where are you going?
"But I'm a girl, too."
Aunty's not a girl;
She's a woman!
Do something.
"You stand and watch, while she falls inside!"
I can't even watch...
the doors are shut.
Let me see...
Relax!
I'll ask her!
Aunty!
What has happened?
Nothing.
What fell inside?
It was my blouse.
A blouse?
Did a blouse make so much of noise?
!
Did a blouse make the noise?
What do you think I'd do?
Don't worry.
You sure this is it?
Yeah.
You got it straight?
"Hi, baby."
"Come on, Fantasia, let's go."
It'll be a few minutes.
I have to pack my stuff.
What stuff?
All you had was your purse.
It won't be long.
Come on in.
Shit!
I'll be back.
That's bullshit.
I'm sticking on your ass.
She better not have bought any clothes.
What does she have to pack?
-Come on.
-Be careful.
I love you.
Did you spend any of my money?
Fantasia?
Where did she go?
"Police officers, freeze!"
Hands up or I'll blow you to fucking hell!
-What the fuck?
-Get on the floor!
Now!
Who the fuck are you?
-You bitch!
He has a child.
"I know, but, come on, you've seen them together."
She's sort of lost her mind.
- This is her fault?
- It's nobody's fault.
It's just...
I don't know.
I think he just needs to talk to somebody.
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna be late.
- I'll be at my dad's till around 11:00.
- Okay.
"God, what's happening?"
Everyone around us is falling apart.
I know.
- Have fun.
- Thanks.
- Hi!
- I got this!
I don't need it!
"- Oh, my God!"
- My God!
"Oh, my God."
My top is totally clinging.
You can see everything.
"Don't worry, I promise I won't look."
Then I'll be insulted.
"- Well, I don't want to offend you."
"- Well, then."
Your top's wet.
Okay.
Where am I going?
Goodbye.
Do you get him?
Hello?
Who am I talking to?
"No, I don't understand you."
"Oh, it's you Henschke!"
What?
Franz?
"Yes, he was here!"
What did he look like?
Proper and hale!
He will return.
Good.
"Yes, thank you."
He's looking for Reinhold.
Let's follow him!
You stay here.
Stick 'em up!
Stick 'em up!
I only got one left.
What are you doing here?
Put that away!
What do you want from me?
I wanna bury the hatchet.
"I won't fall for that, silly."
"The arm is gone, otherwise I'm fine."
What else?
Nothing else.
- I wanna know what you want from me!
- I just wanna bury the hatchet.
You probably won't believe me.
"The arm is gone, it's not gonna grow again."
- I'll take three.
"- Mm, good boy."
Get some flesh on those bones.
How's everything in here?
All right?
"You off, then?"
Oh.
"Er... yes, if you're sure you're all right."
- He won't want for anything.
- It's Adam's decision.
Are you having a laugh?
"Look around, George."
I'm a pig in shit.
- Adam.
- Sorry.
Hm.
"- Right, I'll show you to the door."
"- No, no, that's OK, we can find it."
"Of course, yes."
Like tracker dogs.
- Um... excuse me?
!
"- No, come on."
"Cheers for bringing me here, though."
Look after him.
We don't need you to tell us that.
OK?
See you.
- Shall I feed the boy now?
"- Oh, not yet, Seven."
We're going to make a night of it.
"After all, Adam's finally where he belongs."
Do you work every day after school?
That's gotta be tough.
"Um, no, just three days."
My moms don't want me to work any more than that.
- Moms?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- It is.
"Oh, don't worry, I'll grab that."
"Oh, thanks."
See you soon.
"Oh... down the street, I'm telling you."
- You're really good.
- Not good enough.
"I thought you did great, way better than me."
I'm supposed to be good at this.
- Damn!
- What?
- Someone left us a hundred-dollar tip!
- What?
"- A hundred dollars, yo!"
"- Oh, my God!"
Who do you think it was?
I don't know.
Vanilla milkshake?
He sure was chatting you up.
- Please.
"- Come on, girl."
You know he likes you.
- Shut up.
- He wants some of that.
- Daphne!
"Damn it, Reid."
"I said, ""Don't take the vest off."""
Come closer.
I want to see both of your hands at all times.
You sit across from me.
Why are you so nervous?
I told you.
I'm not used to being around guns.
This is going to probably sting a little bit.
Whoa.
Did you see that?
I knew it.
I knew it.
"Hey, look."
He's got it.
He's got it.
He's got the chip.
I've gotta go to the Higher Authority.
I was supposed...
Not yet!
Turn it on.
Turn the chip on.
Excuse me?
"- Get off the train, Reid."
"- No, no, something's wrong."
Get off the train.
- Get out of there.
- Why isn't he moving?
How many shots would it take to move in?
Two.
First blows the window.
Second takes Bryar down.
-No.
"I'll go alone, I'll go alone."
"-No, I'll go with you."
"-No, I'll go by myself."
I'll go.
"No, I also have to get something."
"The recipe, so I can cook for you."
I'll go with you?
.
"Fine, it's up to you."
And tomorrow's your birthday!
You're already 28 years old!
What would you like me to cook for you?
It's up to you.
-No!
"Just tell me, I'll cook it for you."
-Anything.
What?
Anything you want.
"Sorry, I can't come later."
Joy said she's coming with me.
Okay then.
I'll find a way.
I really need to see you.
Yes...okay.
I'll just call you.
Yes.
Who were you talking to?
You heard it right?
"I was talking to mommy, I just asked how she's doing."
-Are you sure?
.
- Eddie.
Search him!
"Eddie, what's with the security?"
It's not our first deal.
Maybe he looks familiar.
"Here's $200,000."
We'll check the guns first.
What are you guys doing?
"Nothing special, officer."
A reunion.
Open the trunk.
Open it!
Now!
Damn you!
"You set me up, didn't you?"
Are you a cop?
Talk!
I'm no cop!
I didn't betray you.
Then how come he's here?
He's no cop!
"I stake my life on it, Eddie!"
"Lying bastard, I shouldn't have trusted you!"
The guy's a cop.
I recognize him!
You've got it wrong.
"Chang, I'll get him!"
That shithead!
Don't move!
"Goddamn mess, assho--"
Finish your sentence.
Ass... assho--
Not with a tomboy like that.
Get on.
Hold tight.
"Yeah, I know."
What's up?
Dad?
Something wrong?
Well...
How do you tell someone...
It doesn't matter.
I'm home.
They're mad at you.
Why?
Said you'd stay-in this afternoon.
I didn't.
"Anyway, you were home."
I'm here on vacation...
I do what I want.
I might go jogging.
Cousins should help out.
I'll tell your Dad.
Noriko just hangs out doing nothing
You want to be like that?
Then I won't cover for you again.
"I'm joking, please be on my side!"
"100,000 kms from Earth"
"Okay, okay, what're you barking at?"
Let's go.
Quit it.
We're going.
A storm?
My ears are popping.
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
"This is what... recovery is all about -- you know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
"Uh, recovering drunk."
"Wife, sister, mother."
"Two kids -- boy, 10, girl, 8."
Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
Assembly line -- boring.
Come on.
I told you.
Went on and on and on.
"Well, okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high-security."
'cause you mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
"Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.
- I didn't want to go home.
- Clark.
"Uh, yeah, I know, I know."
This...
This my home.
It is!
Will you two break it up?
Stop it!
Hold on to yourself.
What's the matter with you?
"Jimmy, you wasted two months on this."
No collars are comin' in... ..while you're runnin' around town jerkin' off!
Now go back to work!
You're off special assignment!
Get down!
Get out!
Get outta the area!
Leave her alone!
Stay away!
Leave her alone.
There's a sniper up there!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop that man!
He's wanted by the police!
- What's the next stop into the city?
- 25th Avenue.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Police emergency.
I need your car.
When am I gonna get it back?
For Christ's sake!
Hold it!
Stop!
Halt!
- Don't stop.
- But...
You got character.
I don't make this offer to just anybody.
"Sarge, I got a great-lookin' gal to go home to... not to mention my wife..."
so it just ain't in the cards.
Igor.
Another glass of cheer.
You think you got it rough?
Look at that guy.
"- ## [""Harbor Lights""] - [Sighs]"
"Boy, he looks terrible."
What's his story?
"He got a ""Dear Maxie"" letter."
- Says he's got nothin' to go home to.
"- Oh, yeah?"
"Well, that's a shame."
Please.
Allow me.
"Some tune, huh?"
The greatest.
"For a certain little lady and me, that was our song."
"This drink's on me, Maxie."
Please.
Don't call me Maxie.
Only Laverne called me that.
And...
- And...
"- That's it, pal."
Get it off your chest.
Tell Joey all about it.
Yeah.
"You're right, Joey."
Who are you?
[ Laughter ]
Don't know.
"I just picked that out of thin air, too."
"Right, right, right."
Plaid buttoned-down interior.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe.
Um...
Yeah.
He's a keeper.
You'd think sensible...
He's a keeper.
...Good dancer...
"He's a great guy, great dancer, kind of suave, knows his way around a kitchen."
Fun at parties.
"""Knows his way around a kitchen""?"
Was that a fat joke?
[ Laughter ]
No!
You could have said anything.
A kitchen?
No.
That was like sexy chef.
"Oh, is that what it was?"
Yeah.
Oh.
"Your lap... fast, slow?"
How did it feel?
"When you got out of the car, you thought, ""that was..."""
Slow.
Slow?
Yes.
Where is it?
Where's what?
"Look, when I get through working you over, you'll tell me where it is."
Or do you want to talk now?
"All right, I'll talk."
"Well, talk!"
How's Mama?
(GRUNTING)
This way.
I don't know what you're mad at me for!
"I didn't do anything to you, and I didn't do anything to your wife!"
No one ever double-crossed me.
No one living.
What do you want from me?
I know you have that diamond.
I put it in your pocket myself.
There's nothing in my...
Is this what you want?
"All right, here."
I don't want it.
Are we friends now?
BOB:
Wilbur!
Huh?
"Stop him, he's a crook!"
Hey!
"Hey, man!"
Man!
Man!
"Man, wait!"
"Mister, will you wait?"
They want...
"I mean, that's what they deal ya."
That's what they tell ya.
Yep.
Well...
"Sorry to take your time, Jack."
You have a good day.
We're almost there.
Wait.
Oh shit.
"No, forget it."
"Let's go, let's go!"
Come on.
"Look, baby, we're so close."
You can do this.
Let's go.
I can't.
"Vivian, how long have you been down here?"
Weeks.
"Once, I don't know."
This is your chance to get out.
We have to go.
I cant.
Fuck it.
Leave her.
You can't leave her.
Beautiful land you got out here.
Thank you kindly.
I guess it was just kids playing around with the phone.
Take care.
"Sorry you had to drive all this way, Sheriff."
Don't go!
"Wait, wait!"
I am.
It's just that you're sometimes...
What?
"I'll finish this quickly, OK?"
Here.
I put a vitamin pill in it.
A vitamin pill.
- Shall I let in a little light?
"- No, please don't!"
It's better this way.
- I wanted to ask you out.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- To dinner.
- To dinner?
- Don't you want to?
"- Yes, dinner."
OK.
It's you.
"- You don't like it, do you?"
"- No, it's different."
- You didn't even recognize me.
"- Sorry, I was daydreaming."
- Well?
Black coffee as always?
- Yeah.
What were you thinking about?
I forgot.
I think it was important.
- I know the feeling.
"- No, not like that."
- I have a problem here anyway.
- Yeah?
"Granddad, what are you doing?"
!
Stop the car!
I don't want to die!
There!
Now stick that up your ass!
My car!
You hit my car!
Your fault for parking like a fucking asshole!
"Granddad, wait!"
Let's get out.
Oh!
Man!
We can't get out!
"Yes, I said it!"
"Hey, little girl."
Your daddy parked like a fucking asshole.
"Now, won't you be my neighbor motherfucker."
He's trying to start a nigga moment!
I'm from a town called Whup Mr...
Aah!
Run!
We're sorry!
We'll pay for the damage!
Just run!
We will not!
"You little niggas, get off of me!"
"Come on, honey, let's walk the other way and call the police."
- Stay down!
"Stay down, please!"
- Get off me!
Please stay down!
Tell me...
Where were you on Sept 3?
Sept 3?
I've been touring in China for the Asian Fight.
I just got back.
It was live on TV.
Sorry.
We made a mistake.
Sorry.
Jesus.
"Chairman, Don't be afraid?"
There's 10 of us.
He only has 7 bullets.
"Yes, chairman."
Don't be afraid!
Big mouth.
It's 15 bullets.
Get it?
Want one in you?
What about you?
No loyalty.
And you?
That was close...
You didn't do much to save me last night.
"But I almost died for you today, we're even."
"Bro, yours is a fake gun."
"We're friends, forget it."
Where are you sneaking off?
"You said you're sleepy, right?"
"You go back first, I'll dine with Lisa."
"You didn't sleep too, right?"
How embarrassing to fall asleep on the dinning table.
- 'Bye.
Save you a twinkie.
"Ho, ho."
( Rock Music Playing in Headphones )
"- Hi, Jessie."
"- Hey, Mick."
Ben around?
No.
He went with Mom to the store.
Are you bored?
"Yeah, I know how it can suck being the new kid."
You can hang out here with me for a while if you want.
Are you sure?
You don't mind?
Tell you what.
I was thinking about going for a boat ride.
I could use a little muscle.
Sure!
I'm real strong.
Only if you promise I'll be safe out there on the lake with you.
"'Cause after all, you're a pretty good kisser."
Ready?
Go!
I'll race ya!
"Jessie, why do you have to go away to school?"
JESSIE:
Because I'm a woman with a past.
I was a bad girl.
I got kicked out of my school here.
MIKEY:
What did you do?
Kill somebody?
Which one?
"Over there, near the lady sitting on the steps."
You can't see much from here.
"Let's go up higher, I'll show you."
- Which way?
- This way.
Let's go.
Farzad.
Why don't you bring us back the soup bowl?
I'll return it.
I need it.
Who is that lady?
That lady there?
"No, the neighbour."
Mim Khamman.
What does that mean?
My aunt on my father's side.
"- Hello, engineer."
"- Hello, are you well?"
- How's your family?
- Very well.
- Who's that?
- My mother.
- Are you well?
"- Yes, thank you."
Are you Mr Hashemi's sister?
He sends his greetings.
He wasn't able to come.
I understand.
I'm at your service.
"Farzad, help them bring the gear in."
All right.
We can't just leave him.
Either he's gutted or scalped.
"And if he ain't he can find us, can't he?"
What about Glass?
He ain't our problem.
"Like us, he's on his own."
We made a promise to the Captain.
A proper burial when the time was needed.
He needs that rifle!
He couldn't do nothing with it if you tarred it to his hand.
We can't do this.
We got no fucking choice.
"No, we can't."
Look at him.
"All right, shit, then, buddy."
Get him up.
You want to take him?
(GLASS GROANING)
Come on now!
Easy.
"Slowly, Fitz."
Easy with him.
(JIM GROANS)
Just get your shit.
Get your shit!
(GLASS SCREAMING)
Shut up.
Shut up!
JIM:
Hold up!
(GLASS GROANING)
Fitz.
"He's in his crib, like you said."
"Well, you can't... you can't just walk out and leave him alone."
He's not alone.
He has you.
"Look, this isn't just about us."
We have a child.
You were hurt.
"And everyone thinks that maybe you need time, but Lucas doesn't care."
He needs you now.
"But... and if I'm gonna be a good father,"
I've gotta do what's best for him.
I can't fix you.
I can't... make you walk out the front door.
You have to do it yourself.
And I have to let you.
Ow!
Ow!
It's okay...
leave me alone!
Aah!
"Tammy, stop it!"
Ah!
Don't!
Leave me alone.
"I got her. 5 milligrams of lorazepam, now."
What happened?
I don't know.
It came out of nowhere.
No!
Mom's here.
Mom's here.
It hurts.
You have to take another year.
I started when I was thirteen.
Then you can drink your coffee without crying on my nose?
Do not make fun of a grown man.
'You thought I was tough?
-I Was.
You wash the dishes?
"I'm glad I came, Henning."
I do not like it here after what happened.
So let's run away?
Play a little water on the fire.
"Nixon, where are you?"
Please answer me!
Are you hurt?
Not a scratch.
And you?
I need your help.
Hello.
I was asleep.
Enters.
'I'm just going to change me.
Coffee?
-What Is prime the coffee.
Come here.
'Tell me what you know.
-What Do I know?
Christer helped the police.
He was an infiltrator.
'Do not you dare!
Where's the package?
No packet.
I already tried.
"♪ ""I always dreamed the boy I love ♪ ♪ would come along ♪"
"♪ ""And he'd be tall and handsome, ♪ ♪ rich and strong"" ♪"
♪ Now that boy I love has come to me. ♪
♪ But he sure ain't the way I thought he'd be. ♪
"Welcome home, Batts."
"Hiya, sweetheart."
How are you?
Sit down.
Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.
"And give those Irish hoodlums a drink, down there."
There's only one Irishman here.
"It's a celebration, fellas."
-Top of the morning to ya.

Forgot you were having a party for him.
Come here.
I'll say hello.
"How are you, Billy?"
I haven't seen you in six years.
Jesus Christ Almighty.
You look terrific.
Watch the suit.
"You little prick, ya. I've known you all my life."
-Don't go gettin' too big on me.
Just sleep!
Actually we can stop thinking...
Shit!
But her nail is broken!
Stop thinking of stop thinking already!
Excuse me.
The hell kind of machine?
"This heavy, who the hell can lift it?"
Damn!
Hey do you need any help?
I am coming for you.
I'm gonna get you.
You damn rash!
Wait.
Shit I forgot to turn on my cell phone.
Je
Damn it. 57 missed calls.
Did a client die?
What's up?
Sup?
Didn't you call me?
Never mind.
Never mind?
Just tell me why you called?
Nothing.
"The Girls Group's cover, I noticed a nail was broken."
But I already got Jerd to fix it.
So it's ok.
Hey!
You sent my work to Jerd.
That really sucks.
C'mon it was just a little job.
"In a half-hour, it's done."
Here he is.
Stay in the car!
Get going!
Stop it!
Why'd you screw me?
Stop it!
"Stop, dammit!"
I know who the van gang are.
And their next stunt.
They're in the sticks.
It starts from there.
"In exchange, you cover me."
Or get nailed with me.
Who did you waste?
"Marcus Zerbib, his driver and his goon."
Marcus Zerbib?
The guy who put you in jail?
You'll get nabbed right away!
Not with a good alibi.
Now... you can grab the worst gang around.
Choose.
"OK, let's have it."
I know two of 'em:
Francis Horn and Robert Boulanger.
They're squatting in St Ouen.
On Captain Glarner St.
- Don't you say hi?
- I hadn't seen you.
- Want a drink?
- I'm with friends.
You got friends now?
Come on.
This is true.
"This is true, Roldy."
Ooh wee
"- Man, this is so not like me."
- Yeah.
It's like I'm a whole new Harold.
"Better, faster, stronger."
Nice.
"Man, I've never used a sick day before."
"I'm taking a whole week off from work here, man."
"And in less than eight hours, we're gonna be in Amsterdam."
- This is nuts.
This is nuts.
"- I know, dude."
"It's gonna be exactly like Euro Trip, only it's not gonna suck."
- It's gonna be awesome.
- It's not not gonna be awesome.
Dude.
"Dude, this chick's giving me such a boner, it's awesome."
Thank you.
You ruined the moment.
"She's all yours, buddy."
- You wanna pause it?
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
"No, that's--"
Enjoy.
Just a minute.
Fuc--
"Hey, hey."
Let me in.
What are you doing?
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.
"I hate this, John."
I absolutely goddamn hate this.
How was Chicago?
What did he say?
He wouldn't see me.
Shit.
You all right?
It's cold.
"Get in the car, warm up."
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.
Everybody in this town is looking at me like I'm insane.
You know why?
"Denise and all the others, they don't know, John."
I do.
I don't think you're crazy.
Okay?
"You talked to him too, John."
You know...
I've been lying awake at night.
I feel... like I'm sleeping... but I'm awake.
That's when I hear him.
"And lately, when I hear him... all at once..."
I understand.
Everything.
"John, doyou remember the last time you were happy?"
It's real.
These things are real.
I want you to be happy.
Yeah?
Slab.
What?
-There What you want to say.
I did not say you were bad.
You've already talked about.
I did not say you were bad.
You've already talked about.
Why not say again?
Slab.
I did not say you were bad.
I did not say that you are weak.
-Do you love me?
It's not about that.
"No, not about that!"
"No, it's not about that!"
-It's About it!
-Not!
-You did not answer me!
"Yes, I love you."
-When You love someone...
Amends.
Do not turn your back.
You have to be careful with that.
It may never get.
"I can not do this to work with you, Edward."
I can not keep doing this.
Susan.
You can not turn your back on problems all the time.
Come on.
Come on.
-Shit.
I told you I do not know.
"I've got to-- My homework, OK?"
OK.
"That was, um-- That was nice of you."
No problem.
She's a good dancer.
"Yes, she is."
I'm sorry we made a mess.
"Oh, no, don't worry about that."
"So, what do you think about Shannon?"
"Well, l-- l think that she's--"
"She has good instincts, but she's, um-- she's at least a grade behind, and she can-- she has a way with the truth."
[chuckles]
"A way with the truth, right."
"Listen, if you're asking me if it's too..."
Too late?
"It's never that, Mr. Fallin."
Never.
Never that.
"So, you want to-- you want to stay?"
- Yes.
- Good.
Good.
Thank you.
"She's, um-- she's really excited about this dance."
"A night out with you, a new dress."
She's really excited.
Do you want to call me Dad or Jim?
Dad.
I think Dad's nice.
Yeah.
And you?
"Um, are you Samantha or Sam?"
Wait for me!
Wait for me!
"Hiroshima, traitor."
Don't run!
Don't panic.
There's only 1 bullet left.
"Block it with your finger, hurry up!"
How do you know you'll be alright if I fire?
- l don't know.
- l do.
Don't worry!
Some jerk tried it once.
Then go ahead!
It really works!
"E.T., how come...?"
"Mr. Robin, there're no bullets left."
"Back to the Stone Age, I'll use... I'll beat you up, beat you up...!"
Beaten...
Mr. Robin!
I'll slay...!
See you in Japan!
"Oh, I got it wrong!"
I'll slay...!
I'm sorry!
Follow it...
Come back here...!
All finished!
Not for real!
I'll kill you...
Where's Mr. Hiroshima?
Wake up!
Don't fool around.
It's for the better.
"I'm tied down for a week, so I'll just stay put here and write."
"Mr. Director, you are wonderful."
Does it hurt?
A little.
"Damn it, this sucks."
Hello.
- Did you like the food yesterday?
"- Yes, it was delicious."
I'd like to order the soup again.
"Sure, but how's the movie director?"
He's still in pain.
- Hope he recovers soon.
- So do I.
- It'll be ready in a moment.
- Okay.
What's this?
"Oh, that?"
It's a cane.
Why?
Do you need it?
Is anyone using it?
We don't use it anymore.
My husband used it way back.
"If you need it, take it."
"Oh, thank you."
You're welcome.
- Hello.
- Hello.
"- Want some fried eggs, too?"
- Yes.
How many?
Come on.
"Should I help him along, Dad?"
"You know your dad, God bless his Irish soul..."
He was...
How shall I put it?
He was sort of killed.
Tell Tommy who killed his dad.
Tell Tommy.
"Come on, tell him!"
Don't move or I'll fucking kill you!
Son of a bitch.
Jimmy!
Get up!
Get up!
- I'll kill you.
- I'm your son.
Let me go.
Let me go.
- Freeze!
Stop or I'll shoot!
"- Vince, no!"
"I'm sorry, Tommy."
I never meant for any of this to happen.
He was my son.
"But it's over now, because we're going in... together."
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?
"Come on, shoot me."
You couldn't do it before.
You just don't have it in you.
Shoot your own son?
There goes that gold watch.
"I'll give her a fight, all right!"
"- No, no, no."
Wanted to write!
- What?
Wanted to write.
On the paper.
Why should I want to write on it?
I'll have some sent up to your room immediately.
Manuel!
That doesn't work either.
What were you saying just now?
- Turn it on.
- What?
Turn it...
Turn... it... on.
I can't read that.
I need my glasses.
Where are they?
"They're on your head, Mrs. Richards."
I've lost them.
They're the only pair I've got.
I can't read a thing without them.
Excuse me!
"- Now, I had them this morning..."
- Mrs. Richards...
When I was buying the vase...
"I put them on to look at it, and then I had them at tea time..."
Mrs. Richards!
Your glasses are there!
There?
Who put them in there?
"No, no, no!"

And that's your daughter?
Yes.
I know you're still good inside.
I know you want to help us.
You don't know anything about me.
Please!

Assaggiala.

You have never experienced it.
"- Monna, tell her to try it."
You have to taste it.
"Yes, is..."
But it hurts.
"- Thank you very much, but..."
She barked and tossed it.
She does not like the queue.
"I do not like it, but you're sitting on mine."
My dear friend.
Go straight and then left.
"Right, right."
"Sorry, right."
"Nice, huh?"
"Oh, fuck."
Louise?
Is it his version of the disciple?
"She takes, takes and takes, is not it, Mr. Lloyd?"
For what noble purpose?
"Good morning, Ludovic."
- My jacket.
Thing?
- My jacket.
Thing?
"Stop saying ""your place."" This is your place."
Is it?
What are we doing?
Don't know.
There's no version of this that feels right.
I'm looking for Sean or Beverly Lincoln?
Yes?
We got a delivery here.
Where do you want it?
You like it?
They told me nobody's fucked on it yet.
"Oh, it's amazing!"
It's brilliant!
Thank you.
"Seriously, an evil genius."
"Well, sleep tight, you guys."
Or don't.
Okay.
Thank you.
Night-night.

"Shoot him, Toni!"
"Come back, you little bastard!"
Yes.
Yes.
"No, please."
Are you okay?

I repent now.
I'm a Catholic.
I do not believe in abortion.
I'm so sorry.
I feel so useless.
You are all but useless.
You always know what to do.
Thank you.
I think I will never be able to look Edward
After what I did to his child.
He will never know.
What did I do?
What did I do?
I promise I'll be all right.
I will do everything to be in order.
"God, no."
Edward.
Toni.
"You know I had to shoot him, right?"
I do not care what you had to shoot him!
I'm glad you shot him!
I'm glad he's dead!
Hit him in the belly!
"You got him, Nelson!"
Knock him out!
- How do you like it now?
- I still say it'll go the limit!
"- Little Boy, I need some more dough!"
"- All you want, baby!"
We'll make it 100!
A hundred?
"Look, I don't want to take your money, sister!"
- Put your dough where your mouth is!
"- Okay, okay!"
It's a bet!
Finish him!
"Come on, finish him, Nelson!"
Nelson's opened up his left eye!
- It's bleeding!
- Good!
"Come on, Nelson!"
"Get him, Nelson!"
Come on!
Stand up and fight!
Nelson's pounding his kidneys!
The sucker!
Why don't he work on that eye?
That's more like it!
Come on!
I don't like this!
I don't like it!
"- Hey, what goes on here?"
- Don't you like it?
You're trying to cross me!
Yeah.
Rock star!
- Hi.
"- Sarah, hi."
I'm Vanessa.
I'm sorry.
"I didn't realize you had a lesson, Joe."
"Oh, no."
Just us playing a few tunes...
And I made the mistake of saying it looked easy.
It's nice to see the guitar.
It's been a while since it's had any recreational activity.
Yeah.
"You know, I should get going."
Time to round up my little warrior.
"Oh, she's great."
- I'll ring you tomorrow.
- Sounds good.
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
"- You, too."
"Vanessa, right?"
- Right.
- See you.
Don't tell me.
You're jealous.
Don't be ridiculous.
Come on.
She's just another mom.
Lovely.
"Oh, my."
This is so beautiful.
"You know, your home says a lot about you."
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.
What are you doing here?
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
-
I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here.
This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
what the fuck?
You got some nerve standing me up.
Nobody does that to me.
Frankie Valli or some big shot?
I forgot.
I thought it was next week.
so you're a liar!
We can talk about this.
Talk to you after what you just did to me?
Forget it.
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored.
You didn't say anything.
Let me make it up to you.
I'll think about it.
she was screaming on the street and I mean loud.
But she looked good.
I'll think about it.
Hill.
A lot.
She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.
Henry.
Ready?
Yeah.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
What?
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that
Mom.
Henry Hill.
My daughter says you're half Jewish.
What?
"He says let alone fish, not even a fly will enter the house!"
Right?
Take him inside.
Mr Sharma...
Shivraj Sharma!
Let's go in!
Aunty...!
Coming.
Where are you?
In here.
Give me the towel.
What are you staring at?
What's wrong?
"It's been days, you know..."
Don't stay in the water for long.
You'll catch a cold.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's me.
"Please fasten this, please."
"What's your size, aunt?"
- 48 C.
That sounds like a bus number!
So much of junk!
I can't find a thing in this drawer!
What are you looking for?
A safety pin!
Remind me to clear out the mess tomorrow.
- 5 kilos of gourd... that's what we call it here in Mumbai.
What's going on over here?
Today's the Karva Chauth.
My son is happy to go with you.
that's fine.
sometimes they can be... you got homework.
I'll go.
let me get my dad settled.
All right.
I don't care what the lawyer says.
But it's dangerous.
I'm not gonna hurt our chances.
Want TV?
There's TV here.
I'm fine.
Okay.
Get some rest.

You should take a moment and feel it.
Yeah.
It's great.
Logan.
Logan!
You still have time.

Eden it doesn't exist.
Her nurse got it from a comic book.
You understand?
It's not real.
It is for Laura.
It is for Laura.
Get some rest. except for us.
It's enough.
It's really enough for me.
And you would be willing to take the whole marriage thing off the table completely?
"If you promise to commit to me and to love me, and..."
- I already have.
- I'm not finished.
Okay.
All right.
- But I've loved you for seven years...
- Ah-ah.
Okay.
You have to snake the drain when my hair gets clogged.
You know that happens.
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
And also you have to let me eat those Wheat Thins in bed.
You gotta give me that.
"- Okay, fine."
All right.
- Okay?
And...
- Yeah.
- And?
- That's it.
- Okay.
Do I get to come home now?
I guess you can.
But these cannot come.
"- What, my pants...?"
- That's correct.
- Can't come home?
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.
"I hate this, John."
I absolutely %$#@ hate this.
How was Chicago?
What did he say?
He wouldn't see me.
%$@
Gordon.
You all right?
"-Eh, hello."
-Hello.
It's cold.
"Get in the car, warm up."
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.
Everybody in this town is looking at me like I'm insane.
You know why?
"Gordon, I..."
"Denise and... all the others, they don't know, John.I do."
"I don't think you're crazy, Do you hear me?"
"You talked to him too, John."
You know...
I've been lying awake at night.
I feel... like I'm sleeping... but I'm awake.
That's when I hear him.
"And lately, when I hear him... all at once..."
"I understand, everything."
"I understand, everything."
John do you remember the last time you were happy?
It's real.
These things are real.
So?
Women today fast for the long lives of their husbands.
You should know all this.
I do.
But how am I concerned?
Oh God!
I thought you'd fast and pray...
I've called so many other women over.
Okay.
I'll ask them to return.
No.
Let them be since they're here.
But ask me before you do it next time.
Tea?
No.
Juice?
I want nothing!
Can't I stay hungry for a day.
I can't hear you...
Just a minute.
What's going on?
What is it?
I want to hear Macarena!
Not now.
We have guests.
You can't be stubborn with me.
Now quietly come downstairs.
I'm ready.
How do I look?
You always look good.
Why are you crying?
Mom doesn't listen to me!
"Yeah, it's okay."
Look.
It's written in my notebook.
Right here.
See that?
"""It looks like her number came up."""
Let's see your notebook.
I didn't write it down.
I just thought of it.
Please.
Come on.
Can you believe this guy?
You know what?
"I'm going to have your badge, Officer..."
"Come on, Shifty."
Let's walk it off.
Excuse me.
I'm Stan Lawrence.
I'm the station manager.
Here's that list you wanted.
Oh.
"Great, great, great."
I'll make sure they get it.
How long did she work here?
Not long.
Just a few weeks.
I still can't believe it.
I...
I should have put more lights back here.
"Oh, no, no, no, no."
You can't blame yourself.
It was at midnight.
–Drop your weapon!
–I killed them all!
"J.F.K, R.F.K, M.L.K."
"–Carlson, got bean bags?"
–Locked and loaded.
Run DMC.!
That's the guy?
He's a nut.
–I was told he had a bloody machete.
–I called in a kitchen knife.
"–Oh, for Christ's sakes."
–I was told to call if I found anything.
End this!
Come on.
"–Oh, my God!"
"–Just a bean bag, ma'am."
–Let's get back to Bob and Marcy.
–I released them.
–You what?
–I thought we had the guy here.
Bob didn't do it.
Marcy would've told me.
"Stay still for me, sir."
That's it.
–I'm his boss.
How is he?
"–He's gonna live, but we need him in surgery."
–Not until I see my kids.
"–Vic, don't be stupid."
They're on their way here.
They're gonna be here any second.
–Vic.

How long I was passed out.
Not enough.
You're welcome!
Bishop.
Bishop?

This is Quannik's house.

- He's been waiting for you.
- As it did?
- He died.
Forget this.
I have to get back on the road.
How can I get out of here?
"Yes, now I can talk."
"No, I can not now."
It was an agreement.
Me neither.
Maybe tomorrow.
"They will not be here, I will give a getaway."
"Yes, we talk tomorrow."
Who was it?
'It was not anyone.
Why do you want to give a getaway?
-Henning And I are going to see in the woods.
So I want to go out at night.
Henning does not like to go there alone.
I think you're lying.
You can tell it was her mother.
Let me see your phone. -how Come?

"Trust me, then."

Where did you go?
I'm cleaning up.
Where'd you get that?
From him.
Who him?
Katanga.
I got a feeling I'm not the first woman ever to travel with these pirates.
It's lovely.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
What'd you say?
Wait...
I don't need any help.
You know you do.
You're not the man I knew ten years ago.
"It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage."
You are...
"Please, I don't need a nurse."
-I just want to sleep.
-Don't be such a baby.
"Marion, leave me alone."
-What is this here?
-Go away.
"Yes, it hurts."
Ow!
"Well, goddamn it, Indy, where doesn't it hurt?"
Here.
"He's got your looks, too."
And your brains.
Oops!
I noticed that.
She's a smart little thing-- smart.
Hey!
"Hey, where you going?"
She'll be all right.
Have a date.
Come on.
Come on.
Okay...
Marion.
What's this?
It's a date.
You eat 'em.
"How come you haven't found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids, like your friend Sallah?"
Who says I haven't?
I do.
Dad had you figured a long time ago.
He said you were a bum.
"Oh, he's being generous."
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
"You know, he loved you like a son."
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
"Not much, just you."
"Marion, get out of here!"
Duck!
Right.
Shh!
Shh!
Marion!
She likes it when she gets a warm meal.
Oh Franz.
I'm not hungry.
"What's this, Chinese?"
How about you?
I'm fasting.
"Say, isn't that strange  to practically fast into one's own death?"
It's just a question.
- Very tactful.
"Yes Dad, very nice."
Right to the point.
What did I say?
Are you hard of hearing?
I've just about had enough.
Shut up!
I won't listen to this crap any more.
It's a good thing when new people come to us.
"You could be a bit nicer, especially to her."
I think so too.
And you shut that thing off!
"Alright, fine."
- Bon appetit!
Thanks.
Do we want to leave?
Why don't we just stay?
Just for now.
310?
Women's bathroom.
1 15?
"Two keys, no lock."
412?
Two keys.
Come here.
Give me a hug.
Give me a hug.
What's the matter?
You can tell me.
We tell each other everything.
Do we?
Hello?
I'll meet you there.
- Hi.
- Did Marissa come back?
You smell like smoke.
"Yeah, we hot-boxed in Nordlund's car."
And didn't invite me?
"Dude, that kid was messed up."
- He was breathing.
- I hope so.
I can't believe this.
This house is cursed.
- You the owner?
"- Yes, I am."
What happened?
Not sure yet.
But it looks like somebody's been living here.
What?
It's my fault.
- You're okay.
- Disappointed?
Where you going?
Don't know.
"We both keep our mouths shut, they may never know it was us."
- What are you doing?
The cat.
The composer's dead.
Okay.
Shit!
_
Abby?
What?
Is this usual for your...
people in your native form?
She's building a nest.
We do it during molting and breeding.
"- I know, it looks..."
- Freaky as shit.
No offense.
"Trust me, it's a good sign."
Can I ask you something?
"Is everyone here, all the workers, are they... what you are?"
"No, a few are human, scientists like you are."
- They're here of their own accord.
- Lucky them.
I'm sorry I had to bring you here like this.
It's not me that I'm worried about.
It's my family.
- My kids.
- You have children?
Two.
Six and eight.
They live with my ex.
You?
You have any little ones?
A daughter.
She's 16.
Very disappointed!
Morning!
Lovely start to the week.
After you.
Hey!
I know!
Yep.
Belting.
And you were right what you said about pasties and leper colonies.
Was I?
Bought her a plant?
Lovely - she's in a meeting.
"No, it's for him."
It's him I've come to see.
The boss.
"Oh, blimey."
There'll be no trouble.
"We just need to set things straight, the three of us."
To move forward.
You can't lay new lino over a dead cat.
"Now, tell him he's got a visitor."
Use the intercom if you don't want to go in there.
Hello?
"Sorry, Mr Stanley, someone to see Mr Stanley."
Over.
"'I'm in a meeting, Pauline!"
'
Say it won't take long.
"It won't take long, he says!"
Over.
'For crying out loud.
Hang on...'
I didn't think you were going to...
feel that way.
I thought sometime you might want to come over and meet my sons.
Can we do that right now?
"Now as in ""now""?"
Yeah.
"Oh, good."
You're here.
You have to clean all this up.
Come on.
Come on.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Put away all this stuff.
All this stuff needs to be put away somewhere.
No.
Wait.
You're right.
This is better.
More kid-like.
Just play.
Do whatever you normally do.
Just be kids.
That's great.
Is that gonna fit in there?
"No, I don't think so."
Maybe you can put it in there.
I guess not.
"It looked like it would fit, but I guess not."
Wait.
Wait.
"- Yes, sir."
Mr. Weng!
What do you want?
"You should payJeffrey, or he might come afteryou."
That's bullshit!
I'm safe.
Look at these guys.
They're killers.
You're the boss.
You should keep your word.
Don't talk crap.
"I won't pay him, even ifyou beg."
"Mr. Weng, let me keep my word and pay him what I promised."
Then I'll bring him to you.
"Mr. Weng, if it pleases you..."
I will beg.
Go to hell!
Ifyou hadn't worked for my father for so long...
I'd have kicked the shit out ofyou!
Who is he?
He doesn't deserve your sympathy!
Why are you doing all this forJeffrey?
He's my best friend.
Cut the crap!
Come here now!
Mr. Weng's been shot.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Don't let him go!
"- Mr. Weng, you've been hurt!"
-Just kill him!
- Let's go!
They are looking for the female angle again.
- A Tin Hat for Tallulah.
- Girls Like Them?
- Girls Like You.
Girls Like Us?
- You need an ending.
- We're working on it.
Make it a happy one.
It will be.

You can have my spot.
Richard White.
That's me.
Go.
Thank you.
Honey.
"Oh, great."
"We're out of candles, and now the ice cream is melted."
"Honey, please."
Stop worrying.
Stop worrying ?
We're about to be washed out to sea.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
I'm...
I'm right ?
I thought I was exaggerating.
I'm going up there.
To do what ?
To go swim out to shore ?
I don't know.
Assess the situation...
figure it out.
I'm your mother.
It's my job.
Wait.
You can't do that.
Why not ?
I'll meet you there.
Hey.
Hi.
"Hey, Marissa come back?"
Uh uh.
You smell like smoke.
"Yeah, we, uh...hot boxed Nordlin's car."
And didn't invite me?
"Dude, that kid was messed up."
He was breathing.
"Yeah, I hope so."
I can't believe this.

But it looks like someone's been living here.

It's my fault.
You're okay.
Disappointed?
Where are you going?
Don't know.
We both keep our mouths shut.
They may never know it was us.
What are you doing?
You're giving me a ride.
I don't know what happened.
I do not know why the house burned down.
What was he even doing there?
Why didn't you tell us?
Let's go.
Call or fold.
Make a decision.
- Can we try to finish?
- I'm 40 light.
You mind?
- What?
"- No, there's no going light in my game, pal."
Come on.
It's more for you if you win.
Doesn't cost you if you lose.
- Go ahead.
"- Aw, man."
- Write that down.
"- What am I, your secretary?"
Yes.
Beat his ass.
- Three nines?
"- Yeah, three nines."
Told ya.
Good.
Good.
You deserve it.
"Hey, I was a fan."
Give me at least half.
Why don't you run over to that A.T.M.
"Yeah, right."
You can finally pay me back.
"Oh, damn."
You know what?
I must have forgotten my debit card.
"Oh, what a shock."
I need you to be strong.
"Can I count on you, Luke?"
Yes.
Paul.
Hmm?
I think my hands are nearly free.
Guard them!
Hello.
Hello.
"Oh, my God."
Felix.
"- Cut us free, Luke."
- I don't think so.
What?
"Just do it, you little turd."
- I killed Jonesy.
"- And what, hey?"
"What, you think I'm gonna tell on you?"
"Luke, Luke, look at me, look at me."
"I don't care how many people you've killed, okay?"
"As long as it's not me, and as long as it's not Paul."
"Now come on, cut us free."
Have you enjoyed what you've seen?
I hope you're satisfied!
I know...
I know I let you down.
I should have stepped in when Chris went for you but this...
You could have talked to me.
I'd listened.
What is it?
I saved him.
Cut him down.
Not after what I went through.
Sleeping curse.
"The one time I did sleep, I had horrible nightmares."
It's a side effect.
Same thing happened to me.
It did?
Mm.
I had them for months.
"Charming, my husband, he used to wake me when I cried out."
He'd light a candle.
He said it would capture the nightmares.
He'd watch over me as I fell back to sleep.
Sounds like he lives up to his name.
Yeah.
Um...
Why don't you try to sleep?
I'll watch over you.
You'll be safe.
Thank you.

What happened here?
It's where the final battle was.
Give me your hand.
What?
Your hand.
It's cut.
Let me help.
"No, no."
It's fine.
Just...
Would you care to bet?
One dollar. I serve him.
"Any trouble, you win."
"Fine, be a dollar more than I made yesterday."
Inez:
What will it be?
"Well, now, ain't you just a pretty little frijole."
I need me a rye whiskey.
Comprende?
"Sí, señor."
Now I need me a kiss.
-Do you?
MAN:
Yeah.
"No kiss, no money."
-l see.
-Get ready for some heaven.
There's your kiss.
What's your name?
Inez Rocios.
"Well, Señorita Rocios..."

All these men deputies too?
Sure.
Soon as I steal them some badges.
vin:
"Well, well."
"You're a long way from home, Eli Joe."
"Well, I figured I'd see some more of this beautiful country."
Look up old friends.
Hang him.
Sure went to a whole lot of trouble not to face me alone.
"And the midnight screening of ""I Spit On Your Grave"" at the Cinedome."
I can't.
I have a curfew... at 11:00.
So?
"So if I break it, my folks will ground me for a month."
"Yeah, parents."
Terrifying.
When's your curfew?
I don't have one.
"Your parents just let you stay out all night, don't they?"
My dad's out of town on a job.
It's just me and my brother.
For how long?
Couple of weeks.
Seriously?
"Yeah, we got a pretty sweet setup at the Pines."
The motel?
"HBO, magic fingers, free ice -- it's great."
Yeah.
I guess.
What?
"I do whatever I want, whenever I want."
It's perfect.
"Yeah, but... don't you miss your dad?"
Yo!
Sammy!
That's your brother with Amanda Heckerling?
He's cool.
Yeah.
He thinks so.
"Hey, tough guy."
I been looking for you.
"- Thanks, madam."
Beto...
Tomorrow I'll come to talk to you.
"- All right, madam."
Merry Christmas.
The new owners will move in next week.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
"I want to help you, but I don't know how."
I don't want to leave.
You could remarry.
"I can't live with anybody, I am a weird man."
So many years have passed.
"- Yes, madam, 30."
"Can you please leave me alone, Beto?"
"Yes, madam."
"Hello, Too."
"Fine, and you?"
I am calling to ask you for a favour.
Can you get a job for Beto?
"Yes, we all feel the same."
"Yes, I'll do that."
Of course.
I send you a kiss.
Bye.
One moment.
We'd better go.
Hello?
"Hey, Lupe!"
Why?
Right.
Can't someone else go?
"- Aw, I do like you."
My name is Murray Cornish.
I remember that.
- Do you?
- You're very charming.
- You think I'm going to -
- I think you're a charming man.
"- Da, da, da, da, da."
- [Laughs]
"Yes, I like you."
I like you too.
"You know, you're not making me too fishy."
I'm
- I'm with everything -
I don't let it go down.
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.
Are you going to live with us?
- Here?
- Yeah.
"Well, maybe someday I might."
- Not yet.
- Not yet.
It's not my time yet.
[Vocalizing]
"You could come in with me... with I, uh -with all our guys."
They'd like you.
But I would like you.
[Chuckling]
Murray's on the way.
You get it?
I got it.
Why my place of origin?
Somewhere else ok?
"Up to you, just be 500m away from Lisa."
"Michael,"
I know what you're thinking.
You want me to stay away from Lisa cos you are not confident.
Good morning Mr. Lin.
Morning.
Breakfast is ready.
Thanks David.
It's my duty.
Good morning Mr. Mak.
You didn't drown?
"No, thanks for your concern."
You're such a dog.
Really?
It's my duty.
Go to hell!
Goodbye.
You don't like him?
I don't like you too.
Just 3 weeks.
"After breakfast, I'll change and set off."
Going home to nap.
Call me later.
I don't like to sleep.
What if you fall asleep during investigation?
Wake me up.
Hey!
What?
Driving 2 cars is a waste?
Expect me to sit in your car?
"It won't be so bad, believe me."
Good night.
The fish will be pleased.
That's the third in a week.
They'll get the texts down there.
Where can I phone from?
Do you have a mobile?
"Well, me and mobiles..."
There's a phone kiosk over there.
"It's my office, but you can use it."
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
"Sophie, it's Mum."
No.
I'm still at the office.
"Yes, I know it's late."
Tomorrow lunchtime?
OK.
I'll collect him.
You can count on me.
Yes...
"Lots of love, darling."
You too...
Wait.
Wait.
It's...
It's unpredictable.
I'll...
It blocks sometimes.
- There.
- Thank you.
- Sure you're all right?
"Really, really fun."
- What are you do...?
- We're just getting into it.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"No, this has been a good hang, but I think it's time to bye-bye."
"- Oh, that's... that's it?"
- Yeah.
Where do your serving spoons go?
Second drawer to the left.
"Thank you, Doctor."
I really love bonding with you.
Next time let's not dwell on Matt.
"You know, he's gone."
Who the hell have you been talking t...?
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Uh, hanging out with my sisters?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, thought I'd give it a try."
Was worried it might be weird.
Turns out I'm right.
How are you... how are you doing?
Fine.
You?
Fine.
Also.
Great.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
(sighs)
"I came in here to yell at you, and, uh, now I'm just sad."
Unless they've got a special job like you.
"- What about the navy, Billy?"
"- I've been thinking about the navy, but..."
"- Well, I can't swim a stroke."
- Then the air force is out.
- Why?
"- Well, you haven't got wings, have you?"
"- Take these over, love."
- Thank you.
"- All the best, love."
- Thank you.
- All the very best.
- Thank you.
Thanks very much.
Mrs Rose?
"David, darling."
I think I'd better go and get changed.
- Can I help?
"- No, you can't."
"Well, my boy, when do you join your squadron?"
"Tomorrow, sir."
A Spitfire.
I saw her yesterday.
Lovely kite.
There we are.
"Mama, I'm so happy."
"Oh, darling."
- He is a lovely boy.
- Isn't he.
Darling...
"Off you go, Emma."
Both of you.
"Mummy, can I have my room back?"
Of course you can.
"Come on, darling."
Get out of the bath.
Do try not to cross-question him.
I'm not cross-questioning.
It's perfectly normal to wonder who he is.
I just think it would be nice if you didn't go on at him.
I'm only trying to find out what happened.
Come in.
Good evening.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
"Better, thank you."
I'm Henry Baker.
Hello.
I'm Lucy.
Lucy Rose.
- How do you do?
- This is my husband David.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Have some hot soup.
Thank you.
- Bread?
"- Yes, thank you."
"Can you tell me the time, please?"
It's ten to nine.
Ten to nine?
- Help yourself to cider.
"- No, thank you."
Thank you.
"Master Huang, here's to you."
Thanks.
Help yourself!
I can help myself!
Make yourself at home!
I'll never be Master Huang's student.
Forget it!
We're still friends.
I'll help you.
I've got it.
What?
You...
"You saved a girl last time, right?"
This time you'll get yourself beaten up.
I don't want to do it!
You must win my master's sympathy.
I see!
Let's do it.
Master...
What's wrong?
Someone just raided the bank.
Mousy went and fought them.
He was outnumbered.
What's happened?
He was badly beaten up.
Where were the police?
They've all disappeared.
Mousy is righteous.
"Take him as your student, please."
Mousy!
He can't even stand straight.
I'll treat you in a special way.
"Fish, fish... go on, stop that, will you?"
Lay off of that stuff.
"I don't give that fish stuff a nod, no matter how many you've caught."
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?
Always feeling sorry.
"Don't do that, kid, will you?"
Waste of time.
Come on.
I'm sor...
"I mean, ok."
Attaboy.
"You'll smarten up with me, all right."
Yes?
Washington?
"Ok, put them on."
"Yes, yes, speaking."
What?
"Yes, where?"
But what about my...
Oh.
Yes.
I'll be here all the time.
What?
"Nothing about Paul yet, darling."
They caught up with the Krozac gang and shot it out with them.
They're all dead.
But they didn't have Paul.
But what about him?
"He wasn't with them, either."
Then he has him.
He has my little boy!
"Apparently, not everybody's favorite."
And the final number is 17.
My daughter's age!
"Hi, Julie!"
"Once again, the Gold Rush numbers are 25, 52, 7, 32, 10, and 17."
"So, that's it for now."
Keep playing lotto!
You'll thank me later.
"""You'll thank me later""?"
That's my line.
I say that.
"Hurts, doesn't it?"
"You know, I might as well flush 20 bucks down the toilet once a week."
It was terrible.
Wasn't I terrible?
Yeah.
You were great.
I don't know what happened.
I just...
I got so nervous.
You were great.
It's like a tax on the stupid.
"Come on, Randy."
We're parked out front.
Great job.
"Thank you, Mr. Monk."
It was fun.
Yeah.
I'm glad you did it.
What a fun thing to do only one time and never try it again or mention it again.
Natalie?
Where are you going?
"Just hang on a second for me, please."
Alright.
"I'm sorry about that, Guv."
I'll catch up with you next time.
Alright?
Thanks.
Yeah.
(phone ringing)
Mum!
Ev!
"How are you, love?"
Have you found Uncle?
"Yeah-- yeah, but there's people living in his house!"
Oh Ev...
(crying)
"Oh, come on, mum!"
Really?
"That's not helping, isn't it?"
"Of course, it's just that--"
"Okay, look, mum, what's happening with the appeal?"
"Well, Mr. Irving filed it--"
Yeah.
He said likely another 6 to 8 weeks.
"Mum, this is not going to work!"
It's not going to work!
I'm getting light here.
"I mean, it's like $100 U.S. a night."
"I mean, I just can't afford it."
But you're not there on holiday!
You can't afford that!
You need to find another place!
"Okay, yeah, where?"
Drink rakia.
- He does not like.
You have to make it fast.
"Look at me, my friend."
"Look, like that."
"Do it, do it, and after that you will feel better."
You do not like it?
"- Yes, it's very good."
Then I drink it.
And the country is 'hello'.
"Belgium, your country, is 'hello'."
"Half and Half,  or..."
- Maybe.
Maybe.
And what...
What did you find out?
Is Turkey closer to Europe?
I think so.
I think  that...
- And US?
You do not want to.
"You want Turkey, right?"
"- No, well... well..."
But how?
And when?
- It depends...
We've heard these bullshit for centuries.
"Well, at least ten years, okay?"
And it never happened.
We are about to sneeze this exquisite Serbian pork.
"Lady Louise, a gift for you."
She's a little...
So you knew.
Yeah.
Wash me.
Wash me.
Make my body clean.
Maybe it won't come off... but wash me.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We'll call it even.
I was sleeping with a Japanese woman
for money on the side.
Now hit me.
"Hit me, too."
Hit me!
Here's your sushi delivery.
How much?
Please pay when you check out.
It's Kiriko Kashiwagi.
- No!
- Kiriko Kashiwagi.
You're under arrest.
What's going on?
Are you really police?
"Those handcuffs are fake, but we need to talk to you."
Where's Yasuo Ikezawa?
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.
"I'm not lying, we broke up ten years ago."
No way for me to know.
Why should I trust you?
It's been 15 years since that day.
"How are you, Captain?"
Am I intruding?
"Sure, it's after midnight."
Where are you?
In a hotel.
I'm out till tomorrow night.
On a leave.
Wasn't a jailbreak.
I gotta see you fast.
"Tonight, I can't."
You'll regret it.
"Meet me in 1 hr at ""Swann's""."
Same again?
"No, thanks."
Camille OK?
She's fine.
When did you buy this?
We'll talk cars later.
What's up?
Nice welcome!
You haven't seen me in 4 years.
Don't I rate a smile?
This is a favor for a pal inside.
You made me cross Paris for a lousy scam?
I got a hot tip.
You're a piece of shit.
What is it?
Heavy duty stuff.
Real hot tip.
Want it or not?
What's the deal?
Just stay with me.
"No, I'm good."
"I fixed up the guest room for you, but I thought maybe we'd go out to lunch first."
"I kinda just wanna crash, if that's cool."
Sure.
Sure.
It's cool.
Very cool.
Do you want me to show you where the room is?
- I'll find it.
- Yeah.
You can find it.
You're good like that.
He can find it.
I hope it's your daughter... who's gonna decide which home to put you in.
"Well, this is fun."
The two of us.
Getting a chance to talk and catch up... and shoot the breeze.
So how's school?
- Good.
- Oh.
Yeah?
"Well, you certainly have a lot to say..."
To someone.
- What?
- Nothing.
You know.
I text.
So I get it.
"Sorry, what did you say, mom?"
"You know, lol."
Omg.
Om-- you know what--g.
See you later.
Don't forget the meeting!
Try to be there!
What do you say?
The work is hard.
You have to get used to it.
I don't think it's that hard.
It's just getting used to it.
Try to make it to the meeting.
I'm very tired.
I'm asking you... as the organizer.
I'll see.
I'm counting on you.
"Founé, my thurible!"
"Founé, hand me the phone."
Good morning.
"Yes, it's me."
Is the boss in?
Let me speak to him.
"Hold on, I'll go and see."
Founé!
Put Sissoko on the phone.
Who is it?
Zangué?
What's the matter?
Are the workers meeting... with your permission?
Never!
This is Balla's idea.
Incredible!
I can't trust anybody.
Don't wait for me.
"Take Kariba or Drissa with you, and follow procedure."
-No!
Is it wrong?
.
-I called her because she's my friend!
-Because Bela is your ex!
I don't care!
What does it have to do with this?
"Remember this, you can't leave the house"
-if I'm not with you.
-What did you say?
.
I'm not leaving?
.
That's not going to happen!
What?
Are you smothering me now?
.
Is that it?
-Is that what you want to happen?
.
-No.
I'll make sure you're not cheating on me
"That's why wherever you will go, you'll have to bring me along!"
"If you want to know, fine!"
If you're always like that...
-Why?
What are you going to do?
.
-I'm really going to leave you!
-Give that to me!
Give it!
-What the--
"He'll probably be furious, but we're used to that."
Who's we?
"Oh, me and Pauline."
It's my boss.
That's who I've been sort of seeing.
You met him that day.
Oh.
I thought he was married.
"Well, yes."
That's been the complication.
The boss I met?
Mr Stanley?
Yes.
But he is married.
I heard him saying something about his wife.
They don't get on.
They're all very showjump-y.
Who are?
The wife and the daughters.
He's got daughters?
Yes.
Two.
They do dressage.
But you haven't had an affair with him?
"Well, yes."
What did you think you were doing?
To them?
What I was doing?
To their family.
You had no right.
He was somebody's husband and he was somebody's father.
"That's wrong, Enid."
I'll be in front of the store at 7. I'll wait for you!
I wasn't going to go back to the department store.
Yes!
Oi!
What are you doing!
?
She's dead!
That's him.
That must be him.
It's revenge because she told everyone about him peeping into her room.
Who?
Who the hell is he!
?
He's not here.
He must've run away.
Where the hell is he!
?
Please don't be silly.
What do you think you're doing with that gun?
Get your hands off!
Stop it!
Stop it!
There he is.
That's him.
That's the guy!
Tomorrow night at seven.
Just one more time.
I'm used to being disappointed.
Tomorrow night at seven...
I want to see her.
I want to meet her.
I heard that you'd finished.
'Course it does.
You bugger.
Mam!
Wait!
What did he say?
Who?
Him.
Nothing.
He said he'd given me a ball or something.
A ball?
He didn't say to come with him or anything?
To Canada?
No.
No.
"Because you're staying with me, aren't you?"
"Mam, can we play the record?"
No.
I told you.
But why?
Because I don't want to hear it!
Now fasten it up.
"You don't get it out, you don't show it anybody, and you don't tell anybody."
I mean it.
"She said, ""Pop in."""
She wants me to pop in.
"I'm not making this up, am I?"
"She wants me, Tubby Baker, to come and see her in her office."
"Got to mean something, hasn't it?"
Ooh.
"One, two."
And...
"# In this grove, in this grove"
So what's up?
Let me get at you.
You want my number?
"Yeah, I want it."
I want to take you out.
"I could treat you real good, you know?"
"Oh, word?"
Yeah.
(Whispering)
Trans what?
Transsexual.
"Oh, for..."
For real?
"Hold up, you know, that's cool, ma."
"So, like, it's... it's gone, right?"
"No, um..."
I still have a thing.
You real freaky with it?
What?
Like... you suck dick?
Um...
I mean...
"No, I'm sayin', like, you like that?"
You suck dick?
You don't even know my name.
"It's Vanessa, right?"
(Door closing)
(Man) What do we got here?
"' 95, two years grand larceny."
"'01, a year on arms possession, resisting arrest."
Last bid's a three out of five.
"Drugs, possession and selling."
Listen to this.
I'm really sorry.
"If you give me your number, I'll call ya and bring the money to ya."
I don't take I.O.U.'s from guys that I just met.
Forty bucks.
"Oh, wait."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
How 'bout this?
What's that?
"Hundred dollar five-team parlay- Bucs, Rams, Chargers, Seahawks, Lions."
From the Montecito.
Huh?
- No way the Rams cover.
You kidding?
- I owe you 40.
"This thing pays, you'll get two grand, man."
Come on.
Come on!
Give us a break.
Start betting on Korean Ping-Pong.
And get out of here.
"All right, fine."
All right.
It's me.
So what?
I don't know anything about fake chips.
You don't know anything about fake chips?
You cashed it in.
This isn't fair.
No.
"- It isn't fair, is it?"
- It wasn't even my chip.
"I-I'm just finally getting lucky, I guess."
Just lucky.
You guess.
Listen!
"There's no fix, okay?"
Is it an owner?
Huh?
No!
I swear!
"Fuck, it was just a streak, okay?"
"Look, okay, okay!"
I have a source!
I have a source.
It's reliable.
I can't explain it.
It could cause some serious problems.
Was it a doctor?
Tell me what they're doing to bring in the fix!
"No, it- it's nothing like that."
"Look, you wouldn't believe me if I told you."
Bullshit.
(GRUNTING)
Can't you just ride my bets?
Yeah.
"Just make the same bets I do and-I know what ""ride"" means."
(DOOR UNLOCKS)
You are such a piece of shit.
"I hope you enjoyed the peep show, Jasper!"
I'll... take that.
"- Finn, this is-"
- IVAN:
I was just leaving.
Yeah.
"Cigar, pal?"
"Oh, thanks, pal."
(COUGHING)
It's a cigar!
It's a real cigar!
"What did you think it was, Wilbur?"
W-What did I think it was?
"Oh, I..."
I thought it was a candy cigar.
My daddy always gave me candy cigars.
Candy cigar?
Yeah.
Did it taste anything like this?
Did it taste...
I'll see.
I'll wait.
I...
I'm not sure.
"Let's try again, Wilbur."
I don't think it's the same.
We must be positive.
Pal.
I feel awful.
I got some medicine that'll fix you right up.
How do like your Scotch?
Plain or with soda?
On the rocks.
On the rocks?
"Oh, on the rocks is what my daddy always says when he orders that nasty whiskey."
I can't make up my mind about you.
Let me feel your muscle.
It's all right.
All right.
"Okay, I'm gonna count to three, and you're gonna get out of here, okay?"
"-No, you're gonna hurt yourself."
-Don't have a choice.
One...
"-Okay, okay."
"-...two, three."
"Now go, go, go."
Ryan?
"Ryan, are you okay?"
"Yeah, yeah."
-You?
-Yeah.
"I'm fine, thanks to you."
"Hey, Ryan."
"Sorry I was all, ""Oh, my God,"" because usually, I'm very good in a crisis."
But I started thinking about if anything happened to you.
-I don't know what I'd do.
-It's okay.
We're both okay.
Grace under fire is important.
I don't want you to think I'm lacking in it.
We might encounter all sorts of crises when we're away together at college or--
"Oh, my God."
Is that blood?
I faint at the sight of blood.
"-Oh, no, no, no."
It's just glitter.
Okay.
-Taylor.
Taylor.
Call when you get tired of it.
Shit!
May your hands wither away!
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Nina's out, I... it's her mother."
"Right, Maria Vasilyevna."
See how it turned out!
And who are you?
Ghena?
From her work?
"I'll tell her, I will."
All right.
Mom!
"What is it, for God's sake?"
"Oh, my little fish!"
My honey!
I've missed you so much!
You've grown so big!
You know what I brought you?
There's a basket under your pillow...
"Grandma, why have you got such a big nose?"
Why big?
A regular nose.
I'm big and my nose is big.
It's interesting...
"The interesting, grandma, is around the corner to your left."
How did you like your granddaughter?
She's grown up!
They grow so fast.
"- Mom, get away."
- I'll show you 'get away'!
"Don't yell, I beg you!"
Come here.
I wish you wanted to go out.
I am out.
I don't live here.
"Oh, I adopted a cat."
I know.
You send me pictures.
I send them or I sent them once?
"- Oh, more than once."
- I think I'm going to name my cat Gadzookey.
You have a little situation there.
With your...
Oh.
I love him.
You should love a human.
I just don't want him to be one of those exes I have to see every few years.
You know?
He's making it really easy.
I hate that you think this is easy.
That's nice.
- Should I do anything?
"- No, no, no, just look that way."
There you go.
Smile.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
Think of something funny.
Nice.
There you go.
It's me.
Work it.
Work it.
"Classic, but not a comedy."
Get them here!
"Wait a minute, sir-500 coppers!"
Four hundred-just 400 a string!
Just 400 coppers a string!
Damn it!
Three hundred!
Two hundred!
I'm generous today!
Now I'm mad!
One hundred a string!
A hundred coppers!
?
Not even a hundred!
Take them free!
Don't leave!
Don't go!
They're free!
They're all free!
They don't cost a cent!
Come here and have some!
Come on-eat as much as you like!
Bastard!
What?
Why are you ruining my business?
You're trying to take my business away?
What do you want to do?
Me?
To beat you!
You'd beat someone!
?
What a hard bean curd!
Bean curd!
"- Yes sir, right away!"
"Back so soon, you're not dumb this time!"
What?
What happened?
Take it out!
What are you doing?
Fat Pat?
- Take him to toilet and get the 'Beast'!
- Yes Sir!
"Don't do that, I'm against violence!"
I'm against violence...!
"Boss, I can't find it!"
I don't believe!
Did he hide it there?
Not here...!
To hell with you...!
Fat Pig!
"- Boss, he calls you Fat Pig!"
- You want us to beat him up?
No need!
"I'll help him to this drink, and he'll curse no more."
There's no poison!
I don't want to take...
"Here you are, $1.00 please!"
What the hell do you want?
Want some water?
Alright?
Feeling better?
It's poison!
Damn it!
Couldn't find the American and the Jew's dead.
"And my half a million dollars too, oh hell!"
"OK, hurry up."
Come on.
Why did you leave the key in the car?
You look fine.
God loves you for a liar.
Daylight never saw such a ruin!
But you've put on weight.
You're as plump as a partridge.
You look good.
Blanche!
"Yes, you do, or I wouldn't say it."
But watch your figure.
Look at my figure.
Look at my figure.
"I haven't put on an ounce in ten years, Stella."
I weigh what I weighed... the summer you left Belle Reve...
- the summer...
"- Laura, come quickly."
What's wrong?
Internal bleeding and head injuries.
- How did it happen?
- A car accident.
"- Shit, I don't know if I can..."
"- Sure, you can."
You've got no choice.
Come here.
Hold this.
Swab.
Suck it up.
I can't see anything.
- We need more blood.
Ligature.
Ok.
Oh... you know you love it.
"Ooh, you like that?"
"Huh, what about here?"
"Oh, work it."
Work it.
You better tag me in all these photos.
"Ok, I like that."
Oh.
Hey.
"No, seriously."
I can't find Drew.
I'm sure he's just finishing getting ready.
"Seven, you ever think about marriage?"
Do I ever think about marriage?
"To who, you?"
No.
Never.
No.
"Do you ever think about, you know having a family."
Kids?
"Yeah, I mean I want to."
Do you ever think about marrying a guy?
Maybe.
If they ever make it legal.
Or if I ever move to Canada.
Right.
"What about you, Dale?"
Do you ever want to get married?
"Excuse me, Dale?"
Hi.
We're gonna close the front doors now.
"Yeah, Lila, she does."
That's good.
What's her name again?
Thelma Lou?
Cheryl Ann.
"Oh, that's right."
And you and Cheryl Ann have a little girl.
What's her name?
Bonnie.
How old is she?
Eight.
"You don't like talking with me about your family, do you?"
"No, Lila, I don't guess I do."
I don't blame you.
I got something for you.
Where you going?
"Don't shoot me, officer."
DALE:
What the hell are you doing now?
Can I turn on the light?
No.
I put it in here so it wouldn't get stale.
Can we leave this open so we can have some light?
This is our baby's birthday cake.
Here you go.
I don't want any.
Suit yourself.
It's good.
You should try some.
Today's his birthday?
No.
It's in September.
I got an MW today.
A Major Warning.
Because I called you at home?
- No.
Something else.
I'm sorry.
I'm used to it.
Besides.
I don't care.
I don't want to cause you trouble.
- Don't worry.
Promise me you'll call in case of a problem.
What would you do?
Rescue me by visiophone?
Yes.
I'd rescue you.
I love you.
That's ridiculous.
It's sincere.
- Not true.
I know what I'm feeling or not.
If you were in love.
If you loved me.
you'd go outside.
I can't.
Too bad then.
Wait.
Wait.
Listen...
It may be conceivable.
I may conceive that you come to my place.
That you come into my apartment.
- He is not much more than a cloud.
I'll come back to you.
I'll never see him again.
Just stop these silly heroics.
You have placed me in an impossible position.
All I have left is a show of strength.
"Besides, women like that sort of thing."
Are you insane?
Pretty dress.
"Are you ready, gentlemen?"
And... one.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
- This man has fainted!
- That man is wounded.
Too bad!
Help us lift him.
Wait!
Come back!
I knew it!
It's the frail one!
"Oh, my God!"
Is he dead?
I hope the damp hasn't killed him.
- Show us your finest room.
Ay yi yi...
Tu viste eso?
"Her daughter, son?"
"What are you doing, Angie?"
I'm getting ready for bed.
Don't you miss me?
"Enrique, please not now, I'm tired."
"Yeah, what you tired from?"
Life.
"Life, huh?"
I thought you were tired from going
With that new boyfriend of yours.
What are you talking about?
I don't got no boyfriend.
No?
No...
"what are you, deaf?"
"Don't lie to me, Angie."
I ain't fucking stupid.
"Look, I don't expect anybody to wait three years."
That ain't natural.
I was up north.
You had to do what you had to do.
But I'm home now.
I don't want to see no dudes.
I don't want to smell it.
That's it.
"If you want me, it can only be me."
Okay.
"You know I missed you, Enrique."
You sure?
"Of course, stupid."
I-I...
Did.
"You only dated him, what... twice?"
"Right, twice."
"So, on 50% of your dates, you slept with rob."
Or you... you could say
I only slept with him on half our dates.
Wow.
What?
Nothing.
I just...
I never thought of you as...
What?
Easy.
Easy?
"Well, you wouldn't sleep with me until our fifth date."
You were married.
So are we!
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Do not go there.
You categorically told me we were over.
Right.
"In fact, the night that rob and I..."
N-n-n-n...
I actually called and asked if you wanted me to cancel my date.
And what did you say?
"""Go."
"Go."""
"I meant ""go on a date,"" not ""go fuck him""!"
Oh...
God!
Why did you have to tell me?
"Left, right, face."
Forward.
Your brother was a good man.
"Yes, he was."
She won't get out of the car.
Oh...
Hey.
"Welcome home, Maggie."
"You know, I think it'll make you feel better to be with everyone."
We all miss him.
That led was not your fault.
And it's also not your fault that you survived and he didn't.
Get out of the car.
- Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.
- No.
No.
No.
"When we got back from Nam, we had a hard time too, but we got over it."
Out.
"- Take her home, Percy."
"- Come on, baby."
"It's okay, baby."
It's all right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"Why don't you, uh...?"
Why don't you lose that shirt?
Come on.
- Unh.
- Drop that belt.
Take your clothes off.
Want some coffee or something?
Let's sit here.
I saw Helen in the newspaper.
It was crazy.
Four guys were killed.
'You know something more than us?
-Do Not.
"No, they are keeping secret."
I stayed out of me to know that there is a killer where you live.
"How are you going, Mom?"
-Incredible!
I can not wait to get out here and fix my life.
You are halfway yet.
Need to complete the program.
I suppose.
I need.
And how are you?
How are they?
Have done well?
-They Are good.
Okay.
And the school then?
-Are You ... cool.
Dating?
"Oh, tell me."
What is her name?
Henning.
He treats you well?
Do not say anything to Helen and Svend.
-You Can leave.
-Are You good?
"Yes, yes."
Might be kind of awkward.
He's at a real-estate conference in D.C. But there'll be a lot of single guys.
So there will be plenty of chances for me to be awkward.
"Don't worry, I'll be there."
I'll talk you through it.
[PLATES SHATTERING]
"Okay, gotta go."
"Someone just dropped like 84,000 plates."
Maybe I'll see you there.
You're busy.
I shouldn't have called.
You called me.
"- Yup, good."
- Bye.
KEITH [ON TV]:
How...?
How do you work on it?
"Pretend I'm a girl, okay?"
I mean  pretend I'm her.
Amanda.
He's into me.
Awesome.
I knew it.
- Who's this now?
- Alex.
It's totally clear to me now.
He's Watts.
- He's what?
- From Some Kind of Wonderful.
I thought Mary Stuart Masterson was Watts.
- Yes.
- So why aren't you Watts?
(Rachel) You don't have to do this.
Call for backup.
They'll kill you.
John?
I'm Armant.
Where's the little girl?
"Well, how do I know you've actually got what I want?"
Thank you.
Okay.
Let the little girl go and I'll take you to it.
I'm scared.
"Listen, listen."
"I want you to go with Rachel, okay?"
"Yes, go with Rachel."
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Lord grant me the wisdom and the strength to do what must be done.
[bell tolling]
You gotta be shitting me.
It's inside there?
This little girl was right all along?
"Well, c'mon."
Let's go to church.
"Good afternoon, Father."
You look a little lost.
May I help you?
"I once was lost, but now I'm found."
[low beeping]
"Ah, what a beautiful sound."
[fast beeping]
Stop.
Fresco.
"Hold up, hold up."
I do something wrong?
Nah.
I'm saying I want the whole thing tonight.
Oh.
Wow.
You cool with that?
Yeah.
Yeah?
"I don't want to see shit, a'ight?"
You won't see nothing.
Okay.
Damn.
(Gasping)
Damn.
Can I ask you something?
What's up?
"Well, you know when we met,"
How you said you were gonna take me out?
Yeah.
"Well, how come you don't take me out?"
How come you only ask me to come to your room?
"What, you don't like coming over here?"
"No, of course I do."
"I'm just saying, like..."
How come we don't we go out?
"You know like, to the movies, or to eat?"
Cause that shit is whack.
I don't think its whack.
Whatever.
Doesn't matter.
I still know she doesn't hate you.
How?
I'm a daughter too.
Vi?
She left.
Where did she go?
To get more bullets.
"Listen carefully, Daisy."
"When she comes back,"
I need for you to be the one to put me down.
It's very important.
Why me?
"Cause you and me are friends, right?"
"- I guess, but..."
- Will you promise me that?
- I can't.
- I need you to promise me.
- But I can't.
- I need you to do this for me.
- I can't.
- I need you to do this for me!
"- No, I can't!"
"- Don't argue with me, April!"
- But I'm Daisy.
- Just don't argue with me girl!
You promise me.
Say it.
- I promise.
- You promise?
"I said I would, didn't I?"
I have something to show you.
"It's all right, mother."
I'm home now.
"Oh, yes, yes, I know, darling."
"No, I'm all right."
"Oh, my dear!"
"Hi, dads."
I'm here.
"Oh, son!"
That's a boy.
You all right?
"- Yeah, but I have to sleep."
Leave him alone.
"Oh, it's all right, Joe."
"You see Joe, Joe Krozac is his name-"
He brought me home.
"Didn't you, Joe?"
There you are.
"You got quite a ducking, didn't you, son?"
"Here, I'll do that."
"The last time it rained, we slept in a haystack."
"You should have been with us, dads."
It was fun.
I'll bet it was.
"You know, Joe tried to make a fire, and I showed him how."
The way you showed me.
"Didn't I, Joe?"
Let's get this coat off.
"You two must have had some experience, huh?"
Yes.
"Here are your pajamas, darling."
The ones you like...
How about a big glass of hot milk?
No.
Thank you. one of your friends is here to see you.
what's up?
bro.
But I don't think Victor likes you very much-- just the sense I'm getting.
don't sweat him.
It was him and Jason.
You shouldn't be thinking about that stuff right now.
Are you all right?
Do you need anything? please?
bro.
So when's your next fight?
It's tomorrow.
I'll be there.
Are you gonna be all right to come?
don't worry.
Just get ready.
all right?
okay?
man.
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I'll be all right.
Price.
I hope this isn't your fighter.
No.
This is Brandon.
Kyle.
- All right.
- Let's get going.
These boys came all the way down here from Dallas.
10 large.
Right.
You two could be perfect strangers.
"I think the one thing that we can agree on, today, is that you guys should be doing a lot better than just ""works."""
Pretty sure that's why you're here.
Oh.
That's it.
Great.
"Great job, everybody."
Thank you.
Lucy?
"Good day, sir."
I got room service for you.
I'm very sorry.
I didn't order that.
"I think your wife, she called me for you."
I'm...
This is just...
"Because I got a sunburn, 'cause it was..."
The sun was very strong today.
Yeah.
I know.
"This is good for sunburns, right?"
No.
Okay.
"It's good, yeah?"
It's good for sunburn?
"Okay, so I don't see anything."
See what?
There's nothing to see.
"Yeah, yeah, no, no, no."
It works great.
"Okay, I move now."
No.
There's a little bit more.

"Yeah, but why would you move here?"

Someday I'm gonna get out...
And I'll never come back...
- Right.
Good-bye now.
I'll be right there.
Four more lagers!
Two bottles of champagne.
"Well, well!"
A big spender!
"Hey, where is this guy?"
Just as I thought!
"Ah, who cares?"
Mr. Show-off!
All this wonderful champagne!
We only live once!
Cheers!
I told you:
I'm not going in.
I'm not dressed for it.
"Well, in that case ―"
"Unlike you, Mr. Fancy-Pants."
Franz isn't gonna outdo me.
Careful that his big spending doesn't land us in jail.
He's a rookie!
He's showing off for me.
Have a good time.
"Hey, kitten!"
Leave the whole box.
How much is it?
- Fifteen marks.
Wait a minute.
Here's 20 marks.
Keep the change.
Let's drink.
I'll watch over you.
You'll be safe.
Thank you.
(Grunting)
(Panting)
(Grunts)
What happened here?
It's where the final battle was.
Give me your hand.
What?
Your hand... it's cut.
Let me help you.
- No.
No.
It's fine.
"- No, it's not."
So now you're gonna be a gentleman?
"(Whispers) Giants can smell blood, and I'm always a gentleman."
(Cork pops)
(Cork thuds)
Ah!
Oh!
What the hell is that?
It's rum.
A bloody waste of it.
(Panting)
Here's the plan.
We wait for the giant to fall asleep.
"When he does, we'll sneak past him into his cave."
"It's where the treasures are, where the compass lies."
And then?
And then we run like hell.
- Okay.
- Okay?
All right.
Here's the first thing I need you to do.
"You gotta curl up like this, into a ball."
"Real tight, like that."
As tight as you can.
Okay?
That's gonna keep you warm.
I'm gonna see what that light is.
"I'll be back as fast as I can, all right?"
Like a ball.
Like that.
Now sit tight.
All right.
"- Ben, can you hear me?"
- Yeah.
- All right.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Did you find something?
Come on!
"Hello, is anybody there?"
It was blocked.
- I'm so cold.
"- That's all right, buddy."
Can you wiggle your toes?
No.
That's okay.
How about your fingers?
Can you move those?
There you go.
No.
(Clinking) Think!
Bob's been picking her up all week.
She's been humming stupid songs all around the house.
(Grunts) Last night she came home with green glitter in her hair.
Oh.
Stop it!
"That's right, Sue."
Mom's still in the play.
(Gasps)
What?
!
"You know, when you said lunch and bowling,"
I didn't realize you could do it all in one awesome place.
(Chuckles) Yeah.
"Hey, you're a pretty good bowler, too, you know?"
What did you end up with?
39.
39.
That's pretty good for a 7-year-old.
"No, I'm 10."
Oh.
"Well, you should be better then."
(Brakes squeal)
Okay.
Time for you to take the wheel.
(Shifts gears) What?
"Well, you gotta learn to drive some time, don't ya?"
"Um, don't I have to be 16?"
(Chuckles) Who says?
The state does.
I don't have a license.
Thank you.
-It sounds amazing.
-Thanks.
-I'll get the rest this week.
"-Yeah, no problem."
Good night.
Hello?
Yeah.
It's lan in the penthouse.
We need another bottle of Chateau Marmont.
Sorry.
Dom Perignon.
Cheers.
Thanks.
I think it's more comfortable inside.
I think it's one of the best records I've done.
I think it's the best record you've done too.
"I didn't say ""the best."""
"-She said the best, didn't she?"
"-I thought she said ""the last."""
You see?
You saved the best for last.
I know it's not the last.
"No, don't go."
Don't go.
-You should get some sleep.
"-No, we never sleep."
Why have you got your clothes on?
-What are you talking about?
-You look so much better with them off.
Come here.
We've been entertaining you for a while so why don't you entertain us?
"Phew, it smells."
It's some kind of a gas.
Come on.
You OK now?
"Yes, thank you."
This is some kind of science place.
- How'd you get here?
- It was Tony.
He was here.
I saw something!
What was it?
It's where Tony is.
I'm sure of it!
"A big, round shape."
A doughnut!
He's eating a doughnut.
No way!
Is it like a ball?
A great big ball?
- Yes.
- I know where he is.
Let's go!
"Hurry, let's go."
"Oh, thank you."
And thanks for everything.
"Come on, let's go."
We are about to make scientific history.
"And some money, too, I hope."
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.
It's a red light on the cooling system.
It must be a circuit breaker.
Restart the system.
"Tell him he's got to call me, ok?"
"As soon as you talk to him, he's got to call me. lt's important."
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
-Take this. lt's a couple thousand.
"-Thanks, Jimmy."
"Don't worry, everything will be all right."
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?
Pick out a few for yourself.
-For my mom.
"-Yeah, whatever."
Not here. ln the store on the corner.
"It's swag, so I got it down on the corner."
"Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you."
-Thanks.
-Don't worry.
-l'll try.
-He's got to call me.
Over here?
Right down there.
"It's over there, right on the corner."
"Yeah, it's over there."
Right there.
No!
Go ahead!
It's right in there!
"No, Jimmy!"
I'm in a hurry!
My mom's watching the kids!
I gotta get home!
I'll come back later!
"- No, because it happened before I knew him."
- Oh.
- So he didn't think of telling me.
- All right.
- But I was angry.
All right.
Down here - There are a lot of pictures over here.
- Right in the front.
"- Oh, upstairs?"
- I think so.
- Not here?
No.
"- No, not here."
- All right.
The front of the building - in the front.
Hmm.
"Well, do you know which way, Ida?"
Maybe over there?
I'm not sure.
- I don't know.
All I know is that when you come in.
- This is the front entrance here.
- It has to be here.
- So let's have a look.
"Ida, there's no pictures here."
"- Well, it is somewhere here."
"- Okay, let's turn around."
- Yeah.
- Let's turn around.
- Yeah.
- There's one more place.
- Okay.
Concentrate.
Pardonme.
Can I point out your heart rate just increased?
Yeah.
"Well, it should have cos there's a huge crazy spider."
You see a spider?
- You don't... you don't see that?
- No.
Don't...
Don't walk.
Don't...
Holy shit!
"Tough guy like you, scared of spiders."
"Yeah, I'm just not fond of them."
It's worked out you're an arachnophobe quickly.
It's probing for weak spots.
God damn it.
Fucker!
Yeah!
Um...
Okay.
"Yeah, well, yeah."
Whole lot more realistic than the gopher game.
It's good.
It's good graphics.
"It's good, uh..."
Yeah.
Weak sauce.
- What is it?
- Just...
Nothing.
Nothing.
(laughter)
- Fuck?
What the fuck?
How did you do that?
- I didn't do that.
It just happened.
"- Come on, what do you think--"
- Don't fucking touch me.
"Now, just tell me how you did it."
How the fuck did you do that?
Horace:
"Hey, it's a trick."
Horace Sr:
"Tell him it's a trick, please."
Horace:
It's a trick.
- I don't know any tricks.
I just watch nature happen.
- Nature?
You fucking freak!
What?
"My eyes didn't see that, all right?"
What did you do?
What happened?
"- It's all right, Pete, it's a trick."
He's doing-- Show him the trick.
- I don't know.
Horace:
Show him the trick or we need you to go.
- I don't know.
Here.
(glass breaking)
"Now, if you come back to this town,"
I'll know it.
And I'll get you.
Understand?
"(STUTTERING) Oh, yes, sir."
"Oh, I won't come back to this town, honest."
"As a matter of fact, I'm going home today."
Tout de suite.
"Here, let me..."
Let me show you.
"You see, here's my... my fare, $26.40, to Blitzen, Washington."
"Oh, man."
"Oh, be careful, bleeding."
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
I'm going to get the very first train home.
"I swear, honest, so..."
"So, goodbye."
Au revoir.
Remember me to the little woman.
(TITTERING)
"(STUTTERING) Goodbye, man."
Nice...
Nice going.
Let's have the diamond.
Here you are.
"It's only bubblegum, stupid."
But it was in his pocket.
I thought...
"Oh, he's still got it on him."
"Well, you can get it back."
You know where he's going.
MAN 1 ON PA:
You know the Bowlmor Lanes?
Okay.
I'll see you there in a while.

"Well, let me cancel this."
I'll go with you.
- I'll take Martinez.
"- Andy, it's no problem."
"Don't worry, I'll take him."
Those guys who took off that Vietnam vet?
He's crippled.
They left him lying there.

Okay.
You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

I'll see you later.
HEYWOOD:
John Kelly?
Stan Heywood.
"Sit down, Stan."
Why did you pick this place to meet?
"Well, I wanted a place you'd be familiar with."
"- Can I get some coffee, please?"
WAITRESS:
Sure.
- Thank you.
WAITRESS:
He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hyo-jin?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
It's already there?
Let me ask you one thing.
What is your true form?
What do you think is my true form?
The devil.
You're the devil.
Whoa.
Yikes.
Good luck walking that one off.
"Noah, buddy."
Hey.
Can you hear us?
"Man, you think he knows we're here?"
"Well, I hope so."
You know how much I hate doing nice things for people if no one sees.
Oh.
Hey.
I put that there.
He stole my wink.
Every time.
"Well, I guess I better do it again."
Whoa.
Hey.
Ah...
"Well, if you want to get credit, man, let's sign his cast and get up out of here."
"Ooh, ooh."
You know what we should do?
"We should sign it all over, with different dates, and then he'll think we came back a bunch of times."
What?
"Oh, hi."
Who are you?
Hey.
"Um, we're Noah's friends, Ben and Fitz."
- We came a really long way to visit.
- Mm-hmm.
"Oh, that is so sweet and thoughtful."
It is.
Isn't it?
I found it.
It's on the floor.
You should be nicer.
"Eat a D, Nancy."
Sorry about that.
"Dude, that was so embarrassing, man."
"Dude, we suck."
Hey.
I took it right out before I gave it back.
"I knew we had it, man!"
- Shh!
"- Way to go, dude."
"Ooh, gets you all..."
"adrenaline, endorphins."
- I know.
- It's like a drug.
I know.
"Hey, you think this is how she felt when she took us?"
"I mean, what if we don't even recognize her?"
She might not recognize us.
"We need to get cleaned up, man."
We're less than an hour away.
"Going out for a few hours, Viv."
- See you later.
"- Okay, have good day."
- Good.
You're still here.
"- Hello, Mr. Heller."
"I almost done and, get out of here."
I go now.
"No, stay."
Please.
So why should I care?
Fuck.
-What?
"-He missed the punch, fucked up--"
"Mickey, could you keep that to yourself next time, let him play through?"
Let me talk to him.
Sorry.
Yeah.
"It's not there, but that's a direction."
-It's okay?
-Yeah.
We'll finesse it in the mix.
We'll make it work.
What do you think?
-Truthfully?
"-No, lie to me."
"Yeah, truthfully."
I'm not feeling it.
You're not feeling it.
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.
Don't apologize.
Just tell me what you mean.
"I don't know what I mean, exactly."
I just....
"I mean, l--"
I guess it's just not pulling me in.
Or it feels like it's not pulling them in exactly....
Or enough.
I don't know.
They don't seem inspired.
Inspired?
I'm fine.
"Grey, what are you doing?"
"If you sleep with me, you lunch with me."
New rule.
"You let interns sit with you at lunch, dr."
Sloan?
That is so cool.
"Oh, you want to go halfsies with me on that cookie?"
"Uh, what are you gonna trade me for it, huh?"
"You guys, they have Tater Tots!"
I have to go.
Mark.
Mrs. Shepherd.
- You've been avoiding me.
- What?
No.
You have that same guilty look on your face as you did when you were 10 years old.
And you put Derek's favorite frog into the microwave.
"I never pressed ""Start""."
What's going on?
I'm sleeping with her.
"Oh, Mark!"
Not again.
- How could you?
"- No, no."
"No, not Meredith."
"God, no."
Meredith's little sister.
Which one is she?
"The, uh, the... one with the juice box."
Are my new organs here yet?
"Mm, not yet."
Starting to see the light?
I'll give you three days.
"Get out, or you'll end up like your goddamned dog."
Translate.
Translate what I said.
How long has it been like this?
Just a few days.
So?
The symptoms- they're the same as the others'.
There's gotta be an explanation for what she has.
They say they don't know.
What is it?
Oh God!
Who the fuck did this?
What?
!
You okay?
Get your husband.
Who did this?
Who the fuck did this?
Jong-gu!
Jong-gu!
What's the matter!
Does he drink a lot?
It's nothing to worry about.
I'll take the needles out in 20 minutes.
Cut back on the drinking.
Yeah.
It's started.
You better brace yourself.
What I said the other day-we'll do it tomorrow.
Where is Hyo-jin?
I'm working on it!
"Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster."
Ah...
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
"Just get ready to run, whatever happens to me."
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
Damn it!
Don't you leave me down here by myself!
Indy!
Here we go!
Get ready!
"Indy, the torch is going out!"
Indy?
Marion!
Look.
Look.
They're going to fly it out of here.
"When that Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on the plane."
"Ah, monsieur, let us toast our success in the desert."
To the Ark.
When we are very far from here.
That will do.
"Hey, you now.. come here!"
Come here!
Indy!
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!
Look out!
"Oh, my God."
Marion.
These good people want to see me fuck you now.
No!
"We're gonna go away, We're gonna go away."
We're going to Berlin.
Right after you fuck me.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Berlin.
"Help me hold her down, she likes it."
It's Ok.
"It's Ok baby,"
No!
You'll die Adrian!
Kill me baby!
Kill me baby!
No!
What have we done?
Wait a minute.
We think clearly this cannot be explained.
It's easy to explain.
You wanna know who and what I am?
I'm a killer.
I kill with my cunt.
You can write about it... in Midnight Magazine.
Or National Enquirer.
It's gonna be a new sensation.
You wanted to know where I'm from?
I'm from connecticut.
Mayflower stock.
I was taught that my prince would come.
Right!
Right!
isn't it better to open the bag and check?
Right!
- No!
Now it's not about the bomb exploding!
It's about my honour!
Now until the bomb doesn't explode..
..Give me the gun!
Hey!
- Give me the gun!
Give me the gun!
Otherwise I will shoot!
Give me the gun!
- Give the gun!
Otherwise he will shoot himself!
Please!
Give the gun!
- Quiet!
You don't say anything!
I will explode you before the bomb explodes!
"Albert, come here!"
- Fine..
I am normal with you!
Go and buy two batteries from the shop.
Go.
I don't have change.
Change!
I will give you.
But bring it quickly.
Go.
Go.
- No.
"You're doing the right thing, man."
- Send a postcard?
- Sure.
Call me.
Fly's down.
Honey.
Michael's coming over.
- You told him I was here?
- He knew.
"Come on, Mom."
"Jenna, sweetheart, look, I know."
"I know it hurts like hell and I am sorry, I really am."
"But you know, two days ago you told me these things happen..."
"You and Daddy have been together 30 years, Mom."
We aren't even married yet and he's already cheating on me.
I know.
I know.
"And I really don't need you to defend him right now, okay?"
I'm not.
There's nothing to defend.
It's despicable.
He did an awful thing.
"It's not an awful thing, Mom."
It's an unforgivable thing.
Unforgivable?
What do you want?
- I just want to talk to you!
- Get out of here!
It's over!
- Jenna?
- You hear me?
It's a yellow school bus.
"I heard it on the radio, but I ain't seen no school bus."
Thank you.
"You kids, now, give me this."
"All right, get in back."
Stay back there.
You stay up here.
Leave your brother alone.
- Give me that.
"- Excuse me, sir."
What do you want?
I'm looking for a yellow bus.
"All right, give me that squirt gun."
"Look, all I'm looking to do is get out of here."
- Get up in the front.
- Thank you.
"Yellow school bus, have you seen one?"
Thank you.
Are you sure you didn't see a school bus?
"Okay, I'll talk to you later."
- Nothing.
- Me neither.
Tapia Park's just over the hill.
Let's check that out.
There it is.
- What's wrong?
"- Well, that baby food is poisoned."
L.A. 15-7 Mary 4.
Code 33.
Attention all units.
Code 33.
All frequencies clear.
This sucker's got a lot of symptoms.
"No shissh, Sherlock."
Good luck faking the goiter.
Goiter?
"Oh, my God."
That's why they wanted to see my neck.
"Oh, good lord."
Ooh.
- It worked.
- Yay.
"She says she loves you and she's sorry and-- oh, she's sending you a picture."
Yes.
Perky.
Just erase it.
He's coming.
Done.
"Hey, will."
We found your phone.
"Oh, awesome, thanks."
"Oh, no."
"What, is something wrong?"
"It's just this girl, Stephanie,"
I have to break up with.
What?
She's kind of psycho and we dated a couple months.
Now she thinks we're engaged.
"Yeah, because you proposed to her."
Were you spying on my phone?
Ugh...
"Oh, honey, yes."
And that's how I found out you were engaged.
And I went crazy so I texted back.
Hey.
Is this from Vimy Ridge?
It is.
Did you shoot Germans in it?
Say again.
Did you shoot Germans in it?
Occasionally.
I can let myself in.
Mam might be asleep.
I'll just see you in.
What's this?
Herbert Kirkby.
From the choir.
Has he done something wrong?
"No, no."
"With it being late, I thought I'd see him to the door."
Right.
Yes.
"Very good, then."
"Baker did very well, as they all did."
The concert.
"He killed Germans in this, Mam."
Very nice.
"You go in, Baker, you chump."
"Sorry you missed it, Mrs Baker."
You'll perhaps manage for a future occasion.
Right.
"You won't be too cold, will you?"
No.
We're in the sun.
"We won't be sitting long, will we?"
"Now, lunch."
"But we haven't the book, have we?"
"And I don't suppose you know it from memory, do you?"
I know.
I know what we like.
You must sing for me.
No.
"Oh, no, not that."
- Why not?
- Not that.
Not in good voice?
"- It isn't that, sir, but..."
- But it's such a pretty song.
"- Please, not tonight."
- Yes.
Sing it gaily.
- I can't!
"Truly, I can't!"
- Sing it with deep compassion then.
Or loving kindness even.
"- Sing it moodily, sing it with..."
- I can't!
You hear me?
Sing it!
Sing it!
Smile when you sing!
Be happy!
Be gay!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
Can't you see it's all wrong?
You're my girlfriend!
And you're my best friend.
"- Tony, I love her."
"- No, you don't."
"OK, maybe I don't."
He loves Cassie.
And you love me.
That works.
- We work.
- Why now?
It's too late.
"It's always been there, Michelle."
It just took a while.
I need you.
You can't have her.
It's wrong.
It's wrong.
That's all I'm trying to say.
"Everything's gonna be all right, Cass."

"Effy, 100% success."
My art coursework.
It's on the subject of emotion and you seem quite emotional.
So you can do it for me.
I'm Pandora.
I'm new.
Tell him I've discovered the power of the pussy.
And?
I'll sort out your fucking soap opera.
"And that, ladies, is why Monet was shit."
"Pilaf-sama, the boat's taking on water."
So row with all you've got.
"One, two."
"Pilaf-sama, it's no use."
"Okay, okay."
Come to the front.
Pilaf-sama...
"Don't cry, Mai..."
Easy for you to say.
"Don't cry, Siu."
"If we can just get the Dragon Balls, we can do whatever we want."
But we didn't even see them.
Are the seven Dragon Balls really even there?
"Mai, trust me."
They're on that ship.
P-Pilaf-sama.
Huh?
What?
Let's get out of here.
"How'd you like that, you dumb shark?"
.
"Pilaf-sama, we made it."
I thought I was going to die...
You two have done well.
Hey.
What're you doing?
Hey.
Climb this.
"You have my thanks, children."
What were you doing down there?
We're here for the Dra drama serial we're shooting.
Where're your cameras?
"You can't phone him, but he can phone you."
My number's changed.
Can you give him the new one?
Of course.
Thank you.
Great.
You should remember that visitor's days are Saturday and Sunday.
But it's the intern who has to request the visit.
"If he doesn't want to see you, we can't do anything."
He'll want to see me.
"By the way, we don't have inmates here, we have..."
I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.
"We don't have inmates here, we have interns."
"Goodbye, and thank you."
627...
Wait.
... 9 6... ... 6 1... .
... o 9.
"No, 9."
Fuck.
627...
Hello?
"Marco, is that you?"
"Yes, Benigno."
It's great to hear you.
I've requested your visit.
I'll see you Saturday.
All right.
Where are you?
Outside the clinic.
Dr. Vega told me everything.
Only women can make us feel that way.
She dumped you?
It's a bit more complicated than that.
Figures.
It's always complicated with them.
I say if they make you suffer.
they don't deserve you.
I wasn't in love anyway.
Then.
You'll forget her soon enough.
- I guess.
Don't let it get you down.
Have some fun.
Go to...
I mean.
Do...
I don't know.
what you enjoy doing.
Yes.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
At your service.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Welcome to Sextoon.
Do you want to compose a new...
- No.
Do you want to call your...
- Yes.
Hello.
Thomas.
I'm happy to see you.
That was just an accident.
Come on.
Cheers.
- Straight As!
How does it feel?
- OK.
The best in the country.
"The minister of education says hi, by the way."
Don't you ever get laid?
- Of course I do.
- What now?
I'm going to do law at Harvard.
- I'II visit.
- Are we partying or what?
- I'm not sure about that.
- It's only X. Total love drug.
- We need love.
- I can't swallow pills.
- Just for fun.
"- What about you, kiddo?"
"Alex, isn't it tough always being daddy's boy?"
He's right.
You're such a girl.
Is it because your dad's a high court judge?
All right.
"- Welcome to the club, kiddo."
- He's doing it!
Cool!
Mind out.
Is he dead?
"Wake up, Alexander!"
Hi.
- What?
"It means that when you're in love, you're blind."
Ow!
"- Do you like life here, Anna?"
"- Yes, Paris is a big break for me."
That's not what I asked.
Show me your finger.
(sensual piano and flute music with female choir)
Don't be afraid.
(music starts building up)
"(music stops, Anna breathing heavily)"
"Just when I think it's over between us,   he's back in my face."
And I can't say no.
I've got to stay out of that crap.
"It's gotta be fun, for Christ's sake."
Right?
"It's gotta be fun, right?"
"It's gotta be fun, right?"
Fun's OK.
- Maybe fun's not enough anymore.
- You're a romantic!
So that's why!
I've met romantics before.
She's got to be special.
- She is.
- So there is someone.
I knew it.
Who is she?
- You know her.
- I know her?
"Oh, my God!"
It's Anna.
Not anymore.
You know why;
"Maybe you better not talk about it now, Doc."
Got to-- l'll tell you why.
Lutie.
I can say it now.
Lutie.
"Wouldn't let anybody speak her name, would you, Jim;"
But you gotta humor me.
"Last wish, you know."
All Lutie needed was a little help from you.
She had better coming than she got.
She never forgot her children.
She was all right.
And you sent her away twice.
Your fault.
"That's right, yours."
"People don't tell you that much, do they, Jim;"
Jim.
Jim.
You hear me;
"Yes, Doc. I hear you."
"You, you'll never change."
You still got that same look in your eyes.
"No, you'll never change."
The Doc.
"Out of his head, I guess, Jim."
"No, he was right."
Just right.
"He's gone, gentlemen."
"Colonel Brewton, I had no idea."
-Are you sure;
"- No, I'll walk."
- As you wish.
- How much?
450 francs.
"- No, keep it."
Good evening.
- Thank you.
"Say, Sir..."
I think your walk might be on the long side.
- On the long side?
"- Yes, it's quite far."
"- Come on, get in."
Tonight you get to ride for free.
"- Ah, thanks!"
"No, not back there."
"Up front, next to me!"
Thanks a lot!
- Who is it?
"- Me, Andrea."
- Hold on.
"Listen, Andrea..."
"It would be better if you went to sleep in Mimì's room, she's not feeling well."
What's all this about?
You gave me permission...
"- No, no..."
- Now you send me to sleep alone?
She really doesn't feel well.
I've made your bed in there.
- What happened?
"No, because..."
- She's just fallen asleep.
"But, I didn't do anything..."
- Who is it?
- Huh?
Nothing.
"Sorry, not here."
It's really not there?
"No, I looked everywhere."
"Well, could you see me down here for a second?"
Me?
Why?
Only for a little while.
I just want to buy you a nice meal.
"Alright, I'll be right down."
- Okay.
- Okay.
Where are you going?
Who was it?
It's Sunhee.
She wants to see me.
Why?
I don't know.
I'll be back soon.
Take your cellphone.
What's she got to say?
"Yeah, I have my phone."
When did you arrive here?
You saw me yesterday morning.
Sure my wallet's not there?
Why do you make me repeat the same answer?
I'm sorry.
Something very important to me is in there.
You wanted to see me because of that?
Not at all.
I'm his uncle!
Jong-gu!
"Heung-guk, how could you do this?"
Sergeant.
"Did it with this, I guess."
"Stabbed him, like, 20 times?"
Holy shit.
What's that?
Looks like the body was moved here after the murder.
What a mess.
That's Cho-the husband?
Looks that way.
I'll be damned.
And the kid?
We took him to a relative
Why'd he do it?
"I don't smell booze on him, but he's not talking."
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?
What the hell happened?
"How's it going, Sergeant?"
I'm his uncle!
Let go of me!
Rotten bastard.
Couldn't he use GPS?
Why do I have to take him?
Ain't that it?
Get the wire cutters.
Pull it back.
What's that stink?
So.
Cho was killed here.
–I know.
–When can I see them?
–Now?
I got to finish up somethin' first.
I'll be right there.
–Okay.
–Okay.
Looks like he's making a deposit.
"Yeah, you gotta love good intel."
Stay here.
Watch my back.
This is for my boy down the street.
Fully automatic.
You know what I get for those on the street?
Drop it!
Drop it!
Drop it!
Fingers interlaced!
Palms on the back of your head.
"Now, asshole!"
"Come on, man!"
Let's move!
Let's move!
–Vic!
–Stay back!
–Vic!
You been hit?
–I'm all right.
Get out of here.
–I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
–Just get out of here.
"–No, no, I'm not ditching you, man."
- Hi.
"- Hi, dear."
"- Hi, Emily."
"- Hi, Jer."
Come on in.
"Oh, hi, Howard."
Bob.
Happy birthday.
Here.
It's a cake.
"Well, I can only eat it if it's made out of water."
"Well, it almost is."
"Uh, let's see."
"It's made out of, your lettuce, bean sprouts, your ground carrots."
Sounds delicious.
"Well, we don't know, Bob."
Nobody's ever eaten one.
- Let me put it in the kitchen.
"- Yeah, and I'll make us all a drink."
"Oh, Thank you, Howard."
"Gee, if I'd have known it was gonna be formal, I'd have worn my cummerbund."
Go ahead.
Open her right up.
- What do you guys want to drink?
"- Scotch for me, Howard."
"- Uh, I'll have a glass of wine."
- Me too.
"- Uh, Bob?"
- What the heck?
It's my birthday.
Uh-
"Give me a glass of water, and... drop a ice cube in it for flavor."
I see.
I see.
"Boy, today was so exhausting."
I had a really terrible client come.
Have a seat.
"Sorry, I'm sure you don't want to hear me complain."
"You're done with work, right?"
Wanna come over?
Maybe not... tonight.
"Oh, why?"
"Oh right, sorry..."
I haven't been giving you spending money lately.
What's wrong?
Take it.
I just... can't do this tonight.
Do you hate me now?
Why are you still here?
I got kind of hungry...
Let's order some sushi.
Hello.
I'm going to miss you.
Going to room 310.
Go ahead.
It's my last day.
Last day?
I'm going home to Korea.
"Here, I want you to have this."
Wait.
May I open it?
"You'll work at a top hotel, right?"
Right...
Then you'll need a bow tie.
What's going on?
I'd really rather not discuss it.
Not discuss what?
When a person says he'd really rather not discuss it...
Is it about the show?
No.
"So, then...?"
"Believe it or not, some things are not your concern."
"Well, tell me what it is, and I'll see if I agree."
"Is it, like, something serious?"
I'm not having this conversation.
"Yeah, we are."
Come on.
I care.
Tell me.
No!
"Okay, you're starting to freak me out."
"Is it, like, cancer?"
"No, it is not cancer."
"Well, I don't know."
Is it... is it bev?
Does she have...
No.
No one has cancer!
Ed has cancer.
What?
It's okay.
You didn't know.
Jesus Christ.
What is going on?
She slept with rob.
Who?
Hi.
Hi.
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
You all right?
"I'm fine, Jason."
I'm watching the show.
"We do have to get back before sunrise, though."
Let's get a move on.
"I don't think that's a good idea, Jason."
"Come on, hon."
Let's go.
We're very close.
"Jason, I'm not going anywhere."
"It pains me to say this, but I gotta let you go."
I love you.
But we cannot do this to each other anymore.
It's over.
It's over.
"Daddy, wait."
I was wrong.
I don't want to lose you.
I'll go back to the other side.
No.
Then you...
"You,d be doing what I did."
Trying to be something that you're not.
You're 20.
Go be 20.
All right?
I will not lose you.
All right?
I cannot lose you.
Where's Sefton?
I don't know.
- He wouldn't be at the kommandant's?
"-I don't know, I told you."
What did the Krauts trade him for the radio?
I don't know.
- Why don't we look in these footlockers?
-No.
"Come on, you stooge."
Hand over them keys.
I haven't got any keys.
"- Okay, then I'll get me a key."
-Ow.
- Hey!
-Okay.
Hoffy?
- Okay.
"-Hey, wait a minute."
"Hey, don't."
Sefton will get mad.
Of all the hoarding cruds.
"Looks like Macy's basement, don't it?"
That kid's richer than my mother.
"Oh, shut up!"
For crying out loud.
What would he be doing with these?
Suppose you ask me.
"Go on, ask me."
Because I got the goods on Mr. Sefton.
Because this time he didn't shake me.
Take a look for yourself.
It'll curdle your guts.
I'd like to be brought back to the barracks.
I want to be with my brothers.
We shoot the tires.
Take out the guards.
"With machine guns, we won't make it 50 feet."
He's right.
We don't have the gunpower.
Hey!
Steady.
"You all right, mate?"
Ah!
Eric!
- Did you see that?
- Poor bastard.
I don't think the guards did.
Eric!
Eric!
Come on!
Oy!
You bloody goon!
"- Whoa, whoa!"
- You see what you did?
- You did this to him!
- Alfred!
What the bloody hell!
He was my brother!
You did this to him!
Shut your mouth!
"You make one more sound, I shoot you right there!"
Get back to work.
Schweinhund.
Anybody else have a problem?
"I thought so, too."
- What else do you do?
- I'm a nurse.
I'm a nurse.
I'm better at nursing...
- Better?
- Better than at acting.
God!
I can't believe I'm in such a foul mood.
"Listen, you don't have to talk to me."
I just didn't want to be rude.
"Hey, welcome."
I can't find it.
"Oh, God, where are we?"
Go back the way we came.
Take the next right.
Are you OK?
Turn left in the village.
"Well, thanks."
Are you OK?
I'll be OK.
Thanks.
Wait a second.
Do you like to go to the movies?
Not really.
- Which movie do I have to see?
- Anything you like.
They're free tickets.
Thanks.
Amen.
"Are we getting a new horse, Dad?"
We're not going to make it.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
"Hey, I got it."
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
Which dude?
- That dude?
- Yeah.
No way.
He'd kick my ass.
True that.
"- This is so hard, you know?"
- Yeah.
I know.
It's simple.
"If you ask a cop if he's a cop, he's, like, obligated to tell you."
It's in the Constitution.
Constitution of America?
So go ahead and ask.
- You a cop?
"- No, no."
Not like that.
"Ask it, like, official."
Are you a police officer?
"No, I am not a police officer."
"Okay, then."
Hundred and seventy-five for a teenth.
"The price is the price, yo."
All right.
There you go.
Enjoy.
"Thanks, man."
Albuquerque Police!
- I'm coming.
- Look after Gucci.
- But you're way till Sunday!
I've got Robbie Williams tonight.
Helene says Gucci can't be left on her own.
She gets scared.
Just do it.
Then you and I can do something nice next weekend.
Can we go to mum's?
It's her birthday.
- You know I can't.
- Why not?
You know my lawyer says we mustn't see each other.
But call me.
"- Hi, Yugo Danny."
- Fuck off.
- I thought the cops had got you.
- I need your blow.
Where the hell is that coke?
About fucking time.
- What's that?
- Sherbet.
What do you think?
My blow comes in one big bag.
There were problems.
That's not 20 grams.
"As I said, problems."
You get the rest tomorrow.
No.
I want it now.
Or you give back my card.
This is Alexander's.
The oldest and the ugliest.
You should beat me.
If you want...
-Beat her?
"-Come on, do it!"
"Move the lights, pay attention!"
"Get out of the way, quicly, quickly!"
Yeah you want me to hate you?
Whatever you want I'll do it.
I'm so ugly and you're so beautiful I think you should hit me.
"C'mon, hit me."
"Hit me,"
"You ugly old whore, you make me sick."
Cunt!
Let me see your beautiful cock.
And let me do it for you baby.
I'll do it and you could hit me if I do it wrong.
Beg for it.
You asked for it.
Let me see your beautiful cock.
"Come on baby, I'll do it good."
Come on.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
I can't.
Do it!
Do it!
I can't.
Beg for it.
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself.
"And something sweet, like a cookie or a piece of candy."
- And a CD player.
- And a Cody Chesnutt CD.
I don't have that CD.
Uh-oh.
That's ourfavorite music.
So I guess we can't do it.
"Oh, but look."
- I have it.
- Go get the stuff.
"Don't forget the towel, the washcloths or the cookie."
- Or candy.
- Or candy.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- Hey.
Ready to do this?
- I am.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
"- Yeah, we're good."
"Okay, here are the rules."
You have to keep this pillow on your face.
You can't watch us.
- Okay.
- You can't touch us.
You can't touch our heads.
And we're not going to touch each other.
"And you have to tell us when you're going to ""scooch."""
- Okay.
"- So, take off your pants."
A bullet proof vest!
Who's the best cop now?
"- Come on, Jimmy!"
Me and you!
- Go on.
"Run, you son of a bitch."
Tommy!
I just want to talk to you!
"Tommy, what are you making me chase you for?"
"Come on, are you mad at me?"
I just shot my dad.
"Call me, Tommy."
"No, I'll call you."
- Get these handcuffs off me.
- Why are you handcuffed?
Where's Detillo?
- He's been shot!
Get off!
- I'm not getting off.
"Hardy, you son of a bitch!"
Get away from me!
You could never beat me!
You like to jump off bridges.
Who's the best cop now?
- Take these handcuffs off me.
- Get some handcuff keys.
- Do you want to take a shot at me?
- No.
"It wouldn't do any good, Eddie."
On the other hand...
Hardy!
You're okay.
"Oh, no."
"Oh, no, no."
I understand.
"You're just nervous and jumpy, that's all."
"- Yes, sir."
"- Yes, yes."
You have that cooped-up feeling.
Yes.
"You do understand, don't you?"
"- Yes, yes."
"- Well, then..."
"Well, now, where would we go?"
We might go to Albert Hall.
Yes.
And hear a symphony.
"Albert Hall, sir?"
"Well, I sort of hoped that..."
What makes you say...?
"So you'd like to go out, huh?"
"Yes, sir."
I'll go and put my things on.
Don't hurry.
Because we're not going.
Sir?
The bill is ever so good right here.
"Now, let's see, what shall we do?"
We could play cards.
"But you're probably tired of cards, aren't you?"
You might read to me.
Yes.
Yes.
Milton's Paradise Lost would be nice.
"I hardly think she'd have the nerve to appear, let alone testify."
Have you heard what happened?
I was there.
I saw it.
You...
You mean you saw the man?
Did I?
"He was very suave, sophisticated."
A man of the world.
"You know, Nancy never had a chance."
"Well, that explains everything."
I'll let you see for yourself.

A barrette.
"Oh, stop it, Carrie."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop and you were hiding the bag from me.
"Ok, fine."
I'm sorry.
"Oh, man, I can't believe this."
"At most I thought I was, like, the biggest size at Macy's."
When did I make the crossover?
"2 years ago, Christmas."
"Oh, God!"
"Come on, honey."
What's the big deal?
It's just a big and tall store.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, let me break it down for you."
I'm certainly not tall.
You're tall.
Sure you're tall.
"What are you, 6'2""?"
"I'm 5'9""."
That's pretty damn tall.
"Oh, would you come on?"
All right.
Maybe you're a little bit big.
Why is this even a discussion?
The man is gargantuan.
"Ok, what else came from the big and tall shop?"
Tell me.
What-- this belt?
- No.
Oh no you didn't.
"Listen, it doesn't matter."
"Arrest all of us, okay."
Just take us with you.
Just get us out of here.

"No, wait."
They're with me.
They saved me.
It's him.
He's been keeping me prisoner for weeks.
You.

He's a psychopath.
He did things to me.
I told you she's innocent.
"My God, are you all right?"
"C'mere, it's gonna be okay."
Just take me away.
Oh God.
C'mere.
Angie.
"Angie, I need backup right now."
"It's over, I can't believe it's over."

If you want.
That's okay.
It's yours.

What were you writing back there...?
...What do you mean?
In Cook's class.
Let's see it...

That's like the worst combination for you.
I know.
"Oh, just..."
I'm stuck.
"I'm sorry, Dale."
Jill...
You don't have to be sorry.
You just got a little wasted that's... all.
"Oh, I drank too much."
I'm never drinking again.
I've heard that one before.
I don't think he wants to marry me you guys.
And I'm getting married in three weeks.
Dale.
Don't worry about Drew right now.
"Just finish blowing chunks, ok?"
Why don't you go make sure everything's ok out there.

You want the keeper's cabin.
You'll have to follow the track through the woods about half a mile.
"Right, uh, thanks."
You'll have to walk.
The track's too rough for city cars.
"Oh, okay."
"""Welcome to the country, folks."""
- Is it just me or is this a bit spooky?
"- It's just you, pussy."
- What's that?
- Do it!
That's my chips!
Alright.
"Catrin Pule, you're coming with me."
"Try again, Johnnie."
Positions.
No.
"No, no makeup."
Quiet please.
Quiet please everyone.
I'll give you a finger click for a sniper shot.
"Just a very quite click, please."
"It's hard to explain to a non-actor but I want to react to the sniper up there and not the click down here, you see?"
Is there a chance to find a real gunner up there?
No.
Right.
Up for take?
Sounds.
Sound rolling.

Gather 'round for my amazing trick!
I am about to take this wooden match and light it!

Eyes on the fire.

"But you can, Tony Stonem."
You can fuck me right now.
"- No, I couldn't."
- You want to.
"Hey, fuck you!"
I got hit by a fucking bus.
That fucks you up.
"Well, fuck you right back."
You're just not trying hard enough.
You must be so happy the way you are.
Why do you care if my dick can get hard or not?
This is fucked up beyond words.
Coward.
Fucking coward.

"What do you mean, ""what""?"
- What is it?
I've always wanted a grandchild.
-And I a grandpa.
Senna...
Give grandpa a kiss.
We must find Jesse.
I told him that you two are my parents.
Shut up and listen.
Let him believe it's true.
Let him at least die happy.
Dad... it's me.
I'm a grandfather now.
I fired the rocket that burnt you.
It wasn't you.
It was the fire devil.
"Put him on a leash, son."
He's hallucinating.
Morphine often does that.
I want to be under the blue sky where the birds sing.
-I'll fix it.
How are you going to fix that?
I don't know but I'll think of something.
Will he live till tomorrow?
-Maybe.
"Jesse, wait!"
Where are you going?
I have to find out why I became a firefighter.
There are no devils in you!
Jesse.
Look!
Good old Tinky Winky.
This is my piece of meat!
Shut up and eat!
That's too much.
I don't want to get fat.
Idiot...
You were supposed to pick me up...
Who is this?
Can't I have friends?
"Friends, sure."
"I'd watch out, if I were you."
"Watch it, you're only here because of me..."
OK OK.
I may as well clearthe table.
"Yeah, and the floortoo please."
Fuck off!
Mom...
Some snacks please.
I love you mom.
You're the best mom of all.
He's depressed.
He doesn't tell fortunes anymore...
I've been looking for a job all day.
I quit the cafe.
Fuck!
Did you get fired?
Boss kept nagging me about being late all the time.
And this military service thing suffocates me.
Shit.
Come here.
Fight at the bar?
Someone threw a bottle?
I got fired from the cafe.
Couldn't pay the rent...
What...
Who was it?
Her ex-boyfriend?
No!
"No, the ex-boyfriend had an alibi."
He checked out.
"Oh, God."
That's right.
You weren't at the meeting this morning.
But I had to shop for a dress.
I can't wear the same thing every show.
I had to wear the same blouse three times last week.
Three.
Three.
Three.
Tres.
Three.
Hello.
Sorry.
Just remind me.
All right.
His name is Malcolm O'Dwyer.
He's some kind of lottery fanatic.
He wrote a bunch of fan letters to Marissa before she was killed.
Hey!
I'm a big fan!
Thank you very much.
Not you.
The lotto girl.
"""You'll thank me later!"""
That's not actually my line!
Mr. Monk said it first!
Yeah.
I thought you left me.
(sighs)
How long was I out?
Little while.
Not long.
We were ambushed.
Yeah.
"So, what?"
What?
They wanted to stop the broadcasts?
You know as much as I do.
"Yeah, but we didn't do anything wrong."
Right?
We were ambushed.
Sit back down.
All the audio files are there.
We had nothing to do with it.
So...
They can't blame us for anything.
Why are you looking at me like that?
-We're fine.
We were ambushed.
-Calm down.
I am calm.
But what are we gonna do next?
-Stop walking around on your leg.
-l'm fine.
What do we do next?
Just tell me what we do now.
(PHONE ringing)
-OPERATOR:
I can't stand dogs and cats.
Dogs.
Cats.
Humans.
all part of your illness?
Do you have other similar symptoms?
I have plenty of symptoms.
Look.
I'd like to talk with you.
But not here.
With all that make-up.
I want to talk with you at your home.
I can't.
- Give me your calling code.
I can't see patients outside of work.
- But I'm not a patient.
Listen.
I...
Damn.
The boss.
Your code?
- I have to disconnect.
Give it to me.
- Please.
The boss is calling me.
Give me your code.
- I can't.
I'll file a complaint.
No.
Don't.
- Give me your code or I'll file.
I have enough problems as it is.
Dad?
What?
Is it morning?
You were asleep?
"Yeah, I was."
What's going on?
Well...
I wanted to talk about Ryan.
"Yeah, I know, it's cool."
We don't need to discuss it.
"Well, I think we do."
"I mean, I know you're upset, your mother and I are upset."
But our responsibility is... is to our family.
"Yeah, that's okay."
"No, I get it."
"I mean, this is a person's life we're talking about and we need to leave it in the hands of the authorities."
There's no need for sarcasm.
I'm not being sarcastic.
"Well, it's hard to tell sometimes."
Dad... it's okay.
Really.
When you want to talk about it...
"Yeah, I know."
You're the one to talk to.
Got it.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
"Come on, Seth."
"Okay, got it."
"I'll be there in, like, 20 minutes."
Hey.
I'll be in touch!
"Hey, you."
Come here!
You got a lighter?
What the fuck you think I have arms for?
You're free to go now.
- You want a smoke?
- Yes.
"Henry, Akan's already started."
"If we do not stop him, he'll have his army in days or sooner."
"You're half machine, half pussy."
"Wait, wait."
I can tell you something very important... about the man who sent you here.
"Oi, Henry."
I'm at this high class establishment.
Follow the door and then just knock on the knocker.
Get it?
Knock on the knocker!
Ella.
"Ella, you whore."
Take him to Jimmy.
Is this Jimmy?
Hi.
"I'm a fucking car, baby."
A Lexus convertible!
I'm going back in there.
That thing's destroyer-class.
- It feels good.
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Oh God, that's amazing."
Yes!
"Fuck, you're late!"
For my brothers.
They are all I think about.
Are they even alive?
I don't know.
Because I'm...
Stuck here.
Yeah.
There's something here.
It's from my team.
This means the new moon.
- The light.
- When's that?
- Tonight.
- And this?
It means they can only hide five men.
You and four more.
***
It's the best chance we have.
It's your call.
The truck is hidden in the woods.
Aurora has the keys.
Good.
Gun.
- Why would I give you a gun?
- You need help.
I can help.
What do you know about guns?
You aim and squeeze and your target dies.
How do I know I can I trust you?
You don't yet.
What's going on?
These men have experience training soldiers.
"Well, I don't like to see a dog killed either."
"But after all, 250 bucks is 250 bucks."
"All right, I told you I'm buying him, and I am."
- We ain't got no time to fool with him.
"- Quiet, quiet."
Whose money is this?
"Listen, you, you're my dog, and I'm your boss."
"The sooner you learn that, the easier it's going to be for both of us."
Come on.!
Mush.!
Mush.!
Ho!
Ho!
Right there!
Hey!
Go on!
Get back there!
What'd you bring this baboon along for?
- That big guy don't like him.!

He'll learn to like him!
- Come on!
Let's go!
Mush!
Mush!
- Get your teeth out of him.!
Come on!
Get up there!
"Come on, gray boy!"
"Come on, Buck."
- What's the matter?
- Nearly took my wing off.
So I will transfer you my energy.
I will transfer my karma.
Here is my karma on you.
Jason!
You have a great aura.
Yes.
Jason!
Encouragement!
Yes!
This is a great way to stretch.
Yep.
You see?
You could do this with your partner at home.
Sure.
Let's ride this energy out!
Keep your chin up.
Yep.
"Yes, this fire has just started."
And we will not put it out.
What is he doing?
I don't really know that pose.
"Okay, now we go into the happy baby pose."
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Please regard me.
I'm sorry?
"Please, allow me."
To do what?
Regard me.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
"You are doing fantastic, my dear."
Do you think I'm bad?
No.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
How can you be sure?
I know.
You're good.
"Well, since I'm good, can you get me a bowl to fetch milk?"
"When I go to the fields, I'll find one."
I want it now.
It will only take two minutes.
I'm late.
I have to go.
That lady will find you one.
Go on.
"Mim Hamideh, hello."
Do you have a milk bowl for the engineer?
"Yes, by the window."
All right.
She says to bring the bowl back.
I have to go.
Off you go.
May God give you pride.
May God give you good health.
May God give you a long life.
- Excuse me.
- Don't mention it.
- Are you well?
"- Yes, thank you."
is Kakrahman's house here?
What do you want?
Milk?
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?
Aren't we going back?
"We still have some time, right?"
For what?
I want to be with you a bit longer.
When he comes...
He'll take a while to get back.
Let's just go somewhere.
Where?
Anywhere.
Let's just look for a place.
"Ah, here."
They don't even have a front desk.
Isn't it the one outside?
Is it?
Let's try the second floor.
They're all empty.
No one's here.
This is crazy.
"- No, please don't."
- I think I'm going crazy.
Be patient.
Let's meet in Seoul.
He'll go nuts if he finds out.
But I want to have you.
So bad.
- Really?
"- Yes, really."
For real.
"Then, strip."
Everything?
"I know, sweetheart."
I know.
Come here.
"Look, I have to debrief Chappelle."
"I'll see you in a minute, okay?"
"Dad, I know about your drug problem."
Why didn't you come to me with this?
Come here.
Come here.
"I'm sorry, baby."
I'm sorry.
I was embarrassed.
"And it wasn't your problem, and it still isn't."
I didn't want you to worry.
"Well, is it over?"
"No, not exactly."
"I think I'm going to have to go into a program, and get some help."
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
Chappelle wants me to go into the clinic and get checked out.
"- We'll talk about this later, okay?"
- Okay.
Don't worry.
- I love you.
"- Me, too."
Okay.
Jack.
I'm glad you're back.
It's been difficult without you.
"Thanks, Chloe."
- Chase.
- Yeah.
I don't really know you.
I....
I just feel connected to you.
I feel....
"I feel safe with you, like it's okay to be honest."
It's just one of those things.
I'm just attracted to you.
And it's not just because I think you're incredibly sexy.
"I think that you're incredibly attractive too, Sara."
I do.
You do?
Yeah.
I think about you.
Trust me.
A lot.
How do you think about me?
How?
Yeah.
Do you think about having sex with me?
Yeah.
How?
How do I think about having sex with you?
Yeah.
Do you think about me going down on you?
Yeah.
-That's part of it.
"-Yeah, me too."
I think about how you'd taste.
I'm sure you'd taste sweeter.
-Do you resist me?
-No.
-Do you give yourself over?
He's my friend too.
We really grew on each other.
Thanks.
I am counting on you.
"Don't worry about us, and watch your back."
The baron has hired some butchers to guard the place.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire?
!
Where is the fire?
"The warehouse with medicinal herbs from Ming, sir!"
"Oh, no!"
You must find his journal.
That's the only way to bring the baron down.
He won't store it in an obvious place.
He will keep it very close to him.
That idiot!
You!
Guards!
Guards!
Come quickly!
Guards!
Thief!
That way!
Go now!
Go!
But...
Just go!
I got you covered.
What?
!
It won't be a problem at all.
Good.
We're on.
What's really funny is that fucking bank job in Secaucus.
I'm in the weeds lying down.
Resting.
Here?
"This ain't no beach or park."" ""I'm resting!"" I said."
this and that.
My usual.
Nothing.
you'll tell me something today.
go fuck your mother.
Anthony.
My head was out like this.
I'm coming around and who do I see in front of me?
"""What do you want to tell me now?"
What are you doing here?
I said to go fuck your mother.
I thought he'd shit.
The fuckers.
I wish I was big just once.
Funny.
You're really funny.
I'm funny?
you know.
It's a good story.
You're a funny guy.
You mean the way I talk?
What?
you know.
You're just funny.
"Come on, let's sit down."
Here's to the family.
Salute.
"I'm so charged, Sonny."
I never felt this way before in my whole life.
"I know, man, it's a great feeling."
"I mean, things are looking up."
This has got to be the beginning of some good stuff for us.
You know?
It's got to be.
"I'm so happy for you, man."
"Thanks, man."
How's the club?
It's great.
I couldn't ask for anything better.
I got more money than I know what to do with.
That's the way it should be.
"Yes, sir."
Oh.
We're smiling.
Must've been when we first landed.
Yeah.
You know who's in that picture?
You and me.
No.
It's me... and the godfather of my son.
You're kidding.
"That's what Julia wants, too?"
Yeah.
What do you say?
Yeah!
You bet!
I know.
Put it under there.
What are you doing that for?
I'm just passing the time.
"If you really love me, then let's make a vow... right here, together... right now."
- Okay?
- Okay.
All right.
Repeat after me-
I'm gonna be free.
I'm gonna be free.
And I'm gonna be brave.
I'm gonna be brave.
Good.
And the next one is-
I'm gonna live each day as if it were my last.
"Oh, that's good."
You like that?
Yeah.
Say it.
I'm gonna live each day as if it were my last.
Fantastically.
Fantastically.
Courageously.
Courageously.
With grace.
With grace.
You don't have to bubble-wrap everything.
It's not like you're moving to the north pole.
Oh.
That's not yours.
- Very loud.
"Yeah, it's very intense."
This is what men listen to.
Yeah!
This is like Satan's lullaby.
It's brutal!
It's masculine!
Yeah.
Who wants margs?
- I would love a marg.
- I'll take a marg.
Man marg.
"It's not strawberry, I hope you don't mind."
It's just traditional.
That's cool.
That's cool.
I'm okay with that.
"He also said, ""rocks,"" but whatever."
"You know, men, they..."
"Sometimes they don't get what they want, and they deal with it."
- They deal.
- 'Cause we're men.
Who the heck brought lettuce on this trip?
Men don't eat lettuce!
- I didn't pack lettuce.
- Men don't eat lettuce.
But I will put some Lawry's salt on these burgers.
Both:
Lawry's.
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"- I like that, man."
"- Yo, Blaze."
Get some air.
Go on.
- God.
- Take it easy.
"Breathe in, breathe out."
All right.
"I'm gonna stand up, all right?"
Because I got bad knees.
That's better.
"Okay, now listen."
The three of us are gonna work this out.
Yeah?
How?
"First thing, you'll put a dollar in my pocket, both of you."
"You want attorney-client privilege, don't you?"
So that everything you say is strictly between us.
I mean it.
Put a dollar in my pocket.
"Come on, make it official."
"Come on, do it."
"That's it, come on."
Just a dollar.
"All right, now you, ski bum."
Come on.
Give with the dollar.
- Go on.
- Be smart.
What?
- All I got is a five.
- I'll take a five.
"Come on, already."
Come on.
You can give it back tomorrow.
...How do you do it?
You gotta make each side all one color.
like that
...You smell kinda funny.
Aren't you cold?
I don't really get cold
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
Help me Hello?
Please...
Help me Hello?
Hey there...
Are you okay?
What happened?
I fell...
Yeah...?
Can't you get up...?
No...
"How old are you, sweetheart?"
Do you live around here...?
I live right here...
Can you carry me...?
"Okay, sweetheart... sure..."
Why don't you... here...
You got it...?
you expect me to clean it up now...!
don't you?
...fucking bitch!
How did you do it?
!
I just... twisted it.
Do I smell better now?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
"Sara, I would never do anything to hurt you."
I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.
- You wanna go ?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Let's go.
This is it.
This is where l live.
This is my dad's music room.
- He plays the trumpet.
- No shit.
[ Laughs ] He's actually pretty good if you like jazz.
No.
He's got some nice stereo equipment.
It's off the hook.
Huh.
And this is our living room.
- lt's not anything special.
- lt's all right.
My dad's gonna flix that.
It's kind of messy in there.
- Do you wanna see my room ?
"- Uh, yeah."
- This is it. I sleep on the couch.
- [ Laughs ]
"There's a bed underneath, but it gets stuck, and my dad says he's gonna flix it, but I don't know."
"He's, um, at work right now."
He'll... be gone all night.
"Yeah, um--"
[Siren Wailing ln Distance] I'd sleep in a dresser too if I had six brothers to sleep with.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Renee!
Let me in.
Where's John?
Ain't he with you?
No.
"What do you mean, ""no""?"
"Cliff, where is he?"
As...
"As soon as I heard the police coming in, I told him to get out."
I screamed at him that he had to go.
But you saw him leave?
"Where is he, then?"
Where's David?
Did he make it back?
He's... waiting for us at Reg's.
"Cliff, please, do the right thing and let him go."
You can take responsibility for this.
- What are you on about?
- David's not like you.
He won't cope in prison.
Give him a chance to get away.
Nobody's going to prison.
Look.
You should have seen what we left behind.
There's enough here.
Grab your case.
Come on.
"I'm staying here, in case John comes back."
"Cooper, get to the door."
"It's gonna be like my mum, I don't know, dead."
- Your mum?
- Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.
- Your mother is not in there.
- You're not in control of this!
It's in my head.
It fucking knows.
It knows.
- It knows!
- It knows what?
It knows I got this thing with my mum.
"Cooper, I promise you, she's not in there."
- Now open the door.
"- Oh, my God."
It's the only way I can get you out.
Listen to me.
"Okay, Okay."
Fuck.
Okay.
Whatever's in there cannot harm you.
"But I can't get you out unless you open that door, Cooper."
Okay.
Would you kindly open the door?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Okay.
"Okay, okay, I'm in the room."
Where's the access point?
Access point?
- There is no access point.
- What?
We're going to have a baby.
"Which, frankly, scares the hell out of me."
It'll be great.
Yeah.
"I'm sure it will, at times."
And at times I'm sure I'll be exhausted and angry and think I've made a total mess of my life.
I'll be there.
"You will, won't you?"
Even if I get confused and strange and horrible.
"Yeah, I'll do my best."
"I will, too."
"Connie, we're gonna have a baby."
I know.
That's great.
LUC:
I'm... (STAMMERlNG)
I'm going to be a father!
You're going to be an aunt!
(CONNlE laughing)
"Girls,"
I think you should come upstairs.
I'll be right here.
"You will, won't you?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's good.
"That's very, very good."
Commander.
What is it?
A group of people escaped the blockade.
What?
They're probably a bit damp.
"I'll take him the pot too, shall I?"
"Well, I'm sure he hasn't got nothin' that I haven't seen before."
They're nice and warm.
[Speaking Polish] Hmm?
- Danke schon.
- Oh.
English - thank you.
Thank you.
Polnisch - dziekuje.
I see.
"I'll just, um... leave the door ajar."
And I'm going to get my knitting.
Why are you creeping about?
I'm not creeping about.
I'm just...
Ollendorff and I are going to speak to him.
"- What, now?"
- Yes.
He might be asleep.
"Well, if he is, I won't."
What's the matter with you?
I think he's Polish.
What?
"He used the word ""Polnisch."""
"Well, why didn't you say so?"
Neither of us speak Polish; we haven't even been to Poland.
"Hopeless, Ursula."
"Shh, shush!"
When did he say it?
Don't push!
[Footsteps]

- Hollis.
I ain't troubling no one.
- Your neighbors are complaining again.
"You got to turn that music down and go back inside, son."
- It's a free country.
I can do what I want.
"- Come on, man."
Don't cause any more trouble.
We don't want to bring you in again if we don't have to.
Was it you?
Huh?
Fucking no-good coward.
"Hey, you got something to say to me, Harold?"
You say it to my face!
- Hollis!
Hollis.
"Hollis, that's enough."
That's enough.
Go in the house and sleep this off.
Come on.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
I just didn't know if you'd like it.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's for covering blood.
It doesn't have to match the drapes.
You want to hold him?
"He's fed, changed and burped... happy."
It's the perfect time.
"Well, you... you've got him."
Violet...
"Okay, breathe in and out."
"Shh, shh, shh."
Remember what we said?
"This time, you're just gonna breathe in and out."
You're just gonna stand there and wait.
Shh.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
"No... yes, you're just gonna stand there and wait until I open the door."
Breathe in and out.
Do not go in...
The closet.
"I told you, don't ring the bell."
"Oh, oh."
Did I wake him?
No.
She's in the closet again.
Don't worry.
I'm handling it.
"Yeah, no, no."
I can...
Take it nice and easy now.
- Eyes forward.
- Nice and easy.
That hand down!
- Nice and easy.
- They're on him!
Damn.!
I'd love to kill you.!
- What the...
- You got it?
- Cigarettes.
- Ha!
I wish you'd run.
I'd love to kill you.
I would love to kill you.
"But you can't run, 'cause you're busted.!"
Eyes forward!
Eyes forward!
I don't like you.
Keep your gun on him.!
Keep your gun on him.!
"Ain't nothing gonna help you, Hammond."
"I'm sorry about all this, Mr. Voss."
Your daughter is a fine young lady.
"This is the money shot, Ned."
The father-daughter reunion.
- Beautiful.
- He didn't hurt me.
He's innocent.
- He's innocent!
- Later.
That really was funny.
Mm-mmm.
Mmm!
Mm-hmm.
"You don't-- oh, Dave, thank you!"
Ok.
Thank you!
You're the best!
Kai!
It's Erica!
"Look, I came all this way!"
Uninvited.
To talk to you.
Please.
Hey.
Can I come in?
"Look, I know that I made everything really complicated for you, and I'm sorry."
Whatever.
"It's not you, it's me."
I screw everything up.
Why did you quit your job?
"'cause I figured then if I disappear, you and Ethan can go back to being in love,"
Travis can have a nice little musical career.
"No, that's not the way that this works."
I don't care how this works.
You can go.
Now.
"Kai-- I told you to stay away, all right?"
Stop trying to save me.
It's not your job.
"If Dr. Fred can give up, so can you."
"No, Dr. Fred, he hasn't given up."
Really?
- Who is this man?
Just a guy that works here.
Little bit screwy.
"Go on, stand over there, will you?"
He gets excited.
"Well, we'll be going, judge."
We'll make our report to the state board.
"- Goodbye, judge."
- Goodbye.
"I want you to do me a favor, Mr. Gargan."
I want you to stay here.
"For a time, anyway."
And run this place.
Don't worry.
I'll be here.
"- Goodbye, Miss Griffith."
"- Goodbye, Judge Gilbert."
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- And good luck.
- Thanks very much.
- So Joe's all right?
- I'm afraid he's gonna live.
"You can go back, tell him the racket is his."
- What?
- The racket and the whole 5000 votes.
- After you nearly killing the guy?
- Go on.
Beat it.
- Are you staying here?
- Yep.
- So am I.
"Hey, George."
Gary?
Where the hell have you been?
I've been leaving messages for months.
"- I know, I've been busy."
- Don't give me busy.
Who's not busy?
I'm busy.
We're all busy.
Everybody's busy.
All right.
Tell me.
What's kept you so busy?
Mostly chemotherapy.
"Hey, I'll see you."
"Hey, pig!"
"Hey, hey, hey!"
So you called the cop a pig?
I was yelling at the litterbug.
"I mean, this is my town."
You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
"So, didn't you explain that to the cop?"
"No, I fled the scene."
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Kramer, I need to talk to Jerry privately."
What about?
- Kramer.
"- Oh, come on, George you can share it with me."
- You're hurting me.
- You gonna share with me next time?
- Sure.
- [Indistinct]
- Get out of here.
- You.
"Come on, you, baldy."
Come on.
"Come on, move."
"All right, put it on the bar."
- What are you pullin' on me for?
- Get it on the bar.
Get the hell in there.
Put your hands on your head.
All of it.
"Smartass, you dropped something."
Pick it up.
You want that hand broken?
Get it up there.
"What else you got here, huh?"
[Cloudy] Turn around.
You're under arrest.
That goes for you too.
Get in that phone booth.
"Come on, move."
Move!
- Keep 'em up.
Keep 'em up.
That's good.
- Get in there.
"All right, face the wall, put your hands against the wall and lock yourself in."
"Hey, you, haircut."
- Where are you going?
"- You talkin' to me, baby?"
"Yeah, I'm talking to you."
You must really trust me.
- You really do trust me.
"- You're the best, Director Kim."
I told you he's really great.
What trust?
I don't trust people so easily.
"- By the way, he's not my boyfriend."
- Sorry?
"- Oh, come on."
- Come on what?
What?
"But, he said you were."
Do we have to have sex to be boyfriend and girlfriend?
Whatever.
"And yes, you have to have sex."
"Right, Director Kim?"
This is fun.
"We're just friends, you and I."
- Do friends kiss?
- That's so childish.
"Yeah, we kissed once."
Big deal.
Damn it.
This isn't funny.
"No, it's funny."
Very funny.
It's a sea star.
It's dead.
Cigarette.
"When the tide's out, it'll ebb to that lighthouse."
"- Like the Red Sea, right?"
- Yes.
You might be able to catch him.
Come with me.
But-
Please!
Go to see him in Ito.
He's important for you.
Do you have money?
"Yes, I have some."
Good.
"When you see him, give him my regards."
Yes.
You're going to get me into trouble
What have you been doing these days?
"It's incredibly hard to be with you, but at the same time,"
I'm so lonely without you.
I'm terrible.
It's too late.
Too late for what?
Why?
"No, let me go."
It's late.
Let's go home.
I've always considered you very important.
I'm in your heart.
I still do.
"Well, good night."
What are you doing here?
It's a holiday.
What's wrong with you?
"You look sick, you know."
I went to see Kayama-sensei.
Did you see him?
I'm dead!
Hurry up!
You're so slow!
My God!
Sissoko!
"Hurry up, Niaré!"
- What's going on?
"- Greetings, Sissoko."
- I was waiting for you.
- Why?
- You called me.
- I don't remember.
That must be it.
"You know, Niaré, you lose your head easily in this world."
"Let's go in and talk, then."
I'm very short of time.
"- Come in, please."
- I'm afraid I can't.
I'll send you a message by phone tomorrow.
Good bye.
Do you need to whine?
Can't you see I'm not well?
"Right, you're ill!"
What was he doing here?
Who?
Niaré!
He came because you invited him.
You asked him to wait here.
You know very well that I didn't call him.
How could I?
I wasn't there.
You're not going to cry over that.
What the...?
You can't go in there.
It's all right.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
And that's the end of my 20-second break.
"Good luck, man."
"So, Emma, what kind of music do they play?"
It's like an '80s pop vibe mixed with a little Black Keys.
Cool.
This is gonna be painful.
Be nice.
"So, Emma, how do you know Mat?"
"I think what she's trying to ask is, does he have a girlfriend?"
That's definitely what she's trying to ask.
That's not what I was trying to ask.
Do you guys want me to ask?
"Hey, Mat!"
No!
That is not what I was asking.
He's single.
- Lou?
- Yeah.
Lucy.
We're Someone's Little Sister.

- Why did you kill Foon?
- White Tiger killed him.
You're harboring a fugitive!
"Yes, so what?"
"While you're still alive, I'll only be second-best."

We got ambushed.
We're lucky to get out.
We got ambushed.
We're lucky to get out.
We lost taka.
What about the guns?
Gone.
It wasn't a complete loss though.
Kuauo got it out.
We got it out.
"Wow, this is great."
"This is your new place, huh?"
"No, yours."
Mine?
Mine?
You don't like it?
"No, no."
I mean yeah!
It's just that it's so big.
"You know, for one person."
Perhaps that will change.
What kind of bullshit is that?
You told me to do whatever it takes to stay in.
That's paper inside.
Paper?
Paper for...
Our first anniversary.
"Oh my god, it's tonight."
- I don't even know what to say.
"- Don't worry, you've been so busy."
"No, please."
Don't make excuses for me.
I will make this up to you.
You promise to do ...
What's on the paper?
My love for you.
Sealed forever.
It's pretty dark out there huh?
Oh my God!
I love it.
I love you.
You're welcome.
Thanks for telling me.
He made me promise.
Sneak.
You do everything your big brother tells you?
Yeah right.
"I'm I'd listened to him, I wouldn't be such a fuck up and you two never would've met."
Can't fault you on that one.
Alright.
- I'm gonna get outta your hair.
"- No, no."
No rush.
I uh...
I gotta go change anyway.
What's happening here?
What are you talking about?

Brother Migs!
"If you're always like that,"
-Why?

But she's doing fine now.
"But I really ran after him, sis."
I have searched almost the whole block but I really didn't see him anymore.
You chased him?
.
Then why didn't' you reach him?
What if something bad happens to him?
"Okay, change your clothes now okay?"
.
Hurry.
Why are we going downstairs?
I need to show you something.
"We got you, we got you."
"Let's go, let's go."
How did you?
"I heard the buzz, then I played dead."
Played dead?
Of course you did.
Oh wait.
"Connor, I..."
Riley.
I'm so sorry.
Thought I'd say goodbye.
Hey.
"I'm sorry, man."
You were the best crew I've ever had.
Listen...
"If I get out of here,"
"I swear to you,"
"I swear to you,"
I'm gonna buy your girl those boobs.
"I love you, bro."
"Oh, Connor."
No!
"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right."
It's all right.
I should have told you I tried that.
"All right, come on man."
"We gotta move, we gotta move."
What are we gonna do?
We gonna hide and wait it out?
What is it?
You won't tell me.
I'm hungry.
We can go to my place.
- Who did you inherit it from?
- My great-aunt.
She was great.
She loved collecting things.
She hooked a rich building speculator... and traveled.
This was her depot.
- Her depot?
- So to speak.
You'll see.
"The whole family died of envy, and in the end... everyone came away empty-handed."
Almost everybody.
Yeah.
She saved my life.
Just because you went shopping once!
"OK, OK."
Forget it.
- Lf I'd only known before.
- What?
That you're such a great roommate.
Where are you going?
What?
"I have to pee, you dumb cow!"
Or maybe not.
Hello.
Good-bye!
Shit!
Just a minute.
Great.
Hello?
"Hello, everything is fine here."
She got the boy from the bus.
- Good.
Hold on a second.
- One minute.
They aren't going home.
- Where are they going?
- How should I know?
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Sinan?
What are we going to do?
Shall we get out of here?
Candan is inside playing the violin.
"One's here, the other's there."
"Wait a little, just wait."
"I don't know, do something."
Follow them.
Follow them?
I said they got into the cab and left.
"Good, okay."
Hello?
Uluc?
I am going to kill you.
We're going to follow that car.
What are we going to do now?
How the hell should I know?
"Besides, why did you come here?"
The line got cut and I freaked out.
What's up with the violin sound?
What's going on?
"(GROANS) Come on up, come on."
"Hey, come on."
"Here, take your coat off."
Here you are.
Yeah.
This is my place.
My humble home.
I know.
- You want to take your coat off?
"- Oh, thank you."
"Yeah, I'll set it right here."
"- So, er... drinks?"
"- Sure, of course."
"We have some wine, red wine, white wine."
- Erm... red.
- Red?
- Norm?
- Prosecco.
- Ah...
- Prosecco!
"That's fancy, Norm."
NORM:
"You know, I love movies."
So here's a line from a movie.
You have to guess.
"She says to a younger man who's trying to woo her, to flirt with her..."
"And she says to him, ""You don't want me."
"You want somebody young and fresh."""
"And she goes, ""Armies have marched over me."""
"- All right, guess that one."
- Right away.
Thank you.
All right.
Here they come.
All right.
"Come on, come on, come on."
Come on.!
Come on.!
"Come on, Island Hoppers.!"
Let's go.!
"Come on, Island Hoppers.!"
Let's go.!
Let's go.!
Let's go.!
Let's go.!
"I'm telling you, I don't know where it is."
I buried it under a Bougainvillea Priscilla.
But that was a year ago.
The whole garden's changed since then.
"Ain't buying' it, Roger."
The sun's almost gone down and the race is over.
"If you don't get that money before they close this place, there's gonna be something else planted here."
What's with the tender loving care?
Pull it up!
"Nine, 10, 11, 12..."
Thirteen!
There's 13 riders ahead of him!
This is ridiculous!
It's okay.
He can still win.
There's still 60 miles to go.
Tom!
"Come on, Magnum!"
- Come on!
So that we may continue the climb.
So it is witnessed.
So it will be.
So it will be.

More use to who?
I can't tell you that.
"The government gave Carlos Mejia, the man who gunned me down in cold blood, a deal?"
Yes.
And you let that happen.
"I didn't have a choice, Cali."
You didn't have a choice.
That doesn't sound like you.

[Sniffles]

- Mills.
- You need to come in.

- Tell you when you get here.
"- No, now."

Wow.
Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.
"Wa, wa, wa-wa!"

"Geez, man."
I'm surrounded by amateurs.
"[Scuttle] Wa, wa, wa, wa!"
You want something done you've got to do it yourself.
First we got to create the mood.
Percussion.
Strings.
Winds.
Words.

Yes.

- Now you know I exist.
- Yes.
I've got a pencil and some paper.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
I better go now.
Bye.
I'II be home very soon.
Do I have any brothers or sisters?
"- No, not really."
- What do you mean?
There's a little boy at the orphanage called Pramod.
- Pramod?
"- Pramod, yes."
I've taken care of him since he was a baby.
- How old is he now?
- He'll turn eight in precisely a week.
He's this big.
"He's tiny, but he want's to be a footballer."
"Maybe it's stupid, but I brought some pictures, if you'd like to see them."
"Yes, please."
Here I'm taking a bath.
"That's Lennart, my first boyfriend."
He had a moped.
- But he didn't want me.
I led him to Minks' daughter.
What if something goes wrong?
How long will you stay?
A week?
A month?
"Then you'll be gone, and I'll be free for slaughter."
You are already.
Gentlemen...
Nowthe back.
What if he doesn't get in touch?
Don't worry.
He won't pass up this opportunity.
Go on.
Talk to her.
Irezumi!
"Take the suitcase to Convention Center, place it in a van with the number 1969."
We have to put something in it.
"Lynn's tattoo, the 3rd Hiromitsu."
When's the exchange?
- Midnight.
Just one more hour.
Come on.
I'm here.
Do you have me?
I see you.
The transmitter's working.
Midnight.
"Okay, Poscher, let's go."
Take the suitcase and get out.
Check if one of the vans has the number 1969.
I got it.
Try the doors.
May he do the same for you.
Have hope.
You deserve it.
PAULITO:
"La Primera lives, ese."
It lives through us.
It gives to us.
It is us.
"SimÃ²n, ese, it's all we got."
It's all we've ever had.
"Carnal, remember that time we went down to the L.A. River?"
"We drank that funky, funky wine, ese."
"Man, I was sick for a week."
You wanna know what Lourdes asked me?
I'm telling you this 'cause you're my carnal.
"She wanted to know if the reason why they call me ""Little Puppet"" was..."
You know.
Made me real angry.
I think she's pregnant now.
"I guess I showed her, huh?"
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me.
Don't fight.
"Please, don't fight!"
J ust die!
J ust die.
Mi carnalito.
God damn me.
Coming out?
Paulito.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Your brother sent this for you.
"Everyone get insomnia, now and then."
Stevie.
I haven't slept in a year.
Jesus Christ!
I tried him too...
Sorry.
Hello?
Yeah.
No I can't.
I can't talk now.
Okay.
"My ex, he's a fucking Psycho."
"Trevor, I'm worried about you."
"Don't worry, no one ever died of insomnia."
"I hope not, you are my best client."
Can't afford to lose ya.
"Gee, thanks."
"Reznik, I need a hand."
"Gotta get this dead level here, help me out."
- Safety on?
"- Oh, yeah."
How's that?
"No, still off."
Is that any better?
"Hey, do your sleeping on your own time."
I need some help here.
Better.
It's now level.
Try the other side.
I hate this bitch.
Hey!
what did you do?
"Yahoo, ya motherfucker!"
Round up those fucking wagons.
Now he's moving.
Shot in the foot.
He's fine.
So he got shot in the foot.
"What is it, a big fuckin' deal?"
"Vito, get a towel."
Nice fucking game.
Take him to Ben Casey.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.
Take him to the doctor down the street.
Bones are all shattered.
"Don't get me upset, now."
"Don't make a big fuckin' thing out of it, Spider!"
Ya little prick.
You trying to make me think what I did here.
It was an accident.
Fuck him.
Little fucking actor.
-You in?
-l'm in.
-Eight hundred.
-Eight hundred?
You haven't been home in two weeks!
You're not going out tonight!
"Karen, will you grow up!"
Stop.
I'm still gonna go out!
"Not without your car keys, you're not."
Are you nuts?
What's your problem?
It may interest you.
But personally...
May I get out here?
- Where are you going?
"- To school, this way."
I'll drop you.
I'll see Farzad too.
"He has exams, I'll see what he's done."
"Sir, thank you."
Thank you again.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
- Are those the exam papers?
- Yes.
- Don't be too harsh on them.
- l'm not.
Tell our little colleague to come and see me.
Excuse me!
- What?
- Please do me a favour.
Don't tell Farzad what we were just saying.
All right.
Don't worry.
"Go on, get in the other side."
"Hurry up, get in."
- l can't come now.
- Why?
I need one more answer for the exam.
What is it?
The fourth question.
- You don't know the answer?
- No.
Red Cross!
- Hello?
- Hey!
Hello.
Is your mom home?
"No, she's not home."
She's not upstairs?
We heard something.
"No, that was our dog."
- She's not home?
- No.
It's our dog.
When does she get back?
She'll be home soon.
Can we wait?
Where can we wait?
Let's see how much we raised.
- The money also?
- I can count everything.
- What a bad handwriting.
- Yes.
Like a doctor's prescription.
Barely legible.
You want to go to school again?
- Well ...
- It starts soon.
- Where did you go to school?
- In Vienna.
"It's a lot busier there, huh?"
We have already picked up a nice sum.
"If everyone continues to give as much, we did well."
We'll see how much more we get.
-Go fuck yourself!
"Let me handle this, Jemina."
-Go handle the garbage!
"See his ""use, Senna?"
It's red and round like a clown's nose.
They must've had a clown for a boss.
Let go!
I can't breath.
My nasal cavities are built that way.
No more kiddy games.
Get in the garbage can.
I'll let go of your nose.
Damn you...
Need help?
"Jemina, I've got to go."
Peku went to get more birds and the cops took him.
You're talking to me again!
Peku is out of the game now that he's in the can.
Of course he is.
"Did I, like, win?"
-Maybe.
LEVEL 2
Give him a shot when he wakes up.
Remember how?
-Yeah.
Where am I?
-In the bar.
It hurts.
-Would this help?
I'd rather take a bottle of rum.
-Coming up.
"You're a nice girl, Jemina."
She still is.
Roommate I.D'd the photo as a Jordan Arnold.
Run the DMV.
Get me an address now.
We're running out of time.
Snitch's Tavern.
Your first arrest.
That guy had to be 6′6″ easy.
"–Still, that bust was when I knew."
–Knew?
That maybe you wouldn't be a complete screwup after all.
–Take a right up here.
I wanna show you something.
"–No, I can't."
I gotta get back to the barn.
I got some stuff I gotta check up.
Bullshit.
"This is your training officer, all right?"
Take the afternoon off.
Humor an old man.
Take a right.
Come on.
All right.
Yes?
I've got a problem on this Tio murder.
What's that?
"The more I look into it, the more Vic Mackey's name pops up."
"Well, Tio was Vic's C.I."
He was also a drug dealer.
Vic's name is all over his phone records.
But Vic told me he hadn't talked to him in months.
–He lied.
Open the door!
Open the door now!
Break it down!
This is a waste of time.
We don't need him anyway.
I need him.
"If he's a member of the resistance, he may be able to help me contact my ship."
Monster!
He's the one.
He took your mother.
We have to...
They want a fight.
Don't give them one.
What?
I've done nothing!
I've done nothing.
Please!
Please...
You look like a helpful citizen.
"So, tell me."
You might have seen some strangers who were in the marketplace earlier today.
"No, sir."
"No, I've seen no one."
Please.
You!
"I'm looking for someone, a woman."
I haven't seen any woman.
There are two right over here.
"You see them, don't you?"
Yes.
Maybe we should discuss this elsewhere.
Caylem...
Yeah?
Can you see what I'm doing?
It's not that nice.
- Are you all right?
"- Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm sorry.
So are we still on for tonight?
Yeah.
"Yeah, yeah."
"So, like, 8:00, right?"
You want me to pick you up?
"Yeah, 8:00."
I'll be waiting.
"All right, cool."
Bye.
Who was that?
Just this friend.
Do you have a friend I don't know?
This guy from school.
Going through a divorce.
"By the way, I was going to ask you a favor."
What?
What?
"I was gonna go out with him tonight and Jenna fucking hates him, so I'm just gonna tell her I'm with you, if that's cool."
You're fucking around on her.
What?
It's a guy from school.
No.
"Don't get me involved in this, please."
How can you fuck around on Jenna?
She's perfect.
She's beautiful.
A little too rich for my blood.
Maybe they fell out of your pocket— or maybe Cindy's.
"Now, you go home and you sleep... and you wake up and you guide the traffic through this town... and everything will be the way it was."
I'm taking him in tomorrow morning at 6:00.
That's in a few hours.
"I'd like you to come with me, Ray."
There's nothing I can say?
Okay.
Then 6:00 it is.
Yeah.
"No, Lis."
Who was he supposed to call?
Ray knows everybody.
What am I supposed to do?
Let him go in alone?
What?
You know what?
"Okay, fine."
Why don't you go home?
I mean...
"I wanna be here for you, Freddy, but—"
"Lisa's nervous, you know."
She's pregnant.
- I mean—
"- So, go on."
I'll be fine.
Yeah.
"You be careful, Freddy."
Yeah.
You too.
Shut the fuck up!
"Would ya, please?"
I can take the pills myself.
"Okay, fine."
Will you come visit?
You call and we'll make a date.
"I'll get some licorice, coffee, tea, whiskey."
You name it.
Okay.
"Take care of yourself, alright?"
Thank you for everything.
I'll be waiting.
"Let's go by the house first, I'll change my shirt."
"But I brought the one you wanted, it looks nice on you."
Where do you want to sit?
- Next to you.
I don't want to go.
You're kidding me.
"Goni, please."
"Daddy, do as I say."
Don't talk to your father like that.
Don't tell me what to do.
Goni.
Let's give it a pass.
I can't.
Daddy.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Come on.
I'm sorry.
"I'm sorry, come on."
You'll be okay.
Mr. Ben-Shmuel.
Alex Dolgin's secretary asked me to take you to the rehearsal.
Please.
Open up there.
"Yeah, those."
Plug the jacksin there.
"Yeah, in there."
So your name's Henry and...
"Okay, what a good news is that you gonna a while."
"Bad news is that in this case,"
"""a while"" means 20, 30 minutes tops, Henry."
"Unless you're very, very lucky."
Which you are.
Uncle Jimmy is gonna take you to his lab.
Hang on.
"Ah, Shit."
We got ?
on our tail.
Unplug yourself.
Put that away.
There's no clothes in here.
Put the hoodie on.
"There's no enough time, fuck."
Just cover the blood up with the your bag.
Just stay calm and let me handle this here?
Maybe we can skip right to the fine?
So...
Shit.
Fucking Akan paying...
Do you know what's wrong with Mother Russia?
Too goddamn hot.
Too goddamn hot.
Too goddamn hot.
As you wish.
"Oh, God."
"- All right, sad-arse?"
- Nina just rang from the hospital.
He's taken a turn for the worse.
But he's been asking for you.
"Look, we've done our best but he is... he's just too weak."
"Do you understand, Adam?"
"Well, look, we'll... we'll give you some time alone with him, OK?"
Dad?
Adam.
"I'm here, Dad."
Why?
What's happened?
You collapsed.
You weren't well.
You collapsed.
Are you all right?
Have you fed?
Here.
It's OK.
I've got these people looking after me.
"But they... they understand, do they?"
It's fine.
They're nice.
"Now, you give me a minute and we'll get out of here, hey?"
"No, listen."
You have to stay here.
I'm just...
I'm just so... so tired.
"You gave me too much, Dad."
You made yourself weak.
What else could we do?
"Master, he's right!"
Seems like he's not bad
What did you say?
Master is angry!
No wonder you can't win over him!
Dad!
"I'm sorry, Master!"
Master's technique is good
But now he can't even stand still
He was defeated in at least six or seven stances
He picked up the brick
The brick?
You bastard!
Master!
Stay there!
Don't run
It's me!
"Master, stop it!"
Stop it!
You bastard!
How dare you beat me up!
I didn't mean it!
"You did, too!"
And you beat me so hard?
It's just a mistake!
Mistake?
It's more than one time
"No, Master can't take it"
Dad!
"T ell me, who taught you those stances?"
Me
I taught him!
- They can put the finger on you.
"- Quit waiting there, will you?"
Keep in touch.
Let me know what the doctor says.
- Get our doctor if you have to.
Come on.
- Wait a minute.
"Listen, Patsy, I'm asking you, don't go up there, will you?"
- All right.
- Wouldn't that mean--?
"Now, boys."
"Now, wait."
Now wait.
Now let's be sensible.
"Now, let's start all over again."
I'll change everything back to what it was before.
- I swear I will.
I'll change and--
- You're a liar.
"We, the jury, find you guilty of murder in the first degree."
Where did--?
Where--?
- Let's go.
Get him.
- Hurry up.
Hurry up and get him.
Let's hurry up and get him.
"Come on, boys, let's go."
Come on.
"Hurry, Patsy."
He's dead.
"Hey, come on."
And a six.
Pair of threes still best.
- I'll talk to you about it tomorrow.
- Yeah!
Yeah.
"Hey, if you get a chance, can you take a look at it for me?"
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal...
-...the poor box?
-Ha.
That's an insult.
I got a vow of poverty.
"Where'd you get it, then?"
I stole it.
I believe you.
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.
I figure I saved him from a big temptation.
"Oh, Christ!"
I should have been there.
I wasn't there.
Should have been.
There was nothing you could do.
Lie down.
Give me the butt.
Come on.
-Now you think you can sleep?
-Yeah.
-Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
-No.
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.
"Now, shut up and go to sleep."
Good night.
- Yeah.
What did you want to tell me?
"You know, it..."
It's just work.
I should go.
Big day today.
Thanks for the coffee.
Every time.
Bring up retail.
"How may I assist you this morning, Mr. Larson?"
I wanna buy something for my wife.
What's the occasion?
Just because.
May I suggest jewelry?
I thought you might.
How about a ring?
A silver band.
Lined with amethyst.
Is amethyst your wife's favorite stone?
I just think it would look nice.
"Hey, that one."
It's perfect.
[pop music playing]
Pretty.
Can I have it?
No.
Don't touch that.
I got an idea.

Don't move.
I'm gonna smack that ball into Lake Michigan.

"-Aye, free."
And we'II take them together!
Is that the best you can do?
I'd say we've wiped out our bounty-hunter problem.
-For now.
-Aye.
For now.
I was wrong about you.
I acted foolishly as well.
"No hard feelings, aye?"
I'II buy you a refreshment.
"please, allow me."
I shall buy you a refreshment.
"No, no, I'II buy you one."

"Please, I don't mean to interrupt but am I close to the end of this bridge?"
"No, far from it."
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favourite toy.
So you got rid of him.
"Well, what ifAndy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?"
You gonna knock me outta the window too?
I don't think we should give him the chance.
"There he is, men."
Frag him!
Let's string him up by his pull string!
-I got dibs on his hat!
-Would you boys stop it!
Tackle him!
"No, no, no!"
Wait!
I can explain everything!
"Okay, Mom, be right down."
I've gotta get Buzz.
Retreat!
"Mom, do you know where Buzz is?"
"No, I haven't seen him."
"-Andy, I'm heading out the door!"
"-But, Mom, I can't find him!"
"Honey, just grab some other toy."
"Now, come on!"
"Oh, okay."
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.
"Honey, I'm sure he's around."
You'll find him.
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

What did you think of my mall walk mix?
Not bad.
A little surprised by all the Justin bieber.
Really?
I love her.
He's a guy.
They keep saying that.
But I'm not buying it.
What am I gonna do?
I-I broke them up.
He's gonna hate me.
"Oh, will."
"No, I cannot leave the ruins."
But their revenge will be carried out.
The four pirates are condemned.
They will perish.
We will go to meet them!
You will be too late.
That doesn't matter.
We've finally got you.
You will die here!
You little she-devils!
No magic can save you this time.
Stupid whores!
Take advantage of them again!
Tear it!
More.
Go on!
Tear!
Trash.
Bitch.
"Here I go, slut."
Hit the sluts!
Blood!
"Oh, yes!"
It's gonna hurt.
I'm gonna
- I'm gonna -
"Hurts, doesn't it?"
Arching -
You liked it?
Stop it.
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
Shut up!
Henschke!
We'll leave for a couple of days.
I'll let you know where we are.
Quiet!
You're coming along!
"Hey Mr Biberkopf, how are you?"
You've been away for a long time. 3 weeks.
Glogg stove?
"No, look."
- I'm not gonna buy that.
- It's a bandage anyway.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Paula.
Paula?
I don't know anyone named Paula.
What's that about?
"You are ill, Mr Biberkopf."
Minor injuries to your head and arm.
I need to get out of here!
I have work to do!
I need to get out!
I'll get a doctor.
Just a moment.
What is going on?
What happened to me?
"Excuse me, we need to get your personal data."
"You don't mind, do you?"
You've been run over by a car on May 12th on Eberswalder Straße.
"You are Biberkopf, Franz."
Car accident.
"Higher, all the way."
That's it.
You're awful big for 12.
"Oh, it's glands."
The whole family had glands.
"Why, my mother was 6'4""."
We called her shrimp.
"If you're only 12, you're pretty young to be traveling alone."
"Oh, well, that's all right."
I'm not scared.
I'm going be a space cadet.
Where are you going?
Home.
"Oh, here it is right here."
You're going to... (GROANING)
What's the matter?
"Oh, I'm train sick!"
The rocking.
Here's your ticket.
"Oh, I..."
I'm train sick.
The...
The rocking of the train.
I'm really sick.
I get nauseous on a train from rocking and when it goes fast and it shakes back and forth.
I'm really very sick from the train.
Would you please keep quiet?
Yeah.
"I dropped my gun, mister."
Wow!
(TITTERING)
My gun shoots milk.
But it's a bit late now.
She's a pretty girl.
I can see why you liked her.
Just one kiss and then we'll go and join the others.
What would you do without me?
Luke.
Lukey.
"I'm dying, mate."
I'm dying.
Just don't know that.
I've got holes in me.
I'm losing blood.
It's not rocket science.
I need a doctor... or I'm dead.
"One call, Luke."
"Give me one phone call, that's all I ask"
Just... just to give me a fighting chance.
I'm begging you.
That's it.
What're you doing?
"Luke, focus."
"We need... we need a phone, Luke."
Luke!
"Sorry, man."
Sorry.
This'll ease the pain.
"- Get away from me, you fucking coward!"
- I'm trying to help!
Luke.
Give me some.
What have you ever done for me?
"Everyone knows I'm a bitch, Luke."
Knock on the knocker!
Hi.
"I'm a fucking car, baby."
Lexus convertible!
"Oh, that's good."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Oh, God, that's amazing."
Yeah!
"Fellow, you're late!"
You're late!
"The last 15 minutes... have been a fucking rollercoaster of emotions for me, mate."
I didn't know if I was ever gonna see you again.
So I fired up some of this shit.
"Fire up my fucking nose, yeah?"
But there you are.
"It's okay, Henry."
You just lost power.
Come on.
"Hey, there!"
"Bring me some of that strong Russian shit, ladies."
"Okay, now where's that booster pump?"
Where is it?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking...
Yeah!
Fucking hell.
This is it.
"This is it, yeah?"
"Okay, hang on."
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, I gotta get this little fucker in there."
We'll get you out of here.
- What's your name?
- Ben.
"Hey, Ben."
I'm Doug.
Let's see if I can move some of this stuff out of the way here.
- How did you get caught in here?
- We were by the canal and the water started coming real fast.
"- Just get it out, please."
Just get it out!
- Mom told us to stay out of the tunnel.
"It ain't my fault, Joey."
The water just pushed me.
"All right, settle down, fellas."
It's nobody's fault.
- Are you okay?
- I'm cold and my leg hurts.
Let me take a look at it.
It's your lucky day.
I'm a doctor.
- Let me check this.
Does this hurt?
"- Yeah, a lot."
- Try not to move it.
- Is it broken?
- It might be.
"- Oh, no."
"- No, no...."
"- Don't cry, Ben."
"Yeah, Ben."
Don't cry.
It's nothing compared to what I've seen.
"- Yes, I do."
I gotta go.
This isn't right.
"- Yeah, it is."
"- No, no, no."
"Kim, it isn't."
And I don't know what I thought was gonna happen tonight.
I definitely know what I hoped was gonna happen tonight.
But this isn't cool.
"I really, really, really want to have sex with you."
Yeah.
I can tell.
- You can tell that?
- Yeah.
Subtle signs.
But I can't.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
Okay.
It's gonna be okay.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
"Hey, this is Michael..."
Do something for me.
What?
"Go home, tell her that it's over and leave her."
- I can't.
- What?
You're an amazing guy.
You wouldn't be here with me right now unless you knew something was missing in your life.
Don't kill her.
Of course not.
"But you, on the other hand..."
No!
Don't!
"Please, please."
No!
"Please, please."
David!
Please!
No!
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
My God.
Try the other zones.
Who's in the basement?
Let's see what's down there.
We're clear.
My God.
He only fired two shots.
"Oh, my God, it's David."
"Oh, my God!"
They must have thought he was dead.
Bled out.
He knew there was a gun hidden down here.
You still with me?
"Yeah, feel nauseous."
"Yeah, well, puke if you have to."
I haven't puked since college.
It's either a cat leg or a finger.
It's freaking me out.
Let's just get out of here before these people get home.
"Axl, we can't stop now!"
"We have come all this way, and why?"
For aunt Edie!
To give her the one thing in her life
She has always dreamed of!
Wait!
I remember!
It was a book.
You buried a book?
No.
"It was in a ""Nancy Drew"" book."
"She buried a time capsule,"
"And I always thought that I should do it,"
And I never did.
I'm digging a lot bigger hole.
I'll tell you one case Nancy Drew's not gonna solve!
Who's out there?
"Ooh, run!"
Run!
"Oh, look."
"Oh, ms."
Rinsky's here...
In our meeting.
Wow.
You look so pretty.
Is that a new top?
No.
Thank you for coming down.
"Whenever parents have a complaint,"
And... my heart is broken.
Yeah.
Nai would what to say to you right now.
"I can't talk to her, though."
"I just can't... talk to her, 'cause it's like... she's not our Nai anymore."
Exactly.
"I'm sorry, dad."
"I'm so sorry, daddy."
Hi.
Hi.
Nice shoes.
I hate talking about shoes with you.
I...
I hate that at's all we talk about.
I miss you.
I... where are you?
"Where... where did you go, Addison?"
"Like I said, nice shoes."
You came.
"No, wait."
I...
I need you to listen.
Just listen?
Um...
I want to be a good mother.
"I want to be a good mother so badly,"
"And, um, I'm trying to figure out how to do that, how to do that when I look at this baby and I feel..."
Uh...
Katie stole something from me.
"She changed me, and I don't know how to change it back."
"But I'm trying to be a good mother, okay?"
Okay.
Why did it have to be curry?
You like curry.
Since when?
What's wrong with her?
All right.
Wait!
You can't do it like that.
"She's a bride, she should look like a bride."
Like this.
What do you think?
"It's good, right?"
"Yes, it's fine."
"- Okay, you can take it."
"- All right, I'll take the picture."
Look here.
"Three, two-"
Wait!
"Hyang Gi, don't stick too close."
Why is the bride smiling so much?
"Hold the flower up, and you come out a bit, so that your face will come out smaller."
"- Good, right?"
- Yes.
"So that your face will be smaller, right."
"Okay, okay..."
Okay...
- Are the lights fine?
- Yes.
Can you take the picture slightly lower?
Right?
I think that'll be better.
"Ji Hyung, smile!"
Smile!
- Please...
- What?
It's 7-4-6-3.
Can you remember?
Everything's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
"- Go, go..."
- Okay.
Can you keep your pressure on it?
Okay.
- Did we do it?
- I think so.
- Will I die?
"- No, you can live a long time like this."
I need a doctor.
Can you take the bullet out?
It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.
Not the bullet.
You.
You wouldn't...
What?
"You wouldn't do that to me, would you?"
No.
- Somerset Textiles.
- Blackleg Miner.
- Send them in.
"- Yes, sir."
"All right, boys, come on."
Hats off.
"Well, what do you want?"
Why aren't you at your work?
"Well, Mr. Thompson, sir, we wanted to ask you."
Please don't fire Miss Griffith.
Get back to your work.
"- But, Mr. Thompson, please--"
"- Get back to your work, I said."
This is no Boy Scout camp.
Those days are over.
This is a reformatory.
Now get back where you belong.
You can't do that.
Oh.
Can't I?
"Now the rest of you boys, get out of here."
You stay.
I'll show you what I can do.
- Watch that door.
- Okay.
"It don't work, huh?"
Shh.
"Not so much noise, you guys."
Are you crazy?
We got enough food here to feed all the kids in the dormitory.
Shh!
Here comes somebody.
- It's Charlie.
- Get away from that door.
- Open up!
You guys were gone a long time.
Where's Franz?
What's she doing here?
She wanted to call the police for her Franz.
"You almost sunk us all, you and your Biberkopf."
- Where's Franz?
- The cops got him.
That's a lie!
Shut her up!
It's not true!
"Henschke, we'll be gone a few days."
I'll tell you the address.
Quiet!
You're coming with us.
"Good luck, Biberkopf."
Buy my little gadget!
"Peep, peep, peep The dickey bird sings"
Let me outta here!
- Push him out!
- He squealed on us!
"Well now, Mr. Biberkopf!"
Welcome back.
You were gone a long time ― three weeks.
You boiling some punch there?
Have a look.
I'm not buying that.
It's gauze for bandages.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Me?
Paula.
- And how.
- But you seem to be doing well.
- I'm great.
- But you seem to be doing well.
- I'm great.
"Why wouldn't you be great, with a friend like Russ here?"
- Yeah.
"Look at that, huh?"
"- Oh, jeez."
"Oh, boy."
How about that?
"Don't say a word, not one."
"Cause if i hear one comment like, ""What are you talking about?""..."
- I'm gonna call the cops.
- What?
Wh-What do you mean?
It slipped out.
We're listening.
Go ahead.
"I chewed on it for three days, and I'm convinced I have evidence to fuck you both up big time."
Bull.
You don't have any evidence.
What is that?
- Stop it.
Shut up.
You shut up.
- You shut up.
Shut up!
No.
That's bullshit.
"Dick, you have the floor."
You have the floor.
What?
!
# What's going on here #
# What's this all about #
# What do you think you're doing #
"Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always--"
"No, no, sing it!"
"No, I'm sick of singing!"
# Can you believe it?
What'd he just say?
#
# What's the matter with kids these days?
#
# Kids these days #
# Kids these days #
"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!"
"Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!"
Just let me go!
Go ahead... make my day.
"You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red handprints all over your face."
Ahgghgh!
"Oh, my God, what was that?"
!
Did you see that?
!
"Oh, my God, it hurt so bad!"
Agh!
"What the ""h"" is going on?"
!
What are you doing?
This is crazy!
"Well, I had to see it to believe it!"
So I can break this set up?
You mean from the other shot?
So like--
TRENT HAAGA:
Yeah.
-We're very late.
We're never gonna get a movie.
I'm just worried--
You're absolutely right.
Can we [inaudible]?
DAVE:
So I get from here to here.
Is that it?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Hey, Hasan."
Thank you.
That was great.
Thank you.
"Hang in, though."
We can still use you as the super stud that you are.
[Laugh]
"And we may need you as Toxie, too."
"Now, why is he getting out of the costume?"
Because he might be-
- I guess we got the real Toxie.
"Yeah, you're right."
WOMAN:
"I mean, I can put him back in it."
"Nah, it's all right."
Just stay handy.
"And we'll keep doing this, I think."
Like tomorrow we ought to do it also.
"Hello, Nina."
Take her to interrogation 819.
"Yes, sir."
What's the security configuration?
"Don't worry about it, Jack."
We're handling Nina.
"Ryan, you know what she's capable of."
That's none of your concern right now.
I'm sending you to medical to get checked out.
I'm fine.
I don't think you are.
What's this about?
We found evidence you've been injecting heroin.
"Tell me I'm off here, Jack."
Tell me I'm wrong.
I didn't think so.
"Ryan, I haven't missed a step."
I'm fine.
I have to cover my ass.
- I need to get you checked out.
- You're wasting time.
- Kim.
- Yeah?
I thought you'd want to know your dad's back.
What about Chase?
"Uh, he's a few minutes behind."
Thank you.
Kim.
Dad.
"Oh, god."
Hi.
She's here.
Why?
"Somebody's got to be a grown-up, and clearly, it's not you."
Uh... grown-ups drink.
I've been seeing someone.
Like...
A shrink?
Like a guy.
Who?
You don't know him.
And he doesn't drink?
He's been sober for 15 years.
Sounds horrible.
Wait.
Is that whose car is out front?
Yeah.
I'm on a waiting list for one of those.
How'd he get it?
He's a dealer.
Drugs?
Cars.
Asshole.
"So, where is he?"
He took the boys for a bike ride.
He's alone with the boys?
So?
"So you're giving me shit about my parenting skills, and some total stranger is off with..."
he's not a total stranger.
Yeah?
"Well, how well do you know this guy?"
Well.
How well?
Well enough that we're getting married.
I knew it.
- You asshole.
- I'm sorry.
"It is you that's been smoking too, isn't it?"
Wha...?
"Wait, what does that even matter?"
Have you...?
!
Have you been smoking?
No.
"No, I haven't."
I talked to Neil.
I told him.
He said I could stay at his boat for a while.
Excuse me?
Now you're moving out?
"- You're, like, leaving me?"
- No.
"No, I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to..."
Aren't we gonna deal with this?
Don't you wanna find some way for us to work through this?
"I assumed that when I told you, you would want me out."
Is that what you want?
No.
Okay.
Okay.
WOMAN 1:
You're doing a great job.
"Oh, my gosh, it's Bridget."
Hi!
WOMAN 2:
"Oh, my goodness."
That is the reason!
That will deepen the hatred between us.
I don't care!
You want us to kill own men!
"Yes, kill them all!"
- And if we won't?
- And if we won't?
"Listen, I want you to fight with your own men."
Only the winning side can survive.
Or all will be killed.
We have no choice!
"Tat-chi, do your best!"
Ming-kai!
- I won't use 8-divine Sword.
- You!
My fists will suffice!
"- Fung-wu, take the sword!"
- There's not much time left!
Take your sword!
Fung-wu!
Take it!
- Shoot!
- No shooting!
Stop!
No shooting!
Stop!
- Sister!
- Take the sword!
- Do it!
- No!
You must take the sword!
Sister!
"well, you can hear me, and I told you to hush up."
stella.
"Look, this is my house and I'II talk as much as I want to."
"-stella, don't start a row."
"-Oh, he's haIf-drunk."
I'II be out in a minute.
"What do you say, Mitch?"
"Come on, Mitch, are you in?"
"No, I'm out."
Who turned that on in there?
-I did.
Do you mind?
"-well, turn it off!"
"Come on, will you?"
Let the girls have their music?
stanley!
There you are.
I didn't hear you name it!
"-Didn't I name it, Mitch?"
-I wasn't listening.
What were you doing?
He was looking through the drapes.
-I was looking through no drapes.
-We're gonna play.
"We're gonna deal this hand again, play cards or quit."
deal me out.
"AII right, this game's gonna be Spit in the Ocean."
Yes?
hello.
Excuse me.
The little boy's room is occupied right now.
"Oh, excuse me."
I don't get to do a door slam on me.
I do a door slam on you.
This is my bar!
That means I get the last
- friggin' door slam.
"- Oh, yeah?"
What about this?
!
- What about this?
!
- Ha-ha!
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah!
- Moving out.
"- Oh, yeah."
Aha!
"So, Trent wouldn't give the ring back?"
Tell me how that went down.
It was dimly lit.
Through the darkness I saw an Adonis.
"He looked at me, I looked at him."
The nipple went in my mouth.
I loved it.
I can still picture it now.
"Brett, are you OK?"
Are we not doing flashbacks any more?
"Anyway, I'm not giving up."
We're going to get that diamond back.
How do you get at diamond out of a guy's mouth?
How stupid can the guy be?
Let's just think.
For a year I was Trent oregano dealer.
"Now, you say it."
Is beautiful.
Tonight.
What?
What?
What're you doing?
"You're the guy's wife, Cora."
You told me that.
You were gonna leave me?
-I was writing you a note.
-Were you writing me a thank-you note?
-Is that what you were doing?
"-Cora, look."
Live here.
Live with the guy.
"Took a chance, we didn't make it."
Live with the man.
He wants to have a baby.
You understand?
He's changed.
He says the accident changed him and now I'm supposed to have his kid.
"How am I gonna do that, Frank?"
How am I supposed to have his baby?
I can't have his baby.
The only one I could have a baby by is you.
Okay.
Say you won't leave me.
Please.
"Just stall him, babe."
Just stall him.
-Going far?
-We're goin' to Ventura.
You know what?
I need to un-know that!
Your friend is here.
Chuck.
Thanks for coming.
"Yeah, well, I don't have a lot of time, so can we do this?"
"Hey, no, don't!"
Don't!
Shut up.
Do it.
"Okay, this is gonna sting a little at first, but after a few seconds, you're gonna be feeling much more cooperative."
"No, stop it!"
"Help me hold him, please."
Don't!
"Okay, I'm giving him a low dose, but he's gonna conk out any minute, so you guys are gonna have to act fast."
There we go.
All right.
Let's take this again.
Where's his ex-wife?
I-c-
- I c-
- I can't.
Just relax.
That's it.
Calm down.
Where did you hide her?
Cy-
- Cyprus.
She's in Nicosia...
Under the name...
Yasmine...
Sadek.
"Hi, honey."
Is that my phone in your pocket?
Or are you just happy to see me?
"Oh, God, that's all kinds of wrong."
"Uh, no."
Mine.
"- Okay, I'm gonna go shower."
- Okay.
Quick.
How do I write her back?
Just text her everything ys.
"Yeah, compliment her face without makeup, and tell her it's the best sex you ever had."
This is my son.
"Oh, they're here."
"All right, uh."
"Look, I'd love to stay... and help you pretend to be your son, but I have to go pretend I'm dying."
Hello.
I'm Victoria Chase.
This is Dr. Lori Hernandez.
I'm Dr. Robert Moore.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Ah.
Likewise.
"I'm sorry for staring, but I'm just surprised at how well you look."
"Oh, thank you, but I'm tired."
So very tired.
Please sit.
I know that I need to.
"Hmm, that's very odd."
What?
You're not limping at all.
Limping?

What's the story?
"Yes, I, too, would like to know."
"I don't have it all figured out, but it's about this girl after, like, an atomic war, and she has to learn how to survive on her own."
"Well, now that's depressing."
- I think it's cool.
- Depressing and cool.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
"So, get over here as fast as you can."
What the...?
Where'd she go?
I think I'm really hurt here.
"Help me, you son of a bitch."
"I mean, even out here, right?"
"Someone always does, eventually."
"I'm sorry I hit you, man."
"I'm really sorry, man."
"What were you doing, running in the middle of the road, anyhow?"
Can I move my...
No.
Bug out of here.
"Hey, stop."
I need help.
I'm down here.
Get off me.
You look pretty tasty.
Get away from me.
I think I'll start with your eyes.
Get away from me.
"Yum. ""Ant-solutely"" delicious."
"Please, don't hurt me."
"You're a real mess, my friend."
"I mean, seriously racked up."
Please.
Save your strength.
That would be my advice.
You'll need it.
Help me.
"You'll be all right, fellow."
Just lie still.
I think I'm paralysed.
Can you...
You'll be all right.
"- Pop that shirt off, and we'll start punching."
"- Oh, my God."
Really?
"- Yeah, man."
Every time I'm gonna take...
- Why can't you just take it off?
- Just take it off.
- You're ruining the moment.
- What is with you and the moment?
You know what?
Forget it.
Forget it.
- Who do you want to punch you first?
- I don't care.
- That was good.
"- Well, you caught me off guard."
That was a big part of it.
- That was the same spot.
"The same, exact spot."
- Yeah.
"Charlie, if we keep this up, you're gonna be... the best underground street fighter ever, bro."
- Okay.
Okay.
Deandra.
- Just 10 more minutes.
"- No, no."
That's it.
"Dee, that's..."
- I love it.
I need more of it.
It's dangerous.
Enough.
"We're here with you, Stan."
Stan.
Stan.
Now do you believe me?
Shut up.
There must be an explanation.
You sure you put him in the incinerator?
Yeah.
He's ashes.
I don't know who or what we just saw but it's not the same guy.
That cold.
"He's here in the house, with us."
"It's like ice in here, boss."
"What I don't understand is, why did he come to this house?"
Has he ever been here before?
Never.
I barely knew him.
I met you all for the first time last night.
Go.
Let's go.
Wait.
Don't leave me.
"Please, don't leave me."
Go on and see what it is.
He's been gone five minutes.
Where the devil is he?
I don't know.
Maybe he's with Stan.
I'm going up there.
Look!
One of my murderers is dead.
The others will also die.
I killed them for you.
You did it for yourself.
"Why did you write to me, then, Jess?"
Because I love you.
And you were the only person I could turn to.
"You're all I've got right now, Jess."
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
I promise.
JESS:
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
Are you ready?
One condition.
Just this.
Then we're done.
I'll talk to Calum.
He'll get you everything you need.
You talking to me?
You what?
You what?
Haha haha!
"Check this, yo."
Don't point a gun at me ever again.
Where'd you get it?
Kosovan Kate.
Who's Kosovan Kate.
She works with the Albanians.
Here.
You need to wear these.
Give the old bill an head start.
"So she's setting up her own people, is she?"
I never left you.
I could have lived with you.
And him.
Love cannot be wrong.
"But I will leave him, if it means losing you."
I give my life to you.
Tilo!
Tilo!
- Are you OK?
- (Coughs)
Are you OK?
I woke up and you were gone.
I read your note.
I crossed the bridge and just as I got to the other side the quake hit.
Are you sure you're OK?
Yes.
Let's get you out...
Let's get you out of here.
(Coughs)
"Tilo Mistress, you have shown your devotion to the spices."
The spices know you will never leave them.
"Doug, I'm not leaving."
You're staying with me.
I mean here.
I'm not leaving here.
"Tilo, there's nothing left here."
This is my home.
I guess I can help you rebuild it.
You never told me what my spice is.
Sesame.
Tilo.
(Inhales)
"Do you love me, Frank?"
Sure.
You know I do.
"Don't worry about anything, okay?"
Don't tell me that.
Evening.
"You knew I had to stop here, didn't ya?"
She's beautiful.
I come by here all the time.
When'd you put her up?
-Just today.
-Had to be.
What was that?
-There's a damn cat up there.
"-Oh, yeah."
"Hey, they sound a lot like babies cryin' sometimes, don't they?"
"Yes, they do."
"Well, I expect I ought to get back to work."
"Yeah, well, we all got to sometime, that's for sure."
That's for sure.
Take care now.
"Yeah, I'll do that."
"Frank, get over here!"
"Oh, my God!"
What happened to the light?
I hit him!
I hit him!
-What happened?
-I hit him and all the lights went out!
Get on the phone.
Call an ambulance.
The cop came by and saw everything.
-What 'they say?
Dad where's Wes?
Jacob.
We'll get him back.
[Kids steps]
Wes!
What are you doing here?
-Why you never call me back?
What's that?
-I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
-I don't know.
"Look, I'm gonna race next week."
Alright?
"I'm gonna win for you and dad, whole town's gonna see it."
Okay.
"-I need you to be there, okay?"
You gotta tell Pam.
Wes?
[Ring]
Let me go.
"Hey mom's still at her bridge club, you wanna come in for a cold one."
(Hollis) I gotta get back.
"Everything's gonna work out just fine, man."
What 'you worried about.
Yeah.
Put some clothes on.
You scaring the kids.
You alright with riding this one?
"Well, come on, get in."
[Roaring engines].

So how was London?
Quiet.
"No bombing since Tuesday, apparently."
I meant the exhibition.
Very successful.
I will never let him near you.
Okay?
Ever.
I know you won't.
Good?
Yeah.
Riley and I will sweep this area.
Thank you.
Can I have my gun back?
No.
"Come on, just, come on."
"You guys know what a jammer looks like, right?"
Does it have like a fan on it?
Fuck.
I knew he'd find a way to fuck this up.
He always does.
He has not changed at all.
"Ollie, can you please just stop?"
He's still my brother.
It's not in here.
What the hell?
I already checked there.
What?
Nothing.
"Dude, I'm just sayin', don't let 'im talk to you like that."
Fuck 'im.
"No, seriously, you say the word,"
"I'll clan his ass, son."
"Don't worry about it, all right."
I need you to focus.
"Come on, Riley."
Help me out.
Good!
# This is Flora's holiday... #

# This is Flora's holiday. #
"Good night, Mr Kirkby."
Night.
I'm meeting my dad.
See you!
"See you, Hewitt."
"We've done the chairs, Mr Kirkby."
"Are you all right, Mr Kirkby?"
It's this leg.
Gets bad in the cold.
Just need a minute.
Do you want me to go and tell you when the bus is coming?
Then you don't have to stand in the cold.
I walk home.
I'm only down Pattison Street.
That's near me.
"I can walk with you, sir."
I don't think you walk as slow as me.
I can do.
I like walking slow.
"And if I walk on the side of your cold leg it might warm it up, and then it might feel better."
You can lean on me.
I'm dead strong.
I'm always carrying coal and spuds and that for Mam.
"Come on, Tubby!"
Hello!
"Oh, you came."
"Pauline, this is Tubby."
"You remember, I told you."
"Look, we gotta find a weapon."
All right?
There's nothing here.
What are you gonna do with that tiny knife?
Who are you?
- Who are you?
"- No, no."
Wait.
"Stay away, stay away."
We're not gonna hurt you.
"It was Vivian, right?"
Yeah.
Where's that guy that was with you?
I don't know.
I don't know him.
He was...
He was behind me.
Gimme your phone.
You have a phone?
Did you call someone?
"We did, we, got a call out."
Are they coming?
We're not sure.
They're not coming.
"The signal was in and out, but, it still might have gone through."
"Look, Vivian, we need to find a way out."
I can't.
I can't.
"Do you know of anything, any way out?"
Are you sure he was behind you?
Yes.
I don't trust her.
- Bishop Allen.
- Tilt up.
Tilt up.
There they are.
- Those guys were great.
- I say hi and then they say hi.
- This song was stuck in my head after.
"- Yeah, I love this song."
It's a great song.
It's a great song.
- This is one of my favorite...
- Is that her?
- That was the girl in the background.
- It was?
Here's one my favorite Ari Graynor moments.
Here it comes.
What?
Can we get a ride?
"- Oh, that's..."
- That's you.
"Is that ""we""?"
Here it comes.
"Sorry, Tris, the car's full."
- It is full.
- Is she gonna hiccup or something?
Are you mad at me?
What I love about that is the gum that's...
The gum is just about to fall out of your mouth.
You look so messy.
It's like Andy Capp.
"Remember the impossible, like, cigarette dangling?"
That's like you and the gum.
We will see how she does in the office.
I am sure she is going to do well.
"She is my friend, after all."
- Yeah.
"Anyway, you guys carry on."
I will see you later.
Yeah?
You witch..
'I am writing this diary only because..'

"Hi, mom."
How are you?
I am fine.
You tell me.
I told you to call me up after you reach office.
"I am so sorry, mom."
I was very busy with office work.
You always make excuses.
Your papa misses you a lot.
Okay.
Tell me.
How is your office?
"Very good, mom."
Even my boss is very friendly.
Gul.
"Okay, mom."
I got to go.
Pia is calling me.
I am very late for office.

You killed Will.

You poor girl.
You never deserved this.
I know part of you is still there.
Ellia please!
This isn't you!
Zaddik!
Are you alright?
Don't try to move.
It was Ellia.
But it wasn't her fault.
Over here!
Come on.
"No, no, you people need to go back to the village."
It is not safe here!
Who is that?
Don't you remember me?
No.
It can't be.
You were taken by the Daemus.
No father.
Father?
I don't understand.
You're his son?
"If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old."
Precisely.
There's another one of those things out there.
Look what it did to Zaddik.
- Yes.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
How many children do you have?
Ten.
Five girls and five boys.
Five boys and five girls...
Bravo!
Thank you.

Good day.
How are you?
What can I say?
We're all ready.
Everything's fine.

Up here...
Yes...
We're getting bored too but... lt seems to be the only solution.
There's no doubt about it.
"It could be any day now, we can't say..."
She hasn't eaten for three days.
"No, there's no doubt."
We just have to wait.
There's no other solution.
Can I ask a favour of you?
My--my jeans?
My cowboy shirt?
What?
A few things might have come from there.
I don't know.
"Ok, then let's go the other way with it, ok?"
What didn't come from the big and tall shop?
Ok.
I will show you.
The thing is they use very good fabric.
"There's nothing in there, is there?"
"Yes, there is."
This.
"Ok, fine."
Great.
"Well, you know what?"
"This is what I'm gonna be wearing from now on, so you better get used to it, missy, ok?"
I can't feel my hands.
"Hi, babe."
What are you doin'?
Lookin' at myself in various stages of fatness.
Look at this.
Come here.
Watch this.
You can actually see me gaining weight.
Hey.
Watch this.
And there goes my neck.

- Let's go someplace else.
"- Director Kim, that wasn't right."
What?
You shouldn't have done that.
You shouldn't treat people like that.
Go and apologize.
I'm serious.
Go apologize.
What's wrong with you?
You don't do that to people!
Even if he's a waiter!
This isn't right.
"Go and apologize, okay?"
- You really should.
- I won't!
Why on earth should I?
You could still bleed out.
"Emerson, lie to a girl, will you?"
- Bite down.
- I think it's starting to hurt.
Bite.
That was bizarre.
Emerson!
Yeah.
I thought you left me.
How long was I out?
Little while.
Not long.
We were ambushed.
Yeah.
"So, what?"
What?
They wanted to stop the broadcasts?
You know as much as I do.
"Yeah, but we didn't do anything wrong."
Right?
We were ambushed.
Sit back down.
All the audio files are there.
We had nothing to do with it.
So...
They can't blame us for anything.
Why are you looking at me like that?
- We're fine.
We were ambushed.
- Calm down.
I am calm.
But what are we gonna do next?
Woman:
Are you done with that?
He did not!
Hey.
What do you want from me?
"Dad, it's me."
I stuck out my neck for you.
Now you live up-- [sigh] All right.
What took you so long?
They had to make the shit.
"Okay, so I got yours with no onions."
How you like it.
"Dad, you at least have to take a bite of it."
I will.
You should call a doctor.
"I told you, it's just a panic attack."
You sure your mom's okay with you staying here?
"Yeah, she seemed fine."
Did you ask her?
- No.
- That's what I thought.
"Well, she's been really busy lately."
She's on the phone more than usual.
"How's your mom and, uh, and your aunt Callie?"
How are they doing?
Gross.
I don't know.
Okay?
- I don't ask.
- I don't blame you.
Can you watch anything else?
Yeah.
What's the news?
Nothing special.
Take care.
Mrs Parvin!
I'm bringing you soup.
May your wishes come true.
is she well?
Yes.
Have you finished?
"If you hear me, hold the line, I'm going to higher ground."
I'm going higher up.
Hold the line.
"If you hear me, I'm not hanging up."
I'm going to higher ground so we can talk.
"If we're cut off, call me back."
"Yes, hello..."
It's you.
I thought it was Mrs Godarzi.
I told you not to call me.
I'll call you.
Godarzi calls me about work.
So why have you brought me all the way up here?
"I'm sorry, go ahead."
Really?
When?
I can't be there.
Tell them you couldn't reach me.
How is she?
Better?
"Hello, are you well, father?"
I'm listening. I'll be home soon.
I've bought it for you. lt's red.
I think we both know it didn't go as well as we'd have liked.
But I've heard from your previous employer and she speaks of you in glowing terms.
"So, I've decided to offer you the job."
Yes!
Yes!
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Bang!
Yes!
I got you the job!
I got you the job!
"Oh, I got a job!"
Oh!
That is brilliant.
I'm gonna take you for a walk on the seafront.
"- Cos, boy, do I know how to celebrate!"
- Yeah.
- We got a job.
- Yeah.
- Ajob!
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Oh!
"- Get out of here, you."
Oh!
You're dressed already.
What a shame.
- I'm not sure about this.
"- Oh, that was Number Two's."
He was a smallish gentleman.
That's why he only lasted such a short time.
But I think it's a close enough fit.
"Yeah, well, I usually go for a more relaxed vibe."
"Oh, but the great and the good are gathering."
"No, really, I'm fine."
Fine?
You must be exhausted.
"Multitasking, multi-flirting."
"No, I'm used to it."
"I think jealousy uses much more energy, negative energy."
Are you feeling okay?
"Oh yeah, I'm good."
I'm going over to Ricky's tonight.
"Okay, everyone out!"
"(SIGHS) Thanks, Adrian, see you around."
See you later.
Text me.
"So, let me guess."
You're going over to Ricky's to meet Amy?
"Yeah, she says she wants to meet me."
She wants to be friends.
"You know her, right?"
"Yeah, I know her."
And I kind of doubt she wants to be friends with you.
She's not going to like you.
She's probably setting you up.
It is a setup.
They're introducing me to someone.
Who?
"I don't know, but, uh, should be fun."
Could I have some more coffee?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I just ran out.
I'll have to make you some new coffee.
Hi.
Hi yourself.
You can't do this.
"C'mon, I bet you enjoy this."
"C'mon, look at her."
Look at me.
Her name's Betty.
"Bet he's got a nice, big weenie."
Look at me...
"Please, look at me..."
"C'mon buddy, look at Betty."
Morons.
What the hell!
You morons.
Why don't you stop fucking around?
Weren't you taught to not bother others?
"Say something, dammit."
"Hey, man!"
Why don't you shut up?
"Don't hit us, we're just pretending!"
Pretend in the damn room!
"Manager, what're you doing?"
Shut the hell up!
I don't care!
I'm gonna quit this damn place!
You listen.
I'm gonna get a job at a nice hotel.
Then I'll pay you back.
And I'll find me a better girl!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Suzuki San?
I'm running away!
Need a bike?
Jesus!
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
"Well, where the hell were you?"
"Watch it, watch it."
- What are you doing?
- For the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!
"Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster."
Ah...
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
"Just get ready to run, whatever happens to me."
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
Damn it!
Don't you leave me down here by myself!
Indy!
Here we go!
Get ready!
"Indy, the torch is going out!"
Indy?
Marion!
Look.
Look.
They're going to fly it out of here.
"When that Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on the plane."
"Police, stay!"
Told you to stay!
My father may have Alzheimer's now.
He was awesome in South Asia 30 years ago.
You playing me?
I can't find the guy.
I give you 2 days to find him.
Or you are dead.
That's it.
What's wrong with you?
You've never listened.
Go to the toilet.
You too?
What the hell?
What?
"Look, numskull!"
You hit a cop?
How dare you are?
It's a tiger head.
Should have said so.
Forget it.
Let's go...
"Hey, who are you looking for?"
Someone with a scorpion tattoo.
Scorpion Yong?
I know where he is.
Let me go.
Wasn't that an intense toilet experience?
Intense?
Come later and I could have died.
"Well, you're the one who needed the toilet."
I asked you to come along.
Me neither.
"Easy, now."
You went through the trouble to save my life.
It'd be a shame to kill me.
"You all right, Rodney?"
"Yeah, just peachy."
What the hell was that?
The retrovirus is having the opposite effect than we intended.
I guess so.
"Oh, god."
On the...
"Yeah, but..."
Ellia?
You poor girl.
You never deserved this.
I know part of you is still there.
"Ellia, please."
This isn't you.
Zaddik!
Are you all right?
Don't try to move.
It was Ellia... but it wasn't her fault.
Over here!
"Here, come on!"
"No, no, no!"
You people need to go back to the village!
It is not safe here.
Who is that?
Don't you remember me?
No... it can't be.
You were taken by the Daimos.
"No, father."
YOU CAN COME AND VISIT.
YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND PLAY?
YES.
GO.
"PRAMOD, PRAMOD."
"No, you've already had some."
Go away!
"Come on, Pramod."
You have to go to class.
- They want to meet you.
- Me?
What do you mean?
- They want to meet you.
- Why?
I don't know.
They just want to meet you.
The CEO is Danish.
He wants to shake your hand before giving us the money.
Perhaps he doesn't trust us Indians.
"- Let him come, I'll shake his hand."
- They want you to go to Copenhagen.
"I know what he wants, but I'm not going there."
"""This is the cat..."""
"""...that killed the rat."""
It's not possible.
I can't leave the kids.
"""That lay in the house..."""
"""...that Jack built."""
Pramod has a birthday soon.
"It's not possible, Mrs. Shaw."
"""That worried the cat..."""
Franz is coming too.
"Yes, he'll join us this evening."
You know him and me are friends.
All right.
Then I can talk to you about Franz.
Sure.
Where is he?
Freienwalde.
Karl will drive us.
There must be lots you can tell me about Franz.
"Yeah, lots."
"He's a good fellow, if a bit of a softie."
He cried on the stairs last night.
He wants out.
He's not a criminal!
- He's starting that again?
- Not him ― me!
"You, kitten?"
I see.
Let's have a kiss.
Kiss me!
You're quite a girl!
You give me ideas!
To think he works with men like you!
Shame on you!
"Yeah, shame on me!"
Let me go or I'll scream!
Go ahead!
Scream your head off!
Here.
Think you can run home and rat on me to Franz?
"""Reinhold tried to kiss me, and I let him have it!"""
Come with me.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
Do you dance?
"Oh, but the treatment."
Try this.
"Oh, that's wonderful."
Try it again.
Turn around.
(MUSIC STOPS)
But what about the treatment?
"Oh, I know what great lovers you Frenchmen are."
Kiss me.
"Oh, that's good."
You!
What are you doing with my wife?
"Uh, massaging the scalp."
"Oh, oh, pardon moi."
The jacket.
It's very warm here.
The jacket.
"Merci beaucoup, mademoiselle."
I ought to kill you for this.
(GRUNTING)
If you lay one...
"If you lay un hand on me, you know what I will do?"
What?
I'll bleed.
Au revoir.
"If I ever see your ugly face again, I'll kill you."
I want you to get out of town and stay out.
"(IN NORMAL VOICE) Yeah, all right, but I can't leave from up here."
Is there anything else?
Don't let him get in your head.
"Don't let him get in your head, Dave."
I know a place you will like.
Really?
Yes.
You will love it.
What kind of place?
Like a place that has dancing?
There is everything.
Everything?
"Oh, my God, you guys, I want to go dancing!"
You want to go?
"Yes, please, regard me."
Follow me.
"Oh, my God, yeah, I want to go!"
It'll be a girls' night!
"Okay, but, honey, honey, honey..."
"Oh, my God."
You should just slow down here for a second maybe?
That's exactly what I need!
It's the second guitar solo that sorts the men from the boys.
"I was kind of counting on that, Sctan."
Joey?
Yeah?
I think it's time to show the donkey the snake.
"Cut his head, cut his head, cut his head!"
"Go, go, go!"
Dave!
Dave!
Cut his head!
Big finish.
Star power!
!
I told you dumbasses to shovel the walk!
Crap.
It's Dad.
He's coming for us.
We're so dead!
You get your asses out of there before that thing collapses and traps you in an icy tomb.
Stay strong.
We're untouchable in here.
Untouchable?
I'll show you untouchable!
He's shimmying!
"Oh, no!"
He's entering the snow fort!
I never thought this would happen!
Ah!
I'm stuck!
I can't move my arms!
My arms are stuck!
How are your arms stuck?
It's snow.
It's soft.
I'm wedged in!
My circulation's failing me!
I can feel it!
I'm gonna die in here!
He thinks he's dying.
Stop laughing!
Stop laughing at me right now!
Why are we hiding from this man?
Look at him.
These are my last breaths!
Better!
[Groans]
"Okay, Lance."
Here you go.
Excellent.
Mother will be most pleased.
"Oh, you be sure to say hi."
Such a nice lady.
"Please, Mrs. Forman, there's no need to keep up the charade."
Fine.
She's cold.
Get out.
I just want you to know that I don't need these fries.
I choose to eat them because I desire their salty taste.
"Please, just take the fries."
"You need me to take them, don't you?"
Needy bastard.
"Hi, Fez."
Can I talk to you?
"Oh, you need permission, do you?"
I think I was a little too hasty breaking up with you.
- Really?
- Yes.
I like the new Fez.
- What about the old Fez?
- Not so much.
"You know what, Nina?"
There's only one Fez... and that is a Fez with needs.
"And if you don't like that, then we shouldn't be together."
"- But, Fez, I-"
- Shh!
"Sorry, baby."
Something's very wrong here.
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.
I'm from DC.
Look.
"It's a wallet, okay?"
Wallet?
I'm from DC.
My name is John Klein.
Washington Post?
Yes.
Yes.
Can I get out of this shower now?
"You can wait for me outside, Mr. Klein."
We'll run a check on him.
"Anyone else comes by, forget the gun."
Just call me.
Just find out what he wants.
"So, you didn't actually see the guy before tonight?"
No.
But I heard the knocking.
Three nights in a row.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
"I'm gonna give you a ride into town, unless you wanna sleep in your car."
I can call for a tow in the morning.
You're a long way from DC.
What are you doing here?
Driving through.
"We're not on the way to anyplace, Mr. Klein."
I recognize you.
DC Review.
- You watch that?
I didn't get your invitation card.
Damn it.
"If I'd a gun,"
I'd have blown his head off.
"Pity, you've been suspended."
I'll get a gun tomorrow.
Is that easy to buy one in HK?
"A toy gun would do, baby."
This is it.
Chinese Tea.
You can go home when we are done.
Sure.
Take care of Lisa.
I know you'll take good care of her.
Scorpion Yong.
"You want trouble, I'll give you trouble."
Revenge?
Lucky I heard about it...
Fight me!
Try fighting with my gun!
Fight now?
"Michael, wait."
Be careful...
Did you kill my brother Lin Long?
Lin Long?
I killed many in my fights.
But we'd signed fight contracts.
Which clan are you from?
We are the police!
"Whatever, please put down your gun."
I'm afraid of guns.
I beg you.
Linda's coming in.
"Uh, okay."
"Well, you do that."
I'm just gonna drink a lot of wine.
That guy must really know what he's doing.
"Why, because he's slurping?"
Mm...
Ugh!
"Oh, my."
Excuse me!
Hey!
Hi!
Are you some kind of an expert?
I just overheard you doing that sound...
Oh.
I'm a wine enthusiast.
Although I'm not enthused by this first flight.
Oh!
He's hysterical.
You should come taste with us.
Oh!
You can give us tips on how to get tipsy.
Sure.
"Lin, no."
I don't want to drink with that guy.
Why?
"I do, Bobby."
He's an expert.
"Well, I was looking forward to a relaxing day off."
"I wasn't even gonna talk to you that much, to be honest."
I just don't want to drink with the guy...
Hi...
Are you a cop?
Talk to this man!
She's like your sister...
Your sister maybe!
"To me, she looks like a ravishing film-star!"
Don't touch me.
Or else...
I haven't yet.
But here goes!
I'll show you now...!
Let me see what you have.
Let go of my hand!
Let go of her hand first.
"Go away, Janki."
"Come along, aunty!"
Take the doctor and leave!
"Take Mom away, Bharti!"
"Let's go, Mom!"
Please!
I'm about to lose my temper!
Let go of my hand!
No one dares touch me here!
Bloody rat!
You can touch women!
"But women can't touch you, eh?"
I want to ask your Mom what she ate before delivering you!
Shera!
Ashok!
Kaliya!
I spare you because you're a woman.
Or else...
Don't just stand here!
"Well, what do they say?"
That I should die.
"That I'm worthless, that I'm evil, stupid."
- I'm so sorry.
- That I'm...
"No, it's, um..."
"Yeah, it's terrifying."
Do they ever say good things?
"You know, like:"
"""Your hair smells like cupcakes."""
Or:
"""I don't wanna leave you."""
"No, they never say that."
"Well, then your voices are idiots."
- What is it?
- It's a labyrinth.
"You think of a question,"
- okay?
- A question.
Mm-hm.
Something in your life that needs an answer and then you just walk the path.
And maybe you'll get an answer.
Okay.
A question.
Lucy.
- He hates you.
- This is when you die.
I can't.
I can't do this.
You're disgusting.
- I can't.
- You're disgusting.
You have to come back to me!
"Do you hear me, Josie?"
Josie!
Josie?
!
Don't!
Don't!
Please don't lock me in here!
Don't!
Please!
No!
I just want to go home!
Please!
Lies.
Lies.
Lies!
I said her name.
I forgot.
It's all right.
"Garcia, were you able to trace it?"
No.
I was so close.
But I have the cell tower it pinged off of.
I just sent that to your phones.
"What's this area like, Sergeant?"
Mostly blue-collar residential.
What about that area?
It looks pretty secluded.
That's where the old railroad spur line used to come into town.
Mostly just abandoned structures out there now.
We're on it.
There.
"If nothing else, kill me, please."
Make this end.
- You're gonna be...
"You're gonna be okay, Mary."
You're gonna be okay.
"- ""The gardens at midnight... beneath the gnome."""
- Isabel.
- Ah!
"Foul demon, leave me be!"
- What's wrong with you?
- He knows everything.
You will tell him and he'll hurt me!
- Isabel.
Isabel.
"Please, you can trust me."
- You keep calling me Isabel.
I am Mary.
But I remember you.
Margaret!
"- Jesus Christ, what did they do to you?"
What did they do to you?
- I dreamt I killed you.
- I'm still here.
- Did I hurt you?
Margaret!
No!
How can it be?
Why would you help me if I did this to you?
- You're my friend.
I know it wasn't you who did that.
We can't stay here.
You have to tell me everything.
"Yes, Cedric."
- Ethel will find you a taxi.
- Taxi?
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Before I dropped off, didn't you have a moustache, Sergeant?"
"Yes, Cedric."
"That dropped off, too."
Away with you.
"Well, good luck to your endeavours."
Thank you.
We'll need it.
"Oh, dear."
Oh...
"- Now, where were we?"
- My plan.
I'll polish him off but I'll need an alibi from you.
Hey!
I asked you to sit down.
Get that thing out of my face.
I've been abducted by aliens.
You think I care about your little toy trumpet?
( group gasps )
RAY:
"You sit down, hero, or I will shoot your bride-to-be."
DR PENZLER:
"Ray, I'm sure if we talk about this, we can work it out."
"Ray, listen to Dr Penzler."
It's gonna be all right.
DR PENZLER:
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

"- Thank you, Pete."
And this is my attorney:
Lance Lord.
I believe these are yours.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Hi.
How are you?
Thank you for doing this on a Sunday.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Don't mind if I do.
- Yeah.
"To be honest, I'm a little fuzzy on what this is we're doing."
"Uh, Dr. Barrett's made an offer on the farm."
An offer to buy it.
I've accepted.
I just need you to review these terms.
I represent supplies in the farm-to-table business.
We buy non-working farms and get them working again.
Okay.
Um...
"Dr. Barrett, if you can give us a moment,"
I need to confer with my client.
- Lance...
- It's just a quick chat.
If you don't mind.
"It's, uh, it's okay."
Of course.
"Uh, take all the time you need."
"I'll be, uh, outside."
Lance:
I would.
I know you would.
–Who did this to you?
–Fleetwood.
That prick that got Joe kicked off the force?
Yeah.
Joe's goin' after him.
You gotta stop him.
Okay.
You gotta stop him.
"–Come on, guys."
We're losing blood.
–Just hang in there.
–Gotta go.
–Just hang in there.
"Detective Wyms, Carlson just called."
There's a homeless guy with a bloody machete saying he killed somebody.
–Where?
–Just south of Bell on Vine.
That's a block from Kayla's apartment.
Where's Dutch?
I don't know.
Maybe he's checking in on Vic.
Have you heard anything?
Not yet.
Find Dutch.
Tell him to meet me there.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
They got the guy?
"–Sir, put the knife down, please."
–I'll kill again!
What are you doing?
"Between you and me, I can't wait to find out."
"Right, if you look after everyone here, then I can..."
Clara!
Doctor!
That was stupid!
"You were stupid, too!"
"I'm allowed, I'm good at stupid!"
That's the way to do it!
Why does she keep saying that?
"Mirroring, random mirroring."
We need to get on the roof.
This way!
"I do the hand grabbing, that's my job, that's always me!"
"Come on, quickly!"
Agh!
What are you doing?
My bustle is stuck.
Your bustle?
!
You're going to have to take those clothes off!
I didn't mean...
I know.
"I understand, I do."
Good.
What's the plan?
Who said I've got a plan?
Course you've got a plan.
You took that.
Maybe I'm an idiot.
"You're not, you're clever."
Really clever.
"Brucey, Moreno, Lung-Dog..."
"I mean, all those guys started investing a couple months back."
They're doing well.
"I mean, so..."
"Like, if those idiots can do stuff in the stock market, why can't I?"
"Oh, my God, what are you gonna..."
You're gonna apply your grade nine education to the stock market?
I'm not...
That's...
Shh.
Yeah.
Go.
Be quiet.
Hey.
Sorry.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, what's up?"
Tim here?
Billy.
Yeah.
Came to bring you this.
What's this?
It's the money you owe those guys.
I don't want you to get beat up again.
I'm not bringing you into this.
"You're not bringing me into anything, Tim."
Is this why you came over?
Yeah.
And I'm not...
I'm not coming back here anymore.
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.
"I've looked everywhere, Max."
Where could she be?
"Well, look at what the catfish dragged in."
[Laughs] Look at ya.
Look at ya.
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.
I got it.
"It's your hairdo, right?"
You've been usin' the dinglehopper?
No?
"No, huh?"
"Well, let me see."
New seashells?
No new seashells.
I gotta admit I can't put my foot on it right now.
If I stand here long enough...
"She's got legs, you idiot!"
She traded her voice to the sea witch and got legs.
"Geez, man!"
I knew that.
Ariel's been turned into a human.
"She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he's gotta kiss her."
[Sebastian] And she's only got three days!
Just look at her!
On legs!
On human legs!
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!
What would her father say?
He looks like one of those make-believe toys.
"You know, like you wind up."
He's beautiful.
"I hope Ralph'll like him as much as you do, Ed."
"Oh, boy, I'm telling you, when Ralph sees this little fella here, he'll go out of his mind."
(Alice speaks indistinctly)
Put him back in the box 'cause I got to feed him now.
"Supper in bed, huh?"
"Boy, they talk about a dog's life."
TRIXIE:
Alice!
"Oh, Alice!"
"There it is, the voice of doom."
"Oh, Ed."
"What is it, Trix?"
TRIXIE:
Come on up.
Your mother's on the phone.
"Oh, I'll be right up."
Thanks.
"Go ahead, go, go, go, go."
I'll take care of the pooch.
I'll feed him.
What do I do?
"Oh, you just take two spoonfuls of this dog food and put it on that plate and just give it to him."
- Gotcha.
"-Thanks, Ed."
"Here it comes, poochy!"
Here's your din-din!
There we are.
That a boy.
"Eat up, eat up, eat up."
Did your mother change her mind?
No.
I didn't get on the plane.
Can you hide me?
Come in.
-You're so slow!
-Who's slow?
"It's really nice in here, isn't it?"
This is really what I want to do.
On the anniversary of the day we first met.
"-Wait, what are you looking for?"
"-Wait, don't move too much."
Wait!
"-Wait, wait a second!"
Wait!
-What are you looking for?
.
Where could it be?
"Here, here, here, here!"
Is this what you're looking for?
.
"Hey, wait!"
Wait!
Can you see that tree?
.
It's been there since I was young.
"You know, whatever storm comes, whatever kind of earthquake,"
It's still standing.
"Joy, I promise you."
That tree is as strong as my love for you.
"If you can't answer now, it's okay."
Here.
You okay?
"I'll call the ambulance, okay?"
Mary.
"- Yeah, hey, this is Detective Ben Wesley."
- Help me.
Help me.
I need an ambulance to 1287 Monument Drive.
"Yeah, male, 40s, gunshot wound to the chest."
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.
And then he pinned me down and shot me with pento.
"And I really thought, ""This is it."""
"And it's true, you know, that cliche?"
Your life really does flash before your eyes.
And then you were there.
"Uh, look, we can take it from here."
We'll get the results back shortly.
Okay.
I'm glad you're okay.
"Am I okay, Ben?"
Ma'am.
I'm here to take you home.
"Yeah, wait, you sure you don't need to go to a hospital?"
I'm sure.
"I'm a doctor, remember?"
Yeah.
"Grady's gun is a 9-mil, same as the bullet we found in Sid Thomas-Haye."
"Yeah, we're gonna have ballistics compare."
Let's get it on.
Now I know nothing about this guy.
Take him out quick.
Ready?
Fight!
That's it.
That's it.
man.
You look really good.
doing some fighting?
man.
Price.
I hear ya.
No harm in asking.
- All right.
- Nice fight.
Thank you very much.
I'll be talking to ya.
Price.
it's so nice not having to go to work.
I could do this every day.
You'd get bored.
I wouldn't.
honestly.
I do this nearly every day.
You'd get bored.
A man needs a reason to get up in the morning.
So is that why you stopped fighting and moved out to this bumfuck town?
I didn't stop fighting.
And I certainly didn't move here.
I had no choice.
What do you mean? I'm in the witness protection program.
Just stay in bed.
Leave me alone!
It's great the way you sell yourself.
Why me?
You're the one who yelled.
You can't eat up everything in the fridge.
Why not?
I bought the food.
Why do I have to sell myself anyway?
"Because you want to live here, you bum."
You're nuts.
Why don't you stay here?
Would it bother you if Marco lived here a while?
"No, why?"
He asked me.
I'd like him to stay.
"Yeah, sure."
Why not?
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?
What?
Why?
I don't want to have to sell myself.
Don't worry.
I've done it for you.
Thanks.
"But no, thanks."
Stay here!
After all the trouble I went to!
I don't want trouble!
I just want to live here!
You're nuts!
It's right here.
"Oh, here it is."
Here it is.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
- What are you doing?
- You want it?
There's the medicine.
That's why I wanna go as far away as I can.
I can't save you.
I can't watch you go do this over and over and over again.
"- Oh, no."
"No, no..."
- It's just...
I can't.
"Every time I think you're going to get better, you don't."
- It's too much.
"- No, wait."
Mommy's coming.
Mommy's coming.
"Oh, no, look, they're all over the..."
I'm gonna get them.
I'm gonna get all the pills.
I'm gonna pick them all up.
Every single one.
"I'm getting them all picked up, and then..."
And then...
And then...
"Here, you hold them for me."
"You hold them for me, honey."
That's good.
Okay.
"I'm gonna get them, and I'm gonna take all my pills."
"You are the most beautiful boy, you are the most beautiful fucker."
We want to see you fuck her.
Fuck her!
"Get him, Margaret you whore."
Do it!
Give it to me baby.
Do it!
I can't.
Come on!
You can do it!
You whore.
Do it!
Come on Margaret.
Do it!
Let's go!
What for?
Let's go!
You made me do it.
This pussy has teeth no one should fuck me ever.
"What did you do with him, Margaret?"
I can't...
So where's the body?
I don't know.
Would somebody look on the roof.
Nothing out here.
What's in the box?
Was it a magic trick?
"No, Ann, it's no magic trick, I keep dead bodies in so I can fuck 'em."
"Adrian, you should leave me alone."
You should leave me alone.
What are you talking about?
I can.
Don't worry about it.
Don't believe him!
Gary's not exactly on a winning streak.
Ignore that.
Just ignore that.
Focus just on this.
Breathe.
Just breathe.
Do it!
Aah!
My gosh!
In your face!
That is bullshit!
"No, no, no, that is such bullshit."
"Let's go again, double or nothing."
"Double or nothing, let's go again."
- Let's go again.
"- Don't be a sore loser, Freddy."
I think I better quit while I'm ahead.
"Hey, Gary is a pussy, okay?"
You don't have to be a pussy.
"And he's, like, so cranky."
He's so cranky.
Ever since Patty left him for the pool boy...
"Keep talking, Freddy."
Keep talking.
"- Jesus, calm down."
- Keep talking.
- Apologize to the lady.
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
- Apologize to the lady.
"""No!"
Get the fuck off of her!
"""Get the fuck off of her!"
"""She's coming home with us!"
She's coming home with us!
"""Get the fuck--get-- Get off of her!"
"""Stop it!"
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
"""Stop it, bitch!"
Stop it!
Ha!
"""Stop it!"
Stop it!
"No, let me talk to her."
"""Karen, look at me, Karen."
"""Sweetie, you're drunk, okay?"
"""If he wants to take you out, he's gonna wait"
"""till the freakin' sun comes up and take you out"
"""on a respectable date like an adult."
"""We came together."
We're leaving together.
"""Fuck you, Tyrone!"
We came together.
"We're leaving together."""
"And then the girlfriend-- Then the girlfriend, she's all fucking like this."
"She's like, ""I don't know, Karen."""
Her name's Karen too.
"""I don't know, Karen."
"""I mean, he's still nice."
"""I really can't stand up straight right now,"
It was a brilliant fight.
And then I fell?
I suppose I swooned away like a woman.
You were overcome by...
the violence of what you'd done.
You're a sensitive man.
It was very hard.
- I remember the gun was shaking so.
- You see?
You're stronger than you knew.
And I thought you needed me.
But I do need you.
Drink your milk.
Where are the others?
They've gone.
- Gone?
- Mm-hm.
But how will we get back to Paris?
Why don't we stay here for a few days?
It's peaceful.
It's discreet.
Chopin.
Do you love me?
"God help me, I do."
You are superb.
Don't.
What is wrong?
I'm frightened.
Of me?
Certain acts are unseemly.
They are unsuitable.
Chopin.
You all right?
What do you mean?
You look a bit...
I'm fine.
"Loudest club in the west, mate."
You gonna be all right?
Yeah.
I'll be fine.
"Hey, Tony..."
"Hey, Cass."
Are we going somewhere?
"Oh, yes..."
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'm totally ready.
Isn't that sweet?
I'm sad about them.
Aren't you?
I'm fine and dandy.
Good.
We're just fine and dandy...
Come on.
You can buy me a drink.
"I think that since Sid and Michelle are together, we should do the same."
"What, go out?"
Yeah!
Get dressed up?
Go on a date?
Yeah!
"And we'd talk and eat dim sum,"
- and I'd take you home...
- And I'd walk you upstairs...
But I'd knock my head on the door frame and fall down.
The bell rang!
I'll murder that guy!
I'll murder him!
They're trying to pull a fast one!
We've been crossed!
I'll kill that tagger!
He called me a fink!
- What's he talking about?
"- Tell him, Tiny!"
Tell him!
- It looks bad!
- Yeah!
- I can see all right!
"- Okay, it's your funeral!"
"Hurry up and tell him, Tiny!"
"We ain't got much time, so listen!"
"You got to lay down, Stoker!"
- Lay down?
- It's in the bag!
There's 20 bucks extra in it for you!
Maybe 30!
- But I can stop him!
"- No, you can't, Stoker!"
This is Little Boy's fix!
He's paying us to go in the tank!
You know Little Boy if you cross him!
You gotta go down!
Go down on the first good punch!
- Take the count!
Let's get out of here!
- Yeah!
Ten seconds!
Mmm.
Concealed weapon.
The gun's going to the lab ;
you're coming with us.
"Let's go, guys."
You shoot Julio ?
I didn't cap nobody.
That's all right.
We'll get the bullet from autopsy.
"Well, when you do, get back to me."
Are we done ?
"Not quite, Luis."
What's that ?
That is your confession for another murder.
What murder ?
Bob Keaton.
Muzzle stamp's identical.
"Bob's chest, your gun."
800 or deal is off.
Then it's off.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Five.
I'll give you five.
Now you negotiate ?
"Luis, show him my counteroffer."
- I'm out of here.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
You killed him.
Julio's the boss.
"Maybe you took care of that, too."
"No, I swear."
I didn't.
And I was the one who saw him first.
"Oh, don't be ridiculous."
Very well.
We'll use the joint account.
- Don't be angry with me.
"- I'm not angry with you, Ursula."
I'm just gonna get the washing.
"No, no, I'll do it."
I'll do it!
"Oh, Ursula."
[Men chattering]
[Dorcas]:
"Not cheap, is it?"
[Man]:
It is for everyone else.
You can afford it.
It's just as well.
[Men chattering]
[Dorcas]:
I want some pilchards.
[Man]:
No more left.
"What do you mean, haven't got any left?"
I did have half an hour ago.
"What have you done with it, then?"
All right.
Phyllis has got 'em up at the shed.
She'd better have.
[Woman]:
What's she want pilchards for?
Stargazey pie.
What's the matter with coley fish?
- Who is slave?
"I am a soldier, too, please."
- You're what?
Regimental bhisti.
"Proud ox, where is your army?"
How soon are they to follow?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Why don't you look in your crystal ball?
Make the ox talk.
You dirty pack of cowards!
Never mind him.
Now.
He's next.
- I'm waiting.
Will you speak?
- I don't know.
"Hold on, Mac, old boy!"
Stop.
Look.
"See them down there... coiling and wiggling, sticking their pretty tongues out?"
Are you going to speak?
Throw him in.
He'll talk from there.
"- No, I can't stand it!"
- Will you speak?
All right.
"If I ain't kissed by one of them snakes, I'll tell you."
Take me outside.
"- Be a man, Mac."
"- I can't go it, mates!"
"Come back, Mac, old boy!"
"- Well, Sergeant?"
I got you!
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!
Snakes!
"Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!"
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the führer matters.
"I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind."
"It was not to be, chérie."
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!
Indiana Jones... adieu.
No!
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
Thank you.
"Oh, my God, this whole place is slithering."
Indy!
Ow!
Jesus!
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
"Well, where the hell were you?"
"Watch it, watch it."
What are you doing?
For the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
I'm working on it!
"If you do this well, there are more jobs coming."
"Doc, don't worry."
I won't break my promise.
Hey...
You can't charge your laptop here.
"Sir,"
I really need to download some work.
Just a little while?
Yes.
This medicine may make you sleepy.
I'm taking it doc.
Shit!
Damn it!
Only half an hour left.
Are you done?
Here.
Thank you.
Just half for now.
Tomorrow morning I will send you the rest.
You haven't finished it yet?
This is a big project.
"Je, what are you doing?"
I'm calling Jerd.
Why are you calling him?
Tomorrow you will get it.
Yoon.
"Je, don't call."
Send it now or we're screwed.
"Je, stop dialing."
You have another 50% to finish.
It's not...
Doesn't matter.
"But please, I can't accept."
What a nice pear!
"I'm Clemenza, you still have my goods?"
Did you look inside?
I'm not interested in things that don't concern me.
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.
Sure she would.
But who has money for a rug?
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.
"Yeah, sure."
My wife would like it.
That son of a bitch!
He isn't home!
"Damn, he didn't even leave the key."
"Well, he won't mind."
Come on in.
"Hey, Vito, come on in!"
This is your friend's place?
This is a real palace.
One of the best.
"Vito, give me a hand, will you?"
"Look how pretty it is, Santino!"
Come on in.
It's all right.
Hyman's in there.
-Would you like a tuna sandwich?
"-No, thank you."
...pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...
-Mr.
Thas all.
Is no big deal.
We just used up a little gas.
"Look, not a scratch oh, the starter needs adjusting."
"If you want me to fix it, I've got a screwdriver."
Go ahead...
Listen to their sob story.
You'll cry your heart out.
Wait...
listen.
I said hands up.
"Hey, Carnoles!"
Need the police?
I'll call them.
Wait...
There's something you ought to know...
We had a run-in recently in a five-and-dime store.
So we're kind of on parole.
Next time is jail.
"We don't want to go to jail, sir."
Poor slobs.
I'll put you in jail myself.
"Hey, how 'bout giving these hippies a haircut?"
"We're in France, all right!"
Watch out!
Jean-Claude!
What?
I'm all bloody.
Get a doctor.
What a mess!
Whas going on?
Have to get another car.
"If you love me, then you need to let me go."
"Oh, she's gone."
I wish I could cry on demand.
Thetearswon'tcomeout.
Go ahead.
I'll just find a place to park.
"You mean, you're not gonna drive off and disappear for 6 months?"
"Because this is my car, and my lease is up soon."
I'll be right back.
"Baby, get ready to get fragged."
"- Hey, where's Brian?"
- Parking.
Where's Adam?
"Oh, he's outside obsessing over the briquettes."
Is this even gonna work?
"Maybe we should hide the knives, just in case."
Oh!
Oh!
No!
No!
You cheated.
You cheated.
"Oh, come on."
"You looked away, honey pie."
I didn't cheat.
- Slap it.
Slap it!
"- Slapping of the... no, no."
See?
That's why I don't play with you anymore.
- You know what?
You are so cute when you pout.
There's no other woman.
At my age.
At your age.
You keep fit enough.
You're sweet.
I know you're not cheating on me.
I'd notice it in seconds.
You would?
How?
Everything.
I know you through and through.
Ab.
What are you doing?
What are you up to?
Talk to me.
"If you don't know, you can't tell."
Can't tell?
"Can't spill the beans, you mean."
We can never forget this.
We owe it to Arie.
Ab!
Hello!
-Wait a moment.
We've not seen each other for so long.
Come in.
I have to finish something for a party.
Before the children come out of the cinema.
You're a better grandpa than me.
"-Yes, but they're not my grandchildren."
They're my children.
-Oh.
Late happiness.
Thanks for the... coffee!
"My ass is spreading, that's bad."
"I don't mind, I love big asses."
Know what my big ass says to you?
That it misses me.
Sunday's my dad's 70th birthday.
He hopes we'll come.
There'll be a crowd.
You don't have to talk.
- What crowd?
- My mom's family.
"Uncles, aunts, cousins coming from Rome."
We'll see.
"Lola, hurry!"
"Bye, daddy-o."
"Bye, honey."
6 slugs were fired.
"2 hit the driver, 1 the goon, 3 Zerbib."
No one saw much.
The building's all oldies.
"By the time they shuffled to a window, it was all over."
But the concierge saw a girl get out of the Merc and run away.
"Brunette, red coat, a BJ artist."
Zerbib liked cheap whores.
We'll find her.
"That's for Homicide, not us."
You knew him well?
Enough to want to nab his killer.
"Vrinks, bri."
The names Horn and Boulanger.
Give me all you've got.
What's with the Zerbib case?
"No one, right?"
That's where people come in.
That what people see.
"No, this is the wrong..."
It's 0-3.
That's not 0-3.
You're pretty.
You have a pretty mouth.
"All the pretty girls in the hallway, you know?"
And you can come with me.
It's good.
You look good.Who the fuck?
Who the fuck?
It's gonna be a long day.
Nadia!
I look awful.
Can we try something new?
What kind of statement would you like to make?
Something that says... don't fuck with me.
Fuck!
Shit!
Perfect.
Just sprucing up for some marathon shmoozing.
"Sorry, I'm just looking for an earring."
I think you look perfect as you are.
Very funny.
It's nice.
It suits you.
Is it new?
You don't remember?
I was wearing it the night we met.
the opera.
We're talking about 100's square miles of forest.
Be patient.
"Ronon's been going up against the Wraith, one on one, for the last seven years."
"If anyone can track this thing, it's him."
And exactly how is he gonna do that?
I also have good hearing!
Right!
Carry on!
What about you?
You sensing anything?
I am not sure.
What do you mean?
"There is a presence here, but it is different."
I cannot quite explain it.
It's in there.
Ronon!
Dammit!
It's in there.
- It was a Wraith?
- Yeah.
- Did you see it?
- No.
"- Well, so how do you know?"
Ronon is correct.
I can definitely sense it now.
A female!
Ellia?
- Get out of the way!
- Please don't shoot!
She's not what you think!
She's my daughter.
She means you no harm!
Your only friend is me.
"If I conk out, you're dead."
"Here's my direct line, so you can't forget it."
"Give me a lead, fast."
That gang...
I want their names first.
"Nobody knows them, I swear!"
I want news from you.
Stay in touch.
So I know you're OK.
Good seeing you again.
How'd you get that?
It's nothing.
At work.
Why not tell me what you do?
I don't want to lose you.
"You get home late, leave early."
Lots of cops live that way.
Many wind up all alone.
What are you after?
Nothing.
I just do my job.
"Get up, lazybones!"
"- Say: ""Morning, Dad""."
"- Morning, Dad."
And give him a kiss.
No school today?
Never on Wednesday.
You know that.
"Yeah, if I knew it's Wednesday."
Mom in?
Rushing as usual.
"Oh, same old, same old."
You?
Yep.
- So where is Bethanne?
- She won't be coming back.
What happened?
Where is she?
"Well, you were right."
We shouldn't have left.
No.
Hungry?
"Next time, you'll listen to me."
I'm home.
"Teeth brushed, ready for bed."
Safe and sound.
"Oh, good, good."
I'm glad.
Is everything all right?
You sound serious.
"No, no, no."
Uh...
Not tonight.
You still have a few more minutes left of normal.
"I'll tell you about it tomorrow, okay?"
I had a really nice time on our date tonight.
- Such a liar.
"- No, I'm serious."
"In a way, it was exactly what it was supposed to be."
I had a really nice time too.
Could you help me out a little bit?
What the hell?
I could have killed you.
"Karen, that was worth $60,000!"
I need that money!
That's all we got!
They had a search warrant!
That's all the money we had!
I was depending on that!
Why did you do that?
I had to!
They were going to find it!
-They wouldn't have found it!
-They would have!
I swear!
They would've found it!
Why did you do that?
-They would have found it.
-Why did you do that?
"Oh, my God!"
-l had to do it.
"-Oh, my God!"
No!
"Paulie, I'm really sorry."
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.
"Yeah, you fucked up."
But I'm all right now.
"I can be trusted now, Paulie. I'm clean."
"On my kids, I'm clean."
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.
"Paulie, after what you said, I couldn't come to you."
"You know, I was ashamed."
Mr. Crusoe.
I thought you'd forgotten us.
Are you going to be leading us?
I'll leave that to you.
Right.
"I need to help a friend, but I'll be back."
Lancaster.
Unshackle the men.
"Come on, let's go."
"Get up, Velasquez."
The prisoners are out!
"Arm yourselves, you drunken sots!"
They're in disarray.
Let's have at them!
Fire!
Fire.
Reload!
No!
"No, wait!"
Hold your fire.
One more shot and I kill her.
Papa!
Lower your weapons.
We have lost.
Not just yet.
Back to your mother.
Lock 'em up!
A night away to bury my brother and what do I come back to?
Taylor and his officers got out.
It's in the nature of captives to want to escape.
It's the jailer's job to stop 'em.
They had help.
You know this is material evidence.
Did I say it wasn't?
"Either we do this together, Minks, or every man for himself."
I'm hungry.
How about you?
I'll see you tomorrow.
As you like.
"Yeah, what's up?"
What's so damned urgent anyway?
Order me a beer at the bar.
"I'll be right there, okay?"
Sorry.
"Hey... 2 beers, please."
Recognize her?
I found her.
Minks' daughter.
Got it?
She's been here since last Sunday.
I didn't realize it until we talked to each other.
Marie?
"This is Marc, the friend I told you about."
Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can I have a beer?
I have to talk to her.
You really just want to talk?
What if she doesn't want to?
- What?
Go back to her old man?
Will you leave her alone?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
Turn around!
"- Man, I have my rights."
"- What do you mean, your rights?"
"Who's the boss here, huh?"
"Hey, who's running this outfit?"
- I am.
- You are?
- What are you doing here?
Who sent you down?
- Just runnin' around.
"Don't talk back to me, man."
What are you doing here?
"- We saw the car, man."
- You heist this car?
No.
We was breaking down the tires.
That's all it was.
Lock 'em up.
Lock 'em up.
Lock 'em up.
"- All of you, come on."
- Come on!
Come on!
Come on.
Stop draggin' your ass.
Keep your hands on your head.
"You dumb spics, get outta here!"
Lock 'em up and throw away the goddamn key!
[Police Radio Chatter]
Nothin' but a bunch of lousy spic car thieves.
- Nothin' in there except a New York City map.
Did you say anything stupid?
"By ""anything stupid,"" I mean anything at all."
Look at you.
"Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter."
We'll talk about it later.
"Right now, you out."
Ten minutes ago.
Go on.
"There are laws, detective."
Have your kindergarten teacher read them to you.
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap.
Go on.
All right.
Who do we have?
Brandon Mayhew.
Brandon Mayhew.
All right.
Brandon Mayhew.
- Here we go.
Public masturbation.
- What?
I don't get it.
What's the kick?
"Why don't you do it at home with a big flat-screen TV, 50 channels of pay-per-view?"
In a Starbucks.
That's nice.
"That ain't me, man."
I...
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.
Okay.
# Breathe on my dreams don't blow them apart
# Turn me away and you'll lose me
# I know I messed things up and got them wrong
# That can't be changed with just a song
# I really want our lives to intertwine
# To make you proud
# To bring you joy
# So you can say
"# Yes, he's my boy"
# He's mine. #
"Thank you, Baker."
You'll hear from your teacher.
Morning.
You see that ceiling?
All them tiles might have to come down.
Sorry.
Hang on.
"Give me a sec, Tom."
Tubby.
Mr Brierley.
I'm glad I've seen you.
"Look, about the other day."
My wife's a bit...
She's at a funny age.
No. it was a very nice occasion.
Crisp breads.
Very gentlemanly of you.
Could we make amends?
Could I invite you and the lady...?
Enid.
That's it.
Could you both perhaps come to dinner?
Then I'll just get back to work.
"Trevor, not yet."
I need to ask you for a UA.
Look like rain.
Radio says there's a storm on the way.
They said right.
I'd say it's already here.
You are on the first shift?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
"Funny, I never seen you before."
I've been here.
I work in the pit.
I just picked up Reynolds' shift.
Where's Reynolds?
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.
I'm Ivan.
Trevor.
"Well, I guess I'd better begin by..."
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.
You got that right.
I'll see you around.
What's wrong?
I just want to lie here.
We can do that.
I'm so tired.
"You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter."
That is the problem.
I can't sleep.
Nothing helps.
Don't worry about it honey.
We're gonna miss out on all this money.
- Anybody could kick that guy's ass.
- I know.
Come on.
You could kick...
You-You could kick that guy's ass.
You think?
"Oh, my God."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Oh, you're, like, the second toughest guy I know."
I did bash Charlie good a couple times.
- You almost hurt him once.
- With the bottle?
"- Yeah, and that's next to impossible."
- That was good.
- You're...
You're good.
- I am good.
Yeah.
Tell you what.
Um...
Why don't you go stretch out.
I'll talk to the bookie and let him know that Clown Baby... has arrived.
- Let's do it.
- All right.
Goddamn it.
"- Frankie, what's the deal?"
- She got arrested.
- Ah!
I knew that skinny bitch would chicken out.
- So we'll never get the fight.
I acted foolishly as well.
"No hard feelings, aye?"
I'll buy you a refreshment.
"Please, allow me."
I shall buy you a refreshment.
"No, no, I'll buy you one."
I insist.
"No, I must buy you one, to make amends."
It's all right.
I'll buy.
"- No, I will buy."
- I'll buy.
"- No, I will buy."
- I'll buy.
"- No, I will."
- I will.
- I will.
- Me!
Me!

A SUBURBAN TALE
Directed by Sakari Kirjavainen
My name is Ben Laine.
I will help you through the day.
I know that you're anxious.
You've had nightmares or didn't sleep at all.
Count with me from three to one.
"Three, two, one."
Good.
You can feel your entire body relax.
"Make some coffee, Viljanen."
"I'm talking about getting very, very rich."
"You count cards, right?"
All of you?
"As a team, yes."
- When?
- Weekends.
And Christian holidays.
- Where?
"- Vegas, baby."
"So, why are you telling me?"
"Well, let's just say a spot opened up on our roster."
How?
Jimmy got a job at Google.
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
"- Yeah, it's catchy, I know."
"Well, if you're making so much money at this, then why did he take it?"
"Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler."
Yeah...
This is crazy.
"No, Ben."
This is profitable.
"Yeah, I can't do it."
"So, I'm sorry."
"- Come on, Ben."
It'll be fun.
"- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun."
"No, it's not that."
It's...
"I just got a promotion at my job, so it's kind of not a good time for me."
We pay better.
"Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends."
Why not?
"- Oh, is that what you call it?"
- Violet!
What?
"I almost forgot, I got something for you too."
Really?
- Why are you giving this to me?
- You have a unique world of view.
Now you can share with others... in a new way.
"Thanks a lot, mister."
I need the police.
"Yes, that's my address."
What are you doin'?
He's writing a letter.
To who?
"To ""whom""."
To whom?
His daughter.
I'll do it.
What?
I'll write it for you.
Alright.
Thank you.
So where was I?
"""Dear April..."""
That's it?
"So far, yeah."
"""Dear April,"
"I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I hope you do."
In any case...
It's time we finally talk.
"Please, take care of yourself."
I managed to put some money in your bank account.
I'll look for her later!
I was dead.
"I mean,"
I was really dead.
Really.
Tell me about it.
What's it like to be dead?
I'd got loose.
It were as if I was getting out of my body.
"My body was staying here, and I..."
I was flying.
You were floating?
Yes.
"I heard that dog, and a woman screaming."
"They were around me, panicking and... then I heard that noise."
It was like a whistle.
"A very, very loud whistle."
I saw... a light.
A light?
Yes.
It was alive.
It was alive as if it were waiting for me.
I was in the light.
I felt good.
- Didn't you want to come back?
- No.
But you did come back.
Yes.
Why did you come back?
I just did.
Something made you come back.
Is there something you're holding back?
"in ""Assistant""."
I left my coat on the bus.
- Can you describe it?
"Yes, it had eight wheels, hard plastic seats, and when it stopped, it went, ""sh-h-h-h"""
"Harry, he means the coat."
"- Oh, oh!"
"Um, well, it kind of looked like this one, only it was furry.."
don't have it.
Next.
Night Eddie.
- See you Monday.
He's got my coat.
"- Harry, be a man."
"Hey, Mister, that's my coat."
No it isn't.
"- Yeah, that's his coat."
"If it's his coat, how come I'm wearing it?"
Good point.
Hey babes.
"Good morning Dick, did you sleep well?"
"Once the adrenaline wore off, like a baby."
"You know when you've been riding the bullet train to ""yuk-ville"", it's kind of hard to slow down."
I've been up all night faxing jokes to Leno.
What have we here?
Eleven banana cream pies!
One for every letter in my name.
Am I right?
Right.
Oh girls.
You shouldn't have.
"Oh, we had to."
Really.
I didn't see anyone either.
I made it up.
I am not going to drive my son around until he's 40.
The only thing stronger than Manny's fear is his need to protect his mama.
"Oh, no!"
He got away!
"But you did very good, Manny."
That was a frickin' rush!
But we're not giving up.
We're gonna find that guy.
No!
Are you sure about this?
Just go.
I'm walking home.
I can't even hear him it's so loud.
Can everybody just shut up?
!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Is this Phil dumpster?
- Stop.
"- What do you want, Gil?"
Got to be kidding me.
Hang on.
Is that your hot wife I hear?
"Hey, is she still taking those yoga classes?"
Hanging up.
W-w-wait.
Wait.
Real quick.
"The listing at 225 cedar street, it's mine now."
You poached my listing?
Mom!
Let's go.
What are we going to do?
I don't know.
Let's try this car.
"No, no, no, no, please, please, I don't want to go in that one."
"Please, Mom, please, I don't want to go in that one."
"Please, Mom, please, I don't want to go."
All right.
"Let's go down the road, see if we can get in that tourist castle we passed."
"It'll be okay, Billy."
mike'll take us home now.
[bell rings]
"Back, go on."
- Let's find a phone.
- Okay.
"Uh, operator, get me the highway patrol, please."
How do you feel?
"Aw, I'm all right."
You okay?
"Yeah, I'm okay."
[car honks]
Is that them already?
"Uh, you guys stay here."
I'm gonna go down there and talk to 'em.
- It'll be all right.
- Okay.
"How ya doing, Billy?"
Okay.
"[woman] Mike, what's the matter?"
"Mike, tell me what's wrong?"
[woman screams]
Let's get you outta here.
- You good?
-Yeah.
(COCKS GUN)
Stop.
Let him go.
"Wait, you're not gonna shoot me?"
"Once a stiff, always a stiff."
(GUNFIRE)
Go!
"Four, how did you get past security?"
FOUR:
You know me.
Scary boyfriend skills.
What is it?
You weren't there.
You didn't even hear that.
"Tris, we need to leave now, all right?"
"I'm sorry, Four."
What?
I'm sorry I didn't tell you that I was gonna go.
I wanted to say goodbye and I just didn't know how.
I didn't know how.
What are you talking about?
So even though I didn't get to say it in real life at least I get to say it now.
Even if it is just in the sim.
"Tris, we're not in a sim."
Don't you think I'd know if I was in a sim?
"Four, you're not in a sim."
You are the sim.
"Wait, wait."
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
"Eddie, what's with the security?"
It's not our first deal.
Maybe he looks familiar.
"Here's $200,000."
We'll check the guns first.
What are you guys doing?
"Nothing special, officer."
A reunion.
Open the trunk.
Open it!
Now!
Damn you!
"You set me up, didn't you?"
Are you a cop?
Talk!
I'm no cop!
I didn't betray you.
Then how come he's here?
He's no cop!
"I stake my life on it, Eddie!"
"Lying bastard, I shouldn't have trusted you!"
The guy's a cop.
I recognize him!
You've got it wrong.
"Chang, I'll get him!"
That shithead!
Don't move!
"Goddamn mess, assho--"
Finish your sentence.
Ass... assho--
"Inspector Li, the suspect Eddie Hung held a hostage... in a crowded trolley car..."
Could you see him clearly?
"One time, we had a warning of an attack."
We had the entire village like this.
"When the raiders came, we jumped up and chased them back to the beach."
But there was one small problem.
You couldn't find the village again.
Have I told you the story before?
"Now, remember, just remove the leader."
Jacob moore.
"If we take him, we gain a significant advantage."
There!
- Get after it!
- All right!
What witchcraft is this?
What are ya?
Nolan!
Atkins!
Come help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
"Where are ya, ya dog?"
"Now, what have we here?"
You're a demon... come to trap me!
"No, it's us!"
"Will, nolan!"
It--it was here.
What was?
A net!
- A net?
"- A net, aye!"
It caught me in a net!
It tried to capture me.
Not a prostitute.
I receive training.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I didn't mean to insult you.
But how can they impose that on you?
I chose.
What do you mean.
You chose?
Between a long sentence in prison and this.
This was shorter.
Because...
That way.
They'll give me back...
Look.
I can't talk to patients about this.
I mean outside...
If they were to find me...
- Is Eva your real name?
No.
I can't use my real name anymore.
- What is it?
I can't give it to you.
Come on.
It's just a name.
You don't understand.
I'm in prison.
There are rules.
It's bad enough as it is.
If...
Look.
I have to disconnect.
Look...
"Yeah, that's cool."
'Cause I don't see no bwoy.
"Well, I suppose that is a matter of opinion."
I suppose.
(grunts)
Oh--
You're home early.
Mmhmm.
They changed my shift.
I'll get you food.
"I like dat, you should wear it more often."
Well it doesn't help much with finding work.
(kisses teeth)
Excuse me?
"Listen girl, no decent folk is going to hire any deportee, alright?"
That's just great.
"Alright, alright, listen!"
None of dat is my business anyway.
But you?
You have a problem.
But I tied him up.
Fine!
Fine.
I will go find him then--
"But I bet you could, right?"
It's doubtful.
That's almost $200!
"Uncle Archie, I can't afford that!"
"Well, Marva, there are other ways to pay for tings."
Hm?
♪
- No.
It's our dog.
Uh-huh.
When will Mom be back?
Hmm?
Um...
She'll be home soon.
Can we wait?
Where should we wait?
Hand me the list.
I'll see how much we've collected.
- The money too?
"- Yeah, I'll count it."
Okay.
- Really bad handwriting.
- Yeah.
You'd swear a doctor had written it.
It's barely legible.
Looking forward to school?
- Well...
- It starts soon.
- Where did you go to school before?
- In Vienna.
A lot more going on there.
We've already collected a tidy sum.
"If somebody else gives as much as him, we'll have done pretty well."
Mm-hmm.
We'll see how much more we get.
What do you do all day?
Not much.
I have to go to the toilet.
( indistinct chatter )
Come in.
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go.
- If this is about today...
"- No, it's not."
I got a message.
I have to go home.
I have to be there noon on Friday.
"John, do you realize what's happening to you?"
I have to go.
"Hey, it's me."
- Connie?
- Yeah.
"I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes."
- I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
"- No,you can't."
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
"It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45."
"I tried to get you on the one to Charleston, but they're all booked up."
"So if you leave now, you'll just make it."
I can't.
"It's Christmas Eve, John."
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
"Yeah, you can."
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
- R-Right.
Turn the right tap.
- He's messing with you!
It's up to Chris.
He's saying left so that you'll pick right.
Maybe it's because I don't wanna hurt Gemma.
You don't care who you hurt.
One.
Left.
- I choose the left tap.
- Left tap turning on.
"Good call, Chris."
"Babe, babe, I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry, babe, he made me choose."
I suppose a date's out of the question now.
I'm so sorry.
"He made me choose, all right?"
He just made me.
"Round, and round, and round it goes... where it stops... nobody knows."
All right.
I'll play.
Truth.
Why us?
Why you?
Why us five?
Why did you choose us?
A photograph by Felix's bed.
Five faces scratched out.
- Your faces.
- That doesn't prove anything.
"- Fucking hell, a photograph."
- It was good enough for Felix... it's good enough for me.
Let's go.
"Shiv, we have met before."
In our past life.
What?
I was a princess and you were a warrior.
And we were in love.
What...what...what...
Zak killed you to make me his.
And the same thing is going to repeat again.
"Shiv, are you getting me?"
You lost your life because of me.
"Shiv, we can't be together anymore."
Just...just...just a second.
One second.
"Just give me a second, okay?"
- Listen to me.
"- Just a second, okay?"
Very important.
You nitwit!
Where is your Hidimba!
That bloody old hag!
You ask why am I cussing?
She has made my life hell.
- My girlfriend has lost it.
- Shiv!
"Past life, king and queen and what not she is talking about."
I'll stab her to death if I see her.
Let her know.
What?
I am on the other side of the island.
Wait a second.
Hey!
"""..."
"Even holy waher cannoh whihen you."""
How do you know that poem?
Our teacher recites poems to us from time to time.
For homework?
No.
He recites and I learn them.
You must be a good student.
Yes.
Well done!
What grade did you get in the third term?
We haven't finished our exams yet.
"In the second term, then?"
Twelve.
And the first term?
Ten.
When do the exams end?
They start today and go on for two weeks.
- Good luck.
- Come in.
How is she?
Who?
- You don't know who I mean?
- Mrs Malek?
She's so-so.
What does that mean?
She's still in bed.
"She doesn't eat, she doesn't speak."
"Wait, I'll fetch it."
Here.
Just a second.
I'm tying my shoelace.
Yeah.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
But I can't work like this.
"So, you're going to have to choose."
All right.
Then I guess I quit.
Thank God.
"Well, call the station manager, and tell him to find somebody else."
"No, I quit you."
I quit us.
"Monk, stop crying."
I don't know where she is.
It's going to be okay.
No.
"No, I can't, Monk."
I'm at the gym.
"No, you don't want to come down here."
Believe me.
There are naked people here.
Look.
I tell you what.
I've got to work late tonight.
Why don't you come by the office?
Good.
Okay.
See you then.
"Hello, everybody."
I'm Natalie Teeger.
Who's ready to make lotto history?
Our super jackpot is worth $212 million.
Why did I make her choose?
Of course she'd choose to leave.
Why do you ask?
Might she remember?
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
She's going to be well?
"Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me."
"Now, did you?"
"No, not me."
I didn't.
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?
"Of course, I didn't."
I didn't put it.
"Excuse me, madam."
What?
-A man to see you.
-What man?
You're a very nice lady.
-Thank you.
-You're a nice man.
I'll come back when she's feeling better.
"No, she was heavily sedated."
It's serious?
"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts.
"A draft in the fall, when the house is hot, is a magic carpet for bacteria."
"Excuse me, madam."
Anything else?
"No, Karl, we're fine."
Thank you.
It's all right.
A foreign lab?
"Actually, no."
"Garcia, isn't Annandale where Morgan and Hotch are?"
That's not a gas main explosion.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
"Yeah, it's Morgan."
Hello?
"Garcia, can you hear me?"
We saw the explosion on TV.
"Yeah, I know."
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
"Oh, God."
Don't worry.
Don't think you're gonna get rid of me that easy.
Do you need anything?
I know who to call if I do.
"Thanks, baby doll."
They're all right?
Yeah.
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
Son of a bitch.
Sorry about Kenny.
"Yeah, me, too."
The chatter was a set-up.
They knew we'd be listening.
They led us straight here.
Just tell me you know where to look next.
Not yet.
They're okay?
We were right about the trap.
"That'll be a buck, thank you."
Oh.
I got it.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
"Well, pretty good shooting, Billy."
"Hello, the house."
Anybody home?
[man] Come on in.
I'm in the kitchen.
"Hi, perry, how you doing?"
Saw you drive up.
"Just fixing myself something to eat, come on in."
It smells great.
- You hungry?
"- No, I just ate."
"Uh, what are you cooking?"
"Uh, sit down."
How do you like the place?
"You haven't been over here since Daddy died, have you?"
- No.
- I fixed the place up.
Cost me an arm and a leg.
"Well, I'll bet it did."
"I'll tell ya, things are gettin' so expensive,"
I don't know what I'll be able to afford.
I don't work.
maybe I need a secretary.
I used to love canned peaches.
I can't afford 'em anymore.
No way I could buy those.
Where's Stu?
Does Kim know about this?
Yeah.
From you?
I haven't had a chance to talk to her myself yet.
"You square this with her, Chase, you understand me?"
Just make that right.
And get back to me as soon as Nina gives you anything.
I will.
Are we up yet?
Yep.
"Video's piped in, voice analysis, vitals, transcription."
- We're all set.
"- Nick, do you copy?"
"- Yeah, I read you."
- We're ready to go.
"All right, recording to hard drive now."
"So, Tony's doing this?"
Yeah.
Is that going to be weird for you?
What do you mean?
Didn't-didn't he and Nina go out?
Yeah.
We set?
Yeah.
All right.
I want you to do a hi-res on her eyes.
She's tired.
We might be able to pick up a tell.
Okay.
"So, we all right?"
Yeah.
We're fine.
"Look man, you don't have to be nice to me cause I'm going out with Haley, okay?"
I'm not.
Team sucks on a day without you man.
Ask Whitey.
I'm trying to avoid him.
That's cool.
Do what you got to do.
Usually do.
Am I hallucinating?
Did I just see you talking to Lucas?
"No, he was trying to talk to me."
The whole nice guy thing's wearing kind of thin.
You want to walk to English?
"Actually, I think I'm gonna cut out of here a little bit early."
Wanna join me?
Are you serious?
"Yeah, why not?"
You up for it?
"I can't, Nathan."
Alright.
"Well, look, I gotta get out of here so I'll catch you later."
Okay.
You know what?
Catch me now.
- Oh My God!
"- Nice, huh?"
"So, are we trying to get killed?"
"I told you, my dad's in Charlotte, it's okay."
I've never seen you like this.
Now you have.
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.
"Let's start by analyzing that drug of yours, shall we?"
"Oh, yes."
Of course.
Would you like some tea?
"Oh, thank you."
"Oh, no, thank you."
Would you like some?
No.
Are you sure?
It's very good.
I said no.
Maybe some biscuits?
I baked them myself.
Stay away from me!
Ronon!
It's all right.
It's okay.
"They hate me, don't they, father?"
No.
"No, no, no."
They just don't know you.
Was that really necessary?
"You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but it's not going to change who she is."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Come in.
"Go ahead, colonel."
Is Ellia still in the cave?
Yes.
Has she been there the whole time?
Yes.
Why?
They just found another victim.
Let's get a drink.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
This came for you earlier.
And your wife called.
She said to call her back.
What's wrong?
A guy wants to see you.
He's drunk and he has a shotgun.
Who are you guys?
We're police.
We heard you wanted to see us.
Put down the shotgun.
"No, you guys aren't cops."
We don't sleep in uniform.
Put that down.
- Wanna see my badge?
- Stay back.
I'll show you my badge and you put down the shotgun.
It's not loaded.
I only wanted to talk.
I'm sorry.
Beatriz was my girlfriend.
He killed her.
He killed Adela too.
He chops them up and dumps them in the river.
That's why they only found the foot.
What foot?
It was her shoe.
I gave it to her.
She said she was coming back.
Back from where?
"You know, even when they're all grown-up,"
"people say to their kids,"
"""You were always my little boy."""
You really were.
Maybe we... we were blessed that...
Please don't go.
Please don't leave me.
I can't do this on my own.
"Dad, I'm scared."
What's gonna happen?
I don't know.
"Oh, God, Adam."
I don't know.
Dad?
Nina!
Nina!
"- It's OK, it's OK."
"All right, all right."
- What does he need?
"I'm sorry, Adam."
I think he knew it was gonna happen.
That's why he came back to Wales.
He wanted to die here.
- This is it.
I'm on my own.
"- Oh, no, you're not."
You and Nina are just dealing with a problem.
That's all I am to you.
"Look, I can't pretend to know how you're feeling, cos personally I haven't been through it."
I know.
You're just a kid.
"Yeah, but, whatever you're feeling... you can tell me, I'll listen."
Now tell me his name.
- Are you interrogating him?
"- Yes, I am."
Don't you dare!
He's dying!
He's got blood in his lungs and they're filling up and there's fuck all in here that I can use to stop it.
I can still hear all this.
"Okay, Dad."
Just relax.
Just keep calm.
Fine.
"Clare, what do you need?"
Okay.
I need something sharp to stab into his chest to release the pressure.
- That's fine.
I have a knife.
- That's no good.
"- A valve, I need a valve."
- I've got a pen in my back pocket.
"- Yes, a pen."
A pen will work.
- Here.
Okay?
Yes.
Perfect.
"Take that bit out, then slice off the end."
"All right, Dad, just keep breathing for me."
That's right...
I've got you...
I've got you...
- Are you good?
- All right.
"That's, please don't take that call."
"I've got to, booty calls."
"I'm looking for the truth, Mr Sugar."
Alan?
"Alan, someone who's smashed up the shop."
Mr Sugar?
"You got some sort of problem, boy?"
We've got some talking to do.
And I'm looking for the truth.
"Yeah, well, I'm telling you the truth."
You want to smash my shop up?
Not particularly.
"Let's smash, let's smash it up."
Let's smash it up!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's smash it up!
I appreciate you're a little bit angry...
HE LAUGHS
Have one!
Have one!
These are beautiful.
They're great.
What do you want to ask me?
What do you want to know?
Have a nice fruit salad.
One of your five-a-day.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You can eat them...
Why have you got it in for Cowell?
"Cowell sent his boys around here, did you know that?"
For real?
Yup.
Do you want jumping rabbits in the background?
"Okay if the client wants it, I'll do it."
"Being in relationship isn't a waste of time, really?"
It is.
But I made my choice.
Actually it's quite fun.
I've learned new things.
Learned what?
Not telling.
I don't want to spoil anything.
Holding back on me now.
I've learned how to love.
How was that for a sweet answer?
But don't you argue?
It's a lot of hard work.
Surprisingly it feels good.
Weird huh?
So did you hit it yet?
Hell there's nothing to hit!
Rash: 0
Shit!
They're all gone!
Shit.
They're all gone.
So I don't have to go see the doctor anymore?
March.
I thought you weren't coming.
Why are you late today?
Well I couldn't sleep last night.
Oh!
"Hey, Bella."
Do you want to jump in bed?
Do you want?
OK then!
Zıplıyoruz bed!
See?
This place is not bad I said to you!
- What is Jade?
"- Hi, Mike."
"- Sculpture, where is it?"
- I told you I wanted to go.
So sendeymiş.
Wow!
You t.şaklıymışsın vulgar.
- I want $ 1 million.
- How about meeting me?
We'll talk.
"If I make it, die."
Statue when you die.
So I'll do this as follows:
I'll tell you the location of the transmitter.
Give me my money.
Then he'll tell you where to find the statue.
"You play a dangerous game, Mike."
You can not hide from me.
I promise you:
"The one you will not hurt, burn, Mike."
Do not have to do this to me.
Bring the money to the donor.
Then you get the statue.
"Okay, Jade?"
Look ...
He's in the Army.
At Angelras.
That so?
Is cozier like this.
Isn't this nice?
What do you want?
Not a thing...
Can't a guy count his money?
Your guy got a pass?
Yes.
When you'd see him last?
Two months ago.
"Oh, boy!"
What a time you're going to have!
Where'll you go?
I don't know.
A hotel...
Here...
Thas for you.
What for?
I'd like you to stay in the fanciest hotel in town.
In the most expensive room.
With a bathroom for your smelly boyfriend.
Come all over a great big bed.
Order champagne on a silver tray and drink it in bed.
Sound good to you?
Yes...
But you have to earn it.
How?
I'd like you to nurse my buddy...
He's an orphan and he loves milk...
He'd enjoy it...
French is $15.
"And anything special will cost you $25, okay?"
"Yeah, baby."
"Handcuffs, that'll be $35, okay?"
"Uh, they're for you, baby."
"I'm a cop, and you're under arrest."
"Oh, shit, what kinda shit is this, man?"
"You know this is entrapment, man."
"Aw, my man is the man, holy shit."
What the fu...
Who the fuck are you now?
"Uh, what-what's um..."
Where am I now?
"What, uh... who..."
What's this room?
I don't understand.
I never seen this place before.
Nobody ever did anything.
[Indistinct mumbling]
"Uh, is this... is..."
Where's everybody else?
What do you want?
I want the person who killed the ghouls.
I don't know nothin' about that.
I can't tell you...
I don't know nothin' about that.
I can't...
I can't tell you what I don't...
Wha...
Those are my things.
"Um, do... are you..."
Are you new?
- We can't lose him.
My husband's a good man.
You can't do this.
George is gonna die.
They see this is a con.
- They're gonna kill him.
- We got to go.
It's not just him at risk.
It's you too.
"And, by the way, the FBI, so let's get real here."
I'm not going to give up on my husband.
"Salt, at the end of the day, you're a Federal Agent."
"We do not negotiate with terrorists, and I'm sorry, but you know that."
♪
Aborting now.
Pack it up.
♪
Do not let your husband die for them.
♪
[Plane engine humming]
It's time to move.
"Salt, get in the van now"
I'm going to go get George myself.
"Salt, stop."
Think about what you're doing.
[Dramatic music]
♪
Line her up.
♪
[Engine slowing]
♪
She's a Federal Agent.
The fair Eleanor.
Truth.
Who do you think should take the test next?
No one.
No one should.
"You have to choose a friend, or take the test yourself."
- Who're you gonna choose?
- Fuck you!
5 seconds... 4... 3... 2...
Chris!
- I'm so sorry.
"- Now that wasn't so hard, was it?"
Sorry.
I need a drink.
Luke... please.
Look in the drawer of the workbench.
Find something you can use as a weapon.
"Something small enough to hide, a s-screwdriver maybe."
- He's too fast.
"- No, no...not when he spins the bottle."
"When he spins the bottles, he's distracted."
"If you can get his gun, this is all over"
"I don't know, mate."
"He's going to kill us, Luke."
"And when he's killed us, he'll kill you."
Didja get that?
He'll kill you.
Chris... shall we?
It was me.
I sent the postcard.
I confess.
You were in Spain.
"What is it, Haribhai?"
I was terribly sorry... to hear of your mother's death.
When?
Oh yes... just now!
"She's dead, isn't she?"
Absolutely!
But that's an old story.
There's something new.
She's here.
Who's that?
Aunty!
I know that.
How did you know?
You told me just now.
Didn't you?
Damn it!
I speak a lot!
So what's the important thing you've got to discuss?
How do you know I had something to discuss?
How?
You didn't tell me.
Neither did Haribhai.
But I know it.
And how?
The fact that you're here means it's important!
First drive the Gujju out.
I'll go away.
But I must tell you something before I leave!
"You know I'm a widow, don't you, Jai?"
What is a man who loses his wife called?
A widow?
Right!
"Marcia's a very pretty girl, isn't she?"
Oui.
"Yes, sir."
"That's what frightens you, isn't it?"
"Why no, sir, I..."
You're afraid I'll become interested in Marcia.
"Why well, if you..."
If you want to...
What?
!
What?
!
You're not very clear.
"Well, sir, I..."
Oh.
"Oh, you poor child."
"I'm such a tease, aren't I?"
Such a tease.
"Yes, sir."
What a lucky man I am to be loved this way.
But supposing I did have to leave you for a while?
"Leave, sir?"
When?
"I'm not saying when, I said ""suppose."""
Well...
Supposing I had to take a trip from time to time?
You...
You mean... soon?
"Well, now, I don't know."
"Oh, you mustn't look so worried."
"It won't be for a long, long time."
"Oh, I see."
-Whoa Anthony--
He's a big boy.
He knows what he said.
What'd ya say?
"Funny, how?"
"Just, you know."
You're funny.
Let me understand this.
"Maybe it's me I'm a little fucked up, maybe."
"But, I'm funny, how?"
Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?
"What do you mean, funny?"
How am I funny?
"You know, how you tell a story...what?"
"No, I don't know."
You said it.
How do I know?
You said I'm funny.
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?
Tell me what's funny!
"Get the fuck out of here, Tommy."
Motherfucker!
I almost had him!
"You stuttering prick, ya!"
"Frankie, was he shaking?"
"I wonder about you sometimes, Henry."
You may fold under questioning!
What the fuck is it with you?
I would never betray you like that.
You're right.
"You're right, I'm sorry."
I...
I'm losing my mind.
It's all right.
We're partners.
We figure this out together.
You know what you are?
You're a nurturer.
Me...
I couldn't even keep my own little dog alive.
Little shit.
"All he needed was some food, a place to take a dump, pee."
Me?
"I just take, take, take."
So I have to take this.
Just...
Don't start crying.
Okay?
And don't kill yourself.
- Hey.
- Have you met her yet?
- Who?
- Audrey.
Your date.
Do you usually meet them first?
"Grace, if you want me to call this off..."
No.
I'm just curious.
"Sometimes I meet them, sometimes I don't."
Just seems so strange.
I'm telling you!
No one owes me money!
I'll break your neck!
What are you staring at?
You don't know me?
You look rough!
But you're a coward!
Just wait till you meet my sister!
Mousy!
What are you doing?
I'm scolding him!
Who is he?
Me.
You're useless.
Have you collected the money?
I've collected...
Some more clothes.
More clothes?
Take off your clothes.
I'll wash them too.
It doesn't matter.
Take them off!
Money?
Where's the money?
"I was chased by dogs, and Biggie threatened to kill me..."
We'll never survive like this!
- But Biggie was tough!
- Why not say that you're scared.
You're a coward!
Admit it!
Wake up!
You fool!
"Don't turn around, I told you."
What if I do?
You wanna bite me?
"Of course I won't bite you, but if you don't leave in 5 minutes, you're done!"
Because the car's going to explode.
You think I'm a fool?
Can't I get out in 5 minutes?
"Oh no, not 5 minutes, but 5 seconds!"
5 seconds?
Counting now...!
"5, 4..."
- Can't you slow down?
"- 3, 2, 1...!"
Damn it!
Still 2 more customers?
"won't scratch the backs of foreign devils, get lost!"
"I wouldn't do it for more money, damn it!"
Damn it again!
It's dangerous!
"Gosh, I forgot to ask where the Jew is!"
You're Yoyo?
"Yes, this is he!"
Prove yourself.
My father said so.
How did he know?
My mother said so.
"Alright, I believe your mother."
Thanks.
Who are you?
- Helle's my last name.
- Hello!
- Not Hello!
Because you could've killed me and you didn't.
You get one favor.
Now go before I change my mind.
"Actually, I get two favors."
What?
"Well, the way I see it I could have killed you twice."
The poison and when you were knocked out.
I didn't!
What do you want?
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(HOOK LAUGHING)
You are bloody brilliant.
Amazing!
(LAUGHS)
May I see it?
The compass?
It's more beautiful than legend.
(CHUCKLES)
"Come, let's go."
(CLANK)
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
"Hook, I... (SIGHS) I can't..."
"Emma, look at me."
Have I told you a lie?
"I brought you here, I risked my own safety to help you."
The compass is in your hand.
Why do this to me now?
I can't take a chance that I'm wrong about you.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
You're sorry!
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Yeah?
Has he ever caught you?
Yeah.
Many times.
"Well, listen."
Since I already lost my deposit and all maybe we should light up.
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you wanna do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
I just have to go is all.
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And, you know, pot is like stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
So you wanna go grab some dinner?
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."
We...
We cool?
What?
Maybe there.
"Let Ricky talk, and you take a good look."
Yes?
"Excuse me, are you Mr. Maurice Leon?"
Yes.
"Sorry to disturb you, we need your help."
- With what?
- We're looking for...
Give me the photo.
Do you know this woman?
"No, I don't know her."
Sorry.
- Why are you looking for her?
- We aren't looking for her.
She died three weeks ago.
Are you sure you don't recognize her?
"No, I'm sorry."
I can't help you.
You'll excuse me.
I don't think I've ever seen him.
Are you sure?
Did you see how he reacted to the photo?
- How?
- He trembled.
Didn't he tremble?
- What are you doing?
- Knocking.
- What for?
I told you I can't help you.
What do you want now?
"- Sorry, we just wanted to ask..."
All right.
Go!
Good-dye!
I can't take any more!
A little trout for my little princess.
What's wrong?
Why are you crying?
Is it that dastard who's making you cry?
I'll kill him!
Luigi!
Renato!
Hello.
Renato.
Hello.
Don't scream.
Not a word.
The others are out there.
Just act natural.
That's fine.
Just like that.
You dastard!
Who's that?
Some nut.
Come on!
What adout Aldin?
So the microfilm got to Italy... to the top of the mountain on its own.
I don't give a damn adout the microfilm.
I just want to find Aldin.
You detter give a damn.
It may de our only means of getting him dack.
Why?
If it is the list of their agents... we'll know exactly where to find him.
"Blair, we gotta help her."
"We're gonna help her, but we can't help anyone until we get a signal."
It's gonna take two seconds to get our-
- Both of you stop.
Blair's right.
"Connor, shut up."
I'll help her.
Riley and I got this.
"Hey, what?"
No.
Right?
Fuck it.
Let's do it.
We're staying together.
Just go find a signal.
Go.
"We'll go, we'll go."
No.
Wait.
The door.
Spirits.
"Oh, no no no."
Connor!
Yeah.
Are you okay?
"Yeah, we're fine."
"Look, we're gonna, we're gonna figure out how to get her out of that thing, then we'll find a way out."
"Just, find a signal."
"No, we're not leaving you."
"Blair, just go find a signal, okay."
"We gotta go, we gotta go."
We'll be back.
Got a little trick
I've been working on.
Ooh.
"It's up to you now, Jefferson."
"Gray, listen."
"If we're going to do this, we got to do it together."
"It's going to take the two of us, all right?"
- You're right.
- Okay.
"Come on, Gray!"
"Oh, man."
You got my boots wet.
"Jefferson, you did it!"
"We did it, man."
"Gideon, take us back to Rip."
Damn it!
I wanted to be the one to kill him.
"Again, I mean."
Um...
I don't think our problems are over yet.
I'm on it.
On what?
It's not working.
The radiation buildup is too progressive.
I got this.
I don't understand.
I must be all out of power.
What happens if only one of these goes off?
Uh...
time will remain intact.
The world?
Not so much.
How the hell is this a surprise?
This is the most cliche thing in the world.
Je.
We've been together for many years.
"If you're so happy, you cry."
Tomorrow I'll kick you in the head.
Will you marry me?
Alright.
"I'm sorry, I didn't cry."
It's okay.
Hold on.
I'm crying.
Shit!
What the hell!
February.
"How could you make the wrong diagnosis, doctor!"
?
"This is a person's life, not some pig, dog, or chicken!"
You shouldn't be a doctor!
Go do something else!
"Please calm down, sir."
Calm down please.
Doc.
Here a New Year's present for you.
Last time you didn't come.
So I'm giving it to you now.
Thank you.
Let's have a look.
Rash: 24 spots
Better.
See you again next month.
Any medicine left just tell the pharmacist.
-Of course I am.
-You can not see.
"No, we are all equal."
I do not.
Will we Krill.
We are all born alike.
"I'm not Bill, there is only one like me around the world."
I am a single krill.
-Where you going?
-I'm leaving.
"-I want to be free, Bill."
Do not have that to be free.
"Come on, let's think more school."
I'm full of shoals.
We walked into school life.
Sometimes I think your mind is its own.
"Tell me, what is beyond the school?"
More-school.
-And then.
"There is nothing beyond the school, a school are endless."
Everything has an end.
"See, I'm here."
And it's not a happy ending.
"It makes sense, Bill."
If I swim to the opposite of the school end up coming ...
At the end of the world.
Very well.
I'll count to three.
A. ..
Two ...
Three ...
"No, I can!"
I always figure to check out first anyway.
- Why?
- Because that how usually goes for the good ones.
You got a hair dryer?
"Unit 42, come in."
"Unit 42, respond to dispatch."
You just missed her.
- Daze?
- She just left.
Who?
Rose.
- Was she alive?
- I don't know.
But she asked about you.
What did she say?
She said:
"""I'm looking for your partner."""
Those were her exact words.
- Is that all she said?
- No.
"She said that roses were dead, and violets were too."
She's fled after that and that's the end of it.
How long have you been here?
She's taller than I thought.
"How long have you been here, Daze?"
I can't really tell.
"Time is bend up now, so I don't know."
I keep missing my flights.
What's that?
"Oh, that?"
That's his.
The guy's.
We're heading out.
Regards to President Wilson.
"Hi, it's me, Artie."
"No, I-I-I know."
I know.
"Look, please, do you think you could meet me?"
As soon as possible.
Artie does to us what he's making us do to them.
He keeps us in the dark.
"For all we know, we're decoys too."
"Look, we're all pretty good at our jobs, okay?"
We accepted the risks going in.
"Having intel in the field keeps an agent alive, Pete."
But Artie acts like keeping us alive
Isn't a priority.
"To him, we're just-- red shirts?"
- Yeah.
- Okay.
"First, he doesn't think we're red shirts."
"And second, that's so cool you knew what I meant."
Come on.
He's got a Tesla too.
Drop that weapon!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Grab the tsuba.
Ah.
You get a look?
- We get it?
- We got it.
Yes.
Now give it back.
- Push him on the floor.
- Talk to me.
Do it now.
Push him on the floor.
"- You, kick him like a football!"
- My feet are tied.
"Ernie, talk to me!"
"Talk to me, Ernie."
"Hey, pal."
"Come on, talk to me."
Talk to me.
I come in here after I saw you in the station house.
"I tell Chicky, ""Hey, there's no hard feelings."""
"You know, it's worth a thousand to get my wheelchair back."
She gets me in touch with her friends.
SlPOWlCZ:
I don't care what happens to them.
"But if they're hurt, you'll wind up either dead or in jail."
- So what?
"- So your room is bad, jail's worse."
"- Well, that leaves dead."
"- No, I don't want that."
I've seen too many good men go down.
Do you want a drink?
It's on the house.
"I can't, Ernie."
I'm a drunk.
"Everybody's got their battles, Ernie."
ERNIE:
Push him on the floor.
- Ernie.
Tell him you're going to punt him!
- Ben and Mike.
- Mike?
- Jade trying to kid.
- He should be.
Someone else could not.
"- This is true, and I go on and kill."
I will not have to do that.
I'll do.
- Let me find a statue of a she.
- Here's what I want to say.
- You got your passport?
"- Yes, sir."
I always forget mine.
Rook This is a great issue.
This is a very big issue.
A very vital situation.
I know.
"I know, Dad."
Do not worry.
You can make it.
You know what?
In this world there are 2 types of crime.
"I used to did not know it, but now I know."
"In other words, the Wall Street bankers."
I always keep the people robbed.
Zırvalıklara spend all their money.
People are descendants.
This is the real crime.
They are the real criminals.
Bankers.
You know what?
Toronta'daki venue had bi guy.
- I don't know her.
"We wanted to ask if you once made a film, a movie with Isabelle Moretti."
I didn't make anything.
And now I'll ask you not to disturb me.
If Mom were alive I'd strangle her.
Are you sure his face...
- I've never seen him.
- He has an Arab accent.
- Cut it out.
- Why are you pushing?
I'm fed up!
"Mom had an Arab accent, too."
"She came from Algeria, not some kibbutz in Sweden."
So what?
So she's an Arab and he's an Arab and so are you.
- Are you cursing me?
- Yes.
"And I'm an Arab and he's an Arab and we're all Arabs, okay?"
Now lay off.
"Get down, he's coming out."
"- We lost him, damn it."
- Where are we?
- Where to?
- I don't know.
Sir?
Sir?
I'm calling an ambulance.
I'm starving.
Where are your sandwiches when we need them?
Maybe that's the doctor.
About time.
It's not the doctor.
How come?
I have to work.
What about Lydia?
She doesn't need me anymore.
Have you split up?
You could say that.
Believe me.
I could see it coming.
"Don't ask me how, but I did."
"There was something in your relationship, forgive me, that didn't work."
When are you leaving?
"Very soon, but I'll see you before."
I hope so.
I'm sorry you're going.
"Hey, Rosa."
"Hey, Marco."
I'm off.
"Benigno, see you soon."
Yes.
"Rosa, goodbye."
good bye.
Has her period come yet?
Not yet.
Going by last month's nursing report it should have come.
"Yes, it is a bit late."
It's over two weeks.
That's too much.
Are you sure she had one last month?
I put the towel on her myself.
It was the week you had flu.
She even seems swollen.
"Yes, but at times they can be irregular."
- Amy!
"- Amy, be careful!"
Go on!
"Get outta here, you hear me?"
!
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Go on!
"- Now, easy."
- Go!
Just go!
Come on.
Come on.
"Please, you have to leave."
"You broke your arm, Georgie."
Is it true you did it trick riding?
Or was it broken some other way?
You think I'm abused?
I didn't say that.
Why do you say that?
"Look, I know how the game goes."
"You people are always trying to put words in my mouth, trying to make me say things I don't mean."
"Now, that's not true."
I want you to feel you can tell me things.
You're in a safe place...
I'm not abused.
"Okay, I broke my arm when I was doing a trick riding routine for my aunt Crystal."
It was my fault.
I shouldn't have been doing it with her alone.
- Lou and Peter don't let me.
- Okay.
Stop.
What's wrong?
Stop.
"I don't want to hear any more of it, and put that back where you found it."
Why?
What's... what's wrong?
"You okay there, Duval?"
You said that I could do this.
"Well, now I'm saying you can't."
"Just because you don't talk about him, doesn't mean that no one else can."
I'm your father and I told you to put it away!
So put that thing away now!
[Cork rattles]
I know.
That was wrong.
I know.
I'll apologize to Gracie in a minute.
Did something happen at work?
Yeah.
No.
I...
Let me ask you a question.
"If Dad came back, right now..."
What would you say to him?
"Oh, my god."
It's happening.
"It's finally happening, isn't it?"
What?
What's happening?
"Well, you're letting in that Dad is gone."
He's gone.
He's not coming back.
"Whoo, yeah!"
You think the city's big.
It's huge!
And lots of naked ladies.
"If I had my own naked lady, I'd never leave my room."
"If you had your own naked lady, I'd never leave your room."
"So, hold on-- do you got the money?"
We got everything!
Whoo!
Whoa...
Whoa...
"Oh, no."
I want to go back.
"Hey, the footpath's for virgins."
We are virgins!
"Hey, not for long."
"If you guys get killed, I'm going home."
Beautiful.
"Oh, my God."
Do you believe this?
"This woman gave birth to her own head, and it sang to her."
-Wow.
-Wow.
"Hey, Cash, where you going?"
You don't ask me that.
Never ask me that!
"Okay, I'm sorry."
I just forgot for a second.
"Guys, come here."
Whoa!
This is going to be tougher than we thought.
How do we tell a prostitute from everybody else?
"John, listen..."
I've never done what you do.
I know.
Just ask him for the time.
"Or a light, or whatever."
You can do that.
I'll do the rest.
Do you want some fudge?
I've eaten tonnes.
I'd better save some for Manuela.
You OK?
I feel a bit...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can you...stop the car.
Stop the car.
"""It's done."""
Are either of the kid's fathers gonna turn up to this dance of theirs?
Abby's dad sends money in a card each birthday.
"Rob's dad, nothing at all."
I could come if you want.
To the dance.
They'd love that.
"They think you're great, you know?"
Rob said you were cool.
Got some catching up to do.
"Like you said, you're not going anywhere, right?"
"They're good kids, Jess."
You've done a brilliant job with them.
I can't find my shoe anywhere.
I'll need it for the beach.
"'This is freedom, isn't it?"
- I feel weird.
- I can't breathe.
- Did you take something?
- Franz gave me a pill.
- Simon's with your sister.
In the VIP Lounge.
You can't allow that.
"- Go home, Luise."
- You can't make me.
Mum will freak if she hears you came here on a school night.
Go home.
- I hate you.
- Go home.
And you come with me.
Move over.
- Where are you going?
- For a wash.
- Will you be back?
- Maybe.
You bastard!
She's my little sister!
Why did you do that magazine?
- Can't you just forget it?
- It was so way out of line.
- I don't regret it.
- So you'd do it again?
- If I have to.
- I don't need shit like this.
Keep your hands off Luise.
"Simon, you mustn't go."
- Please don't be too rough.
- Haven't you done it before?
All you can eat?
Dyn-o-mite!
"That's right, I'm gonna dine with all my might."
RALLO:
Ha!
"What up, black people?"
These threads ain't about the cruise.
I'm filling in for the Sandman at The Apollo.
"But the Commodores, those cats are outta sight!"
You dig?
Is everyone in this family stuck in the '70s?
Can any of you name a single current rapper?
What's a rapper?
"Oh, Cleveland, you are stuck in the '70s."
"They're the guys who wear the gold chains and go,"
"""Wibbity-bop, flibbity-blop."""
"Oh-ho, Donna, that is fresh."
Let's have some more of that!
"♪ Hootie-hop, hootie-hoo!"
♪
♪ And a wop-a-doodle-doo!
"♪ ♪ Scratch, scratch, scratch. ♪"
"♪ Don't give me no jive. ♪ ♪ Uh-huh, uh-huh ♪"
♪ Who bad?
♪ ♪ I'm bad. ♪
"♪ Her bad, mmm. ♪ ♪ I'm bad. ♪"
"Well, if we're going on a '70s cruise,"
I'm gonna go get un-waxed.
"Oh, Cleveland, this cruise is gonna be fun."
But are you sure you can take the week off from work?
Of course I can.
Everybody gets off for spring break.
I will finish it.
"But it isn't, see?"
I'm finishing it.
Hello Jerd.
This is Je speaking.
Yes.
Are you free now?
I've got a job for you.
It's for Adidas.
"You can, right?"
So you're free?
Okay.
Where are you now?
"Okay, I will send you the file."
Bye.
Yoon.
Save the file for me now.
"No, I won't."
Yoon.
No.
This isn't the time to be afraid of losing a job.
Have you lost it man?
I'm not afraid.
"You are not afraid, huh?"
What do you call this?
I said I'll send the rest tomorrow morning.
You have another half.
You won't make it in time.
You taught me that freelance work is all about being responsible.
"If you can't make it, don't take the job, remember?"
But I will finish in time.
Is this in time?
Can't swim...
"Oh, you're such a pussy."
I can't.
You just don't want to.
Lie back.
That's it.
You're OK.
It's easy.
Just float.
Excuse me.
"Come here, please."
Come on...
Bit naughty.
Never mind.
Up you come.
- Tony - is that right?
- Yes.
"Now, Tony, the thing is, we're not really supposed to go in the pool."
It's really only for sporting events.
And the Super Irony Fun Splash Club.
"And the Super Irony Fun Splash Club, too."
You're supposed to be on the tour.
"There was this girl, but she's gone."
"Don't go with her, Tony."
- What?
- You should join us.
What?
Yes.
We'll find you somewhere you can dry off.
"You should get out of those wet clothes, too."
I'd really like to see you out of those clothes.
I'll lend you my cagoule.
Shut up!
"It's my place, you have no say here!"
"Now, I swear in front of the lights!"
I will never care about Ho Foon.
"If I don't keep my words, I'll be punished by law."
Don't you care about me any more?
You mean it?
You are selfish!
You are merciless!
You are impotent!
Bastard!
You bastard!
You really mean it?
Bastard!
How dare you cheat my money?
"Brother Foon, hide up first."
Hide up?
"Yan, take care."
I am not impotent...
I am not!
"Hubby, what's wrong with you?"
It's only a dream.
Foon said that I am merciless and selfish.
Is that true?
"I feel lonely, how to say in English?"
I love you.
I love you.
Really?
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
"Yes, sir?"
"Box F, sir."
Right this way.
"Now, all together, boys."
Two pints.
"Oh, oh."
A tip.
"A tip, of course."
"Seven shillings, sir?"
Why...
- Why not?
"You work hard, don't you?"
"- Yes, sir."
"Bless you, sir."
"- You have a family, no doubt."
- Yes.
"Yes, sir."
Thank you.
- Did you hurt yourself?
- What the...?
"Oh, what a pity."
"You were thinking of the children, no doubt?"
"Now, have that barmaid bring me some champagne."
- Ivy ain't allowed to leave the bar.
- I don't think you understood me.
- What's all this here?
"- This gent here wants champagne, sir."
Champagne?
"All right, then, bring it, bring it."
- But he wants Ivy to serve it.
- Of course Ivy will serve it.
Go on.
Hey.
Cover's off this fuse box up here.
I'd say that sucker stuck a paw in it.
Fried him deader than hell.
Yeah.
How about that?
Must've been those guys that were workin' on the sign today.
Yeah.
Sounds like that.
"Sorry about your husband, ma'am."
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
I'll get a flashlight.
I know it's tough...to go down and see him.
You're sure you don't want me to drive?
Hurry back.
"Take it easy guys, there's plenty here."
Cut pie.
Little portions.
John Philip Sousa.
I don't want to make love tonight.
It's our last night.
I know.
I don't want to make love.
"Yeah, you're right."
Me neither.
"Oh, Christ, Cora."
It's all in the feet.
You must watch the feet.
-Can I talk to you a minute?
"-It is beautiful, believe me."
-You just watch your feet....
But it's not good.
There you are.
I had a dream about you.
Yeah?
Hope a good one.
"There was some kind of... disaster... nuclear, maybe, I don't know."
[muttering]
Seemed like the whole world was burned.
And I was looking for you.
"I couldn't find you, and I was..."
I was calling your name.
So not a good one.
You've been working too hard.
So why don't we stay in bed all day?
Order some food in.
Watch movies.
What?
What is it?
It's Sunday.
Yeah.
I know what day it is.
"Yeah, it's Marius' deadline."
Yeah.
"I know that, too."
"If you ruin Eddie's hands, you'll never get a chance to expose Mukherjee."
So you want me to give Eddie a pass.
Yeah.
"Hey, tell me something."
Yeah.
"I need to ask you something, and I want you to be honest with me."
Of course.
Do you still care about Marius?
- All right.
Yes?
- What's your name if it's no secret?
- Tanya.
"Tanya dear, some tea, please."
"I guess your tea isn't strong enough, so don't bother, I'll make it myself."
I've got such little bomb...
Just bring me some boiling water.
- So it's you?
"- Yes, me."
It means...
- With me?
- I guess so.
- You alone?
- Alone.
All right...
How about you...
None of your business.
Miss!
- Go away mister!
"- I apologized, didn't I!"
Miss!
I'm not going like this.
- What's up?
- Don't you have women's beds?
You put me up with some...
Don't you see...
How come?
- Is he making passes?
"- What do you mean, passes?"
"I can't change, can't put my slippers on."
"Go back to your compartment now, we'll find something for you."
Okay.
"Thank you, Brian."
Thank you very much.
It's okay.
We're just gonna look.
My God.
Here you are.
We were just making sure there was adequate closet space.
Good.
"Well, this house is yours if you want it... but you have to decide right now."
We'll take it.
-Really?
"Oh, my God!"
You know what I kept thinking when we were looking at that house?
That we should get a mattress for that closet.
I kept thinking that it felt like a dream come true.
Come here.
- How fast can you drive this thing?
- Really fast.
Let's see.
Okay.
"- We bought a really, really..."
- Excuse me.
We bought a house.
We bought a big house.
¡Mary!
¡Mary!
¡Mary!
"Mary, are you all right?"
"Mary, talk to me."
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
- Rocky Sullivan?
- Yeah.
- Does he know I'm here?
- Sure.
Didn't you want me to tell him?
That's all right.
Send him in.
"Well, well, Rocky!"
This is a surprise.
- What do you hear?
What do you say?
- I had the date on the calendar.
I thought it was next month.
Otherwise I would've met you with a brass band.
"I thought it was funny you didn't show, but you've been busy the last three years."
You got a swell layout here.
Looks like you're in the dough.
"- Yes, only..."
"Well, you know Mac Keefer."
- Mac Keefer?
"Yeah, heard of him."
- He owns the town.
Can buy and sell it.
- Only he doesn't buy it.
He sells it.
"- That's soft, eh?"
- Softer than that store cot I've been sleeping on for the last three years.
"- Well, you're out now, Rocky."
- Yeah.
- Where's that dough?
- What?
The hundred grand?
No.
I don't know what it is.
Do you?
Not yet.
Now we are done here.
I apologize again.
For what?
Keeping me waiting or lying to me?
Both.
Good evening.
Sabine will show you out.
"Picked the wrong House to crash, Ma'am."
Chthon is pretty picky.
I was looking for my daughter.
She was there.
"A lot of people pass through them, Ma'am."
What's that?
An extract of garlic.
I'd say this is gonna hurt a little but I'd be lying.
I've always hated garlic.
This will be the last time you'll be able to smell it.
I promise.
"Oh my god, mom!"
What are you doing?
Get out of the way.
"You're gonna have to kill me first, you son of a bitch."
Blade.
Krista?
"Mum, we're gonna get you out of here."
"I'm a little busy, sweetheart."
"Mom, look at me!"
You've to come with me now!
I don't repeat things.
"And I hope I don't offend you, but I don't respect Korean men too much."
There are some good men though.
"Yeah, I guess."
Take care of your leg.
Hope your script comes out great.
I'm sure you'll do well.
I really like you.
"Yes, good-bye."
Moonsook.
Thank you.
It was under the bed.
"Oh, really?"
When are you going home?
The day after tomorrow.
How about you?
I'm going now.
Hope you think things over well.
"Yes, I will."
I'll be going.
Good-bye.
My car...
We'll push it for you.
"- We'll push, you drive."
"- So I have to get in, right?"
Here we go.
Steer to the left a bit.
- Like this?
- Left.
"Left, like this?"
I think it's getting out!
- Thank you so much.
But you're talking to me.
Let's meet at our usual place.
What a fool!
Moloch!
Moloch!
Moloch!
Moloch!
No!
Don't do it!
No!
Be quick!
Run there!
Here she is!
"You didn't expect it, did you?"
I knew that it was not delirium!
I knew it.
You'll tell me everything now!
You'll sign everything off to me!
How much did you get for it?
How much was your price?
You're the one who sold your soul.
You!
You didn't rape me.
You stole my life away.
You killed my son.
He could have lived.
He could have been saved.
But you demolished the hospital.
What did you do it for?
You did it for the sake of your damned mega-center.
Save our children!
Korob is the killer!
"Brother Foon, he's the one!"
"- Mousy, you have a go!"
- I can't do it!
My legs go weak when I see him.
Brother Foon is a really good fighter.
I'd be happy if I was half as good as him.
Does it hurt?
I forbid you to scream!
"You've got to smile, too!"
Smile like you mean it!
Mousy.
"Next time you see Mousy, I want you to smile like you mean it."
- Brother Mousy...
- Don't you know what to do?
Scram!
"Brother Foon, you're brilliant."
"When you meet people like that, you've got to behave like a bully."
I can't act fierce.
"Brother Foon, you're my idol."
Everything will be OK if Sifu Wong agrees to take me on.
"OK, I'll put in a good word for you."
We're done for the day.
I've got to dash.
What are you doing?
"Excuse me, please."
Stop clowning around!
Let me pass!
Help!
Help!
This actor is trying to kill me!
Make way!
"Make way, please!"
I wouldn't hurt you.
I'm sorry.
Are you expecting somebody?
No.
Can I talk to my sister for a minute?
It's okay.
I had this whole speech planned. so-- wait wait.
Just-- what I'm trying to say is that l-- but it wasn't for lack of trying.
Dad split... and Mom passed away.
And we got stuck with Rod.
And... you know?
I'm not your responsibility anymore.
I know that.
That's what I came here to say.
I know you're not a little girl anymore.
And... you-- you grew up to be this really beautiful woman.
And you deserve better.
And I'm gonna have to learn to let you go. but I'm gonna try.
okay?
Thank you.
Thank you.
He's not such a bad guy.
I know.
He's not.
I'm gonna go.
Are you okay?
it was my mom's ring.
I didn't know he had it.
I'm gonna be leaving.
I want you to come with me.
Of course.
- Yeah?
Don't go now- or you'll all die.
"If you go now, your whole family will perish."
What are you talking about?
The Jap is waiting for you... to annihilate your family.
He's dead.
He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hvo-jm?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
"Baby""."
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
Honey!
Where you going?
I have to help them.
"No, no no."
"The cops are gonna be here any second, and you're two strikes."
"Okay, you're right, you're right."
"They're gonna be here, I'm gonna buy them some time."
"Well, what about us?"
"Take the van, go down the street, wait for me there."
"No, that's not the plan."
"Fuck the plan, Blair, okay."
He's gonna kill them.
How could you?
I loved you!
Hey.
Hey you.
This is the police.
"All right, freeze."
Fuck face.
"We know you're up there, all right?"
"We want you to come out, and reach for the sky, or..."
I will shoot you in the face.
Oh shit.
Shit.
"Shit, shit."
Hey!
Police!
"Freeze, fuck face!"
Hands in the air.
Stop.
Reach for the sky or I will shoot you in the face.
"What do you know about me, boy?"
You might have split the bottom.
"We'll be back, my friends."
"For the time being, good-bye... and good-bye."
Look out!
"Well, they wanted gold."
Now they got it.
"Hey, Claire, get the medicine kit and some hot water."
Is he badly hurt?
Yeah.
He's got a nasty crack on the skull.
"Some prospector, I guess."
"Go away, Buck."
Get out of the way.
John!
John!
"Oh, John."
"John, darling.!"
"Claire, dearest..."
I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton.
"All right, dear."
I thought I'd... lost you.
"Try to rest, please."
He's feeling much better this morning.
"He remembers everything, thank heaven."
It wasn't so serious as we thought.
"He wants to see you, Jack."
What are you going to say to him?
I wanted you... and I took you with us.
"Well, I'm keeping you."
Jack.
"You know I love you, don't you?"
"You couldn't doubt that, could you?"
Uh!
- Ow!
"- Oh, sorry, babe."
What were you aiming for?
"Hey, got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling."
"I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
- Cool.
- Yeah.
Why do we keep hurting each other?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not...
- On the same page.
- Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
- I count that.
Are we OK?
"Yeah, sure."
"I mean, we had the talk, right?"
"It's just that every time you look at me, it's like you want to run away."
"Nah, no, no way!"
"Or if I do, it's just 'cause I'm busy."
"You know, I got places to be, stuff to do, you know, just like you."
"OK, well, as long as we're cool."
Cool as a...
Cool thing.
Look at them all.
They think I killed her.
Nobody thinks that.
Do they Fiona?
'Course not.
Terrible news.
"Just leave her alone, you bastard!"
Two containers.
One's tap water.
One's battery acid.
You have to choose.
That's the dare.
"No, I'm not going to."
Tell me who sent the postcard.
"- I don't fucking know, all right?"
"- Chris, I'm going to pick a tap."
"If you choose, Gemma's got a 50-50 chance of surviving."
If I choose... she's got absolutely none at all.
Now left... or right?
- You're a sick man.
You're psychotic.
"- Oh, come on, tough guy."
You can do it.
Pick one.
- You're a fucking psychopath.
- Who sent the postcard?
"If I knew, you really think I wouldn't tell you."
I don't know.
"Five seconds, Chris."
Five...
Four...
"Please, don't hurt her."
"Please, she hasn't done anything wro..."
Three.
I'll give you a hint.
I'm left-handed.
"Left-handed, left-handed."
Two...
-Oh my God.
Mom says we should pull ourselves.
It can also ye are not.
It's crisis.
"Lars, you must talk to her."
"I've tried, but she is furious because we conducted the tour."
But you must have the agreement.
Lars.
"I have not seen him in 20 years, since the trial."
So he stands here.
Totally sick.
You just do not let her run over you.
Not this time.
-No.
She takes well to mind.
"Yeah, talk to her."
-Hey it's me.
-I do not know if I want to talk.
-How did it go with Tim?
-It goes well good with him.
He spoke to me twice without screaming.
"Angie, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry I went.
-Are you all right?
You were right.
It was a bad idea to come here.
-Has Something happened?
No.
I'm going home soon.
We can do as you said.
I might take me a little time off from work.
Maybe we can go somewhere.
I'll watch myself.
Just give me a chance to prove myself.
I'm different now.
Really.
I'm ready.
I can do this.
Okay.
That's the kind of confidence
We've been waiting to hear.
Yes.
Okay.
We will.
We'll give you a chance.
We're gonna start out with two weeks
And then we'll check in on you.
"And if that goes well, then we'll give you two months."
"And then if that goes well,"
- You'll be free.
"- Yeah, two weeks."
Yeah.
Okay.
So you can leave here tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.
"Listen, i really believe in you."
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
So go out there and make us all proud.
Make yourself proud.
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.
"Good luck, monica."
Pretend?
What?
"I've wanted to tell you for a long time... your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the formula.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just... got worse.
What did you do?
"I'm sorry, father."
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
"I knew when he was feeding, and I would go out at the same time."
No.
"No, it can't be."
Ellia?
Stay away!
What is it?
What's happening?
Let me help you.
No!
Sheppard.
This is where he's been making camp.
He was here less than hour ago.
Did you hear anything?
no.
Huh.
We watched it for two weeks.
Oh God.
Oh God.
You're lying to me.
You have to be lying.
What?
"I don't know anything about robbing, but I do know that two weeks is not enough time."
"No, two weeks is the perfect amount of time."
It's not enough time.
That's more than enough time.
"Yeah, so much time."
Oh my God.
We can do a lot in two weeks.
Plenty of time.
An eternity.
"Hey, you know what?"
"My driver and our lookout, they're calling the cops right now, so you're gonna be okay."
Everything's over.
Now we just all need to sit tight.
What?
No.
"No, no no no."
"No, we can't do that."
He's gonna be back here.
He's gonna kill us.
You don't understand.
Who?
Him.
He's not right in the head.
He did things to me.
You want a tissue?
Never mind.
- About as sure as an old man can get.
Is she related to you?
No.
Never met her.
"Anyway, thanks a lot."
Thank you.
Could I play anything particular for you?
"Oh, no, thanks."
"I'd love to some other time, though."
Good.
Come back again.
"Now, don't go doin' that, Mrs. Pauley."
You've done enough.
"I want to, Tickler."
?
"[ Piano Stops ] Well, I'm gonna have to earn it."
I don't know.
I have to think adout it.
"In any case, it can't go very far."
He has no education.
He is a dit uncouth.
And you are not a woman.
"You know, Renato, you're a real killjoy."
Are you OK?
"You do everything to hurt me, Renato."
Don't exaggerate.
I'm not exaggerating.
Let me tell you something.
I've had it with you.
I've had it up to here!
And I'm getting the hell out of here.
I've had it.
"Pull me up, please!"
- What a nice country road!
- Don't look down!
Hold on tight!
That's it!
That's it!
Now!
Like that!
Good!
A bit more!
Thank you.
"So, we've arrived."
"But I'm afraid, not where we were supposed to."
- According to the plan we should be...
- Let's check it out.
"- Come on, please!"
- My transmitter has disappeared!
What did you want to transmit anyway?
That we landed at the wrong place?
- That's all we know.
- Leave that to me.
What's this?
Against the cold.
- Maybe we pressed the wrong button.
- Why?
Did you press anything?
- No.
Emilia!
Katya!
I see flowers!
And bees!
I thought they only existed in fairy tales!
I see your giant elephant's cock.
I want it inside me.
I really do.
Now it's inside me.
-Right.
Are you there?
There's no one here.
"Hi, daddy."
Are you crazy?
What if the boss sees that?
Do you like me at all?
-I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Do you?
-Do you know what'll happen - if my vegan friends find out I'm chopping lamb all night?
I'm coming.
No problem.
I'll never sleep with you if you go now.
I hate you and your barometer.
I'd rather marry Peku than you.
"I hate you, Peku!"
"Kaitsu, I mean!"
Any explosives?
-Come on!
No way.
How about the fireworks stuff that got banned?
You're a genius!
I'll get them.
Two rolls of wide duck tape.
This is all we've got.
One price for all.
And here's some fuse.
Keep the change.
I'm getting chills.
-I'm getting nauseous.
-I'm getting rich.
"Come on, I told you it's all an act."
There's nothing to it.
It's all fake.
See?
"This isn't real wood, it's fake."
[BELL RINGS OVER TV]
There's the bell and we're under way.
"Come on, Bull."
Come on.
-Pulverize him.
-Use your footwork.
He's not moving.
"[CROWD YELLING, BOOING OVER TV]"
"Come on, Bull."
Do something.
The Battling Bailiff has yet to come out of his corner.
-You're very calm about all this.
-It's all part of the act.
"No, this isn't in the script."
"Wait, wait, he's moving."
"I told you, it's a sure thing."
The only way I can lose is if he left the ring.
He's leaving the ring.
"Bull, what are you doing?"
I could have burned the money.
It would have been quicker.
It's that kind of performance that gives this game a bad name.

GHS]
"It's big, Mama!"
"Oh, it's lovely."
"Oh, it's gorgeous, isn't it?"
e'll go upstairs.
This is your room.
"Okay, you know what?"
Don't dirty the windows.

Hello sunshine.

It's all right.
"That's why I did it, didn't I?"
I told you that I wanted to.
know you always used to say.
""" I'II always get you a house, Mum, when I'm older."""
"I know you did, but...."
"That's the best thing, isn't it, about what we're doing?"
"You work so hard, Zayn, and I just.... 'm so proud of you."
Very very proud of you.
I can't even thank you enough for what you've done for us.
t's all right Mum.
You don't have to cry.
"You're just happy, aren't you?"
Happy tears.
You have a slow leak.
"Guido, he fix."
You make-a such a nice new road.
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.
Even though you not a Ferrari.
"You buy four tires, I give you a full-a size spare"
- absolutely free!
"- Look, I get all my tires for free."
"I like your style, eh?"
You drive the hard bargain.
OK.
Luigi make you a new deal.
"You buy one tire, I give you three for free!"
"Oh, would you look at that?"
"Ramone, Ramone!"
Then Luigi make you a new new deal.
"No, no, no, no."
Deal me out.
Pass.
"No, thank you."
"- No, no, no, no."
No.
- This is it.
My last offer.
"You buy one tire, I give you seven-a snow tires for free!"
Done.
"You interested, you call me."
You know where I am.
Ah!
Stop!
Let me...
You're a beautiful girl.
You know that?
That's what they love around here.
They need girls like you.
"And with me in your corner, you're in like Flynn."
"Thanks a lot for helping, really."
Good.
That's nice.
That's what I like to hear.
I like to be thanked.
No.
"I'm sorry, I don't want to."
Come on.
Get off me.
Don't play hard to get.
Get away.
Get off me!
I don't mind if you don't.
Get back.
Get away!
"Come on, we're gonna trade favors."
Tit for tat.
"You wash my back, I'll wash yours."
Definitely not a funny way to die.
Crockett I though!
t you were off.
Since when has that mattered?
Who's in the bag?
Morty Price.
The comic?
He got a nice slice from a steak knife.
Definitely not a funny way to die.
"No, ma'am."
"My guys, they don't smoke on the job site."
They're good guys.
Are you sure your guys haven't been sneaking around here?
And smoking?
And lying to me?
And smoking?
I'm pretty sure.
"I need you to be honest with me, Javier."
Because I can't have someone lying to me.
"To my face, under my roof, on my time."
That's a lot of prepositions.
"I mean, there's no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there?"
"I mean, we made promises to each other."
"I mean, we have a contract."
That's like making promises.
Isn't it?
Maybe I should get back to work.
"Oh, yeah."
"Right, yeah."
"That's great, yeah."
- Javier?
- Yeah.
We're good.
Right?
You and me.
"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
We're good.
"- Oh, good."
"Okay, that's great."
"Yeah, he did great work."
Hey.
I'm... very hungry.
- This is Storm Island?
- That's right.
- And what do you do here?
- Sheep farmer.
- Really?
- I'm going to bed.
My back's playing up.
You're a fool.
Lucky to be alive.
Why were you out in the storm in the first place?
Because I had no idea it was going to be so severe.
Give me two.
I want to sleep.
I can do that.
Good night.
- Would you like some more soup?
"- No, thank you."
It was delicious.
There's some brandy next door.
Would you like some?
Do sit down.
"Where do you live, Mr Baker?"
I used to live on that boat.
I suppose I am a damn fool.
I moved from London about a month ago.
- Really?
I haven't been there for years.
- When were you last there?
Four years ago.
And that was to have a baby.
- You've been here four years?
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive, you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
All right.
So... what do you think?
Did they see us?
"No, man."
I think we're good.
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me!
No.
Where the hell is Jimmy?
He should have been here ten minutes ago.
You think Jimmy's actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is.
Wait a minute.
"No, no."
What?
What?
Let me see.
- Who the hell is that?
- What?
What is that?
"My God, I think... that's a telephone line."
"Look, you just stay here and I'll be back as soon as I can."
All right?
I'll go see.
Hey!
"Hey, mister, can I use your phone?"
"Hey, who are you?"
- What are you doing?
- I'm a pilot that crashed.
Airplanes ain't safe.
Airplanes ain't dependable.
Look what happened to you.
Put that down.
That's railroad property.
"- Mister, I gotta eat something."
- Put that down!
You roach.
"It's been a home for me, man and boy, for 50 years."
They still got a place for me on the railroad.
"Mister, I got a kid who's hurt bad."
I gotta take her something to eat.
- Leave it be!
- I'll pay for 'em.
You drop 'em.
Now you get outta here.
Take it easy.
Just take it easy.
You know you ain't gonna make it.
Damn!
Edgar!
- You be easy now.
"Yeah, man, take it easy."
"My God, Miller."
I don't know where to begin.
"Nah, don't sweat it, kid."
There is nothing to say.
I wish there was some way I could repay you.
"Well, for starters, you can give me your left arm."
"In fact, that is why I came by here today."
"Isn't it, Tucker?"
Fair is fair.
"We are just razzing you, kid."
"You keep your left arm, I will keep my settlement."
Hell!
I've heard these guys who'd give his arm and a leg to get a deal like this.
"So, I guess you can call me lucky."
"Well, Miller, if there is anything I can do..."
"Nah, forget it."
No hard feelings.
"I'll see you around, pal."
Hey!
Help!
Hey!
Hey!
It's got my arm!
Somebody help me!
Someone help me!
Reznik.
"I got ya, I got ya."
"Be cool, be cool, alright?"
"Who did it, huh?"
Why didn't you turn the fucking braker!
Can people be evil?
- Where are you getting this...?
From your mother...?
-All her religious crap...?
- No.
You know what?
"Owen, listen put your mother on the phone, I wanna talk to her... she's not here..."
"All right. please have her call me when she gets back, alright...?"
Well.
Dad!
"Owen, I want you to get that crap out of your head, okay?"
You mother just... she has problems... and I'm gonna talk to her.
"So I don't want to hear any more about this, alright?"
alright?
...Yeah...
"You have a good night, pal."
I love you.
"And I'm sorry about the last couple months, but I'll see you real soon, okay?"
- I promise!
Maybe next weekend.
- Okay...
I love you!
Can I come in...?
...You have to say it You can... come in..
Are you a vampire...?
I... need blood.
To live.
- How old are you?
Really.
- twelve...
But...
I been twelve for a very long time...
"I don't know, professor."
This scratch looks pretty old.
The Ark's magnetic.
"Yeah, let's check it out later, come on."
There's no engine!
That'll keep 'em out for a while.
And us in.
"Shh, quiet!"
Sound the alarm.
"Come on, MacGyver, they know we've escaped."
We haven't yet.
Give me a hand here.
No one left through the gate.
Search every inch of this place.
Find them and kill them.
"Load it up, professor."
What?
You sure this will work?
Nope.
Good.
That's the MacGyver I know.
Open this up.
Looks like they're gonna open the door for us.
Get some men over here!
"Yes, sir."
Now what are you doing?
Trying to stop some ethnic cleansing.
Buckle up.
It worked!
It worked!
Ha-ha-ha!
I knew it would.
"You're not embarrassed, are you?"
Of course not.
"I just thought you were working, that's all."
I took off.
For this?
Yeah.
Didn't your father ever teach you how to tie a tie?
"No, he didn't."
You know...
I didn't mean to make you do anything
You didn't want to do.
I'm chillin' yo.
"Oh shit, my dude..."
That's a nigga right there.
"No gas, no gas!"
Oh!
You just gonna stand there?
You're not gonna say anything?
"Yo, what you want me to say, yo?"
It ain't like they lying.
"You know, you're fucked up."
Yo.
"Yo, you ain't my girl."
"You need to chill the fuck out, a'ight?"
"Oh, so I'm good enough for you to fuck"
"And for me to suck your dick,"
But I'm not your girl?
"Well, then fuck you..."
fuck you!
"Yo, you good?"
"I'm good, yo."
"Wait, Chris."
"That's a shame, Frankie."
Lot of unanswered questions.
You want your fight?
You got your fight.
"You and me, right now."
"- Well, I..."
No.
- What?
"Daddy, you can beat him."
Come on.
- You're next.
- It'll be like the old days.
I will kill you.
I will knock your nose off your face.
"You wanna knock something, you knock it off of me."
- That's right.
"- All right, you got a fight."
"Greg, get my gloves."
"- I'm sorry, bro."
"- Yeah, well, sorry's not gonna get our money back."
- He was so fast.
- You should have moved around a little more and tired him out.
- We have nothing.
- I don't know what to say.
- I gave it my best.
- Yeah.
You know what?
Your best wasn't good enough.
"- Hey, you have the time?"
"- Aw, not you again."
We don't have any money.
We just lost it all.
FINN:
I think I know where he might be.
(KEYS JINGLING)
JASPER:
Christ.
What's he keeping in here?
FINN:
I don't know.
Him and the previous manager added this door years ago.
"God, please, oh, please, don't let him be in there."
There's no way.
"If there was a dead body in there, we'd be able to smell it."
"(GASPS) Oh, God."
What?
Is he in there?
"Oh, my God."
"Close it, close it."
What happened to him?
It looked like he was burned.
"Yeah, I don't know about that."
Did you see his suit?
It was fine.
It wasn't even touched.
Isn't it obvious?
"I mean, you read his journal."
He broke the cardinal rule.
You don't fuck with time.
"Jasper, please take his hat off."
It's my thinking cap.
What the hell is there to think about?
"We need to call the police, guys."
Hang on.
"Yeah, thanks a lot."
- What's your name?
- Tia.
- I'm Rocky.
- I'm muscles.
- Crusher.
- And I'm dazzler.
We're the earthquake gang.
Does that scare you?
- No.
- Aww.
Let's change our name again.
We gotta have a name that scares.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
How'd you do what you done?
"Well, I really didn't do anything."
Yeah.
You a magician or something?
No.
You want to join our gang?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
- Thanks anyway.
"- Aw, sure."
I guess you're like the rest of them.
You've heard we're a nothing gang.
"Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing."
Someday we're gonna be the toughest.
Take over the whole territory.
Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block.
All right.
No Italians.
No Italians.
"Frank, it's not really our bag."
"Frank, it's not really our bag."
"Pot of VB, thanks, love."
"Pot of VB, thanks, love."
"Hey, mate."
"Hey, mate."
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Are you looking for a shooter?
Are you looking for a shooter?
I'm available.
I'm available.
We got our own guns.
"Oh, it doesn't have to be guns."
We got our own guns.
"Oh, it doesn't have to be guns."
We can use knives.
Anything.

Anything.
Bit of fuckin' four by two - anything you want.
Bit of fuckin' four by two - anything you want.
"It's your call, mate."
You're the boss.
"It's your call, mate."
You're the boss.
How much it worth?
How much it worth?
You ever offed a man before?
You ever offed a man before?
LookI know he's not dead.
I would feel it in my heart.
We're soul mates.
No.
Agent Lee.
I need legal help.
We have a suspect who's refusing a cheek swab.
I'll file for a DNA search warrant.
What's the name?
Rebecca Kemp.I'll e-mail you the info.
Listen... you miss working with us?
I think the legal department is more my speed.
"Why, do you miss me?"
"Uh, sure."
Boss...
Agent Lee is getting us our cheek swab.
Rebecca paranoid or guilty?
Might just be angry.
"At Finn, us, the world."
"Go back with her to her apartment, get Finn's stuff."
"And, no, I don't want to wait for a search warrant."
- I'll grab my coat .Wait at the elevator.
- Okay.
"Hey, you."
Where's my money?
"Yeah, you."
Did you and Jimmy spend it?
Please get away from me.
I don't know you.
I am Jimmy's fiancee.
James loved me.
He used you.
I know that what he did was wrong.
It was stupid and I was angry at him.
But you were his best friend.
You should've helped him.
You were a little girl then.
I'm a big girl now.
I gave him a chance and he blew it.
You liar.
He's the one who gave you a chance.
He made you thrive on stage and gave you the best parts.
He took you places you thought you'd never reach.
"He let you dance and sing, the best thing you ever did."
I loved your father and mother very much.
How can you even talk about love?
"Relax, it'll be easier if you relax."
My love.
We'll try again.
Help me.
- Okay.
Gently.
- Okay.
"Okay, never mind."
I can't.
"Never mind, my love."
I'll get some bandages.
"Tell me the truth, Daddy."
"What, Gonki?"
About Mommy.
Tell me about Mommy.
"Say it, Daddy."
Mommy is dead.
Say it again.
Excellent!
What's wrong now?
You've suffered internal injuries!
You're joking!
Touch your rib cage.
Does it hurt?
No.
No?
What about this spot?
"Yes, it hurts a bit."
"You've breathing problems, too."
"Yes, how do you know?"
I think you trained much too hard.
I must try to relieve your tension.
You'll be okay when that's done.
Does it hurt?
No!
It doesn't!
What's wrong?
"It doesn't hurt, does it?"
What are you doing?
Trying to kill me?
It's burning...
Stop it!
It won't hurt.
Have you finished?
Feeling better?
You're great!
Of course.
You dare to hit me?
How many hands you want to use?
You're magnificent!
"Just go to the bathroom, get the scissors and cut me loose."
Nothing bad has happened.
Cut me loose.
"I want you to say 10 times, ""I won't listen to my brother."""
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't...
"Louder, please."
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't listen...
I said louder.
Our mom wouldn't do that.
More clearly.
Elias...
I'm sorry.
Again.
"I'm sorry, Elias."
( turns off video )
Come now.
Please.
Cut me loose.
What happened to your nose?
Nothing.
Nothing serious.
"There, you see?"
You'll cut me loose and I'll make you breakfast.
"Cut my feet loose, they hurt."
Lukas?
"I know it's hard, but we'll make it."
"Come, just cut my feet loose."
"Come on, it'll take a sec."
I'll make breakfast.
Just cut it.
It's the bloody guerrilleros.
We can't hit them from here.
Call the helicopter.
Unit 47 to helicopter.
Please respond.
Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
- Those bastards are in control of the dam.
"Yes, we know."
They've taken out the guards.
We'll try to attack them from here.
Please support us.
We've got no heavy weapons.
We must try to get closer first.
Over.
- What are you waiting for?
Attack!
- Hurry up!
"- Hurry up, Jaime."
They're coming back.
- All right.
Why can't you throw hand grenades at them?
We'll be above them soon.
They're not going to enjoy this.
They'll be here in a minute.
"Hurry up, damn it!"
"Oh, my God!"
They've hit the helicopter!
Is it bad?
Can you get up?
I need help!
José is injured!
-It's nothing.
"Hey, it's me."
Why can't you tell me?
Okay.
Sit down.
There's this woman that I like a lot.
But it can't happen.
She's not a Tribbiani?
No!
So is she someone from work?
Yes.
"Well, does she like you?"
Sometimes I think she could.
But I can't do anything about it.
Why not?
It's complicated.
She was with this other guy for a long time.
Someone from work too.
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.
"Wait, I thought you hated everyone at work."
"No, no."
I only say that..
so Chandler won't feel threatened because I'm his only friend.
Excuse me?
"Sorry, sorry."
And I'm your only friend too.
"So this guy she used to go out with, is he still in love with her?"
"-No, I don't think so."
-Okay.
Is he a good guy?
"Yeah, he's the best."
"Well, I said maybe, but... look at his pant cuff, Tony."
Is that a gun?
Could be.
We have guns.
Not Ellie.
Uh... she packed hers.
"No, actually, mine's on me."
"Well, I-I thought you said you weren't comfortable traveling with it."
"Well, I wasn't at first, but it's become kind of a habit."
"Listen, this guy could be law enforcement, so let's show him ours and ask to see his."
"What, guns?"
Badges.
Hey.
Sorry to bother you.
"Again, you mean?"
Yeah.
"Uh, but this time I need to see some I.D."
"Well, too bad."
I'm not Navy.
She asked you a question.
You're making a big mistake.
Freeze.
Hands where I can see them.
Oh.
Okay.
"Well, what's his deal?"
I'm an air marshal.
Mike Beers.
Thanks for blowing my cover.
"Sorry I drew on you, Mr. Beers."
These two kind of...
forced my hand.
And you are lucky to have such a stallion at your disposal.
"No, your needs are fine."
It's your neediness that's the problem.
- Then why didn't you say that?
- I didn't want you to make a scene.
You didn't want me to make a scene?
You didn't want me to make a scene?
Ha!
You dump Fez!
I dump fries!
There's your scene!
Here's a dollar.
Sorry about the scene.
"Oh, poor Fez."
Too depressed to leave his room.
- That's it.
"You guys, we gotta cheer him up."
- Knock first.
"If Fez is alone, I'm guessing he's not wearing pants."
"Oh, awesome!"
Wait.
Let's catch him.
"- Oh, wow."
- Wow!
Check out all this great stuff.
"Oh, my God."
Is that a race-car bed?
- I call shotgun!
- Ay!
Oh!
"Fezzie, come on out."
I can't.
Say it.
Let's go.
Everywhere.
Everywhere.
Even though-
Even though- We're scared.
We're scared.
'Cause it's life- It's life.
And it's happening.
"It's really, really happening... right now."
All right.
"Now let's kiss to make it real, okay?"
Okay.
"So, how is your art project?"
- Is it in the museum yet?
- No.
That's not how it works.
"You know, they have to know about your work-"
"I would just march in there and show it to them, you know?"
No one is going to live your life for you.
Okay.
"That's not how itworks, but okay."
"So, how's Ellen?"
"Oh, she's wonderful."
I can't sleep at night thinking about her.
I just wish I had met her 50 years sooner.
- Yeah.
- But then maybe I needed... 70 years of life... to be ready for a woman like Ellen.
This rug is dirty.
Everyone get a box on the way out.
Ow.
Ow.
Huh?
You're the type of woman... who needs a man you can control.
"Well, guess what..."
I'm not that man.
I'll show you!
You little whore!
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Emma, let me see your hand."
You keep the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!
How the fuck could you let her get out alone?
"You crossed the line, John."
You put the girl in jeopardy.
"Yeah, well, I didn't lose her."
She's reckless because of you!
To get to you!
"Now, I'm gonna go get her, bring her home... and handcuff her to the fucking banister!"
She's gone!
"Oh, man!"
She's probably at the EI.
Come on.
No.
No way!
You stay out of this!
You fucked up enough already!
Come on.
Couldn't you have said something... she wanted to hear?
Anything?
Couldn't you have lied?
I did lie.
Help!
Help me!
That dog belongs to me.
"I bought him, Smith, and I don't allow my dogs to be shot."
"That is, of course, unless I shoot them myself."
That's all right.
I'll give you twice what you paid for him.
He's not for sale.
"Just as you say, my good man."
Just as you say.
"Well, what others have you?"
"- Uh, here."
Hitch 'em up.
- These two will do.
I ordered a collapsible bathtub from Seattle.
Did it get here?
It's a bathtub.!
It's a bathtub.!
You sweet meats.
You're losing your home.
Easy with ye.
Come on.
Out.
Come on.
Come on.
"Come on, Harmon."
"Here ya are, Mr. Smith."
We thought it was something to pile wood in.
The only bath a person gets up here is by the sweat of the brow.
How interesting.
Mush!
"Been a great pleasure, gentlemen."
A great pleasure!
Nice guys.
You've got your million.
"No, jim, i haven't."
"Oh, of course you have."
What do you mean?
I gave it all to nick.
"I had to, jim."
He needed money desperately.
I had to help him.
Don't you see?
"Sure, i see."
Try to understand.
I understand.
I'm just beginning to understand.
"We know you're in there, jim fisk!"
"Come out, you yellow-bellied crook!"
What's the matter?
Are you afraid?
Come on out of there!
"Jim, you can't go out there."
They'll mob you!
You think i'm afraid of a mob?
Jim!
"You stay here, josie."
This is one time the colonel is going to be at the front of his regiment.
Jim!
Jim!
"What's the matter, boys?"
Losing your nerve?
"This is no joke, fisk!"
This is no joke!
"If it is a joke, it's on me!"
You can't talk yourself out of this!
Four years.
Oh?
"Killed his girlfriend, Ida, while on the booze."
Not bad for a beginner.
Eats her fill and then she's off.
- What did he come looking for?
- Me!
Do I owe you?
I'll pay you back.
So you were in the can?
"- Yeah, but that's over."
- You're quite a guy.
I'm a street vendor now:
"Matches, newspapers, suspenders."
You can't make money that way.
The main thing is to go straight.
Am I right?
- You're right.
What's your name?
Reinhold.
"See ya, Reinhold."
"You used to be my gal, Cilly."
Not anymore.
Maybe we can be friends again.
Get the fat guy for us.
We can use him.
He's done time in Tegel.
The two new guys are lightweights.
We're gonna get that guy.
- Looks real solid.
- Yeah.
And not too bright.
That was seven years ago.
I know.
"I'm trying, darling."
Did you see this?
Why are the drapes open?
"Kay, are you all right?"
-Are you hit?
-No.
It's all right.
Stop!
Stop!
Halt!
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.
-Keep them alive.
-We'll try.
Alive!
Stay by the door.
"Yeah, come in."
"-Mike, are you all right?"
-Yeah.
"There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom."
And I know that's upset you in the past.
You felt it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.
But it's because I admire you and love you that I kept things secret from you.
Now you're the only one I can trust.
Fredo?
"Well, he's got a good heart."
"But he's weak and he's stupid, and this is life and death."
"Tom, you're my brother."
"I always wanted to be thought of as a brother by you, Mikey."
A real brother.
I'm starving.

MAN:
"That's Pam,"
The Overly-Confident Morbidly Obese Woman.
This fat suit smells like corn chips.
WOMAN ON P. A:
"Going again, please."
Thank you.
"And this is the set of ""The Girlie Show."""
It's a real fun ladies' comedy show for ladies.
"Hey, everybody, look."
Here's someone you never get a chance to meet.
"It's the head writer of ""The Girlie Show,"" Liz Lemon."
[Clapping]
[Burps]
[Telephone ringing]
"""The Girlie Show."""
"Hold on, I'll connect you."
Hey.
PETE:
What's up?
"Hey, have you looked at that cat-lady sketch?"
It's still seven minutes long.
"Yikes, okay."
"Oh, and Standards has a problem with that Michael Jackson bit."
Why?
- Here we go.
- Here we go.
Richard!
Hi.
Hi.
I thought your car was over here.
It is.
It's down there.
You could give me a ride to it.
Doesn't that break the rules of the thing?
This can be like the afterlife.
"You know, like we're angels or something?"
Cute.
What are you doing in my car?
"No, I don't know you, and you certainly don't know anything about me."
"I mean, what if I'm a killer of children?"
Yeah.
"Well, that would put a damper on things, wouldn't it?"
"See, you're acting like I'm just this regular man."
Like a man in a book who thewoman in the book meets.
I'm not doing that.
Did I just invite myself into your car?
Is that what I just did?
"-Well, I'm sorry."
"- No, I'm sorry."
- I'm sorry.
-You should be.
Good.
Terrific.
Canyou get out of my car now?
Okay.
Okay.
Do you readme?
"Listen, we losthim on the bridge."
Right.
I got him.
He's headin' north on East River Drive.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
You take Sal.
I'll take the beard.
There goes Sal.
- You want the red or the white?
- Pour it in your ear.
"- Yes, sir?"
"- Yeah, guyjust walked in, what's his name?"
I'm pretty sure that one's a Frog.
"He made me, too."
"He lives on four, he went up to six."
"He's cute, real cute."
The other guy's a Frog.
He checked into the Edison.
Had a hooker sent up.
You should have collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How about Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
"Why don't you do the same, Doyle?"
You look like shit.
Come on.
"Look, my partner and I made this case, you know, originally."
- We don't want any feds screwing it up.
- Case?
- OK.
"- Just go, Paul."
Well.
I'd better get off.
You'll call and let us know how he is?
You'll see that he's all right?
Look out for him?
"- I hardly know him, really."
- Promise me.
So say it.
All right.
I promise.
Where the hell have you been?
- How's it going?
- Great.
You brought me gear.
You have to stay in overnight for observation.
I'm not staying here all night.
"No, I've things to do."
You just had a suspected heart attack.
Lie down.
"Heart attack, me arse."
Just a touch of angina.
More lively than usual.
You're staying here.
What's it to you?
"Please don't leave me here, Paul."
Please.
You stay here.
OK.
That everything you wanted to say to her?
Let's go.
"They can help you, Dr. Bryar."
Not any more.
- Let me know when HRT's ready.
- Got it.
"Gideon, you send those guys in there, hostages are going to die."
Yeah.
"You don't do something, they're going to die anyway."
It's not gone.
I know.
"Well, you said when the chip came out, it would go away."
It's...
I still hear it.
Then there must be more of them.
"You said it was the only one, Leo."
I can still feel the buzzing.
The burning.
- Dr. Bryar?
- What?
- Reid.
"- It's all right, Elle."
Is there another one?
You know there isn't.
"- Lf there were, Leo would have told you."
"- Don't listen, Ted."
Make it stop!
I know what it's like.
- Make it stop!
- I know what the voices are like.
He's trying to trick you.
The voices.
They won't stop.
They've been talking to you since you were a child.
"–Hey, where is he?"
Where is he?
"–What are you gonna do, hit me?"
–I don't see any witnesses here.
–Yeah?
Let my bruises do the talking.
Don't make me do something that we both don't want me to do.
–Yeah?
Go ahead.
–Just tell me where he is!
Please.
Just tell me where he is.
"Go ahead and whack me, you cracker prick."
I'll make my own million.
–Is that what you want?
–Mm-hmm.
–Is that what you really want?
–Mmm.
"–All right, let's go."
Let's go.
–What?
What are you... –Come here!
–No!
Let go of me!
–Leave me alone!
–Open up!
"You and me, we're about to get real acquainted if you don't start remembering."
–Don't touch me!
–Where is he?
–Open up!
–Let go of me!
You don't wanna tell me?
Brilliant.
"Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic..."
"Well, whatever it was you just did,"
It was absolutely heroic.
"It was nothing, I just..."
Get off the street!
- Run!
- Hide!
Here come the goon goons!
Let's get 'em!
They run like chickens.
More goons!
We're trapped!
Hide or they'll get ya.
Over here.
It ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans.
The earthquakes' got girls in their gang.
Let's finish 'em.
"Now, where in the world did that come from?"
It was a set up.
- Let's give it to 'em.
- Yeah.
That was an ambush!
Stop banging into me.
I can't see.
I can't get out.
Get me out.
Get it off me.
Yeah!
All right!
"Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out."
"Yeah, thanks a lot."
I can see it now.
It's gonna be great.
Lex.
It's Gina.
Please call me back.
I found who you've been searching for.
I know who the traveler is.
"After the funeral, I plan on taking some time off."
Get the jet ready.
Zurich.
You can't run away.
"No matter where you go, I'll always be there."
You can't get rid of me.
You need my help.
There's still good inside you.
I know it.
I don't want your help.
Don't go to Zurich.
I'm going.
I have to.
Dad was right.
"If you open the box, it will destroy you."
It's all I have left.
It's not true.
You still have me.
I'm done listening to you.
You make me weak.
Long night.
It's good to see the sun again.
It's too bad Lionel's not here to see it.
Lex closed the funeral to any and all guests.
"In other words, Lex is the only one invited."
Cash.
Who is this?
No I.D.
Caught her sneaking outside with this.
"Well, you're not a reporter."
Who sent you?
I don't like uninvited guests.
And I don't like waiting.
"If your security isn't airtight, we can't do business."
None of us will.
Put her in the cell.
Hook her up.
Let's go.
Move it.
"Oh, my God."
"Amanda, what have they done to you?"
You're about to find out.
Get in there.
M-more.
I want more.
- This is private property.
- Call a cop.
Think you can school me?
Watch me.
"If I shoot you now,"
I can't have any fun with you later.
You won't have any fun with me now.
I might have a little.
- Yes?
- It's Stone.
- This better be important.
"- Trust me, you're gonna want to hear this."
Now it's done.
I'm callin' this in.
Thank you.
"Hey, guess what?"
"In case you didn't know, you have the right to remain silent, bitch."
Hello.
"No, no, no, no!"
Shit.
Hey.
"You, you're out."
Where you taking me?
Shut the fuck up.
We're almost there.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Blair, I'm so sorry."
"Okay, I'm, I'm a fucking idiot."
I just...
Please don't tell me those were Timmy Song's guys.
He's the only one powerful enough to get you out.
Okay.
"Blair, we have to go."
We have to get out of town right now.
"No, Ollie."
I gave him everything we had.
And I had to borrow on top of that.
"Look, you don't have to worry about that right now."
"No, I have to worry about it, okay?"
He calculates his late fees in body parts.
"All right, when's our first payment?"
Next week.
Fuck.
Slug.
Suppose Thompson walks in.
"If he walks in his sleep, he'll walk in."
He's upstairs snoring his head off.
What did you turn that light on for?
"Listen, are you on the level with me?"
"Oh, that's okay."
What's the matter?
Are you getting yellow?
No.
"Just careful, see?"
"Hello, kids."
Don't you think you need some dough?
It's pretty late to get a hitch around here.
I think you better take some.
Here you are.
"Go on, take it."
"No, we don't need your dough."
We'll get along okay.
"Yeah, sure you will."
"Well, so long, kids."
Good luck.
"There, see?"
He don't care.
Come on.
"Gee, he's nuts, ain't he?"
Come on.
- Have you seen Jimmy?
- Yeah.
Everything's all right.
"What's the matter, Patsy?"
Just playing a long shot.
Yeah.
You seemed bored.
-I tried to be seductive.
-Other guys can see it.
One guy under a bridge.
He wasn't interested.
-Answer it.
-It's ok.
-Nothing's wrong.
-Answer it.
-It's ok.
-I said answer it!
Answer it and turn it off.
It bothers me.
I'm going to the bathroom.
-Yeah.
-Hey I'm at yoga place.
It's not at this time usually.
"Yeah, the trainer came home late last night."
Maybe she was drunk her ass off.
She loves drinking.
You don't have to hang up.
She isn't here yet.
Are you busy?
I guess I'll have to hang up then.
I got vaccine for German Measles.
They say I don't have the antibodies.
Doctor says that we have to use condoms for a month to 3 months at least.
It takes about that long for the antibodies to generate.
You have to do them.
I can't take pills.
-Hyang Gi.
"- Mitchell, you understand this."
- You know what I'm going through.
- I do.
"So, why won't you help me?"
!
"OK, you know what?"
There... there is another option.
It just might be the answer.
We recarpet?
What?
!
"No, no, no, no."
"This guy, he's one of us."
A vampire?
- How did you get his number?
- He found me.
He says that he has systems in place.
No killing.
But he'll make sure the kid's fed.
We have to do something.
"- You'll take Adam to him, then?"
"- Oh, no."
"Me and him, we do not get on."
"I'll call him and make the introduction, but after that I don't want any part of it."
"Oh, just take me to them."
Wow.
"Oh, wow."
This...
"Oh, this is really nice."
"All right, George!"
"Little bit of help here, please?"
Mm.
There are a lot here.
- What's after that?
- Nothing.
I know what there is.
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- There's a road near the tree.
I'll tell you what there is.
"""Near hhe hree is a wooded lane, greener hhan hhe dreams of God."""
What's after the tree?
Read the address.
"It says a tall, single tree."
There's a lot on this hillside.
is it very tall?
"Yes, it says it's very tall."
It must be different from the others then.
The single tree?
There are so many.
They're all on the hill.
That's what it says here.
I don't think this will get us anywhere.
There it is.
"There, look, a single tree!"
- Where?
- Up there.
I see it...
What a big tree!
Look at it.
He was right.
"Jahan, take a look."
Where?
"Too late now, you'll have to look up through the roof but you won't see it."
Where'd you spend it?
"Look, man, I just wanted to start over."
Quit the Agency.
Have your drink.
It could have been anybody walk through your door.
Yeah.
But it was you.
Go clean up your mess.
Three minutes.
Start the count.
"No, please, God."
Why did you do that?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
What a shame.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
- She's just a kid.
Jesus Christ.
"- The fuck, Emerson?"
No loose ends.
How long have you been out in the field?
"It should say there, in the file."
I want to hear what you say.
A long time.
I didn't know you smoked.
When did you start?
Right after I quit drinking.
Why did you stop drinking?
I was a drunk.
What would you say is your current disposition?
How do I feel?
"Oh, Red, you missed a spot."
See it right there?
- No!
No!
- On the hood right there.
"Stop, stop!"
That's cold!
Help!
Please!
Stop!
"Thanks, Red."
What was that for?
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?
"If you do, you gotta be clean."
'Cause even in hillbilly hell we have standards.
"What, I...?"
I don't get it.
I thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job.
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
"I mean, not with me!"
But there.
"Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone."
"- And I'd be in my cone, and it's..."
- Wait.
"Wait, you're being nice to me."
"If you want to stay at the dirty impound, fine."
- I understand you criminal types.
"- No, no, no, no."
That's OK.
"- Yeah, the Cozy Cone."
- It's newly refurbished.
Don't you believe me?
You want me to show you?
What are you looking at?
Don't you know me?
I'm Mousy!
I'm a fighter!
You're filthy!
And you have a bad attitude!
"You see good people, and you bully them!"
"You see bad people, and you fear them!"
My big sister's no coward!
"If we don't get the money, we'll come after you!"
"Mousy, who are you shouting at?"
- Him.
- Who's he?
He's me and I'm him.
Useless bum!
Where's the money you collected today?
I collected more laundry.
- Here.
- More business as well.
Your shirt looks dirty.
Take it off for a wash.
It's OK to be dirty.
- Take it off!
- No need!
Where's the money?
Where's the money you collected today?
Ah Fook's house has a fierce dog.
Ah Sao says he's got no money.
Big Mouth shouted at me.
I didn't collect any money.
Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?
What?
"You said you'd love to call me but then you said, ""Look forward to hearing from you,"" and..."
You see how that's kind of confusing?
"Yeah, look, we'll talk."
We'll get in touch.
You did it again.
Very vague.
You know what?
Let's just say that you'll call me and then we can skip all the nonsense.
"Goodbye, Gigi."
- He was cute.
"- Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him."
What are you doing?
I'm not calling him.
"If he wants to see me, he'll call."
Wow.
That guy Alex really made an impression on you.
Was he hot?
No.
He was just right.
Morning.
"Morning, Ryan."
A surprise mocha venti just because you're so awesome.
- Love you.
- Love you.
Good morning.
Okay.
So?
"Oh, hi."
- He asked me out.
NATHAN:
Where can I contact her?
Look.
If you continue to harass me.
I'll have to report it.
Where is she.
Damn it?
- You're going too far.
Tell me where she is!
- I don't know.
Because of you.
she's in the hands of a judge...
Yeah.
I know.
What do you know?
- The madam called you and complained.
Indeed.
Madame Zoe is threatening to sue us.
I don't give a damn.
Think of all the consequences.
You could be sued for...
Yeah.
Where's the girl?
The prostitute?
- Yes.
The prostitute.
Don't you know you're forbidden to even ask the question?
I don't care.
I love her.
You understand?
I'm your insurance company.
I speak in the name of the company.
OK.
"- Oh, my God."
"Paulie, I'm really sorry."
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.
Fucked up.
"Yeah, you fucked up."
But I'm all right now.
I can be trusted now.
I'm clean.
"On my kids, I'm clean."
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.
"After what you said, I couldn't come to you."
"You know, I was ashamed."
I'm ashamed now.
"But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie."
You're all I've got.
And I really need your help.
I really do.
Take this.
And now I've got to turn my back on you.
$3.200.
That's what he gave me.
$3.200 for a lifetime.
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.
- We got to get out.
- I don't want to run.
I don't want to.
Am I supposed to just pick up and leave everything?
Go hiding?
I don't want to do that.
Hi Zeke.
Hello young lovers.
I got to get back to class.
See you back in class...
Striktly hands of Bro.
"Zeke, I wouldn't do that."
She's just my friend.
You wouldn't?
That's what best-buds do don't they?
Yeah!
I can think about a dozen times...
-
I have been the best friend you ever have.
"Saved your ass, lie for you, stolen for you."
"Zeke, I am telling you."
Nothing is going on.
So we are on the same page?
Yeah.
"Ok, come on, let's hang out."
I steal 6 packs of beer how does that sound?
"Tonight, me and you we are going to the movies."
Leo is in a new movie.
You got to see it.
"I can't, I have to work tonight."
Why do you work in that awful place?
"I need the money, I have to save up to college."
"Alright, whatever."
I ask Mimi to go with me.
"Ok, see you later."
Bye!
All hands on deck.
Jake?
I'd get the witch hazel.
"And I'd say, ""Witch hazel?"
"""What are you, 90?"
"Get some fucking painkillers."""
"And I'd say, ""Hey, it's an excellent astringent,"
"""and we're out of aspirin."""
"I'd turn the argument into a good, hard, angry fuck."
"Well, that's where we might have a problem."
What do you mean?
I've got... a bit of a problem in the downstairs department.
What?
"You know, downstairs."
What?
!
Where?
!
"Oh, for fuck's sake!"
- My cock doesn't work!
- What?
My cock doesn't work!
Hi...
He's watching us.
"We can't help it, Sid."
No.
"It's OK, isn't it?"
Isn't it?
It's fine.
We're fine.
Fine.
OK?
- I'm fine...
- And dandy...
Here.
This isn't too bad.
Here.
Jones...
Jones?
"We never seem to get a break, do we?"
What is it?
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.
What's happening?
We have most important friends.
Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
Don't you touch me.
What about Jones?
"There's no trace yet, sir."
Jones is dead.
I killed him.
He was of no use to us.
"This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed."
She'll bring a very good price.
Mmm?
"Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken- if it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl."
It would reduce our loss on this trip.
Savage!
I hope you don't mind that we opened things up.
Long as you pay for them.
"Not planning on drinking that beer and driving, are you?"
LILA:
No.
No.
We wouldn't do that.
This is for later.
Just kidding.
"CASHIER: $7.95, please."
Y'all have a nice night.
Y'all too.
"She's too young for you, Bill."
I like them young.
Shit!
"That trooper's behind us, man."
Don't look back.
Just be cool.
What do we do if he pulls us over?
He ain't going to pull us over.
"Slow down, Ray."
Don't panic.
"He recognized me back there, man."
I know he did.
"If he did, he would have arrested you."
He was just looking us over.
"White boy and a nigger girl in Texas, that's all it is."
Right now he's probably running our plates.
FEMALE RADIO DISPATCHER:
5-42.
"5-42, go ahead."
"On your out-of-state plate,"
How you know?
Change the tags.
Here how?
The hotel staff is here.
"Its big job Papa, yeah it is."
Go tease the girl who is standing being me.
Who me?
"Yeah who elss, go tease her."
"She will shout, help... help... i will come and beat you, hotel's staff will gather here."
At the same time they will change the tags.
No one has ever tease a girl in my whole family.
"You are saying i tease her, i don't even know it."
"There is not much to do, go near her and say."
Coming?
And that's it.
How will you say?
Coming?
Ma am.
Ma'am?
Is she your sister?
No...
coming?
Coming?
"No... no... which one, the one behind me."
Right or left behind you?
Left one.
You left or mine?
Your left.
There are two girls in my left.
The pink one.
"There are two with pink, light pink or dark pink."
Laxmi Narayan do one thing.
Pure killing without motive.
Wasn't that our challenge?
And then you go and kill my boss.
You tying to make things easy for them?
"I mean, I like a challenge, but..."
"Well, that was just stupid."
Don't worry.
They have no idea who killed Henry.
What are we gonna do?
We'll go back to basics.
We'll mess up the pattern that they think is emerging.
What do you suggest?
I've got you a double.
Is that OK?
Beats chemo!
Cheers.
MOBILE PHONE RINGS sorry.
Yes?
Nik?
Did you get the paperwork?
Yes.
I haven't had time to Look at it.
"Nik, I really need you to sign it."
Soon.
Nikki?
I will.
But right now I'm...
"Don't tell me, you're busy."
Yes.
OK.
I'll sign them and send them.
Thanks.
Can we spend some time together?
You're so beautiful.
- You're not serious.
"- No, you're really beautiful."
I envy you.
"- Please, stop."
You're much prettier.
- Not at all.
- How old are you?
- How about you?
Thirty-one.
I'm older.
You are?
Then I should call you Big Sis?
How did you meet Joongrae?
It was just a coincidence.
He wanted to have a drink so we did.
What do you want to have?
"Oh, it's my treat."
What would you like?
Should we go over there to the inlet?
I think it's not far.
"Oh, the inlet?"
"Sure, I haven't been there yet."
"Well, hop in."
This is my car.
It's cute.
"No, it's a piece of crap."
Director Kim thinks that you and I look alike.
Who told you that?
The restaurant owner told me.
That man always talks crap.
Get 'em!

"- Oh, go away.!"
"- Here, here!"
"You can't do that, old man."
"Let go, you!"
"Oh, you!"
You bully you!
You great big brute.!
You bully you.!
You brute.!
"Let go of me, you brute.!"
Let go of me.!
- No.
Come on.
- Let go of me!
Really!
You men cover the back.
You come with me.
You're under arrest!
"- Marjorie, are you all right?"
"- Yes, I think so."
But where have you been?
Locked in a garage.
Had to dig my way out.
I got here as soon as I got the police.
How are you holding up?
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hello?
- Jane!
- Mum...
We're here now.
Shh.
"Let's pack up your things, and we'll drive you home."
"Erm... no, it's all right."
I want to stay here.
- Erm...
- OK.
- OK.
- I'll be fine.
I promise.
"Would you both stay, just for a little bit?"
Of course we will.
As long as you need us to.
What do you want?
I wanted to return this to you... make sure you got it.
It was David's.
One of the lads at the station was meant to get it back to you a couple of weeks ago.
He forgot.
Can't trust men to get anything right.
Ta.
Take care of yourself.
"One glowing review, you're the Sheriff of Hackney?"
It's just...
It's just what?
"You don't want to spend the rest of your life in uniform, like me?"
I agree with you.
"You can taste the Silvaner grapes, the Muscat."
I can sense my old lady.
What's your old lady want?
She coming to the basement?
"You mean, if we stay too long?"
Really?
- She'll come?
"- Yeah, in a bikini."
In a bikini?
I'm gonna wait then.
I'll wait till she shows up.
Till she arrives in a bikini.
- This I want to see.
- Me too.
Will she dance for us?
"Sure, she'll dance."
She could get lost in such a big basement.
It's roomy enough.
- How long have you been married?
- An eternity.
- How long?
"- 25, 24 years."
What?
- 24 years.
- How much longer will she want you?
I can't say for sure.
We're heading down a long road.
She's built to last.
"So, I'll show you your future room."
Shut the door.
I'm a masochist.
"Mr. Lawrence, I told you I wasn't an actor."
I'm so sorry.
Sorry about what?
That you did such a terrific job?
That the phones are lighting up like crazy?
They love you.
And those little ad lib things you did?
You were wonderful.
Wasn't she wonderful?
"So, what do you say?"
About what?
About doing it full time.
It's just three nights a week.
I promise it won't interfere with your day job.
"I mean, I don't know."
You really thought I was good?
I told you when I met you.
You're a natural.
Mr. Monk?
"Well, I..."
Why don't we think about it?
Okay.
I will.
I just did.
I want to do it.
"Oh, Mr. Monk, I'm so sorry."
But I could really use the money and I think it could be fun.
There you go.
A star is born.
No.
Don't worry.
It's not going to change a thing.
"- Let's get him out, okay?"
"- Please, please, get me out of here!"
It's gonna be a piece of cake.
When I was a kid I used to build....
- I used to build forts in these tunnels.
- You did?
Yeah.
"You gotta watch, because when it rains, the water comes up really quick."
"Joey, listen to me."
You go find a phone.
You call 911.
You tell them to send a rescue squad.
"All right, Joey?"
Go!
Go!
"- Well, where's he going?"
"- Well, this grate is locked."
- I'm gonna need a little help.
- But you said you could do it.
- What's that light down there?
- I don't know.
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Don't leave!
- I'll be right back.
- Wait.
Just don't!
"Ben, listen to me."
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise you that.
"But you gotta do me a favor, okay?"
You gotta trust me.
Can you do that?
But it's no longer a Chinese's place.
It's a British colony now!
I don't care!
I won't let anyone bully me.
Alright.
Leave me alone!
"The salary which you haven't paid me, if it's convenient... may I get it back?"
What did you say?
The salary which you...
The previous line.
No.
"You told me to leave you alone, didn't you?"
Good!
Very good!
It's what you said!
"Master, you love chicken's kidney's very much."
Eat more.
More rice.
Let me do it...
"Master, your rice."
Don't you know I am on diet?
I want half rice!
Let me do it...
"Bastard, what a useless guy!"
Half!
"Look, half bowl of rice which you want!"
Eat it!
"You do this in my place, you are not giving me face, are you?"
You said you would leave me alone.
"You lost, Chan Mon-gut!"
Peace!
Peace!
"No, you're not a dog."
You're a great man!
We're outmoded characters.
We're outcasts.
I don't want to die like a dog.
"But you see, I didn't keep one last bullet."
I have one.
-Jeffrey!
"-Jenny, don't move!"
Don't leave me alone!
- What'll you do?
- Storm my way out!
"Don't kill anymore, please!"
Give up your guns and come with me.
What?
You saw me kill Sidney.
He was my best friend!
And you dare tell me to surrender?
"When Chang died, I swore I'd kill you."
But now I don't want you dead.
Get out of here withJenny.
How?
They'll chase me to the ends ofthe earth!
I have nowhere to go!
Get out there and say you're a cop.
See ifthey give up their guns!
Jenny!
Jeffrey!
Dumbo!
"Thanks, Mickey Mouse!"
I owe you.
You owe me nothing.
Just think about it.
"Think about it, boys!"
All right.
I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
"All right, you know what?"
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.
Douchebag.
Come on.
I was joking.
Come on.
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down.
Come on.
"I mean, what are you complaing about?"
"You got abs, man."
Kinda.
"Whatever, dude."
I'm not even sure I want to buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"I just need you to prove it, you know?"
Prove you're not a cop.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
I got it.
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
Are you a cop or not?
Now you come up with this story and I'm supposed to believe you.
When was the last time you saw this girl?
He's putting them in the water so I'll find them.
- He wants me to find these girls.
"- You're crazy, that's it."
- He called me.
- He called you?
- That's right.
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.
- You dreamed it.
Get in your little boat and get the fuck out of here!
You're an alcoholic.
You need help.
- Get your head examined.
- Maybe you need a drink.
- It'd ease the pain of being wrong.
- Get out of my sight.
Keep those people out of here!
Am I talking to myself?
Put Grandpa back on.
Just a second.
She sounds good.
Yes.
"Okay, bye-bye."
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you all right?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Okay.
This is it. 16 months ago.
I'd be afraid.
What are you afraid of?
I don't know.
There's a lot of time to think.
Strange ideas come to mind.
For example?
Some things.
When you're alone?
-No.
Even though you're with me?
Even more with you.
Then you're afraid of me.
You?
Not a bit.
Maybe indirectly.
"Those ideas may scare me, not you."
I'm glad I don't scare you.
What'ss the impression you get about me?
-Fear is not one.
Will you be upset if I tell you something?
I hope not.
Sometimes you make me laugh.
I find you funny.
Yikes.
Yes.
When you're worried about something.
You're funny.
You think too much.
That's true.
Of course it is.
You're always analyzing everything.
And saying what's good and bad.
I saw it like five times.
Where's the love?
"Right on, let me get two apple chickens and some pecan waffles."
"Nothing for me, I--"
"I had, like, four hot dogs this morning."
"Eat, Lemon."
Eat!
I hate skinny women.
"Hey, Lorna."
Ten beers.
"So, Tracy, we should talk about the show."
"Yeah, I ain't doing it unless I can get to do it my way."
"You know, I want it to be raw."
HBO-style content.
"Well, it's not HBO."
It's TV.
And I don't think that it's a good fit--
"You know, cause I wanna drop truth bombs."
You know how pissed off I was when Us Weekly said that I was on crack?
That's racism.
I'm not on crack.
I'm straight up mentally ill!
Sure.
I got mental health issues.
"Sure, well, you know..."
"Who doesn't, really?"
"Hey, has anyone seen Liz?"
Or Pete?
She went out.
"Well, who's in charge when they're not here?"
I'm in charge.
Oh.
- Where?
Where?
Whaddya have to do?
Don't you plug in the phone?
- Which part?
- I don't get it.
"What about that guy, Taka?"
We need to ask you something.
How d'ya get on the 'net with PlayStation2?
We can't?
!
But I heard you could.
Says we need an adapter...
But we don't have one!
Who does he think we are?
We ain't got one.
Have you?
Why the hell not?
That was no use.
We're back to square one.
Doesn't Taka have a computer?
"No, he just knows a lot."
Buys magazines then can't afford a computer.
What's up?
"That guy, Kanzaki!"
He'll have one.
That weirdo electrician?
He's not a weirdo!
"Who, who?"
My Dad told me.
So the weirdo's got a computer?
He's not weird.
"- Oh, you don't?"
- No.
"Well, how would you say it?"
I don't know.
I'd call her up and ask her to a dance.
Or a movie?
"Yeah, or a movie and we'd go and get something to eat."
Or drink?
"No, not any girl I'd propose to."
"Oh, I see."
"Well, go on."
"Well, then when the time came, I guess I'd hold her hand."
You mean like this?
Yeah.
Then what would you say?
I'd say:
"""Betty, I'm crazy about you."
"Will you marry me?"""
"Well, let me think."
"Yes, Ed, I guess I will."
"- Well, then we're engaged."
- I think that's what they call it.
Oh.
"- It's swell, isn't it?"
- Yeah.
"Hey, what will your mother say?"
"She'll probably say, ""Thank, heavens. """
- Come on.
Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
How you like the sodas?
"- Okay, Nick, take it out of there."
You're one of those rich computer twins.
Otto recoded your white blood cells to fight the cancer in my blood.
You brought me back to save you.
Otto:
The donor grows much stronger than any of my models anticipated.
[Gunshot]
"You hang on, all right?"
You hang on!
I should have gone to your ball games.
I should have...
I should have been better to your mom.
Duval:
He's dying.
He said you could fix him.
I'll meet you at the gate.
"No, we're coming in together."
No more lies.
Why does he think he's my father?
Because he is.
No.
"No, no, no, no."
"No, it can't be."
It is.
It is not.
It's impossible.
This doesn't happen.
It...
it... it never happens.
"If by ""it"" you mean me, it's happened."
Look at me.
You know who I am.
- Shut up.
I'm tired.
I've got to do something.
Come on!
Let's go and take care of this.
"Tom, I can't find Franz."
"Please give him my best regards, and give him this."
This is the video footage.
I've decided not to do the project.
He'll be upset then.
"I'm sorry, but I think it's for the best."
I'm upset too.
Didn't you like the mask?
The mask was great.
I'm not so certain.
It's not your fault.
Who's fault is it then?
Certainly it's not yours.
Take care Tom.
I've been waiting for you.
I had the late shift.
Now I've got no time.
What are you doing?
Shopping free of charge
Help!
Do you live here now?
You came here to ask me that?
Something has happened.
What?
A supermarket was held up.
A woman was shot.
Is he shoplifting now?
What are you up to there?
That's all we need for now.
"You know, I don't think they're going to Jeremiah's at all."
Me either.
Fantasia's coming home to see her kid.
"Hey, Hurricane, just how well do you know this gal anyway?"
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
"Ha, ha, that's real fucking funny."
Fuck.
Goddamn her.
Ronnie.
Lila.
"Why, look at you."
You've gone to Hollywood.
Look at you.
You're all grown up.
"Stand back, let me have a look at you, girl."
"Yeah, you're still ugly."
I'm just playing.
You look fine.
"You know what, I'm feeling fine."
I'm going to go see my baby.
I'm going home.
"You can't go home, Lila."
The cops are after you.
What did they say?
Get in the car.
"You know, I didn't do the things they say I did."
"Yeah, I know that."
Being on the run makes you look guilty.
I already look guilty.
And looking guilty's being guilty for black people.
Look at this.
4 more break-ins on casino boulevard.
It's getting so you can't walk out the door anymore.
"Well, you can walk out the door."
You just can't go left.
That's not the point.
"A man should be able to walk out his front door, turn right, turn left, or walk right out into the street if he wants to."
"Don't make me lock you in the house, dad, ok?"
"Well, hello."
Ooh.
That shirt looks sexy on you.
Does it?
"I, uh, hadn't noticed."
"Hi, I'm Doug."
I'm a pisces.
I like walks in the rain and bags of pork rinds.
"Work it, baby."
Work it.
"I got the trash, babe."
That'll be our deal.
"Every time you buy me a shirt, I take out the trash."
"Oh, that's ok, honey."
I got it.
I got it.
"No, really."
It's fine.
What--what is this?
Barry's big and tall shop?
What?
"Oh, that's trash, baby."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop?
Did I?
"Go, I'll pay you later."
I can't start the day... with debts.
So what do you want?
I also start the day with debts...
"What am I working for, then?"
I don't give a damn.
Beat it!
I have no money.
What do you want?
Come back later!
"Just think a bit, I have to earn a living."
"Go on, beat it!"
I won't flee...
"Hi, Korotoumou."
You could wait until the morning is over.
Korotoumou... do you have my money?
Don't insult me!
- Aren't you a bitch!
"- Yes, I am."
"I have your money, but I won't pay you."
You'll pay me.
Is the Mecca wall painted... with your shit?
And yours?
Fucking bitch!
You old whore!
Calm down!
Have you no shame?
"Traoré, breakfast is ready."
What's the matter?
I don't feel like talking.
I'm worried.
- You know them well.
- I don't know what's going on.
- I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
- What is wrong with your mom?
- She's bipolar.
She's bip...
She's an official lunatic.
And you let us get in a car with her?
"I tried to talk you out of it, but you would never listen to me."
If you would've told us she was crazy.
"No, near the mall."
"No, I'm fine."
"No, Mom, I just need you to come pick me up."
"Mom, no, please, just come pick us up."
"Izzy, I'm so sorry to have to put you through this."
"Grace, it's me."
I always knew.
I always knew there was something different about your mom.
Go.
Go.
"I'll deal with Olivia, okay?"
- Mom?
"- I'm up here, honey."
How could you do this?
You lied to me again.
You stopped taking your medication again.
"- Oh, I have my medicine."
- I hate you.
I'm done.
I'm so over it.
I have my medicine.
It's right here.
who cares?
OK.
You're ugly.
You're the ugliest woman of Earth.
Everyone knows it but me.
To me.
You're beautiful.
You don't know me.
When will I know you?
Enough.
I mean...
In two weeks?
A year?
Ten years?
How much time does one have to fall in love?
You're not in love with me.
You just want to leave your apartment.
No.
I don't want to leave.
You don't want to and yet you're suffocating.
So you fall in love with the first woman who cries in front of you.
You want her to get you out.
- No.
I'm fine here.
Not me.
I'm not buying it.
You're not even handicapped.
But I am.
You revel in your phobias.
Of course.
I revel in them.
That's what phobias are.
How strange!
He still hasn't appeared.
Oh!
It fell apart!
"Oh, my god!"
This is Moriarty's doing.
There he is!
Hey!
Here we go!
You won't get away from me!
Wait!
Here they come!
What a fantastic engine I have stolen!
It works perfectly with my beloved 'Crow'!
Dirty rats!
Here we go!
"You, get out of my way."
How paltry!
Here we come!
"Stop that, stop that!"
You won't get away from me.
You coward.
"Oh, I'm coming apart!"
It seems that we're the last two planes left.
What?
!
Here I come!
"When it comes to technique, I can hold my own against anyone!"
Get down!
How swift he is!
"If that's how you're going to be, I'll just come to you."
"All right then, commence Mrs. Hudson's basket operations."
Hit it!
"Stig, nice and easy."
[ Tires screech ]
I didn't factor into this experiment that the stig only knows how to drive fast.
"Eventually, he got bored with the truck, so I took advantage of his window of low-speed driving and gave it my best shot."
"All right, you ready?"
I'm ready.
This is the slowest the stig has ever driven.
Don't let him down.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
The plane threw me.
Come on.
Just like a football.
Throw it!
I'm coming!
Wood:
"All right, that didn't work."
Ferrara:
"All right, you ready?"
I'm ready.
[ Tires screech ]
Yeah!
Yes!
"Aw, come on, you unplugged it!"
You ready?
"Oh, I got it!"
I got it!
"Oh, crap!"
All right.
"Now, listen, we're gonna do it this time."
I feel good about it.
"Are you a robot, too?"
Yeah.
"I started to rust here, but Ohji fixed me."
"I'm usually prettier than this, but you caught me at a bad moment."
Because the Ruin's begun.
What is the Ruin?
"Is it going to happen to me, too?"
"Man, I don't know what's going on!"
"But, you really are beautiful, mister."
You aren't all beat up like me.
You're like a human!
"I have to get back, or else Ohji will be worried!"
Ohji will be worried!
Ohji will be worried!
Bye-bye!
I don't think you're beat up.
I don't.
You can have this.
It's the prettiest one I've ever found.
It'll keep you safe.
Thank you.
"Just now, that was..."
Luna...
Ringo!
"Humans will perish, just like us."
I'm a robot.
A robot kid?
I can't stand kids!
They have that new kid smell!
The world's on its way to Ruin!
It doesn't need any goddamn kids!
Die.
Don't worry.
I stuck a bloody Band-Aid in it before we left.
Holy crap.
Look at that!
Cool!
A diving board!
Oh... my...
God.
This is the greatest thing ever.
And someone just dumped it here for us to find.
We've got to take it home!
What are we gonna do with it?
I don't know.
But...
look at it!
It's... it's got the... and it's... up and... and bounce and... and bounce!
He's right.
We need it.
"One, two, three... go!"
"One, two, three... go!"
"One, two, three, go!"
"One, two, three, go!"
"Aah, Jamie, this is ridiculous!"
"You'll eat dead bugs out of the zapper, for God's sake, why won't you eat your peas?"
You love peas!
Come on.
This is name-brand stuff.
It's three times the price of the food I eat!
"If you want to breathe, you have to open your mouth."
See?
There's no reason for...
"Now you're just going to have to eat some eyebrow, too."
Do you wanna leave ?
I like this place.
It's been a long time since we came here.
Your mother is gonna wait.
It was at least a year and a half ago.
"I wanted to take a book with me, and I forgot."
It was quite sunny !
You had to insist to bring me here.
As usual I dithered.
Aferwards I was happy.
Things were never the same after that.
"Try to sleep now, sweet heart."
Was it Francois who's just called ?
"Yes, he is on the way."
You didn't tell him.
No.
I don't want him to worry.
It's bad enough with you being upset.
This should be him.
Mom ?
Yes sweet heart ?
How do I look ?
Great.
Hi François !
Everything's alright ?
Yes !
How is he ?
Did he sleep ?
No even if he's really quite exhausted.
"He can't sleep, can he ?"
And he keeps asking about you.
"I go see him, and then I will make us dinner."
"Oh, my."
"You have got a present for mommy, don't ya?"
You need a diaper change?
- I'll do it.
- All right.
You have at it.
- Go see auntie Nic.
"- Okay, baby."
Who's the best baby?
Not in your mouth.
Not in your mouth.
"Ooh, that's yucky."
Wait.
"Oh, gotcha!"
"It's okay, baby."
"Auntie Nic's not really a baby person after all, is she?"
"Okay, I know-- oh, not a ""baby person""?"
Then what's this?
"Oh, well, I mean, honey, of course you're a baby person."
It just takes practice.
That's all.
Maybe she just doesn't like to have her diaper changed.
"Oh, no."
She doesn't.
"None of them do at this age, but you'll learn all that."
"Actually, you'll just get a nanny, and she can deal with all that stuff."
Okay.
There we go.
We're all better now.
- What?
"- Thank god for nannies, right?"
"I'll make sure to get one that's a ""baby person."""
Yeah!
We should come back to the beach tonight and go skinny-dipping.
Yeah!
You know?
"Like,I just want to be naked in the dark ocean with you."
Naked.
You know?
Johnny?
"No,no,no,no,no."
"Everything's fine,it's just..."
What?
I like you.
"I just need you to,like,taper it back a little."
Just a little.
Like this.
You don't need to do that.
It's all good.
We're cool.
"You're kinda,like,bam, instant on me,bam?"
Yeah.
"and I need to,like,ease into it."
Have a little flirty time.
I don't want flirty time.
Flirty time's awesome.
"Flirty time is not awesome,okay?"
This is awesome.
This.
"This is awesome,okay?"
Come on.
"Don't be afraid of it,Bella."
You have absolutel no patience.
You're going to drive yourself crazy for nothing.
So you didn't take the bedtime pills?
I did.
But I still couldn't sleep.
That's odd.
So how are you today?
Feeling better?
Let's have a look.
C'mon.
This side.
They're all dry.
Let me check your neck.
Wow they are all gone.
Lift up your t-shirt.
"So there aren't anywhere else, right?"
All gone.
So you are cured.
"Yes, I am."
Why you sound like you knew it already?
Oh that's why you didn't wear a jacket.
"You know if you're all better, you didn't have to come."
Done.
Congrats.
So next month we won't see each other anymore.
"It's all good, doc."
Thanks a lot.
Hey...
You are okay.
It's all good.
You understand.
It's all good.
"Before you went you knew this would happen, right?"
So what's wrong with you now?
The ambulance is saying 15 to 20 minutes.
- I can take him.
- Caroline can take me.
"- No, I didn't drive."
- Then I'll wait.
You will not wait.
"Okay, you need to see a doctor."
- Tyler's driving.
End of story.
- Fine.
- Go.
- I'll bring my car around.
- I see you're packing.
That's a good sign.
- It won't be long now.
- Did you get the missing piece?
I am a fucking bastard.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Are you gonna come over and hit me?
you've been waiting your whole life.
I'm in a chair.
Come on and hit me.
I'm not going anywhere.
Come over here and hit me.
I'm in this chair.
Now's your chance.
So hit me.
I'm nothing fucking like you-- nothing.
I'm never gonna be like you.
I'm not that little boy anymore.
Can I ask you something?
what's up? just packing your bags just leave?
"Yeah, but my dad was only 12."
"Well, if I was older, do you think that I would make a very good husband?"
"If you were older, I think you'd make a wonderful husband."
I'll be back when I'm 25.
Will you wait?
That's a long time to wait.
It won't be as long as you think.
Now don't move.
I'll be right back.
Nancy?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What are we fightin' about?
I don't know.
I guess I do.
I'm jealous.
Of Wilbur?
He's only 14 years old.
He is?
"Well, how old did you think he was?"
"Oh, much older."
"I mean, he's very mature for 14."
I thought he was at least 15.
"Oh, Bob, you're so silly."
(CLEARING THROAT)
Now let's see.
"""Nancy, I know I'm not very much,"""
"""but I am old enough."""
"""And I couldn't love you any more if I were 100 years old."""
"No, that's no good."
"""Nancy, honey, if you marry me,"""
"""I'll be the happiest, luckiest man in the whole world."""
Mama!
Calm down.
This was a bad idea.
Hop out.
"Good for you, Jay."
It has to be when he is ready.
- Nope.
He's driving.
- What?
- What?
I-I can't.
- You're doing it now.
"Jesús, take the wheel."
He's terrified to be in the back.
Now you're gonna put him in the front seat so that he can kill all of us?
!
Can you not make this fear worse?
I watched Dede coddle Mitchell when he was afraid of the dark.
"Till he was seven, he'd only blink one eye at a time..."
Gave a lot of girls a very wrong idea.
"Manny, you don't want to do this right?"
"No, I really don't."
"Okay, papi, you know what?"
Let's switch.
I'm going to drive.
"I've got a bombshell, mom."
"Ay, papi, thank you, but this is a very weird thing to say when we're in this position."
"No, I've decided I'm never driving."
Uh... unh-unh-unh-unh!
No way.
You there.
You there.
What have you done?
"""The lovers moustache tickles"", doesn't it?"
I've shaved it!
I can see what you want.
"You misunderstand, sir!"
This is... a cross-connection!
What?
Let me put it plainly.
What you are dreaming of can never be true!
But what are you scared of?
Wouldn't you be scared if a man proposed to you?
It's wrong.
Cancel it!
I've had it with Hari once!
Who's Hari?
Hart's my husband.
"But he's Godbole, isn't he?"
True but I'm married!
Obviously.
But you never spoke of it.
I thought...
He went away on a pilgrimage ten years ago.
You never mentioned that.
You never asked either.
You just thrust a rose in my hand.
What could I do?
!
He's been away for 10 years.
He won't return!
What if he does?
In that case I'll get you a divorce.
Have you nothing else to do?
I'm not gonna answer it.
What?
What?
I don't have the money.
What do you want me to do?
"Ok, you tell your mom, she gives you the money, you're out of debt."
Then you enroll in a public school.
You make it-- you make it sound just so easy.
It's--it's not--
I will give you until tonight to tell your mom.
"Nick, please, man."
I will get the money.
Ok?
That's--that's not a problem.
"I'll get it from this guy who owes me anyway, and I can pay him back with that and she'll never know."
Ok?
[Cell phone rings]
Uh...
Please don't make me sorry that I told you this.
Your client will talk?
Not on your terms.
What do you want?
An s-visa.
No.
What do-- TRENT HAAGA:
All right.
"No, let's get smoking."
Let's have him go.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Can we come back tomorrow?
TRENT HAAGA:
Here we go.
"- Tennison, are you hurt?"
- No.
No.
It's...
It's not my blood.
It's...
It's David Bentley's.
He's dead.
Let's get you to the station and get you cleaned up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
"We'll get you in the car, all right?"
"Take her to the station, OK?"
When are you coming back?
I don't think I am.
What?
"Do you know what my mum said to me, when I was joining the force?"
No doubt the same as mine.
That you were mad.
She said I'd end up dead.
And you think this has proved her right?
"Kath, you can't give up."
You've got a shot at joining CID.
I'd give my right arm to be in your shoes.
"It's not giving up, accepting your limitations."
I need someone to look up to.
I'm not much of a role model.
You're not if you quit.
Funeral's tomorrow.
So surreal.
He was standing right in front of me.
My wife wants just what I wish for.
You must take Lajwanti's place in this family now.
We clash again!
As if we were separated in our last birth!
Jai's waiting for you.
There!
I've startled you!
I always say he's not in and you say you know!
"And you say ""You've told me"""
I've trapped you this time!
He's not in!
I know that.
How did you know?
You just told me so.
Damn it!
I'm trapped again!
Laxmi!
It's me...!
When did you arrive from outside?
I'm going out.
But when did you arrive?
I said I'm going out.
Okay?
Why have you locked that aunt in?
Chachi's gone out.
Impossible!
I just saw her coming up the stairs!
"This thing about in and out is a long story, Haribhai."
When aunt went upstairs...
"you saw her, I didn't."
And both of us didn't see when I went upstairs.
How could I see myself?
Ma'am?
"No, thanks."
You sure you don't need something?
"I need 100 bucks, or I'm going to get smacked."
You got that?
"Yes, I do."
You can have it.
You saved my life.
What are you doing with all that money?
We wanted to see a naked lady.
"Oh, God."
You know what?
"Why don't you take that money and go home, before you get hurt, okay?"
"I-I wish I could, but... it means a lot to my friends, and we just want a look."
How much looking?
As much as money can buy.
Okay.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
"Okay, pull your shirts up over your heads."
You first.
"Show me yours, and I'll show you mine."
Our what?
"Armpits, come on."
Come on.
"Okay, you're not hairy enough to be dangerous."
We're not hairy at all.
"So, what's your name, lady?"
V.
Like the letter?
What's it stand for?
What's your name?
Take care.
What?
"Come on, Allie, just step down."
- She's scared.
"- No, I'm not."
"You're not helping here, Zack."
- Zack wets his bed.
- I do not!
- His whole room smells yucky!
- Liar!
"Hey, hey!"
Since when do you go after her?
You're twice her age.
"- She's a liar, I hate her."
- He hit me.
You hit her?
- Don't ever hit her.
"- I didn't, I just swung my arm at her."
"What was the deal that we had, huh?"
I'm not through with you yet.
What was the deal we had?
"When I'm not around, you protect your little sister and your mother."
I can't stop any big guys.
"Don't worry about the big guys, I'll take care of them."
How?
You're never around.
"I don't care any more anyway, cos Mum said if you don't come back, she's gonna get me a new dad."
- Excuse me.
"- Can you ask someone else,"
- I'm on my way home.
"- I'm Beth Felton, I'm Beau's wife."
"Oh, well, I'm Megan, Lieutenant Megan Russert."
"If we ever have a daughter, we should do her hair like that."
"- Oh, like Jeannie's?"
- Yes.
"No, no."
You got to be born in a lamp.
"No, it's adorable!"
"I could do it one day, and then you could do it the next day."
- But no hat.
- I love the hat!
"Hel, that hat looks like it's for a monkey who should be clanging a symbol."
Austin.
Okay.
How does the other guy look?
"Oh, no."
You're not gonna be one of those exes that shows up when he's drunk?
Even though we're not exes.
Even though we only did it once.
They're gone.
What?
Who's gone?
My kids.
I lost custody of my kids.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Get in.
"Austin, I'm so sorry."
It's all right.
"The judge said, and I will quote him directly because he was such a complete and utter asshole..."
Sure.
"You know, get comfortable."
You're the one who makes me feel I've made a flop out of this.
"I'm telling you, the only one."
"Say, Jim, that's not bad."
That's good work.
- Have you always been able to draw?
"- Yeah, a little."
Come on.
Let me see you draw me.
Come on.
Let me see if you can get my puss on paper.
Go.
Come on.
A professional tried to draw me once.
He couldn't get me.
Couldn't touch me.
"Well, you shouldn't be hard to do."
"Well, come on."
Let me see you do it.
"How do you want me, full face or sideways?"
Look over there.
You're a cinch.
"You know, the more I see it, the better I like it."
The pan or the picture?
"Oh, why, the picture, of course."
Hm.
"I'm crazy about you, baby."
"You know that, don't you?"
"- Are you, Patsy?"
- Mm-hm.
Gets worse all the time.
It's got me worried.
- Why?
- Does your mom know?
"- No, but..."
- ...it's for a couple of nights.
- A couple of nights?
- Are you crazy?
- This is stunning.
Guys.
"Oh, wow."
Hold on.
Turn around.
It fits perfectly.
Let me just pull this over it.
"The length looks great, it's beautiful."
I want it to be perfect.
He likes lace.
I'm not misinterpreting.
Your dad came in like he wanted to chop me off at the knees.
And I'm telling you that's not my dad.
I recognize him from the picture of everybody on the glacier.
- I'm serious.
- So am I. I act like I'm not in love with his daughter.
He's acting like he wants to challenge me to a duel over your mother.
- I don't understand.
- I do.
- He hates me.
- He doesn't hate you.
He hates me or he's crazy.
"No, he does not hate you."
He couldn't.
Then he's crazy.
Pam.
"Oh, hey, Ella."
Where are you going?
is she your aunt?
Yes.
Why don't we go to your mother's?
She says that our house is too small and that you deserve better.
I think your mother's wrong.
Small things have their value too.
You're small but skilful.
I'm going to grow.
The house won't grow though.
You'll grow up and go to school.
- How far does your school go?
- Until 11.
You want to keep on studying after?
I'll go to Momenieh until I'm 15.
"For the final years, I'll go to Kermanshah."
Where is it?
"Over there, look."
It's over there.
Look.
The blue window.
- The blue window?
- And that's her son.
"I see, he's her son."
Yes.
Where's the cemetery?
Up on the hill.
I have to go.
I'll take the others to Hammad's.
Are you worried about them or your book?
My book. I have an exam tomorrow.
You'll come back?
"If you believe this, whatever it is, and I don't bring it forward in this day and age..."
I'm not willing take that risk.
You've shitting me right?
I've known you too long.
Thank you.
There's a flight at 7.30 am.
"- You got a hotel here, right?"
- Yeah.
I'll pick you up first thing.
"We're gonna figure this out, Ray, you and me."
We're gonna gat all this squared away.
This ***.
Where I am?
"You are where you need to be, honey."
"You don't have to this, Chase."
This is the only way to ensure the project success.
What project?
What are you talking about?
What is he doing?
Chase?
It's ok.
Don't worry about what he's doing.
What is that?
What is he doing?
Marcus?
Marcus?
It's just an experiment.
But one I'm sure will work.
Ready.
"You're sure about this, Chase?"
I've nothing but faith in you.
Chase?
Go!
Go!
Right behind you.
- Come on!
- Ah!
This way!
Hurry!
- Won't they search the Abbey?
- Probably.
Behind there.
Quiet.
Hurry.
- Bread.
- Thank you.
- Be safe.
- You too.
We'll move you when the search dies down.
You must go before the Abbess sees you.
Come.
This way.
- Never do that again.
- What?
You broke rank.
You took action with no plan in place.
You've never broken a rule to save someone?
- Your job is to follow my orders.
- Our job is to recruit fighters.
We got what we came for.
We got lucky.
"If you want to stay on this team, you can't be so impulsive."
- We almost lost you once.
- Is that what this is?
"Run,run,run!"
"Go,baby!"
"Go, go, go!"
"Go to second, go to second!"
"Go, baby, go!"
"Go to third, go to third, ziggy!"
"Go, babe!"
"Run, run, run!"
Home run!
Home run!
Home run!
Slap me some skin!
"Oh, my god, you did it!"
Ah!
You cannot ruin this one.
"It's hand wash only, so make sure and tell bonnie,"
Or i guess you can tell your dad.
Maybe your dad does the laundry now.
Maybe he does.
I was thinking
"Now that you are gone a little bit,"
Maybe we could have some girlfriend time.
That'd be cool.
Are you ever coming back?
"Yeah, of course."
I'm gonna come back all the time.
I made a playlist for you.
Are you trying to take my room?
Can i?
"No, you can't."
"Maybe when i go to college, though."
We should go get pizza.
"I promise you, when I get my licence you can quit and go back."
I already quit.
"Yeah, OK, but you can dance"
- and go to school can't you?
- Not really.
"Alright, but it's kind of expensive for both of us to go to school, so, you know..."
It's not gonna happen.
"Drugs, med school."
Duh.
"OK, but I can, I..."
I got this.
I can control the drugs.
Duh!
"No, it's cool."
"Listen, you'll dance, you'll put us through school,"
- and then I'll...
- Decide you're too good for me?
"It's not gonna be forever, babe."
Stop talking to me and hope I get the idea?
How 'bout I be the doctor and you be the stripper.
- Where are you going?
- I have to pee.
Calm down.
"- Cool, yeah."
Right.
- OK.
"When you come back, we'll get a little more coke."
We'll get out of here.
- We'll figure all this out.
Promise.
- Yeah...
Yeah.
I really don't like what I'm hearing.
You guys will drive me crazy.
"Between my mom, the cops and no job."
We haven't even paid the rent.
Why?
It's been paid.
How?
Here.
Did you pay it?
Don't I live here?
How many times have I told you?
Enough!
I support this house.
I am not a sponger.
"I sleep here, eat here."
I am here... got that?
I'll go with you.
The way I look they'll never believe I am gay.
Make me a Zenne.
Some cream?
"Oh, you speak German?"
My ex-husband was from Bavaria.
I lived in Munich for many years.
How did you like Bavaria?
I don't know.
I didn't really feel at home.
"The people... but now, I miss it very much."
Bavaria is beautiful.
I hope Ahmet will enjoy it there with me.
What are you doing?
Take this!
Stand in line.
It was a bit rushed.
I could do better.
Ok.
That's good.
"Sarah, that's really good."
"And Debbie's actually one of my favorite models necause she's so flexible, and she moves in really interesting ways, you know?"
"So, what do you do with that now?"
Oh...nothing.
It's just an exercise.
You mind if I keep that?
Thanks.
Yeah.
"You know, you really should've gone to art school."
"What is this, a mid-life crisis or something?"
Do you have cancer?
"No, no."
"No, no."
"Well, then what?"
Art school?
That's what I should do?
I thought it was Commerce or...
"Pre-med or I'm ""on my own."""
I said that?
Ah.
"Well, I wish I hadn't."
"I mean, I know that doesn't really help."
It helps a little.
Well...
"I had a really nice time today, Sarah."
"Yeah, me, too."
Good.
Take care of yourself.
I might as well get a dog or something.
When it comes to sex.
the man has to be in charge.
In every way.
"He has to take me when he wants, where he wants."
I'm just Woman.
just a sex object for this man.
And I need that.
And I like it.
You're right.
I swear...
Seriously.
How are you getting home?
- Leave your horn here.
- I'll take it.
- Leave it here.
- I'll drop it off tomorrow.
- By bus.
I promise.
- With the graveyard shift.
I'm the Fuhrer of this party.
- I'll take it with me.
"- No, leave it here."
Leave it.
You'll bust it.
- We need it.
- You guys have no sense of reality.
Of what's real.
How will you get home?
I have to open the door first.
How will you get home?
With who?
"No, but I'll leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you."
"Monica, come on."
You want to have kids.
I do.
But the stork is gonna bring mine.
"Seriously, you're not gonna make me watch this alone."
She's right.
Of course not.
"Honey, get the tape."
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.
"Oh, sure."
But if you leave a drumstick under there and you're a bad roommate.
Here we go.
Okay.
"Oh, my."
"Come on, come on."
Why is that baby torturing that woman?
Why have I seen this thing three times?
It's beautiful.
-It's horrible!
"-I know, I know!"
I'm so sorry for you!
What do I do?
I don't want to do this!
How do I get out of it?
-You guys!
"You guys, look!"
-What?
Did her ass explode?
"No, the baby's out."
Look.
Look at those little fingers and toes.
Not anyone else.
"You seem like a great kid, Sam."
Just live the life you wanna live.
We came back here so you could talk to a teacher?
He's a good guy.
"Well, whatever."
Go have your Robin Williams'
"""O captain, my captain"" moment."
Just make it quick.
"Excuse me, sir."
Can you tell me how to find room 305?
Sure.
"Um... head down the hall, take your first right, and it's the..."
third door on the left.
"Thanks, Sam."
"You got tall, Winchester."
Trust me.
This will help.
That ghost is dead.
I'm gonna rip its lungs out!
"Well, you know what I mean."
"It knew my name, Dean."
My real name.
We burned Barry's bones.
What the hell?
"Well, maybe it wasn't Barry."
Maybe we missed something.
We just got to go back.
No way.
How did we not see this before?
- What?
- Check it out.
Trying to get into shape.
Some other shape other than hot dog or igloo.
I can't think of nothing new.
"You know, there's more than just those two shapes?"
There is?
Let's try this one.
An octagon.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Like that Chuck Norris movie?
That ain't Chuck Norris.
And it's not an octagan either.
"Hey, do Octopussy."
Like this here?
That's what I'm talking about.
There you go.
You know what?
I gotta go take a dump.
I don't know.
All these shapes just freakin' hurtin' my kidneys.
Why can't people just like me for me?
"But sadly, no one does."
Not even the president.
"He's a great guy, though."
"If I don't come up with some new shapes,"
I'm gonna lose my damn job.
He says he don't need me.
I be the first to go.
I have an idea.
That will cost you $20 dollars.
What do you want?
Shake:
Get your car washed.
"Oh, my gosh, you guys."
The yoga instructor just smiled at me.
He has the cutest... dimples.
Shh.
Ok... he's telling us to shut up.
His smile is just his state of zen.
"Oh, God."
Namaste.
Namaste.
Do you guys really do this all the time?
Yeah.
I have to.
I'm older than you.
I get fatter quicker.
Sorry I'm late.
I just got your message.
You're late.
Hey.
Hi.
What's going on?
You guys look so serious.
I was just telling Dale about my wedding
"Um, Drew still hasn't picked a tux yet."
Or groomsmen for that matter.
"Well, you know we're guys."
We take a little bit longer with that stuff.
Yeah.
"Well, I gotta go."
I have a hair appointment at 2:00 and then a couple jewelry design appointments.
"Oh, that's so fetch."
"Congrats, girl."
"Thanks, girl."
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
You know...
What's going on?
"That should do it, right?"
"You love it, don't you?"
What?
The thrill of a new case.
I'll see you around.
Don't fall for your target.
What are you watching?
Ooh.
Porn?
"No, it's just something for this case."
Mm.
I'll get it out of you.
Right.
Oh!
You're late.
"Yeah, I had to meet someone first."
Mm-hmm.
"Someone tall, ruggedly handsome, carries a gun?"
Keep your enemies close.
"Yeah, I'll bet you kept him close."
Duly and diligently.
Hey.
I'm glad you guys could make it.
Wouldn't miss it.
Morgan was one of our favorite clients.
Yeah.
"You know, the day we met at his place was the day he died."
"Yeah, we heard that."
"Sorry he had to go through it alone, you know?"
"Oh, he wasn't alone."
"Well, no man is an island."
We are all... connected.
Right.
You've gotta be the youngest attorney in the firm to sit on a case this big.
I don't know.
"Listen, here, hey."
"I was gonna give this to you at dinner, but it feels appropriate here."
Danny.
"Oh, my God."
I saw it and I thought of you.
It's beautiful.
"Here, here, here."
- Can we afford this?
I had some stocks pay out dividends.
You know.
Can't a guy do something nice for this girl?
"Yes, he can."
I love you.
"Wait, you didn't get this off that dead girl, did you?"
Wow.
Wow.
- Just checking.
I'm just... pushed too far to his throat.
Did you know...
- I don't know.
Tell me how.
Say it.
"Yeah, I would've."
- How?
"I don't know, okay?"
"No, it was an accident."
I didn't want him dead.
"You must've choked it back into his windpipe, right?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it was an accident."
Here.
Take this.
You look half frozen.
Thank you.
It was my fault Raven got out yesterday.
I was supposed to fix the gate.
It's...
It's fine.
It's no big deal.
You could have been hurt.
And...
I'm...
I'm sorry.
"Pin, if it wasn't for you, I would have never met Raven."
"You'd have met him, one way or another."
Some things are just meant to be.
Don't say anything...
but I know how Raven got out.
"- It was horse thieves, wasn't it?"
- No.
Pin forgot to mend the gate.
Oh.
Kind of boring.
We don't know who's stealing sedatives.
It's horse thieves.
Or who Ghost Pony is.
- Or why Bob's obsessed with the muck heap.
- And she's off.
I guess I'd better head home.
My mom will be worrying.
- But you'll be back tomorrow.
- Will she?
He'll get his wheels back.
Don't worry.
Right where he left them.
He'll never press charges.
"""Beauty Salon"""
Well...
What do you know?
Don't you feel stupid?
Dangerous characters.
"Not bad, huh?"
You can't get any?
Like a little feel?
Hands up.
And fast!
"Tough luck, boys."
I'm trying out my new gun.
Is my third car stolen this year.
I'm a little fed up.
Get it?
We didn't steal it.
We just borrowed it.
"We returned it, didn't we?"
Here it is.
It never even moved.
Tell that to the cops.
Go call them.
"No, wait!"
Why bother the cops?
We didn't hurt anyone.
We just went for a ride.
Just killing time like we were hitch-hiking and you picked us up.
You weren't around.
Let's go.
"Marshal, please."
What kind of place is this?
This is a high class brothel.
A brothel?
What do you take me for?
The moral standard is down the drain...
What a lovely bottom!
What a surprise!
Take good care of him.
Marshal...
Let's go somewhere else.
Let's stay and check the place out.
There may be underage girls here.
Yes.
Let's have a toss.
Drink up.
Don't be shy.
What's wrong?
You're flushed.
What?
I just had a little drink.
But you just drank the soy sauce.
I want to investigate this girl.
Wait.
What's the matter?
Can I investigate your wife?
Do you know who I am?
- And do you know who I am?
- Who are you?
- Liang Foon of the Pochilam School.
- I've never heard your name.
I'm here for a few days.
- My cell number's on there.
- Of course.
"Were you and your aunt, uh, close?"
For most of my life she was a birthday card with a $5 bill in it.
But she never missed a birthday.
I understand.
How about you?
How well did you know my aunt?
My great-aunt.
Oh.
She came in once a year.
- Like Santa Claus.
- Heh.
She was very sweet.
"When I called, they told me that you had spoken to her just before she died."
I'd like to know what you thought of her.
- I don't know what I could tell you.
- We could talk about it over drinks.
Uh...
I don't know.
Heh.
Consider it.
You've got the number.
I will get these to the Revenue office.
Thank you.
I didn't know my dad was coming.
He wanted to know how somebody could beat me.
If I slacked off.
I didn't.
You know I didn't.
I told him we tied but you got the slot.
"Yeah, sure."
"You cry, and it's all my fault."
I'm not crying.
You don't even want me to live here.
Do you really think it's a good idea?
Sure.
Why?
"- Why, why?"
"- Yes, why?"
- Why not?
- Why should you?
It'd be good.
We'd be together.
- But we're always arguing.
- That's not true.
Do you really like being with me?
"No, a big shiver!"
"Besides, it's starting to melt."
"- So, it's that urgent?"
- I already told you that.
What if Lella is delayed?
It would be a disaster.
Then let me handle this before it's too late.
Mother of God!
Actually...
I'm going to devour you!
- Just a moment...
let me get undressed.
- Hold still...
How long have you gone without?
Since I was born!
Where should I start?
That must have been cute as hell.
"But yeah, she lost the lisp."
"She grew into a beautiful, smart woman."
"Look, I know what Audrey did to you."
"And as far as I can see, right now, this is your chance to get back at her."
Ahem.
Didn't you say you were gonna buy me a drink?
- Is she in?
- Of course she's in.
You got to pay her tab.
Pay the tab.
Son of a bitch.
"All right, so when we get the money and I put it in the safe, I'll let you call Audrey,"
- and you can be the hero.
"- Yeah, absolutely not."
"You're not coming with me, and I'm not giving you the money."
Raven.
"Raven, it's okay."
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
It's okay.
"You sure you're okay, Mia?"
Of course.
A little fall never hurt anyone.
"Uh, what's her name?"
The girl with the wild horse.
Her name is Zoe.
And she's our friend.
"Let's go, let's go."
Cool.
That I'm on the list.
"Well, I can't say I'm surprised."
You made my top ten.
Just squeaked in there.
"Well, I don't even know if I'm going to do it."
Why wouldn't you?
I have my reasons.
"So don't do it, then."
"So, you don't think I should do it?"
"Alex, are you asking my permission?"
No.
Why would I need to do that?
It's not like we're...
It was one date.
One motorcycle ride.
'Cause I'm really not the possessive type.
Good.
'Cause I'm not really... a possession.
Can I see you tonight?
"Yeah, I'd like that."
"Oh, no, not tonight."
I've got to prepare for a deposition.
Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow's tough.
- Working at the tavern?
"No, I, uh..."
I've kind of got a date.
Really?
Not a date date.
It's a blind date.
It was set up a week ago.
Yeah?
"Yeah, I got a good look."
"Yeah, yeah."
I got it.
"Sure, I'll take care of him."
"Out of the way, blubberhead."
The famine is on.
"Guys, want some cigarettes?"
All you guys can have cigarettes off me.
"You better pack them now, boys."
Here comes the beef trust.
How do you do?
- A nickel you don't conk him.
"- All right, a nickel I do."
"- You missed him, chump."
- Yeah.
A nickel apiece you owe.
That cop don't walk right or something.
"- Those cops are so dumb, it's pathetic."
- You'd think they'd learn where a tomato comes from in police college.
Look.
"Hello, toots."
You want the bottle?
You want the bottle?
"Oh, nuts."
Hey!
What are you doing with my baby?
"""Hey!"
"What are you doing with my baby?"" Here's your baby!"
- You loafer!
I'll get the cops after you!
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
I'm ashamed now.
"But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie."
You're all I got.
"And I really, really need your help. I really do."
Take this.
And now I've got to turn my back on you.
Thirty-two hundred bucks.
That's what he gave me.
"$3,200 for a lifetime."
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.
-We got to get out.
-I don't want to run.
Am I supposed to pick up and leave everything?
Go hiding?
"I don't want to do that, Henry."
Is that what you want?
"Karen, lf we stay around here we're dead."
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
-You know what kind of questions they been asking him?
-l don't know.
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money.
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.
"She wants to work for me, because she needs money."
What for?
She has all she needs here!
"Just sit down, Franz."
You want something to drink?
Coffee?
Quick!
Come in and shut the door!
"No sleep last night, Franz?"
You need money?
I don't need money!
- Put the gun down!
What's going to happen now?
"You'll slaughter your family, or what?"
I don't want to show up in the newspaper like that!
"I said, I don't need money!"
Franz doesn't need money.
Does it work with the suit?
"Yes, the suit looks good."
I look old.
No.
I would say mature.
I'd like to ask you something.
The tie looks good on you.
If you think so.
There is still a problem.
It'll be fine.
Are you coming with me?
I don't think I'd make it through an evening like this.
You don't have to.
I know.
Just tonight.
It's too hot in this gown.
We always feel the heat when we're going on a date.
What if we got found out?
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.
I'm here for you.
"When it comes to girls, you've got to be brave."
"If you have little courage, you must have a thick skin."
- I've got an idea to show off your heroism.
- How?
The painted face you're afraid of will come for you tonight.
- You slapped me!
"- No, I was swatting mosquitoes."
"Don't be scared, don't be scared."
Watch me teach him a lesson!
Block.
- Kick me now.
- How?
- From the bottom.
- OK.
You got the wrong place.
- Not like that.
Harder.
- Harder?
That's too hard!
Get lost!
This young man has great potential.
This is the proudest moment of my life.
Sifu Wong.
I feel safe around you.
Really?
I'm sorry.
"Wait, look here."
See where the skin's broken?
Bastard even bit me.
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
"Most of all, friends."
You don't sum up a man's life in one moment.
"There are no cold answers, are there?"
There's no simple yes or no.
A man's life is not the bricks.
It's the mortar.
It's the stuff that lays between.
The stuff--
The stuff you can't see.
I've known Walter my whole life.
God!
He's a decent man.
-He's a good man.
-But this is tough stuff.
This is body-bag stuff.
Tell me if there's some other way.
There isn't.
Die's been cast.
It was cast a long time ago.
Go easy.
Give him a blindfold and have mercy.
"Walter Stern was a tough man, but he was fair."
We give back the same.
No?
And you be careful.
Keep George with you.
Let him drive.
I gotta go in here.
I knew James Wakeley would surface...
... justasIknew when that bullet hit that boy...
... itwouldkeeptraveling.
And find its way... ?
I'm in a fox's den!
So what!
"Whether I'm killed by a fox, or get rich off of their pictures, you'll never kill me, so don't call me again!"
Honey.
"I'm hanging up, you bastard."
I'm risking my life for this.
Live or die.
Turn into a fox!
"Honey, please change!"
- What?
- Turn into a fox!
- You don't change when you do this?
- No.
You're still the best!
Welcome!
Tickets are sold here!
"Hey, they didn't buy any tickets."
"Dad, what's with all these people?"
It's a sign that everything will be alright.
The cop.
Welcome.
May I help you?
I came to see a circus performance.
You came to the right place.
Do you know her?
Who is she?
"No, I don't know her."
- Is that so?
- Yes.
Who is she anyway?
A dead woman.
She was found axed near Nam Mountain here.

I lost my motherfucking money.
you and Todd get ready to leave.
I'm going to get our money.
but--
Our money?
Your choice.
Take it.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
000 looks like?
This is fucking awesome.
boys.
Our next fight's a 10-grand buy-in.
Todd?
When do I get some?
I discovered him.
This fucking guy.
How would you like to discover this?
I'm serious.
yeah?
These fights today-- these private fights man.
You want to fight in real fights-- proper fights with proper prize money and betting money.
That's how you make money in fighting.
- So when do we get some?
- I've already put the word out.
Calm down.
SIX MONTHS LATER
Help!
Help!
Please help!
Just go away.
They're gone now.
Don't be afraid.
I'll take you home.
Jenny!
How do you know my name?
I've listened to you sing so often...
Who are you?
I feel as if I know you.
I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.
What are you doing now?
"No, that's fine."
"Joongrae, I like you."
You live foolishly.
You know me?
"Just, a little."
"You're reckless, but not loathsome."
You know nothing about me.
I knew I'd meet you some day.
Seriously?
Do you love me?
I like you very much.
- Do you want me that much?
"- Yes, more than any other woman."
"Then, have me."
I don't mind.
But I still love you.
"Joongrae, you are mine today."
"Thank you, Moonsook."
I love you.
"I love you, too."
Have a seat.
You must've gotten up early.
Aren't you tired?
"No, are you?"
"No, but I think I'm coming down with something."
It's because we worked ourselves too hard last night.
"Oh, come on."
"You were married once, right?"
"Yeah, I got divorced."
A long time ago.
Should I leave you alone?
Seems like you were deep in thought.
Fine.
I'll do it.
Okay.
What are doing?
Are you mental?
Put it down.
Put it down.
Let go.
Put it down.
I am taking care of it.
I got it.
Put it down.
I got it.
"Billy, what the hell are you doing?"
"Stan, I can't work with this guy."
"What, you can't work with me?"
"Who do you think you are, lady?"
I've been here for eight years.
And you're just another untalented pretty face.
"Billy, calm down."
"Untalented, huh?"
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up.
"That has nothing to do with you, you moron."
Billy!
I've warned you before about your attitude.
That's it.
You're out of here.
You're fired.
Somebody call security!
What?
We'd been here all night.
"June's mixed up, he's getting old, he don't see very well."
Lying son of a bitch!
I'll make him talk.
He's not gonna talk.
It's his sister.
Can I speak to the boy?
"How are you this morning, Byron?"
Just fine.
Pretty sleepy?
"Yeah, I guess so."
Did you go stay someplace with your uncle Ronnie last night?
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
"You didn't see a lady, a pretty lady?"
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
Did your uncle Ronnie tell you to say that?
Yeah.
So this has just been pretend?
Yeah.
What do you say we stop playing pretend and play really?
Okay.
"And I think you really ought to spend a night or two in jail, so you don't tell your sister."
Dale...
You got to let me go.
"I can't do that, Lila."
You can't let them put me in jail.
"What's going to happen to our baby, with me in jail?"
Your mom will keep taking care of him.
Gin is good.
Gin is good.
So... what's wrong with ya?
"I mean, other than the whole ""psycho chopped the baby out of your belly and ran"" thing."
Other than that?
Is... is there something other than that?
You tell me.
I'm just a chick with a drink.
No judgments.
Oh.
I get it.
You don't want to open up to me.
I know.
I'm not the touchy-feely type.
I got fired for being heartless.
Cooper apparently agrees.
Maybe he's right.
It's the baby.
He have 11 toes or something?
He's perfect.
He's absolutely perfect.
"He's the baby in the commercial, he's so perfect."
And I...
"I look at him, and I feel... nothing."
I can't... feel anything... ever since the...
"I mean, there's this pressure to be all ""mommy,"""
and I'm just...
I'm not.
I'm not ready or something.
I just...
I don't...
I don't want to deal with him.
- Yeah.
I loved that old house.
"- Yeah, I loved that place, too."
- I had my first kiss there.
"- Me, too."
"So what's going on, Jimmy?"
"I've just had a really bad year with the market and, it's disastrous, and it's going to be a struggle just to remain solvent for the next..."
How much do you need?
No.
It's... it's a lot of money.
It's too much.
Jimmy.
It's a hundred thousand dollars.
I'll call the bank.
No.
I can't.
I can.
I'll pay you back.
But it's going to take me a couple of months.
I know where you live.
This place is going to be perfect.
I hope so.
New contractors come tomorrow.
Better get the job finished.
New contractors.
Mm-hmm.
Sounds like a nightmare.
Pretty much.
You okay?
So the contractors start tomorrow.
Guess that means I'm gone.
One bus ticket to Austin. 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Mom.
Hey.
I'm so sorry.
Everything's fine.
`
The baby's okay.
She's okay.
She ?
It's a girl.
Sweet.
Cool.
"Well, looks like the old girl held up pretty good."
I can't wait to have a hot shower with the hot water we don't have.
I'll settle for sleeping in my own bed.
Or sleeping anywhere.
"Come on, I'll fire up the grill, we'll get the camp stove going..."
it'll be fun.
Caleb is going to be indicted.
I don't know when.
"- Oh, my God, the yard guy?"
"- Yeah, I know."
"What was I supposed to do, wait for you?"
You weren't coming back.
I wanted you to tell me the truth.
- Who's your favorite writer?
- Bendis.
"Well, hot damn, welcome to the club."
- I love that guy.
- You're not the only one.
"- You had me three months ago, and you left."
- I want to make that up to you.
I escaped because I played dead.
Played dead?
Yeah.
That wasn't my fault.
Get me?
Yeah.
Where'd you come from?
I've known this guy for six months.
What is that?
It's a good plan.
"I'm his crew, we go way back."
What about you?
I'm his sister.
"Okay, everyone stop."
"This is my lead, my research, my job."
You're out.
"No, wait."
Connor listen.
"Look, I'm begging you, okay."
I'm begging you to let me go.
"Look, the only reason Blair is here, the reason why we're in this mess, it's because of me."
"I didn't put her first, and now we've lost everything."
And I can't risk losing her too.
"I don't care about the plans, I don't care about the score."
I'm begging you.
Please let me come.
If I let you come...
I have ground rules.
"First, the cut remains the same."
You're not gettin' any extra money for coming along.
Totally fair.
Yeah.
"They don't got gold, neither."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
We had one of them nothing school trips.
To the museum.
"Yeah, they got a pile of gold."
And a stagecoach.
They had to kick me out.
We've got to go there.
"Come on, it's over here."
"Now, Tony."
We're going to create a little diversion.
The stagecoach.
I want you to roll it all around the museum.
Look out.
Watch it.
"Watch out for that thing, it's coming this way."
"Hey, where are the horses?"
I... don't know.
Now cause total chaos.
Watch out.
Short circuit the control system.
"Oh, no."
Letha!
Letha!
Look out.
Get out of my way.
Can't you put that thing out?
"Come on, take a shot."
Move it.
"Now, Tony,"
Make a hole in the plastic shield.
And it doesn't have to be neat.
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my fucking head!
"Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, okay?"
I just need to connect.
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!
"Oh, my God."
Where am I?
Who are you?
I can't stop it.
I don't know who I am.
So I...
So I need to go home.
The interface has data tendrils like roots.
They've dug in deeper than they're meant to.
"Threaded through your brain, taken over whole areas, I can't stop it."
"I can't remove it, and I can't stop it."
But I...
But I don't know who I am.
I don't know...
I don't know who I am.
I don't know who I am.
I don't know.
"On behalf of Saito Game Team, I most humbly apologize."
Who are you?
What have you done to me?
- What have you done to me?
"- Put him with the others, please."
"No, no, no, no!"
"No, no, no!"
"Captain howdy, do you think my mom's pretty?"
Captain howdy?
"Captain howdy, that isn't very nice."
"Well, maybe he's sleeping."
You think?
What--Regan...
Why are you reading that stuff?
Because I like it.
It's not even a good picture of you.
You look so mature.
I wouldn't talk.
You wouldn't talk?
"Well, I didn't have my makeup man there."
Let me take an eyelash off your face.
"No, I didn't get it."
What are we going to do on your birthday?
Isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?
What can we do?
I don't know.
What would you like to do?
Got any ideas?
Mm-mmm.
No?
Let me think.
Let me think.
What can we do?
We never finished seeing all the sights in Washington.
"We didn't get to the Lee mansion, lots of stuff."
Shall we go sightseeing...
If it's a nice day?
"Yeah, let's do that."
"And tomorrow night,"
"-Good, if you want..."
"I am going to prove it to me, but you do not take advantage which my parents have gone away to Florence."
And that does not return until this the night.
And you do not watch to me by the eye of the lock.
Absolutely.
In agreement.
"It sees calm, I am ""gentleman""."
-Certainly you do not watch to me?
-I have said that no. to You.
-I will do in a while.
I go.
-Please.
You do not watch?
eh?
"No, absolutely."
"I want that the things between us they are pretty, very clean, until the marriage."
"Soon all good will go, will be all normal one."
You do not watch?
eh?
holy shit...
Alvaro?
what you do in the ground?
Eh?
I do... yoga.
You like?
Good... it is not bad...
"It is pretty, truth?"
yes.
You like it or not?
Good... enough...
They see here.
"No, Alvaro, you do not do it."
- You believe me?
- Yeah.
- Poor bastard.
"- Jerry's a good guy, so don't..."
"No, I'm not."
"It's just that,"
"I mean, man, it's gotta hurt."
"One time I kissed this girl who I was,"
- I had such a crush on...
- I don't need to hear this.
- I had to watch you kissing Jerry.
- Yeah but that's not...
"Anyway, I did the Hail Mary thing, and it was great, I thought, and after the kiss, I was like, here we go, this is gonna happen."
- OK.
"- Yeah, OK, that's what I thought. ""OK."""
"Except she said, oh, kissing me was like kissing wait for it... her brother."
- Oh that's so gross.
- Right?
That's not what it's like kissing Jerry.
What?
He's a good kisser.
I'm just being honest.
But not as good as kissing me.
I forget.
Mm...
Still not sure...
You win.
I'm going to Dallas because I love you.
Do you love me?
"I can't believe I have to ask, but..."
"Yeah, I do."
I love you.
That was your first lie.
It's inevitable.
"You're gonna get old, Stefan won't."
Forever doesn't last very long when you're human.
"I'm sorry, but I don't have what you're looking for."
Sit down.
And tell your boyfriend to walk away.
- I want the invention.
- I don't have it.
I know that.
But Damon does.
- And you're gonna get it for me.
- He's not gonna give it to me.
Then the blood will be on your hands.
"It was nice meeting you, Elena."
"Hey, Anna."
"Uh, where are you?"
What's up?
Uh...
Give me a call when you get this.
How is Anna?
I like that girl.
She has fire.
"Uh, I don't know."
- She won't return my calls.
- Girl trouble?
"No, no trouble."
"Anna just owes me a call, that's it."
Is that the girl that I saw you with at the Founder's Pageant?
"So you two are getting pretty hot and heavy, huh?"
When was the last time you saw her?
- Why?
Who's gonna pay for the window?
Go check out what's going on.
- Why don't you go?
- And you call yourself a man!
"Bello, come here!"
Come here!
"Bello, come here!"
What is going on here?
You're crazy!
Are you allright?
They picked the wrong person for a fight.
"Let's go Franz, here is your hat."
Are you alright?
"What's going on here, constable?"
"Oh, you don't know either?"
Acting like a deaf-mute.
- What do you want?
Franz again?
- Franz will be back.
- Flowers?
"- Yes, please."
I can't possibly accept this.
How do you think how is this gonna work out?
- You'll see.
- Are you hooking up with him?
- You'll see.
Even if you break his bones he'll stay the same.
You're quite smart.
"Reinhold, there are so many men."
I'll get you ten other guys!
I need him!
He must cooperate!
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.
What happened to him?
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?
"You, too."
How are you?
Why are you up so late?
"Well, he came in."
Youse came in.
I'm so happy to see him.
Go inside.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.
-Go to sleep.
We're leaving.
-l can't.
Not while he's home.
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.
You go inside.
"This stuff is great, but it's like lead."
"Tell me, where you been?"
I haven't seen you.
You haven't called.
Where have you been?
"Mom, I been working nights."
And tonight we were out late.
We took a ride out to the country and we hit one of them deer.
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.
"It reminds me, I need this knife."
they're on a boat
Near the south side pier...
"the heartbreak, dock 12."
Who is this?
Just a pal.
Tell me you na...
how did you get this number?
Have a lovely night.
Right.
Very good.
Who was that?
Anonymous tip.
Let's go.
"Let's go, let's go, let's go."
That didn't take long.
Oh.
Thought you were someone else.
Brannis told me one of you would be coming.
One of me?
Would it make a difference if I told you I won't make it easy?
Yeah.
"He told me that, too."
What did you do?
What did you do to my arm?
Aah!
"Well, that works."
Not if you want a massage.
Jarvis:
I imagine that'll be your colleagues.
We must go.
We can't leave him here.
He's a witness.
Number...
"I mean, how hard is that?"
"I mean, a talking monkey could do her job."
It's embarrassing.
"Actually, that's 16."
"See, you're holding it upside-down."
"Oh, it's..."
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
It's no big deal.
"Look, I've seen it my whole life."
I've never seen it under the six.
"Why don't we ask Natalie, then?"
"Well, she's the expert."
Okay.
Okay.
But I see your point.
About the monkey.
All I'm trying to say is it's not the same Natalie.
"If you knew her, you wouldn't know her."
"Last night, after the show, she got somebody fired."
Really?
One of the crew.
Sound guy.
There were some wires on the floor.
She was...
"You know, complaining."
"And, I mean, I met the guy when I was there."
He was a nice kid.
"If you're all too scared to put on big boy pants and go in,"
I'll just claim my winnings and be on my way.
Wait a minute!
We can last in there just as long as you can.
Fine.
Come on then.
"Hold up, Shrek."
"You can't just go barging in some creepy, spooky joint like you own the place."
And why not?
It's not like there's anyone here to stop us.
"I still don't know about this, man."
You know...
Whole creepy house-of-wax vibe goin' on in here.
"Look, it's that little thingy you love so much, remember?"

Get out.
- Ooh!
Let's do that again.
- No!
"All right, now."
"Here, we're gonna start weight training."
First things first...
Squats.
Okay.
That's it.
"Uh, that looks really heavy."
Look.
This is not gonna be a half-assed workout.
We gotta really get into it.
It's gonna hurt.
"- Yeah, but I can't lift that."
- Just position yourself under the bar and listen to me.
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna take all the weight on your neck.
Then you're gonna jam your legs down and hyperextend your ankles... and then shoot back up and lock your knees in place.
Not one of those things sounds right to me at all.
Look.
You wanna fight like a man?
You gotta train like a man.
"Now, come on."
Gimme a squat.
- Ready.
Go!
"- Oh, my God!"
- Go.
Keep it up.
"- Daddy, I can't."
- It's...
I can't.
- Keep it up.
Keep it up.
No!
Not again.
Get...
Go back!
Frank.
Frank.
"Oh, my God, I just had the worst dream."
You were having another kid.
"Maureen's the last one, right?"
Tell me she's the last one!
She's the last one.
"Oh, thank God."
It was horrible.
This baby had teeth!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to figure out which bill we can pay.
"Well, we got about eight inches of free water falling right now."
"So, heat it is."
"Frank, we'll get through this."
We always do.
I'm here for you.
The kids love you.
Mohican will realize their mistake and take you back.
"And if they don't, you'll get a better job somewhere else."
"Yeah, sure."
I'm gonna go downstairs.
"Oh, Sue, don't do that."
I haven't showered in days.
"I meant the kitchen, Frank."
Get some sleep.
Tomorrow will be a better day.
Only if I get hit by a bus.
"Yo, how long you two been married?"
Come on.
Play ball.
"Okay, all right, time-out."
Time-out.
My time.
"You, uh, never played basketball, have you?"
"No, I've played once or twice."
Yeah?
"Yeah, I mean, I can see that."
"It looked like I was watching Lebron, and maybe he's just this much better."
You know what?
"Football was my sport, okay?"
Yeah?
Now you tell me that?
"Hey, you ready to quit?"
- No.
- Yes.
- Which one is it?
"Can you just give me a second, please?"
Can I have some space?
"All right, listen to me."
"You're not gonna outshoot him, so out-D him, all right?"
Play it like it's football.
"Put a body on him, steal the ball away from him and put it in the hoop, huh?"
"What's he gonna do, call a foul?"
We're in jail.
"All right, I can do that."
That's game.
"Let's have it, man."
"All right, badge, here it is."
A couple weeks ago we're in rec watching some tube.
You know that.
Do not want to get involved with them.
He lived for the club!
-And Died for him too!
-My Condolences.
Thank you.
My condolences.
He was a good man.
-I Can send flowers?
-Of Course.
Thank you.
My condolences again.
Let the memorial later if you want.
They will make a memorial at the club and want me to be there.
-You Can stay with Jimmy?
"No, you will not."
"You can be a cop, but you can not order me around."
We can have it.
Let's leave it.
Health then.
-It Was a beautiful funeral.
-Yup.
He was a very good people face.
"He was like a brother to me, you know?"
'You just said that.
"Yes, but he was there."
I do not sit and stare at someone kill my brother.
Raymond!
Free your mind.
Preserves you!
Sorry about that.
-Get It.
"Larry, Kim."
- It is so nice to meet you.
- Hi.
I did sort of a half get-up there.
"- For my niece, fake niece..."
- I should've done a full stand.
I think a full get-up would've...
It's the thought that counts.
"Listen,"
I hope...
"it's kind of weird, but I'd really love for you to take a look at my reel if you wouldn't mind."
"You know, I mean, I could take a look at it."
I'm not really...
I'm not doing TV right now.
"- That's fine, it's fine."
- How you doing?
I'm doing really well.
Thank you.
How are you?
- You look fabulous by the way.
"- Oh, why thank you."
"So Anna Nicole Smith, she's got uh... some pair of knockers on her, huh?"
"They're not real though, are they?"
Huh?
- Whoa.
- Hey.
What's all... what's all that?
Look at all his gifts.
I thought you said we weren't supposed to bring a present.
He said no gifts.
I don't get it.
- Hello.
What do you mean?
I just...
"I have a bad feeling about it, I, we need to find some rope with her."
"Blair, she's been kidnapped..."
I know.
She's probably traumatized.
"I know that, but she's been here for weeks, right?"
I'm pretty sure that's a fresh pedicure on her feet.
You're basing all of this on nail polish?
Yeah.
Did you get a good look?
Yeah.
I know.
I think so.
Maybe she got a gel pedi before she got kidnapped.
How do you know it?
"It doesn't matter, I just..."
"I think, I think maybe we should tie her up."
Tie her up?
Are you listening to yourself?
She's been tortured.
"No, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it.
Are you guys robbers?
"Sorry, Vivian, we..."
Who told you we were robbers?
Your leader.
He wasn't very good.
Connor.
I think it's my fault.
I think I took a wrong turn.
I don't know.
- Even money Stoker don't go the distance!
- Twenty says he does!
"I'll take that, and as much more as you got!"
Break it up!
Come on!
Nelson's working on his belly!
Stoker don't like it there!
Who does?
- What you trying to do?
Cop a Sunday?
- What's the matter?
Can't you take it?
"It looks like a home run, and it is a..."
"No, it's going to fall inside."
- You're doing swell!
"- How're you doing, Stoke, huh?"
"Okay, fella!"
"Okay, let's see that!"
That will be all right!
"Take it easy, Stoke!"
Take it easy!
There we are!
Give them a show!
"One more heat, and we'll call it a day!"
"Sure thing, Danny!"
Sure thing!
You're doing fine!
You're doing fine!
- I told you I'm gonna take this guy!
- He never laid a glove on us!
Ten seconds!
"Don't forget, if you try to slug with him, he'll kill you!"
I don't know if we have to retire so soon.
That's been the plan this whole time.
"One last job, travel for a year, settle down and..."
Find normal lives.
We're so good at this.
Do we have to stick to that plan?
Always stick to the plan.
Are you sure this time though?
Like really sure.
I'm always sure.
I could not be more sure about this.
I'm a hundred million billion percent sure.
"Yeah, that sounds like you're pretty sure."
"We're 30 years old, sitting in a fake painter's van, about to rob a house."
So cool.
It's not cool.
It used to be cool.
Okay.
This is our last job.
As planned.
Are you sure?
"I am... 100,000 billion percent sure."
Shut up.
"Yeah, sure."
Thank you.
There she is.
Faster than schedule.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Finish it.
Finish what?
The joke.
"Let's see your fingers, prune girl."
"Talk to the hand, 'cause the face ain't gonna listen."
"He asked me to come up with something new, something fresh."
You read it.
It was good.
- Yes.
- It was the funniest script we've had all year!
"Yes, it was."
So what was their problem?
"Hey, I want to hear."
"Oh, yeah?"
"I want to sing opera, but I can't, so I don't."
That downstairs is...
"Well, your dad has a high-pressure job."
What's a high-pressure job?
"It's when you don't get to do what you want and when you do, you don't have time to do it."
Do spies have high-pressure jobs?
Only when they're caught.
I'm never caught.
You're right.
You never are.
"Oh, look, a ugly water bug!"
Hey!
Caught ya.
Here she is.
Night.
Good night.
Good night.
You want me to tuck you in?
Golly can do it.
"""'The time has come,' the Walrus said."
"""To talk of many things."""
My room.
Lie down and rest.
What room is this?
It hurts here.
I can't believe this.
This is my room.
Just lie down and relax.
You were in my dream.
"No, when I was taking a bath."
Really?
Do I look dirty to you?
Think I slept with Changwook?
"No, no."
"Then, what's wrong, huh?"
Because I used to date foreigners?
No.
"Actually, it makes it better."
"When you're dating, it's a turn-on."
It is?
"But to cherish someone in your heart, it can be a problem."
It hurts so much.
"There's no woman here, is there?"
"No, stupid."
Really?
Of course not.
It hurts?
It's nice being with you in the morning.
I don't know what to do.
In my brain there is this illness.
My ex-wife had slept with my friend before we married.
I didn't know that before.
"But then, I found out, and I couldn't forgive her."
Doesn't matter.
See?
You keep to yourself some things too.
But it's not the same.
-Why not?
You're 13...
Daniel is 18...
I'm your father...
And I want to know what you're doing with an 18 years old boy!
"Well I go out with him, to the movies, we dance, laugh, argue, tell jokes, we go to the theater.."
And nothing else!
Had he kissed you?
I said nothing else.
Won't you have slept with him!
That's why you're worried.
The whole point was this.
It's not funny.
What if I'd answer yes.
Nothing.
What could I do?
Who knows..
The first thing would be telling mom.
Do you think I should tell her?
You should know.
So you've slept with him.
If you say so...
Want to make me angry?
That's what you said when I was little.
And what are you now?
If I were so little you wouldn't ask me this.
"It's true, but now..."
-Now everything changed right?
It broke.
I don't know what happened.
"Oh, it's ok."
I'll fix it.
Unless you forget where you put it.
"Don't you worry, I'll find a perfectly safe place for it."
We're out of juice.
Norman.
Come on.
When are we getting our house back?
"Jess, come on."
I'm serious.
"Look, I feel bad enough about what my Dad did already."
Everybody's always giving Roman a raw deal.
He's my brother.
I'm not gonna do that.
I didn't mean it like that.
It's just...
I know you don't see it but...
He scares me.
And I don't trust him.
"Remember, I'm the one that caught him snooping in our bedroom."
"Come on, Jess."
He's not a bad person.
I plead his case.
I know exactly how bad he is.
I can't do this for another 18 months.
We need to get him into a halfway house.
Alright.
"As soon as we find a place, he's out of here."
Hello.
Hey.
Come on.
"One, two, three!"
Wow.
That train is not moving very fast.
This window won't open.
That's why we need to get back in there.
Could pick up the pace.
You're not going fast enough.
I am too going fast enough.
No job is done until the paperwork is complete.
Stand by.
Where the hell is Rudy?
Okay.
"Oh, boy!"
"Oh, oh..."
"Oh, wow..."
It's not that bad.
You're making a big deal.
Wow.
You're making...
Come on.
It's like my grandpa.
It's not that bad.
Where the hell have you been?
Pull me up.
Hand me the chocolate and then I'll pull you up.
Hand you the chocolates?
Yeah.
And then I'll pull you up.
How do I know that once I hand you the chocolate you're not gonna just leave me out here and take the chocolate?
I wouldn't do that.
That's what I would do.
It's too bad it ain't winter.
We could grab a couple bags of those coals.
"""Everwrite Fountain Pen Company."" I wonder what's in there."
Come on.
Let's take a look.
It's loaded full of cases.
Fountain pens.
Hundreds of them.
- We can break that easy.
"- We shouldn't, we don't need those pens."
- It ain't like stealing coal to keep warm.
- We can sell them.
"Now, listen."
"What we don't take, we ain't got."
Look around.
See what you can find to break that lock.
"All right, whoever's in here, come on out."
"Come on out, I say!"
- What's the trouble?
- Just a couple of kids.
I heard them.
Come on out of there.
"Come on, you hoodlums."
You won't get away.
"- Come out, or I'll come in after you."
"- Let's make a break for it, Jerry, now."
"Come on, Rocky!"
Jump!
"Hi, Snowflakes."
"- Hi, Jerry."
- Hello.
What do you hear?
He's cute.
I know how to make him feel better.
"No, I know a better way."
Lift him up.
"Oh, goodness."
"Oh, goodness, what have you done?"
"What are you doing this time, Jimmy?"
He's still conscious?
Yes.
Hello.
You'll be fine.
You just gotta get a little bit power.
"Ladies, could you give us a little space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I want the same thing.
This might hurt a bit.
Here we go.
That's wonderful.
Now we can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is very confusing for you.
But it's better if I show you at the lab.
Hello?
"Oh, thank you."
They're Here.
They must have followed you.
I can't...
I can't let them see me like this.
I can't let...
I'm sorry.
What?
You gotta show us the house.
It's just over that hill.
It's just the one house.
You can't miss it.
You came all the way here.
You should see it through.
"Don't touch me, I gotta go!"
Where do you think you're going?
I said let go!
Shit...
Hey!
Mister.
Mister?
Mister?
You all right?
You fucking bastards.
We're sorry.
Fuck off.
I'm gonna get your asses sacked.
You just wait.
"We're real sorry, okay?"
Fuck you.
You deserve to get scorched by lightning.
Where are you going?
You got hit by lightning.
Hey!
What's the point of taking all those health tonics-
if it's lightning that kills you?
How can something like this happen?
What are the chances?
"But they'll say, thanks to all those tonics, he survived."
Why aren't you trying anything on?
Did you take your meds?
"What do you mean, did I take my meds?"
Of course.
"For God's sake, Mom."
Ha-ha-ha.
"It's just, you don't spend money like this when you're on them."
"- What are you saying, hm?"
- Nothing.
It's nothing.
Just having a good time with your friends.
Isn't that all right?
"Just because I'm sick from time to time, I can't have a good time?"
- That's not what I'm saying.
- We're having a good time.
See?
That jacket is gorgeous.
You see that jacket?
"It's beautiful, right?"
"Oh, my..."
"Oh, with the shoes."
"Oh, my God, it's perfect."
"Come on, baby."
Just try something on.
Try these on.
Wanna try these on?
They're really cute.
We'll get three of these.
We'll get one for you and one for Grace.
Let's get three of them.
"- Thanks, Robin."
You're awesome.
- Yeah.
"I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes."
John.
- I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
"- No,you can't."
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
"It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45."
I tried to get you on the one to
"Charleston, but they're all booked up."
"So if you leave now, you'll just make it."
I can't.
I can't.
"It's Christmas Eve, John."
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
"Yeah, you can."
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
I know I can.
I can stop this.
"No one can stop it, John."
Listen to me.
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.
People you know and love are going to die... and no matter what that voice tells you... there's nothing you can do about it.
It's two years to the day.
He told me that she's goi ng to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.
He's lying.
They said it was on the floor.
I didn't understand.
Really.
Please try to forgive me and understand.
I'm just new here.
It's my first day.
If I'd known it was down there...
You sure you'll be OK?
I'm really very sorry.
Please try to forgive me.
"If you need anything, just call me."
Anything you want...
I'll be outside.
"Phil, when you get a chance, take a look at this article."
It has been a day!
Dr. Jones is a piece of work.
Had me running back and forth.
I can't wait to get out of here.
No.
I'm talking about the one right there.
No.
"Look over there, girl."
Stop.
He's all right with me.
He's cute.
Of course he's cute.
That's why I'm telling you to look.
"You having a problem there, Jessica?"
Yes.
"I put my money in there, and it keeps eating my money."
I can see through their clothes.
This is weird.
Maybe if he wasn't so handsome...
Which one?
Both.
How can I compete with that?
You had a world-famous TV star and a hunk that drives a truck.
He drives a truck.
"Well, morning's no slouch."
Ah.
She's probably twice as old as both your guys.
"Even so, that body, those big tits..."
"Oh, you did very well, my friend."
I suppose.
You did.
And now it's time to put all that behind us.
We agreed... fresh start.
Fresh start.
Right?
Clean slate.
Clean slate.
What?
What are you thinking about?
Your dirty slate.
Yo.
"Matt, I just got off the phone with Diane's lawyer."
"Oh, fuck."
He told me about the D.U.I.
The D.U.I. with the kids in the car.
"Got to say, didn't see that coming."
It's bullshit.
I was so not drunk.
Believe me...
I've driven drunk.
"Look, I've never met anyone like me before."
"Apart from the first time, and that was mostly fighting him off."
Badly.
Please.
No-one's ever taught me how to do this.
"Adam, here's the thing, right?"
I don't care.
"Yeah, like I want to hang out with some whiffy Goth anyway."
Excuse me?
Just cos you're a vampire doesn't mean you have to smell like the undead.
"One word, Mitch."
Deodorant.
Tch!
"- Oh, good."
You two have met.
- He's just leaving.
You want to watch yourself with this one.
She's been giving me the glad eye ever since I arrived.
- Loves a bit of fang.
- I do not!
That is a terrible thing to say.
I do not like a bit of fang.
"Not his fang, or anyone else's."
"Er... you know, I'm not ruling it out."
Just if the right fang came along.
But I haven't even thought about it.
At all.
For ages.
Oh.
"OK, ladies."
I'll catch you later.
Can we?
It's...
L.A. You can wear whatever you want.
"Ok, I'll just grab my purse."
I'll get your heels.
"Well, hello to you, too."
Thought you said you had...
a meeting to go to.
What?
"You said you had... a meeting, remember when I texted you... earlier?"
"Oh, yeah."
"I did, but uh, but I'm done now."
"Oh, great."
"Hallie, what's up?"
What's going on?
What's going on?
I think I should be asking you that question.
Excuse me?
"What is going on, Dale?"
"Uh, nothing."
"Look, I'm just-"
"I'm, did I miss something here?"
Wait.
Do you like him now?
Is that it?
"Look, I'm just gonna leave."
All right?
Of course you are.
"Zach, you're a piece of crap you know that?"
You're just another famous asshole guy who thinks he can screw around with any girl he wants and then not call them.
Well... fuck you!
"We're not... even dating, Hallie."
I've told you that 10... times.
Fear of bodily fluids.
I need a break.
Let's take a break.
Okay.
"Okay, I'll get him."
Richard.
Why don't you walk around in those and see how they feel.
- It's Peter.
- Hello?
"Oh, no."
Really?
"Well, did you call your mom?"
"Oh, right."
Damn.
"Well, can you make it through the day, Petey?"
Are you barfing?
Okay.
"Okay, let's see here."
"I don't get off until 6:00, and we are just slammed here."
It's a sale day.
But don't worry.
Someone will come and get you.
This is why we have neighbors.
"We're part of a community, Peter."
Does your mom make you do that?
"No, this is my own towel."
I bought it with my own money.
I have the whole set.
"See, this is the bath sheet... and this is the hand towel... and this is the washcloth."
- Isn't the washcloth cute?
- Yeah.
"When they hang on the rack, they go like this."
"No, stop!"
Look out for the cow!
"Come on, no, not there!"
please stop.
"No, stop!"
We can't go there yet.
people just aren't ready for you.
That was close.
"We can't go running around like that, okay?"
Look!
That would be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.
We gotta hide!
"You know, hide?"
"It's when you-- You know, when you--"
"Just get behind something, quick!"
We took him to a relative
Why'd he do it?
"I don't smell booze on him, but he's not talking."
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?
What the hell happened?
"How's it going, Sergeant?"
I'm his uncle!
Let go of me!
Rotten bastard.
Couldn't he use GPS?
Why do I have to take him?
Ain't that it?
Get the wire cutters.
Pull it back.
What's that stink?
How?
Here's 50.
Why are you doing all this for me?
Hurry up.
There's coffee if you'd like.
Laure!
"Laure, it's Gilou!"
- Calm down!
- How's it going?
"So, who was right?"
You switched your phone off?
"Sorry, I went back to sleep."
"I'm taking a shower, I'm coming."
"- Wait, I'll make some coffee."
- I don't have any left.
I'll see you at the office.
"See you later, then."
"Fuck, just what I didn't want to happen."
"You're entitled to a private life, aren't you?"
I don't know.
What?
How come you don't know?
- Aren't we serious?
"- Yes, we are."
"Anyway, I've got to go."
I'm taking someone in for questioning.
What kind?
The kind of dealer involved in settling scores in a squat.
A guy got hit in the lung by a bullet.
It went through the ceiling.
He is dead?
He'll survive.
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling isn't mutual.
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.
- He's been causing me a lot oftrouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.
- Don't bother.
- No need.
- Please be careful.
"- Take care,Jenny."
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.
"Jeffrey, take care ofyour friend, meanwhile."
"Make yourselfat home, Dumbo."
"I am, Mickey Mouse."
"Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage?"
He paid me a thousand bucks to keep you talking.
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am I?
Lets wait and see.
You're always the loser.
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.
Let's put your preparations to the test.
- Are you always so determined?
"- Yes, that's my style."
Mine too.
So we have something in common.
You're so tall.
Get lost!
So sorry.
Goodbye.
"David, sit and eat with us."
I've to work.
Thanks.
Thank God having David here.
I'll never know how to deal with those members.
Like it?
We can change it till you like it.
Can you stop spending money to me this way?
"When you did something wrong, sent me gift."
Now you buy me a car.
So what?
I'm not that greedy.
You know how bad that makes me feel?
What?
Aren't I nice to you?
You just walked out on me.
Why did we've to split up?
You really want to know?
Tell me.
"You're ill-tempered, stubborn, give me no sense of security..."
"Ok, cut it out."
"You're not my cup of tea, ok?"
Then imagine me to be coffee.
"Milk tea, tea and coffee mix, anything."
"Michael, let's just be friends."
"It's all my fault, ok?"
"Lisa, is everything ok?"
This is your tea.
Not now.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
I keep it running perfect.
"It's Tony's sister, she did it."
She's as weird as he is.
"Tony, I command you to make this car run perfectly and continuously without interference from your sister."
I can't stop the car.
Tony's energizing it.
It's like your brother doesn't even know you.
- It's yo-yo.
Let's go!
- No.
Don't run.
You crazy?
You don't want to go to that school.
"Please, trust me."
"Now, come on, hurry."
"Hey, wait for me."
"Come on, you guys."
Get in there.
- Let's go!
"- Come on, get in."
I'm dreaming.
You're surrendering to the board of education?
"Sir, you see that car going down the street?"
- Yeah.
- My brother's in it.
He ought to be going to school.
You ought to catch up with him.
Another truant?
"Oh, boy, we're gonna have a load."
Okay.
Less gay it is.
Great!
"I'm gonna give Wes a call, see what he thinks of the glasses idea."
"Oh, Jack."
He has no idea what he just...
Anticlimax.
What's wrong?
My boyfriend back home thinks that college is gonna make me some sort of... sex robot.
Tell me about it.
Mine thinks it's gonna turn me into a brainwashed sex doll.
You know what?
We should teach them a lesson.
Yeah?
If they're gonna treat us like that... maybe we should just act like it.
Yeah!
"Okay, close your eyes."
You tricked me.
What are you gonna do about it?
- That.
- Ouch!
Not too hard!
Stop!
You stop!
"Oh, you're so sexy!"
I feel so much better!
Me too.
Pillow fights fix everything.
"You know, I heard that but I always thought it was a sham."
A pillow sham?
"Ooh, good one."
I've never done that before... with a girl...
And so are we.
You are so explaining this to me.
"Hey, baby."
"If this bar were a meat market, you'd be the prime rib."
"Oh, god."
"You reek of cannabis, Bender."
Cannabis?
"Hey Maxine, you've got something on your chest - my eyes!"
Go away.
It's never going to happen.
"Hey, are you like a parking ticket or something?"
"Cuz you've got ""fine"" written all over you."
I have a headache.
You can stand here but don't talk to me.
"Look, you look a lot like my next girlfriend, you know what I'm saying?"
"Oh, my god."
How long does this go on before you actually quit?
I never quit.
That's one thing that you're gonna learn about me.
I never quit.
Never.
Fuck it.
[BENDER] Fuck what?
Fuck it - let's do it.
What?
Where we going?
We're gonna go to your place.
We're gonna go- we're gonna go to my place?
Mm-hmm.
Sweet.
- Now.
"- Oh, now."
Go!
Thank you.
Get out!
Do you still love me?
I gave you my reasons.
Do you still love me?
"Say ""I do not love you."""
Say it!
Say it!
I do not love you.
You're a liar!
"You did the right thing, coming to see me."
I do not have anyone else.
You say it is the Church that has persuaded the King to renounce his love for you?
Yes.
"You have beauty, wit, intelligence, yet none of these have proved strong enough to retain the King's love."
Only one course remains open to you.
What do I have to do?
There's someone you should meet.
Who?
His name is Guibourg.
Who is he?
He's a friend and he sees the world as we do.
Where shall I find him?
Monsieur Guibourg?
Yes?
I need your help.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I am the Marquise de Montespan.
And how may I help you?
I need to reclaim a man's love.
You didn't forget your phone again did you?
"Anyways, Aunt came out to check her bank account, and it broke her heart."
Give her a call ok?
Welcome!
This is driving nuts!
Give me a can of beer that's past the expiration date.
There's no such thing.
It's $1.70.
-Get money from Jang Min.
-Sis said that she will kill me.
"If that kills you, I should've been dead 88000 times."
It will be $1.70 sir.
I don't have money.
See?
"Fine, let me call my sister first."
Chan!
Come on Chan!
Geez.
"""Sis isn't answering her phone."
"I left her a voice mail."""
"""I told her that you cried your eye balls out."" Hehe look at this kid."
"""Ok."" Send."
"This is so simple, Honey."
Hey what time are you coming home?
"Yes, mother around 7?"
"Ok, I'll get ready then."
"Ok, Mom see you."
What did you want to eat?
Just make whatever you want.
Fine!
"We can just text this, ""What time?"" ""What do you want?"""
"""7,"" ""Kimchi"" It's so simple."
Here.
Look at this one.
"Oh, that's great."
Great.
With the smoke around Jivver's face.
Yeah.
So how's Hallie?
Looks like...
"you guys are an item now, huh?"
No.
"No, not an item."
Definitely not.
"She's a very nice girl, but um, she doesn't take no for an answer, does she?"
"Well, you're a big boy."
I'm sure you can handle... her.
"Hey, um, I wanted to ask you did you tell her to pursue me?"
Uh...
- Hello there Miss homebody.
Why aren't you dressed yet?
For what?
Did you forget my big screen debut deal?
We're going to my L.A. Red carpet premiere.
Hello.
"What do you think, Johnson?"
I think she's dead.
No excuses.
Seven was supposed to tell you.
Yeah.
"Well, he didn't."
"Oh, my god, I did actually."
It's just that you had your head buried in those photos and you didn't notice.
"Well, can I wear this?"
"Okay, I'm making out with this guy..."
PG stuff.
"And he mentions that he's going out of town, he's gonna be out of touch."
Run.
But maybe he is going out of town.
Where?
Where's he going that he's gonna be out of touch?
Where are you going out of town to again?
Um...
Uh...
Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh.
Run.
"So, what, now I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?"
Yeah.
There's not gonna be anybody left.
I don't know why I'm saying this but I think I know a nice guy who might actually like you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
He's friends with my brother.
His name's Bill.
We'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.
"So, I mean, I'm in his bathroom right now."
What do I do?
"Well, you gotta come out eventually, right?"
But I'd take my time in there.
I'd let him sweat.
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
[SIGHS]
BEN:
"Yeah, the boat looks great."
"The way he talks, you'd think he had something there."
Excuse me.
Hey.
Look at the dude.
- Come on.
Let's give him the works.
"- All right, kiddo."
"- Hey, watch out!"
- Give me that!
I'll make you eat that ball in a minute!
"All right, come on!"
Let's go!
Like taking candy from a baby.
"How'd you get it, Crab?"
I hoisted it over the transom in the alley and dropped it.
- The corner caught me right in the dome.
- So long as it didn't break the machine.
"Boy, we'll be in the money now."
Six nickels and two slugs.
Imagine crooks like that?
Putting slugs in a slot machine.
- Chiselers.
- I'm gonna break this thing...
Pipe down.
- It's only Soapy and the gang.
- That's good.
"Hi, Soapy!"
"- Soapy, look what we got."
- You should see the hook I got.
It's the most I got in my life.
- We got a sucker's poke.
- No kidding!
How's that working out for you?
"Yeah, what a shocker."
Right.
"Next, I need you to, uh, take your shirt off, please."
Open up there.
"Yeah, those."
Plug the jacks in there.
"Yeah, in there."
"So, your name's Henry and... okay, well, the good news is that you're gonna live a while."
"The bad news is that in this case, a while means 20, 30 minutes tops, Henry."
"Unless you're very, very lucky... which you are."
Uncle Jimmy is gonna take you to his lab.
Hang on.
"Ah, shit."
We got bacon on our tail.
Unplug yourself.
Put that away.
There's some clothes in there.
Put the hoodie on.
Shit.
There's not enough time.
Fuck it.
Just cover the blood up with your bag.
"Just stay calm and let me handle this, yeah?"
That's how it goes...
Bollocks.
"Fucking Akan, paying off the..."
"I'm gonna have to hurt you, Henry, but it's for your own good, mate."
Just give me your arm...
Hey!
Shit!
It's me!
I never heard of a Guy that never belonged to a gang.
I'm sure something's happened.
I've got to find him.
"If anybody could find him, we could."
"I mean, we know this town inside out."
"Oh, would you?"
"Hey, yeah, sure."
"Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hey, come on, let's go."
That Tony sure made himself scarce.
- We better walk you home.
- Where do you live?
I...
I was supposed to stay at a hotel.
But I don't know which one.
You could stay in our hideout.
- Yeah!
- Thank you.
We'll look for Tony tomorrow.
If we aren't busy beating up goons.
- Yeah.
"- Hey, it's Yo-Yo."
- Get down.
"- Come on, hide."
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
- But he's coming this way.
- Who is he?
- Our worst enemy.
- He's worse than the goons.
Is this... um...
Who-who-who...
Who... where...
"Uh, gee, if i..."
How 'bout it?
What's up?
"Do-do you know many, um... [crying]"
Wait!
"Please, don't go."
[Crying]
It's up to you.
I'll talk.
I'll tell ya.
What did he look like?
[Monitors beeping]
I think it's time for us to go.
"Listen, would you wait for me outside?"
Okay.
I'll be there in a minute.
I found the guys that did this to you...
And I've taken care of it.
It was strange.
It was like we were back in 'nam.
It didn't matter if it was right or wrong.
I just did it.
"And don't worry about Maria and the kids, 'cause I figured out a way to get some money for them."
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.
"Listen, do you want me to turn this television on here... just blink your eyes if you do."
"I'll get the nurse to come in and look after you, okay?"
Just hold on.
Please.
Help!
Help!
Please help!
Just go away.
They're gone now.
Don't be afraid.
I'll take you home.
Jenny!
How do you know my name?
I've listened to you sing so often...
Who are you?
I feel as if I know you.
I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.
What are you doing now?
Looking at this scarf.
It's got my blood stains on it.
- Then say it!
I want to wear my old dress!
"Oh, dear."
"We'll look for work, even something on the street!"
Why?
Where'd you get that fur?
Where'd you get this?
I ran into an old friend.
- And he told you about me?
No.
- And you let him give you furs?
- Yes!
But I can't give you presents?
"Franz, let's dress like before and look for work."
You're not gonna tell me who it was?
I made that up!
Where'd you meet?
On the street?
While I'm risking my neck and showering you with money?
"Get away from me, you tramp!"
You tramp!
Damn you!
Get out of my sight!
I'm out risking my neck and slaving away like crazy!
Franz!
Let me go!
Let go!
This is my home!
Leave me alone!
This is my home!
Open this door!
Just wait until I ―
"Because I should feel terrible, and I don't."
"And you're right, it does feel good to say that."
Dam... broken!
Go-to guy!
"Hey, girls!"
I did it.
I broke this dude's dam.
"Hey, I'm going to bed."
"Okay, I love you."
You can sleep outside if it makes you feel more comfortable.
"Oh, and make sure to close the window so the alarm sets."
I got it.
See?
Go team!
"Uh, or you can just keep it open, in case there's a fire, so you can just throw me out of it."
I love you.
Ugh.
"Oh, balls."
"Oh, my God, a squirrel!"
Aah!
"Okay, calm down."
I...
I can't.
You know I hate rats.
"Okay, it's just a squirrel."
"No, no, squirrels are just sexy rats."
Everybody knows that.
"I think it touched my leg, ugh."
Where is it?
"I don't know, I don't know, all I feel is a squirrel touch, ugh."
"Okay, it's fine, all right?"
"It is much more scared of us than we are of it, all right?"
"Well, listen."
"Since I already lost my deposit and all, maybe we should light up."
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you want to do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
"I just have to go, is all."
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And you know, pot is, like, stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
"So, you want to go grab some some dinner?"
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."
We cool?
"Your satellite's on, by the way."
That screen's bad-ass.
I just think it's asking a lot.
He knows it.
He's done nothing but apologize.
Is this going to be every weekend now?
You're late!
The last 15 minutes..
"I've been a fucking roller coaster of emotions, mate."
I didn't know if I was ever gonna see you again.
So I lit some of this.
"I fired on my nerves damn you, you know?"
And there you are.
It's okay.
You've just lost power.
Come on.
"Hey, bring me some of this strong Russian shit, girls."
"Okay, now where is that ... pump?"
Where's that?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking...?
Yeah?
"Fuck you, no!"
This is it.
"This is it, yeah."
Okay.
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, we gotta get this little fucker in there."
Whom I kidding with?
I'm not in condition to do this.
"I'm sorry, I'm in no condition to do this, mate."
I'm in no condition.
I'm sorry.
I'm in no condition to do this.
What's wrong with his hand?
Who is he?
Is he a robot?
Dale!
They threw gas bombs in through the gates.
All the guys ran up in the north cell hall.
"Now, the National Guard's out there with machine guns and gas masks!"
Did I say a picnic?
You two guys get in that cell.
Okay.
Why don't we give it to them right now?
We may need 'em later.
[GUNSHOTS]
Any of you guys got a shiv?
He's got one.
Swell.
Screws with machine guns all over the joint.
We'll make out.
Out where?
"Why, through the back door."
"We pick the screws off the wall, get some rope at the twine mill and lam out!"
Let's go!
STACEY:
"Come on, get going."
Come on.
You guys go ahead.
What about you?
Don't worry about me.
I'll make out.
I got something to take care of.
"Go on, beat it."
Put him in that cell.
He's done.
[GUNFIRE]
"We all go together, Stacey."
I'm not dating...
I know.
I get it.
"What about you, smart guy?"
Did you really think this one through?
"Well, I have a right to display my art."
"Oh, give it up."
I'm gonna have to side with chloe on this one.
I wanted it in my show. it's my best picture.
There's a red dot on it.
Who bought it?
"oh, god. that feels weird."
Nobody bought it.
"I didn't want anyone to have it,"
"So i-i put a ""sold"" sticker on it."
Yeah.
Maybe.
Out of my way!
you!
"Oh, pooh. you're late. sorry you missed all the fun."
Oh!
not really.
I brought my own fun.
"Hello, andrea. come in early tomorrow."
Do you mind?
I want to show you your new office.
i think you're gonna like it.
"If you need to make a copy, it's super convenient."
"Okay, so you don't like practical jokes."
That's good to know. that's how a friendship grows!
Come on.
I'll walk you out.
I don't want a dime extra.
And you're not gonna touch him again.
You hear me?
I hope he doesn't give me a reason to touch him again and I hope you don't...
I don't give a crap if he gives you a reason.
"You're not gonna touch him again, just say it."
"Billy, let's go."
You need to calm...
You need to tell your little brother...
"Listen to me, you fat son of a bitch!"
"You're not gonna touch him again, you understand me?"
How's Jackie?
You don't touch...
Billy!
Billy!
You're barking up the wrong tree!
Hey!
Get out!
You are barking down the wrong tree!
Billy!
Go!
"Jesus Christ, Billy!"
"What are you thinking, man?"
Get in the truck!
"Barking up the wrong tree, Billy!"
He's got a gun.
He's got a gun.
Just get in the truck.
Keep your little brother away from me.
Start the truck.
Start the truck.
I'm trying!
"It's a morning thing, right?"
When you wake up?
You work too much.
Sure.
Excuse me.
"Oui, mon ange."
"Yes, sweetheart, I know."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Daddy will call you back, but now I'm... wait, hang on."
Would you excuse me a second?
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
"Honey, I can't talk to you now."
"Rachel, check out that guy for me... now."
Of course you're coming for vacation.
Sure you are.
"No, honey, I can't come get you."
"We'll do just like last time, I..."
We'll see.
"Okay, I'll call you back."
Love you.
Don't ever do this to me again.
Ever.
I've got a screwball in my office.
"He may be a screwball, but he wasn't lying."
He's head of a department at St. Louis.
Ross didn't tell you anything else?
"No, nothing."
"They say the swan sings only once, just before dying."
"Yes, I know."
"He senses he's going to die, so he sings."
It's not because of the pain.
I don't think he's alive.
"We've gotta do something, or that bastard will get us first."
Shut the damn door!
What's in that jar?
Which one?
The one with the red lid.
It's just soy sauce.
Bring it over.
"What, are you deaf?"
"Out of the way, come on."
Stand back.
What is that?
I'll be fucked...
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.
"You don't want to leave, do you?"
Let's
Stop it!
Hyo-ijn!
"Come here, you!"
You met up with something recently you weren't supposed to?
I don't follow you.
Did you disturb someone?
"Of all the evil I've seen, this is the strongest."
You disturbed it.
"Oh, God!"
What do we do now?
Who is it?
Who did you disturb?
Tell him.
A Japanese man...
I knew it.
That's no man.
"If she doesn't pay, it comes out of my pocket."
Why call the police?
We'll make her parents pay.
Do you really need the police?
I feel bad for her.
"What, are you willing to pay what she owes?"
"No, but..."
"She won't tell us her address, she's a runaway."
Hey!
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Hey!
He's not coming back.
"He hasn't replied yet, right?"
You were tricked.
Shut up!
He said he's not doing that anymore.
He tells that lie to everyone.
Get your hands off me!
What're you doing here?
Ow...
Let's go.
He went and fought for her.
What about you?
They must be in round two.
Take it easy.
I have to go.
"Does your husband do this to you, too?"
"No, he won't even lay a finger on me."
Sergeant Fujita must be asleep with your kid now.
Don't...
"You're a naughty wife, leaving the kid to your husband."
"- Oh, the setup is all wrong."
I'm bound to wind up behind the eight ball with you.
What do you mean?
"Well, by your standards, I'm a wrong guy."
- You're the sweetest guy in the world.
"- No, you don't know what I mean."
- You don't know my racket.
- I don't care about your racket.
You sure?
"Not now, I don't."
Hello?
Mike.
That guy gets in your hair.
"- Hello, what do you want?"
- I'll tell you.
- You better get down here fast tonight.
- For what?
This Joe is on the loose.
They're stringing with him.
"I'm telling you straight, the guy threw me out."
You're frozen out.
Tell him to get here.
Tell him what he tried to do.
Louis is burned too.
He said Joe tried to hold him up today for cash.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, listen, you tell Louis I'm getting right down there."
"- Yeah, right away."
"- Yeah, okay."
"- What's wrong, Patsy?"
"- Oh, no, nothing."
Nothing at all.
"Have you got a cold, Ed?"
I didn't have a minute... didn't have a minute ago.
"Scratch me there, will you?"
- Here?
-(sneezes)
"Boy, this usually only happens when I'm... when I'm around dogs."
(sneezes)
- You got a dog?
"-Uh, yes, I have, Ed."
- Maybe you'd better go.
-Huh?
"Oh, no, no, no."
I'm all right.
"It's just, uh, the..."
Whose dog is it?
It's mine.
I got it at the pound.
But please don't say anything to Ralph about it before I do.
He doesn't think we should have a dog in the apartment.
"Oh, no, no, no, I won't."
I won't.
I won't.
"I'd like to look at the dog, if you don't mind."
"Well, do you think you should, Ed?"
"Oh, I'm-I'm all right."
It's just... (begins to sneeze) ...just after the initial attack is over then I'm all right.
I want to look at the pooch.
Where is he?
"Hi, there, little poochy boy!"
"Oh, what a beautiful dog this is."
Hey!
Hey!
[Brakes Screech]
[Cloudy] Here.
I'm pretty sure that was the frog.
He made me too.
He lives on four.
He went up to six.
He's cute.
Real cute.
The other guy's a frog too.
He checked into the Edison.
- Had a hooker sent up.
- You could have collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How 'bout Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
"Why don't you do the same, Doyle?"
You look like shit.
- [Cloudy] Come on.
- Look.
My partner and I made this case.
You know?
Originally.
We don't want any feds screwing' it up.
Case?
So far you haven't showed me a damn thing.
"You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right in the middle of next week."
"- Aw, get out— - [Cloudy] Knock it off."
"- Don't tell me to knock it off, goddamn it."
- We don't need this.
"Now, cut it out, will ya?"
For Christ's sakes!
All right.
He's the one I'll go after.
Wait a minute.
It's cold outside.
You'll freeze.
Here.
I'll lend you my fur.
Hasn't she prettied up the place?
"Wait till you see how gentle she is, and good as gold."
You have everything you need at the bar.
Enough about the bar!
Here she comes!
Hide and don't make a sound!
"Stop right there, Mieze."
You have to swear first.
Swear you won't look behind the curtains.
"""I swear..."" Come on!"
I swear.
"""I swear I won't look behind the curtains."""
- Fine.
- Good girl.
"You got me another present, didn't you?"
Don't buy me any more presents!
"Why not, sweetie?"
We have everything we need.
I have my dress.
You have your things.
Why do we need more things?
Because they're nice to have.
What is it?
Franzie...
I have something to say.
- All right.
Come here.
All right.
"I'll allow this but if you start making strain noises,"
- we're breaking up.
- We should go.
- I'm sure she's fine.
- She should just move on.
She falls all the time.
What do I care?
What we need to be concerned about is getting that diamond back.
We need someone to kiss Trent.
- Can you do it?
For Candace?
- Oh no...
I'm not into that kind of thing.
"- Yep, that's Trent"
- I'll do it.
I don't like seeing you all torn up like this.
You know what?
You know what we could do to cheer you up?
Let's do that thing where we pretend to be an old couple that's been married for 50 years.
Come on.
"I'm coming for you, stud-muffin."
Hot wheels.
Almost there.
Sweetie...
This usually gets me going.
My heart's just not in it.
Guys.
The fight with Danny is killing him.
I know.
"I was little, but I was so angry."
That doesn't sound like you.
I've got to cram for my lit exam.
PDA in the hallway.
It's adorable.
"Don't you have, like, everything to sign up for?"
First day.
You got a lot to do.
It is my first day.
I don't know where anything is.
- Okay?
"The cafeteria, the office..."
- I'll...
I'll show him around.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- He's a pain in the ass.
- I'm standing right here.
Just dump him at the office.
They'll take care of him.
"So, it must be weird starting at a new school in the middle of the year."
Used to it.
We move around a lot.
Living in one place your whole life isn't all that it's cracked up to be.
"So, yesterday, in the hall..."
Yeah.
Right.
I was wondering when you'd bring that up.
- You knew who I was?
- ‭Yeah.
And you chose to screw with me because...?
"It was more fun than ""Hey, I'm Eli."" ""Hey, I'm Emma."""
We don't talk to the priest.
Just between us.
Sometimes he says something.
But that's it.
But I'm not the priest.
No.
You're my father.
I come here once a month and you always end up interrogating me.
Sometimes I'd like to slap you face!
No.
Better hit me with your belt!
Like Elena's father.
And who's Elena's father?
"A beast, who else."
"Well, let's calm down."
I'm calm.
I assume I was bad at you.
But you were too.
Me?
Why?
You never give up!
You're mad because I'm going out with Daniel.
If he were 15 you'd be so happy.
15 is a much more similar age for you.
That kid who came to eat with us one day was 15.
He seemed nice.
Normal.
Do you think we talk in the same way with an adult?
Then when there's someone older you guys lie?
And you lie to me?
Tell me.
You lie to me.
They'll be coming up soon.
"So just slow down a little, Dale."
"I'm pumped, man."
Pumped!
Stupid cops.
- Stupid!
- Couldn't stop a snail on a salt bed.
- You see him yet?
"- No, not yet."
"- When you see him, tell me quick!"
- I will!
- Now...
- Yeah?
"When I give the order, you ram him hard into the guard rail, Dale."
- That'll stop him.
- I'm a road warrior!
"- I know you are, Dale."
- I am.
"Time to stop those yuppie punks, Dale!"
"- Dude, are we gonna be on TV?"
"- You know we are, dude."
- That's hot.
- You know we are.
Did either of you ever actually kill anybody?
Not yet.
I did.
How did it feel?
It didn't feel like I thought it would.
It felt shitty.
It felt wrong.
But what can you do?
"Partner, there's nothing you could do."
The flat's yours.
You are the one who pays the rent.
Anyway I'm going to Manchester tomorrow.
They decided to take the exhibition on tour.
This is a success then?
It's success.
I'm glad.
You know the first time I painted you outside the steelworks?
Maybe I shouldn't have shown you walking away.
Oh!
I don't know Ellis.
Maybe you shouldn't have made me so bloody small.
One ticket madam.
Safe journey.
Next please.
War widows.
War widows.
There you are.
War widows.
War widows.
War widows.

-l'm sorry. I apologize.
-What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?
"You don't buy anything, you hear me?"
You don't buy anything!
"I'm sorry, Jimmy."
The fat fuck.
He oughtta wear a sign.
I can't believe this...
"Are you stupid, or what?"
Excuse me.
-Take it off.
-Why?
Take it off!
Take it off!
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big or attract attention?
"One guy gets a Caddy and one gets a $20,000 mink."
I'll return it.
Bring it back where you got it.
Get it out of here.
Understand?
Get it out of here!
"This drink here is better than sex, babe."
I'm going to see Stacks.
Don't you look at anybody.
You look straight ahead or I'll fuckin' kill you.
"He's so jealous. lf l even look at anyone else, he'll kill me."
That's great.
I tell them all not to attract attention.
What do they do?
I've been looking all over for you.
"Listen, I need the money."
What do we think?
Uncool!
It's not uncool!
Who said uncool?
Me!
Why is it uncool?
It's a Peugeot!
What's that got to do with it?
It's ugly!
That's nothing to do with coolness!
Anyone think it is cool?
"Right, I do."
I'm gonna explain why.
It's a hot hatchback - hot hatchbacks are cool.
"They're small, they're easy to run."
"I had one the other week, came down here, drove it in second gear all the way, made me feel 18!"
"All of which is good, and they're good cars."
I just...
"Everybody else thinks it's uncool, you think it's cool."
Casting vote here.
"I reckon, apply your own test."
The Kristen Scott Thomas test.
Picture her outside her apartment in that.
She'll get in.
No.
She'll get in the diesel one of the bloke behind.
I think it's uncool.
"Oh, my God!"
What's up with you?
Chinese burn.
Why don't you give him a dead leg?
I will.
Your silence has saved your life.
Until now.
"Now you need us, and we need you."
There's only one way to catch that maniac.
Hold on.
By offering him something he can't refuse.
You aren't serious!
We have no other choice.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
He wants to use you as bait.
You what?
- It's your only chance.
Put me out there like a piece of meat.
You came to see us.
Don't get her involved!
She already is!
You wanted to solve this case.
Not at her expense.
And we'll solve it.
Always you!
And if it's the last thing I do.
You just can't be trusted.
What?
Here's a package.
Speak up!
Who's it for?
"For you, lnspector Minks."
From somebody named lrezumi.
I'll put it here.
Car keys and a parking-lot ticket.
No.
♪ Let's live it up ♪
♪ Don't need no boys to tell us no ♪
♪ We refuse to be controlled ♪

We got it.
♪ You know that you can't do no wrong ♪
We got it.
"- Oh, the verdict?"
- We nailed it.
"Great lyrics, Andrea."
Thanks.
Just think.
This is our chance to get our big break.
I think a crazy plan is coming our way.
"If we can just get the song to Livi, she'll help launch my career."
I'll be rich and famous.
"And what happened to ""us""?"
"We're a band, remember?"
"Yeah, what good is fame if you don't have your friends?"
That's just it.
We'll all be famous.
As if.
What do you want?
Me'?
"Oh, nothing."
It's just so much fun listening to you guys think you could be pop stars.
We've got a better chance than you.
"Oh, please."
OK.
Nice.
That feels good.
Are you gonna fuck me now?
Yup.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Can I stay up late watching movies?
-Yep.
You're not gonna make me go to bed?
Do whatever the fuck you want.
What's wrong?
"It's... you know my friend you met here tonight, Bender?"
Yeah.
"I can't believe I'm telling you this, but she was here before you got here and she kissed me."
She kissed you?
"Yeah, she was tying my tie and she pulled me in and kissed me."
Did you kiss her back?
No. [LAUGHING] Of course not.
"But it was- you know, it was peculiar."
"Well, girls do funny things sometimes."
Yeah.
"There was this once, a long time ago, actually when we first met, she and I made out."
Nothing really came of it... [SIGH]
She and I - we don't make sense as a couple.
Do we make sense as a couple?
-Yes.
-Yeah?
Water!
"Please, let me get water."
I'm so not done with you yet.
"What, what?"
Last night was terrible.
You look good.
That's impossible at my age.
Even more now... that I'm dying.
Don't say that.
I'm dying!
"Come on Jacoba, you have to be strong!"
I don't want to!
I'm dying...
It's all because of your son.
It's a girl.
Don't you remember?
Why do you blame her?
He's a selfish person.
"When he was small, he was so quiet."
Probably he was thinking what he was going to do later.
He was really cute.
And very obedient.
You know already what happened when he grew up.
He turned out to be so ugly!
Now that we're married I can tell you...
He took away my house.
You said the house was for me.
But he came back and took it away.
So I told him I was leaving to die in other place.
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
I know what I'm saying!
Who's that?
She's a nun.
She takes care of you.
You're younger.
[Radio Chatter]
"[Man, Indistinct]"
[Horn Honks]
I don't want to get into this.
I gotta have time.
I can't get any more time.
"- Give me some fuckin' time, will you?"
- You're not gonna get it.
We found a set of works on the kid driving the sports car over there.
His girlfriend's in the back of the car.
She's dead.
- Give the car a complete toss.
- I say we keep sitting' on Boca.
"Jimmy, give it up."
Give it up.
It's all over with.
"If there was a deal, it's gone down by now."
We blew it.
We blew our warrants.
We blew our cover.
"Walter, listen."
I know the deal hasn't gone down.
I— I know it.
I can feel it.
I'm dead certain.
"Last time you were dead certain, we ended up with a dead cop."
Hey!
Hold— Hold on!
Hold on!
"Break it up, both of you!"
Will you two break it up?
Stop it now.
"Oh, yeah."
No.
My boyfriend.
He hurt you?
"Uh, you want me to call the cops?"
No.
No.
That'll only make things worse.
"I just want to go to his place, pick up my stuff."
If I just had an hour.
[phone rings] [ring] [beep]
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.
Otto speaking.
I'm at the bar.
Come see me now.
[click]
"Yeah, it, uh..."
"Well, no, no, no, sir, we don't, and, um, I would..."
I would appreciate it if you would take us off your list.
[beep]
"Hey, uh, you mind watching the place for a few minutes while I go hit the head?"
You don't have a toilet?
"Oh, it's busted."
Goddamn landlord doesn't want to pay to fix it.
We've been using the bar down the street.
"Anyone stops in, just tell them I'll be back in five or thereabouts."
"At my age, it may take a little longer."
[honking]
Hey.
"Hey, why'd you park me in?"
"Hey, what the fuck, man?"
Why'd you park me in?
I sleep just fine.
Ok.
And I came to realize it's that fear that's the worst of it.
That's the real enemy.
So... get up.
Get out in the real world.
And you kick that bastard as hard as you can right in the teeth.
Do it again.
Go on.
"$10,000 even."
Same as last time.
It's totally accurate.
"You and I, we are gonna feed this machine."
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.
"Not yours, I take it."
"We got 10, 20, 30,"
"44, 45 each."
3 pounds should be 48 each.
- Who's short?
- Ok.
"Don't freak, all right?"
We didn't get ripped off.
Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.
"I know he's planning on pulling an all-nighter, so he's probably still in the sack."
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.
Why you gotta be such a hard on?
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.
This only works when they're scared of you.
Jack off.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
"You were after money, the same as i was."
You would've cornered gold if you could've done it.
"I'm broke, too."
I'm right back where i started 10 years ago- right down to my last dollar.
"But i'll get on top, and you'll stay right where you are!"
You belong in the streets!
Get back into the streets!
Get a doctor.
"Yes, sir."
"Take it easy, jim."
The doctor's coming.
You're going to be all right.
Jim!
Jim.
"I'm all right, josie."
"Lie still, jim."
Don't move.
I'll go.
"No, no, no."
"Don't go, luke."
We can't split partners now.
"We're not going to split partners, jim."
"We never have, and we never will."
"Take it easy, boss."
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna pull through.
"Sure, i will."
"You know, it's a great life."
I wouldn't sell this next minute for... for a million dollars.
Nick... i owe you a bet.
So I'll call you later.
"Hey, do you mind..."
"uh, driving me home?"
No yoga?
No.
We missed it.
"Um, yeah."
I guess.
"Ok, when did that start and did you know?"
"Well, I mean, I kind of guessed, but..."
Does she know about... you two?
What's there to know?
Hallie should know better.
Seriously.
Anybody that knows you would know that you are so hot for him.
"Becca, I'm not so hot for him."
No.
He's your friend.
And it is so typical of Hallie.
She's a fame whore.
"No, she's not."
It's...
Damn it.
She is a fame whore.
"No, she's not."
"Oh, God!"
"Hallie, it's just frustrating."
It's so much right now.
She doesn't deserve that.
Hallie was there for me when I had that swine flu.
Every time I've broken up with a quasi boyfriend.
And I don't know what I would've done about that stalker if it wasn't for Hallie.
"I mean, she has to come back, right?"
I don't know.
My mom's... kind of a train wreck.
So's mine.
"Well, I mean, what about your dad?"
Can you call him?
Dad's in jail.
Armed robbery.
"Impressive, huh?"
"My dad, he's, like, a financial planner."
And I think he's in trouble.
I don't have any stock tips.
"He stopped going to the office and these guys keep showing up at the door like cops, but he won't answer."
"Look, I haven't told anybody about it."
I can keep a secret.
Hey!
"Where you at, girl?"
It's time for you to get your buzz on.
"Nolan's so faded, he can't even feel his feet."
There goes the left leg.
"I miss you, babe."
"You know, it's not a party without you."
"Oh, you're sweet."
What's the deal?
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.
"Okay, I'll be there soon."
Say hi to everyone.
Allright.
Love you.
"Love you, too."
Bye.
So how long you been with him?
- And the redhead?
- She's my associate.
You don't fancy her?
None of your business.
What about you?
No girlfriend?
It never works out with girls.
"You're good-looking, you should be popular with the girls."
I'll let you finish.
I'm off to bed.
Catch!
A T-shirt for the night.
"Good thinking, thanks."
- Good night.
Niko?
How's your hand?
That bitch bit through the skin.
You'd better get tested in case she has AIDS...
I'll call you back.
"Hello, Vlad."
How are you?
"Not so good, mate."
Why didn't you tell me a girl tried to run?
"I was going to tell you, but we got her."
Tani took care of her.
We have more pressing matters.
Did you watch the news?
Not yet...
The cops are looking for the football player.
They found his hideout.
Find him and kill him.
I don't want him to talk about us.
Are you?
"If I've got a plan, what is it?"
You tell me.
That's the way to do it!
Is this a test?
Yes.
What will it do to us?
Kill us.
That's the way to do it!
"So, come on then - plan, do I have one?"
I knew straight away.
"No, you didn't."
Course I did.
Show me!
Why should I?
Because we'll be dead in under 30 seconds.
Do I have a plan?
"If we'd been escaping, we'd be climbing down the building."
"If we'd been hiding, we'd be on the other side of the roof."
But we're standing right here.
So?
So!
After you.
After you.
"After you, I'm wearing a dress."
"Eyes front, soldier!"
My eyes are always front!
Mine aren't.
Stop it!
No!
I understand you're the previous governess.
I regret to inform you the position is taken.
And I got my period at a very young age.
"Oh, my God,"
I-I got to get out of here.
I-I can't breathe.
I don't know why I let myself get close.
"Christine, hold on."
I don't want to hear any more jokes.
"Come on, you joke about New Christine all the time."
"Like how she's so dumb, she has to take off her shirt to count to two."
"Or when you killed that moth, and you said she moved up on the brain donor list."
"Well, that's different."
That's funny.
"Anyway, it's not just your lame jokes, Richard."
It's everything.
It's the pancakes and the princess and the periods.
She's not my daughter.
I don't want to be her mother.
I thought you liked Papa Jeff.
I do.
I did.
I-I don't know.
I just...
I've just got to get home.
Wait.
What do I tell people?
I don't know.
Just tell them I got sick.
That was my mother-in-law.
She had to leave.
Her broom was double-parked.
It's funny.
"Oh, I'm glad you're home."
Anybody else?
"No, I don't think so."
Wasn't Bertrand JoyaI with you?
"Yeah, but no..."
Was he there or not?
"He was there in the yard, but he wasn't with us... at the hotel or in the car."
alright.
So when you got there?
He ran away.
And you caught him.
Yeah.
You ran after him?
"Yeah, well Touchy ran, me... with the pick up."
With the pick up?
In the corn?
"Yeah, I've got a bad leg."
So then... you caught him and you brought him back.
What did you do to keep him from running away?
You locked him up?
You aimed the gun at him?
What?
"No, no, we thought that was too dangerous."
Same with locking him up.
We didn't want him to break anything else.
So...
We didn't...
we didn't lock him up.
"In that case, what did you do?"
Did you tie him up?
You tied him up?
You tied him up?
Just like that?
Fine.
It's very viscous.
It's a...
Cab-Merlot blend.
"Okay, okay, okay."
"Bob, do you know what the wine is?"
It is a blend.
But it's a blend of spit.
Because it's from the spit bucket!
What?
He's right.
Bobby wins.
What?
!
"You drank spit, Rick."
You drank a lot of it.
What?
You poured that from the spit bucket?
Why did you do that?
Because I knew Bob would know what it was.
Why would Bob know that?
"Because we went to see Sideways, and after that we went to the wine bar and I bet Bob he wouldn't drink from the spit bucket and he did."
That's disgusting.
And that's how you win a wine-off.
Ah!
Wine fight!
"No, no, no."
Not the jacket.
"Not-not the turtleneck, it's cashmere."
That's for lying on your profile.
I'm sorry.
"Look, I'm a middle-aged man who's just trying to get back out there and..."
Now I plan to mary and settle down.
Good idea.
Have you seen any girl?
"- No, I haven't yet."
But I will.
I see.
You hide from me?
"Tell me, who is she?"
"Hey, there's nobody."
"Don't wory about me, big daddy."
Find a good girl for yourself and settle down.
I did like a girl.
Butthings didn'twork out.
"Come on, you are good at it."
But I am no good.
I get a bit nervous.
- So what?
I'll speak for you.
"- First, speak for yourself."
"Sheetal, these flowers are rosy in colour like you."
But you are looking more red in your anger now.
"Yes, I'm Vijay here."
I was waiting for your call.
Really?
"So, you were sure I'd call you, were you?"
Of course. I have seen a lot of cases like this.
Tell me...
How are you?
May I ask you why you sent me these flowers?
Just to get a call from you.
And just why did you expect a call from me?
Just because I want to meet you.
Trust me.
This is it?
What do we do now?
I don't want anybody getting hurt.
No matter what you see... stay in the car...
until I say.
Okay.
Thank you.
Where's your son?
Where's Jasper?
Look.
This is about me.
I'll do whatever you want.
Just don't go after my son.
You people killed my wife.
Isn't that enough?
A basic rule of covert ops... is let someone else do your dirty work.
Let someone else find the guy you want to kill.
Oh-
It's a great technique... as long as you're not the someone else.
Move!
Move!
Where's your son?
- What?
You come here to kill me and now-
- I'm not here to kill you.
- That woman out there is.
- Who's she?
I need you to stay away from the windows.
- Where is your son?
- He's not here.
I sent him to stay with friends.
"Please, my friend, what is the matter?"
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.
"If you want water, I will get you water."
"No problem, no problem."
I thought you were dead.
You must have switched baskets.
Are you hurt?
No.
"You have to get me out of here, quick."
They're gonna be back at any minute.
Cut me loose.
Quick.
They keep asking about you.
What you know.
What's wrong?
Cut me loose.
"I know where the Ark is, Marion."
The Ark's here?
"I'm coming with you, Jones."
Get me out of here!
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!
"If I take you out of here now, they'll start combing the place for us."
"Jones, you've got to get me out of here!"
"Come on, Jones, are you crazy?"
!
"Marion, I hate to do this, but if you don't sit still and keep quiet, this whole thing is going to be shot."
I'll be back to get you.
"Jones, what's the matter?"
That's it.
Who knows?
"But since you don't have it, I'm gonna need that kiss."
Is...
Something wrong?
Pull her up.
Is she dying?
"She might, I... which is why this is gonna hurt."
You broke her arm!
It'll trigger the healing process.
I still gotta get the venom out.
This is where it's really gonna hurt.
Stiles... you make a good Batman.
You know who it is.
Jackson.
"You just wanted Erica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
But we'll do it on one condition.
"We're gonna catch him, not kill him."
And?
And we do it my way.
"Thank you, Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
Please... you have to tell him.
"It's okay, your baby's fine."
Not...
The baby.
He killed Sean.
"Honey, the police know."
They don't...
They didn't see it.
Every bit of it has been skewed and twisted.
It's Crystal.
She's the one who's done this.
It has to be her.
Hi-yah!
Come on!
Yah!
Hi-yah!
"- That's it, that's all of 'em."
- Close the gate.
"All right, you two, you're finished here."
"It doesn't have to be like this, Matt."
But you don't get to decide that.
I don't want you near those horses again.
Same goes for Will Vernon.
You tell him that.
Let's go.
"We can't let this happen, Ty."
All those beautiful horses.
He's gonna send them to auction.
He's gonna let them die.
"Okay. don't worry about it, all right?"
"We'll figure this out, just one step at a time."
"Amy, look."
At least he's still free.
This isn't over yet.
It's just beginning.
S08E10 The Heart of a River
♪ And at the break of day you sank into your dream ♪
♪ You dreamer
"♪ oh, oh, oh... ♪ You dreamer... ♪ You dreamer..."
It's not fair!
- Where?
I can't see you.
Come down to the beach and walk to the left.
Left?
Towards the inlet?
"Yeah, turn left and straight on."
Hurry up.
"Okay, be right there."
You told him to walk down that way?
"Yes, in the meantime we should go back to our rooms."
It feels so weird.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
I see nobody here.
Keep on walking to the end of the beach.
All the way to the end?
Yeah.
It's so wonderful.
I'm hearing so much about films from Director Kim.
Keep on walking and you'll see us.
"Alright, wait for me."
Okay.
What is it?
A splinter?
I think so.
I'll poke it out where there's light.
"Yeah, thank you."
Let's tell him that I vomited.
That I got a bad stomachache.
And we had to run to the pharmacist so that's why we missed each other.
Are you worried?
"Okay, we'll do as you say."
Excellent.
Hotel Lunik.
What can you do for us?
"Hi, we're with Hannes."
We're supposed to take some photos here.
I have a list of names.
Could you round everyone up?
I'll take care of that.
That'd be great.
"Photos, of all of us?"
With or without the mask?
He likes to wear a mask.
Is that alright?
"No, not at all!"
With the mask!
Alright!
I'll be right back.
Very nice.
"The man in the mask, in the middle."
Everybody a little closer together.
Are you a part of the group?
Why doesn't your boyfriend join us?
Why doesn't your girlfriend join us?
Why don't you both join us?
Come join us!
They can make fools of all of us.
It'll be good for you!
Come on.
I'm just a guest.
This time you're the subject.
"The more people we have, the livelier it will be."
Very nice!
"Well, congratulations, sire."
We have a champion.
Good.
Where is he?
They haven't found him yet.
- Is that good?
- Yes.
That's what makes him a champion.
I see.
"They will find him, won't they?"
- You must be very proud.
"- Proud, you shit?"
Shit!
- Isn't that a great honour?
- Maybe he'll get the honour.
I'll get a dragon's tooth up my bum and a shilling-a-year pension.
I'll have to sit vigil with him all night as well.
"Christ, what luck!"
I promised my body to a woman tonight.
Maybe I could go and tell the lady that...
Wait a minute.
Maybe you could do it.
Certainly I could.
I'll tell the lady...
"- No, no, not that."
Sit the vigil.
- Me?
"I could give you my hat, my cape."
Just keep your head down.
He'll never know.
- I can't do that.
It's not right.
On the double!
"Well, at least the search is on."
- Is that everyone?
- One more.
Stiller.
He's bringing the mail from Pasco.
He knows to keep his eyes open.
Got about two hours of light left.
What a mess.
Then let's go down the cliff.
- Why do you do that?
"- We can't make it, that's why."
Those wolves are gonna hang around.
"Anyway, we were dead the minute the engine quit."
- I didn't wanna say anything.
- Why talk that way?
- It's the truth.
- It ain't.
It's what you think'll happen.
- You made a snare and shot a rabbit.
- So what?
I'd rather be trying things than sitting on my butt.
All right.
All right.
Let's go if we're going.
Take what you need.
I was thinking more like a couple of sweaters.
See?
I told you I grew up with boys.
Jesus.
- Do you live by yourself?
"- Yeah, that's right."
It's amazing.
- You serious?
Oh you can get that.
"Oh no, it's OK."
But you can get that.
Sorry.
Oh it's Hallie.
Just 2 seconds.
Hey!
Um yeah I'm still here.
Um sure that's fine.
"Wait, you didn't really just do what I think you just did, did you?"
Because I kind of had plans to just spend the night with you.
Um she's outside.
How did she get my address?
"I don't know, not from me."
Hello...
Door's open.
Hi.
Dale said she was coming by to shoot the band so I thought I'd surprise you.
Hey.
- Hey.
We actually finished a couple of hours ago but um...
Really?
Why don't you sit back down.
You're not...
Yeah you know I'm sorry I'm lame but I have to work in the morning so...
You should see the show she's casting it is so funny.
"Look you could stay, have another beer."
Oh I'm sure we'll do it some other time.
I'll see you guys later.
Just one second.
It's me.
"I'm going, and I'm not gonna fail."
- You're new here.
- It's about getting back to Henry.
I don't care what I have to face.
You're not gonna argue with me?
Would it do any good?
No.
Anything in that bag that's gonna help me with a giant?
A hook.
Hey.
Come with me.
This...
Powder made from poppies.
He has to inhale it.
Your sword... how strong is it?
The most powerful blade in all the realms.
Is it strong enough to cut through that beanstalk?
Indeed.
Give me ten hours.
"If I'm not back, you cut it down and keep going."
Snow won't like that.
That's why I'm asking you.
"If I don't get back, you get her home."
(Hook) Ladies.
"In this world, we are slaves to time."
And ours is running out.
"In other words, ticktock."
(Zips sleeve)
I was hoping it'd be you.
Just get on with it.
Put your hand right here.
Who is it?
It's Mickey Mouse.
What does he want?
He's come to say good-bye.
What are you waiting for?
I'm a cop.
I don't shoot people in the back.
Another way we're the same.
"No, we're not the same!"
"I uphold the law, and you break it!"
Chang died because ofyou.
I swore I'd get you this time.
"I'm sorry, but I won't let you lock me up."
"Ifyou must take revenge foryour friend, shoot me now."
Don't force me to kill you!
- You'd really kill me?
- I won't let you go this time.
Go ahead.
You can't win all the time.
"Jeffrey, where are you?"
Where is he?
Right in front ofyou.
- Don't take him away.
-Jenny!
Jeffrey's promised me he'll never kill again.
Put that gun down.
"Jenny, put that gun down."
Not unless he leaves us alone.
"I beg you, please, let us go."
I'll never let you arrest him!
Did I kill him?
ls he dead?
"Hey, come on."
Get that out of here.
Come on.
"- Jim, Butch, Mac, where you going?"
- Get out of here.
- Get out or we'll give it to you too.
- What are you trying to do?
Go to the pen?
You can't get away with this.
Go back there and put out that fire.
- We're gonna finish the job.
- You're playing into Thompson's hands.
- He'll hang you for this.
- Thompson's dead.
Thompson's dead?
"- Yeah, we took care of him."
"- Listen, kids, you gotta stop where you are."
Whatever you do will be another rap to beat.
I wouldn't give you a bum steer.
I'm in as bad a fix as you are.
- You think I ran out on you?
I didn't.
"- Sure, you ran out."
You ran.
Go on.
I didn't.
I meant to come back the day after I left.
I got into a fight and shot a rat.
I think I killed him.
I'm on the lam now.
"If they get me, it may mean the chair."
- What do you get for--?
You're trouble you know that Cece.
What afraid you're going to fall in love?
OK you have got to stop it with the winks.
She winks?
All the time.
Becca is a winker.
Becca's a wanker?
"No not a wanker, a winker."
She winks.
I only do it to guys I think are cute Ok?
It's for this movie I'm doing it's a character role.
So what are you guys doing afterwards?
Ah home.
I've got to work early in the morning.
"Whoa, whoa lame excuse."
Excuse me can we get six tequila shots please?
Top shelf?
- Yeah.
"Oh no, no that is trouble."
I puke.
I'll clean it up.
Ah count yourself lucky you even got he out.
She's always in bed by 10PM.
Just this one night.
Ah I would but I really should go.
Me either.
I have an interview with a wedding planner in the morning.
I have an audition at nine.
I have casting.
I'm free.
I'll stay.
Ok well I'll let you off the hook this one time OK.
Nice.
Where'd you get these things?
- How do I look?
First I gotta know where you got 'em.
I see.
You'd rather look like a tramp than accept something from me.
Take 'em back where you got 'em.
Got that?
Then maybe I should just leave too.
Maybe you should.
"Where'd you get these things, Cilly?"
A girl gave them to me.
I won't ―
I'm telling you:
Watch your step.
"Don't be angry, Franzie."
"None of us are angels, are we?"
Enough!
Let's get down to the bar!
- You really mean it?
- Why not?
Stop pestering it all the time!
And you get out of here with that cigar!
The air's bad enough.
You're nuts!
They've never been in a cage.
They don't understand.
So what's the story?
He wouldn't take the clothes.
"Well, I want Biberkopf, and that's that."
"Well, I won't help."
"I want him, and that's that."
"No, look!"
He's breathing.
He's so beautiful.

She had the most beautiful voice.
"Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed a bit too much seawater."
Off we go.
"Come along, Max."
We just gonna forget this whole thing ever happened.

Or through the rear window if you're brave enough to turn round.
It's so big!
We've passed the single tree.
And loads of others.
Two more up there. lt's beautiful!
I said we're reaching two single trees.
It would help if we could ask someone.
"Don't worry, we'll find someone."
We can ask them.
Slow down a bit.
- We may not find anyone.
- We will.
"This is farmland, they're out working."
We have to ask.
"Don't worry, we'll find someone."
I can see a black spot in the distance.
Over there.
He can't hear us.
"Wait, I'll go and ask him."
Ask that one.
Ask her.
"Hello, ma'am."
"Hello, I'm honoured."
How do we get to Siah Dareh?
"200 yards after the junction, turn left."
Thank you.
Good-bye.
"Look, it's behind the hill."
Wait till we pass that tree.
Look into the distance.
On the hill.
- Siah Dareh's over there?
"No, I'm good."
All right.
Don't got to worry about me.
"You say you're okay, I take your word for it."
Medical suspensions?
[Chuckles]
"That's for the fucking nanny state, and I don't play that bullshit."
But do me a favor.
Put the glasses back on.
You're giving me a fucking headache.
"So, what's the deal?"
You got a spot on this card for me or what?
I can find a spot for you.
It's in Fresno.
It's only a week out.
It's not a problem.
Okay.
- Who's the guy?
- Local kid named Vargas.
He's aggressive.
"Not a lot of skill, but he's a tough motherfucker."
- 155?
- Ish.
"If either one of you's a few pounds over,"
I'm not gonna dock you.
I'll make it.
Even better.
"Unfortunately, though, not a lot of money."
I just want the fight.
All right.
It's a deal.
I'm excited.
I swear.
- All right.
I'm looking forward to it.
"All right, I got news."
You ready?
- Gary Fogel had cancer.
"- Oh, yeah, I knew."
- You knew?
How did you know?
- He told me a few months ago.
Why did he tell you and not me?
- I don't know.
- How are you closer to him than me?
- So is he okay?
"- Oh, yeah, he's fine."
"He was in bad shape for a while, though."
Really?
How bad?
Was he on his deathbed?
"No, he was on his regular bed."
So why didn't you tell me?
- He swore me to secrecy.
- So?
It's not like you're my wife.
I still think you should've told me.
You were better off not knowing.
It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this.
I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
I'm gonna talk to him about this.
That's right.
You let him have it.
Who is he not to tell you about his life- threatening illness?
Because I told you to.
You get up so early.
I have to stop that.
I really shouldn't walk around here like this.
I can't find that red blouse that you bought me. I wanted to wear it.
- The one time I need tape.
- l put it in the wash.
There is tape.
It's in the drawer like always.
- l wanted to wear it.
"- We'll put it in the dryer, sweetie."
"- Oh, my God."
- [Lily] What?
They're pink.
Those were in the washer?
- Yeah. I put them in last night.
"- Oh, my God."
I don't think you're supposed to mix colors and khaki stuff.
Are you?
How do I make them not pink?
I don't think you can.
- Sorry.
"- l think they're cool, actually."
- You don't have to wear them.
- Why did you put them in?
I think Atlantor would appreciate seeing a different side of Rick.
The pinker side.
I don't have to take this abuse.
I'm out of here.
I hope not in those pants.
- Fade-away jump!
- Jess.
"- Of course, who else?"
- You must be making a lot of money.
But your dad could've paid for it.
"Come on, I fend for myself now."
"By the way, how did you two meet?"
"Well, I worked on a student film way back."
I built a set for them.
And she did the music.
"Oh, so that's how you met."
"Like me, she's an avid fan of yours."
Really?
Have you lost your mind?
Are you nuts?
"By the way, I'm Kim Moonsook."
Nice to meet you.
- So you do music?
"- Yes, it's nothing really."
Her music is great!
How do you like this music?
I brought this CD for you.
What?
Is this her music?
"Yes, isn't it nice?"
She's mainly a composer.
She made this to use as a demo for her singing debut.
Very nice.
This is a bit mainstream.
I also have some weird stuff.
Want to hear it?
"No, it's nice."
Let's listen to this first.
I really like this one.
New shoes?
Have you jogged in them yet?
Judging by your rash.
"No, you haven't."
No cream residue.
"You've been scratching, right?"
"It's itchy, doc."
"So I have to scratch it, right?"
"If I scratch, my itch will go away, right?"
Wrong!
"The more you scratch, the itchier you get."
The more your lesions will get worse.
"And the bedtime pill, you didn't take either, right?"
"If I didn't take them, you can tell?"
No.
But based on what you just said.
I know you didn't.
And how is your penis?
"Doc, you don't miss a thing, do you?"
I'm really upset.
What you ask is too hard.
It's like asking me to become a monk.
This...
Who sleeps at 9PM anyways?
"In my profession, it's impossible."
What I am asking you to do isn't hard.
It is hard.
Do you sleep at 9PM?
Or you work 24 hours?
Yes.
No weekends off?
Nope.
- Empty your pockets.
"- Hey, meth-head."
Are you listening to me?
We don't have any money.
"Do it, or I will kill you both."
"Okay, here you go."
Look.
Empty.
- Now you.
- I don't have anything.
- Do it.
- I don't have...
- Just empty your pockets.
- No.
I'm not emptying 'em.
I'm not even gonna...
I don't feel like standing in this alley all night.
- It's a matter of principle.
- A matter of principle?
- I don't feel like standing in an alley with a meth-head.
"- I'm gonna stab you, man!"
"- For the love of God, empty your pockets."
- Okay.
- What the hell is that?
- Give it to me.
You give us a second.
Where did you get that money?
I had to change the bet... a little.
- You bet against me?
- I bet against you.
- Why would you bet against me?
- It was the right move.
Clap on!
"I said, the plate."
...that you're holding.
Get out!
This home is temple for us!
Right?
"You're right, sir."
Go on... don't mind this!
Go away!
Let me not see you around again!
"Thanks, Laxmi."
You have awakened us today.
I wonder how many thieves we have at home!
"She'll play Alibaba and drive away the thieves, grandpa."
"I threw her out of the gate, sir!"
"I'd throw her out of town, if I could."
I'll find another maid in a couple of days.
Why a maid?
Why not a male?
We can find a good cook.
"With a maid around, maybe..."
"You win, aunt!"
A male would be perfect.
I'll find a cook soon.
That's okay.
What do we eat till then?
I'll cook.
I did it for 5 years in my house.
No thank you.
You people have been flesh-eaters!
"You must help her, Laxmi."
I can't stand the smell of flesh in this house!
"Come on and get this boat out to sea, you lazy lots!"
"All right, all right."
You'll be kissing the gunner's daughter before too long.
Get her out to sea while the tide's still with us.
"One, two, heave!"
"Come on, boys!"
"One, two, heave!"
"One, two, heave!"
Secure the camp.
I've got a score to settle.
We have all had our fill of Jacob Moore.
So I'm seizing the ship and taking command.
Stow the prisoners below.
Prepare to set sail.
You're abandoning Moore?
That I am.
Weigh anchor!
Up sheets!
Hands to the jeers!
"Aye, Captain."
Stow the prisoners.
Let's get clear of this godforsaken place.
Let's go!
Come on.
We need to drink.
Please.
Make it quick.
What are you doing?
It will keep you cool.
We are being pursued.
Let us go.
Now!
Maddy!
"I can't believe you are doing this, Maddy!"
I didn't bring you here so you could catch it.
"Shannon, relax."
This is for our safety.
You said The Beast is killing animals.
It could easily turn on us if it isn't contained.
"So, what?"
Then you're going to let it go?
"I'm not in the business of caging wild animals, no matter how unusual."
"We put it in here to get a closer look, that's all."
That's cool with me.
That thing has some serious fangs.
Shan.
OK.
I'm sorry.
It's just... it just got real all of a sudden.
"That's why I'm here, Shannon."
To show the world The Beast is real.
OK?
OK.
They'll kill us.
What are you going to say to them?
I don't know but I don't think sorry's going to cut it.
We could go back.
Do you want to?
Look.
Put it on me.
Tell them I made you do it.
"Thanks, but I'll take the blame."
I've earned it.
It's starting.
Not so soon.
How about tomorrow?
Let me tell you something.
"No need, just drop me a line."
Some chick is crazy about me.
I'm irresistible!
That's a good joke.
"Very funny indeed, good night!"
You are jealous.
"Guess, who's come to find me?"
The boss's fiancee
B.?
"How dare you call her B., only I can."
She calls me Robin darling too!
Robin darling?
Are you kidding?
"She's so sexy, she even tried to seduce me."
Tore everything off to rush and take a shower...
You mean her?
Me of course!
But she told me to do so.
Do you get it?
But it's very clear what she wanted to do.
Why is she lying on your bed?
I haven't done anything yet!
How dare you steal my first girlfriend?
I didn't.
Don't deny it.
This is the end of our friendship!
Did you go and visit him?
Yes I did!
Did you tell him to take a shower?
- What are you two up to?
"Nothing, God, don't be such a paranoid freak."
"Party time, princess."
It's time for us to say goodbye.
Like hell.
"We made a deal, Karp."
- Liana's coming.
- She's... she's coming here?
It's a family reunion.
And I'm off to one of my own.
"Farewell, my sweet."
Your generosity will not be forgotten.
It was just an accident.
Motorcycles don't have seat belts.
You could have died.
"If you had died, I'd be alone."
"You wouldn't be Flynn, you'd just be dead."
"Emme, I said I'm sorry."
What else do you want me to say?
Huh?
"He's fine, he's fine, he's fine, he's fine."
"How are you holding up, Emme?"
Holding what up?
How are you doing with Flynn being hurt?
I'm fine.
He's not going to die.
Did my counselor leave?
"She'll be here in a few minutes, take you back home."
You mean school.
This is my home.
"Yeah, of course it is."
I'm gonna go look for Haydn.
Have you had a nice day?
"Oh, what's this ***"
"Thank you, Nana."
It's so good to be here with you.
This place is so so acceptable.
Aha!
I got it.
I got the job!
We can definitely move out.
"Yeah, I know."
"I know, I was pretty speechless myself at first, but then I thought ""Hey, come on!"
"You know this was just a matter of time."""
I am...
a manager.
Right.
"Well, this is calls for a celebration."
Let's see.
"Would you like a go, Samuel?"
"No, ma-maybe not go too mad."
So we're going to have to throw ourselves into the house hunting.
"You'll be good at that, eh, Becky?"
"Well, not too far away I hope."
"We'll still be seeing you, won't we?"
Yeah.
"I mean yeah, of course."
You'll come to Sunday lunch?
Yeah.
"Yeah, when we can."
Alright.
I've not been on Facebook for four and a half months.
It is time for a status update methinks.
"Won't be strange, dear?"
I'm so hungry.
"I thought there was a cracker, or like some fruit left or some shit."
I don't know.
Put that away.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Are you here to hurt me?
No no no.
No no.
"No no, we don't wanna hurt you."
Okay.
Not at all.
I'm sorry about him.
Yeah.
"We're robbers, and we're stuck down here with you."
You're robbers?
Yeah.
You don't make any sense.
We were pulling a heist.
I'm the leader.
He's part of my crew.
"Yeah, don't, don't judge us on our rugged exterior."
Find anything yet?
Nothing.
I think we just should have sent that text.
"Look, it was a good plan, okay."
"We found the jammer, we killed it, we could have gotten a phone call out."
So no one knows that you're here?
No.
Wait a minute.
Why would you rob this place?
"We, we thought it was legit."
There was no one here.
So you've got a bodyguard.
But it can't be you.
"Yes, it's me."
"That seems funny, doesn't it... you and the 12 temptations?"
Sure.
I laughed my head off.
"Well, here i am."
"Well, now, that's just fine."
Let me see.
You can... you can go to the photograph gallery with me.
What?
I have an appointment there at 4:00.
That... that's-that's- that's-just a minute.
One second.
Just a little more light.
"Ah, that's fine."
"Oh, the hands... just put the hands out over on that."
Just relax a little bit.
Give me a little smile.
That's right.
"Hold it just like that, and i'll take one more look."
Oh... i've got it.
"Oh, that is beautiful!"
"Oh, that's so exquisite!"
Ain't you think she looks just like a...
like a... ain't you think so?
Maybe you can see something through that thing that i can't see.
"Well, go ahead."
"Look, look!"
"Oh, so soft... hey, you can't take this."
It's upside down.
"Oh, no."
One more time.
"Okay, on this part ?"
"It's like we're battling, right ?"
It's like a challenge.
"When I step forward like this, you have to challenge me back into my space, and I challenge you back in your space, like this."
"So, it's back, front, back, front, back, front, like that, that kinda feel."
"Step, back, forth, back."
"Wait, wait."
You're making me dizzy.
"Stop, stop."
"Sit on it, sit on it."
Stick your ass out.
- Do it.
- [ Both Laugh ]
"Okay, okay."
How am I doing ?
How's my butt ?
"[ Chuckles ] lt's nice. I mean, it's good."
Thank you.
[Sara] You made that ?
It's really nice.
It's Tanisha's.
That girl's gonna pay my way through design school.
What about your mom ?
Where is she ?
She was in jail...
for drugs.
For things women do for drugs.
She got out and took off.
"Well, maybe she'll come back."
"That is what Derek used to say when we were little, when Momma Dean used to piss us off."
But he grew up.
Where's Cutter?
"Din, where is Sgt. Cutter?"
- They catch him.
- What's that?
Who?
"In the gold temple, they catch Sgt. Cutter."
Who's they?
Priests or what?
Very bad men.
They'll give him torture.
"Go help, quick."
- How many men?
- Don't know.
- I run away quick to bring help.
- I'll bet you ran away quick.
"And you'll run back just as quick, too."
Show me the way.
- I'll pick a dozen men.
- You'll pick nothing!
I'm going alone.
You haven't a chance.
I'm not killing Cutter by riding in with a troop.
They'll cut him up if we have a rescue party.
- Right.
We'll go together.
- No.
"Tommy, what's the matter?"
"Cutter got himself into a mess, and Mac and I are going to get him out."
"Don't worry, I'm not taking him."
I'm going as a sergeant in Her Majesty's service.
- I'm not taking any civilians with me.
- Who's a civilian?
"Honest, that night, when you walked out of my place I made as if I didn't care."
I did care.
"After you'd gone, I kept wishing you'd come back."
"Truly, I did."
"This man, Hyde, will never trouble you again."
I give you my word.
How do you know?
He'll come back!
He'll come back and kill me!
No.
He won't come back.
I'll see to it.
"Oh, you don't know him, sir."
"Oh, you don't know him."
"He ain't human, he ain't!"
I gave you my word.
You'll never see Hyde again.
You must believe me.
"I believe you, sir."
I believe you.
You must go now.
"Yes, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"For a moment, I thought..."
Goodbye.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have admitted such a person."
I didn't know she was hysterical.
That's all right.
I'm glad you admitted her.
"Now, about the wedding, we've got a lot to discuss."
- We've never been married before.
- Let's not get upset.
"- No, you're right, and I don't."
"That doesn't mean I feel that way now, though."
"No, now you feel guilty."
You're still scared.
You're just scared of what I'll do to you.
"Well, that's true."
- You were really terrified?
"- Jenna, I am terrified."
"So am I, you idiot."
"I'm scared I'm gonna be a bad mother, and you won't love me, and you'll ignore me, and..."
"I won't want you, and the whole thing will fall apart and I won't know what to do."
"- Baby, that's not gonna happen."
- How do you know?
Because I know.
"- You know now, you didn't know before?"
- Yes.
I know now.
Were you telling me the truth last night?
You didn't sleep with her?
I was telling you the truth.
But then I went back.
Fuck you!
Jenna.
Calm down!
Listen to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
- Get the fuck out!
- I'm telling you the truth!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
"It's okay, Pete."
"- I can't come, Abb."
He won't-- He won't let me leave here.
I can't just leave.
He doesn't let me do anything.
"Yeah, well, it's-"
"- That's easy for you to say, Abby, all right?"
I will come and see you tomorrow.
"And we'll talk about it, okay?"
Wha-
- Why?
"Becau-- Yeah, because he's my husband."
That is my fault and I can't do anything about that.
"No, do not come here, I'm telling you, that's gonna make things worse."
"Yeah, I know, I know."
"I know, I know."
I-
- I don't know what to do.
I don't know--
"I don't know what to do, can't do this anymore."
I just want to die every day.
I can't.
"No, do not-- I can't, I can't, Abby."
Don't do that.
"I'm telling you, don't come here."
Just tell me that--
That you love me and that it's gonna be okay.
"I know, but just say it anyway, will you, honey, please?"
"Iâm dying over here, I need you."
I don't need you like that.
Why can't I?
Why can't I?
Chris makes me happy.
That's it.
I'm not taking it.
Okay.
All right.
"Nice, y'all!"
That's the way!
That's the way!
Good teamwork!
You all need to call it!
"Watch that hole in the center, okay?"
You all need to pick that up.
"Hey, time out!"
Time out.
"It's looking great, girls."
They're double blocking me every time.
That's okay.
"No, they've figured out our move."
"No, they did not."
"Now, don't you act like this is luck."
This is not luck.
You all are doing a great job.
We are kind of lucky 'cause their star hitter's out sick.
TAMl:
"No, you all are playing a great game."
You're playing a great game.
I want you to keep it up.
"I want you to keep it simple and remember, you are playing this game and you are winning this game because of your teamwork."
You are a team.
You work together.
"And you, you just focus on that Riggins."
You slam it down his throat.
- Here.
"- God, that stinks."
"Yeah, but it's gonna keep your face from swelling up like a pumpkin."
Hold it.
Here.
Hold it on there.
"So, whatcha gonna do ?"
It's payback time.
Either you down or you not.
Either you my boy or you ain't.
Simple as that.
"Oh, ha !"
"Hey, baby, we lit it up out there."
I am serious.
"Did you see us, ""D"" man ?"
Do you see us ?
We're talking.
Anyway.
"Hey, baby, we lit it up."
"- Oh, man, come on, man !"
"- That shit ain't funny, man."
- You damn right it ain't funny.
- l thought you liked it down there.
"That's your specialty, ain't it ?"
Crawling on the floor like a bitch.
That was a reflex action in the heat ofthe moment.
You're just plain rude and wrong to bring that shit up in mixed company.
- l'm gonna go home.
Are you ready ?
"- No, he's not ready."
He's talking to me.
"It's an ""A"" and ""B"" conversation."
Any place that has this turf needs to be closed and searched.
"Yes, mom."
We're all over it.
Watch your step out there.
"Yeah, you too, Tanner."
Hauser was so sure of himself.
He was even more of a jerk than usual.
You gonna rub it in?
Tell me that you're still at the park.
"Oh, yeah, I am, but Petty's not."
Stay there.
He could still show up.
Where the hell are you?
"Till you hear back from me, do not move."
Petty.
You know me?
A friend of mine did.
Give me your hands.
You probably won't want to move now.
Now give me your gun and your phone.
I've never been on a stakeout before.
This isn't a stakeout.
It's a waste of time.
Hauser say why he thought Petty was coming here?
"Well, transparency isn't one of Hauser's strong suits."
I just pictured him in a transparent suit.
It's pretty gross.
Shh.
Drop the knife.
"Get on the ground, face down."
You with the guy in the suit?
You are.
"Ain't no problem at all, Sheriff."
Anything I can do to help.
It's working.
Come on.
"Are you all right, hon?"
Did he hurt you?
"I'm sorry, look..."
"The sheriff's upstairs, all right."
We have to warn him.
I need you to help me open the door.
Can you do that?
Okay.
I'm gonna hook this out through the door.
Okay.
"Then you turn it on, all right."
"Catch you a cup of coffee, Sheriff?"
Homemade iced tea?
"No, thank you."
I'm sorry.
How long did you say you lived here?
I didn't.
"Well, how long?"
Long time.
And not a lot of decorations in this nice house.
"No, never had that for that kind of thing."
Is that right?
"Well, my wife Betty, she..."
She took care of all that stuff before she passed on.
"Nothing quite like a woman's touch, huh."
My wife died just last year.
"Well, my condolences, Sheriff."
Suppose it'll get better with time.
"""I am ruined."
"I am beaten."""

Let's go after him.
"No, you stay here."
Put your hands up!
Put 'em up!
I only got one arm.
What do you want?
Put that down.
What do you want from me?
I want to let bygones be bygones.
I'm not falling for that.
"I lost an arm, but otherwise I'm fine."
And?
And nothing.
Tell me what you want!
I want to let bygones be bygones.
Maybe you don't believe me.
My arm's gone.
It ain't gonna grow back.
But here I am.
So it's money you want?
Money?
"Yeah, I want to make money with you guys, work with you guys."
"I thought I could take the respectable route, but I was a real dope."
So here I am.
What else can I do?
Be an organ grinder?
"No, I'd rather steal."
I did everything I could.
"But that's over and done with, even if it costs me my neck."
- So this is your latest idea?
"- No, no, no!"
I did everything I could!
Bless you.
Don't be afraid.
He's a friend.
I need you to take them to the treehouse.
But he's a savage!
"Far from it, madam."
He's my best friend and he's your salvation.
And where are you going?
I've got to find a way onto that boat.
You'll be fine.
"Come on and get this boat out to sea, you lazy lot!"
"All right, all right!"
You'll be kissing the daughter before too long!
We're off to sea while the tide's still with us!
"One, two, heave!"
"Come on, boys!"
"One, two, heave!"
"One, two, heave!"
Secure the camp.
I've got a score to settle.
- We've all had our fill of jacob moore.
- I know.
So I'm ceasing this ship and taking command.
Stow the prisoners below!
Prepare to set sail.
You're abandoning moore?
That I am.
Weigh anchor!
Hub sheets!
Hands to the jeers!
- Stow the prisoners!
"- Aye-aye, sir!"
That's it.
Give me that.
You can have it.
There you go.
Thank you.
"Well, we should probably go to the bedroom and..."
start clearing stuff out of there.
Right.
Yes.
This is weird.
And this is really weird.
Who's this?
- I don't know.
- How could there be a photo of my dad with his arm around this woman... on his nightstand and I don't even know who she is.
Maybe she's an old friend.
"Nah, she's gotta be a new friend."
This was taken at the Wynn.
The Wynn didn't open until just before he died.
Then maybe she's a new friend.
Why wouldn't he tell me about her?
I know.
It's because I didn't call him often enough.
I wasn't gonna say that.
All right.
Let's hit the closet.
Yeah.
We did it.
What did we do?
It took a lot of people.
"It took a lot of man-hours, but we checked everyone that came into the casino between noon and 3:00."
You want to guess how many people that is?
No.
Please don't make me do that.
"Come on, you're a guy."
You do this kind of thing all the time.
What do I do?
I don't know.
Just act sexy.
I can act sexy.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm acting sexy.
Looks like you're trying to get a cobra out of a basket.
"Hey, this move killed for me in the '80s."
That's great.
"If a Duran Duran concert suddenly breaks out, you'll be set."
"All right, I got it, I got it."
Here goes.
Hi.
My name is Christine Campbell.
"I'm divorced, but I get along great with my ex-husband."
We're just better as friends.
"Anyway, I'm not crazy."
I'm very stable.
"In fact, I own my own gym."
It's one of those 30-minute workout places for women.
"I make decent money, though."
But most of it goes to my son's private school.
But I'm not a snob.
I'm very down to earth.
I just want what's best for my son.
"His name is Ritchie, we live in Mar Vista."
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Way to play it cool.
"Die, asshole."
"Oh, Ilia, that feels good."
Then I'll make you feel even better.
"Ilia, can't we have sex today?"
You know it's against the rules.
"If we do it, I'd be fired."
Then I wouldn't be able to see you anymore.
"I don't want that, but..."
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
Feel good?
Feel good?
Feel good?
I'm gonna come!
"Come, I'm coming too!"
I'm coming!
Ilia.
It's perfume.
I hope you like it.
"I've been with lots of delivery girls, but no one's been as genuine as you."
Service tells you a lot about a girl.
"If you don't mind, will you go out with me?"
I'm sorry.
Of course...
"I'm an idiot, what was I thinking?"
I'm going home to Korea.
I can't take this.
"No, please take it."
"It's my first gift to a girl, ever."
"I talked with the clerk, wondering what you'd like."
"That itself was fun, my heart was bouncing."
My heart was bouncing.
"I ought to pay your fee, oughtn't I?"
I haven't presented you with a bill yet.
How about this to begin with?
Not that it's enough.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's much more than most people pay.
It doesn't seem near enough to me.
"Harry, listen..."
"Oh, sorry."
"Come along, will you?"
It's getting late.
Well...
But...
But you aren't really going just because he says?
"No, no, no."
But I have to go now.
But look here.
Don't you understand?
I ain't no...
I ain't no...
"No, I know you're not."
You're a girl with her heart just where it ought to be.
Maybe a little too generous.
"Because you're a nice, pretty girl, next time be more careful about the company you pick, huh?"
"Well, but..."
"But you are here, ain't you?"
"Yes, but I shouldn't be."
"And if you really knew me, you'd know I don't wanna be."
"Well, I..."
I picks only them as wants my company.
- I'm sorry.
Why?
I guess there were some complaints that your eyes were more interesting to watch than the lead performance.
Ohh.
"I'm really sorry, honey."
"Oh, it stinks."
"(Sighs) Oh, my God."
I can't believe we're not in the play.
"Uh, yeah, well..."
That's not exactly true.
So we are doing the play?
"No, we're not."
So we're off the play.
"No, no."
That's not it.
So we're on the play.
- We're not.
- We're not?
Right.
We're not.
What?
Your mom's in.
You're out.
Just say it.
"Thank you, Mike."
I was getting there!
What?
"But you're gonna quit, right?"
"Well, quitting is certainly something that I could do, although I am the strongest voice of all the Ozians... (Sighs) And it is for charity, but if you really want me to quit, then I--"
I want you to quit.
"Okay, well, let's not jump into any rash decisions."
"Just sleep on it, and if you still want me to quit in the morning, I will."
I want you to quit.
"You'll have to be patient, I'm afraid."
We have the situation under control... but there might be some damage to the skull and brain.
"We have to do a CT-scan, but we can't do it here."
And we can't get a helicopter in weather like this.
Can't you drive her there?
It's too much of a risk.
Her condition is critical.
We might lose her then.
Lose her?
A coma.
"What's a coma, Dad?"
Go home and get some sleep.
There's nothing you can do here.
It was...
It was like a snake.
Shaped like a snake.
Pardon?
Has he been treated yet?
"No, I'm OK."
It's nothing.
Come on.
"Hello, sweetheart."
I just can't get you out of my mind.
I miss you.
Really.
Do you actually love me?
Then come over here right now.
"I'll undress you, you'll undress me..."
- Why don't you answer?
- Hello?
- It's me.
What are you doing?
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?
This guy didn't want to give you the check.
Could you take care of this?
No problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.
that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order
Sonny.
like I'm a deadbeat.
You're a mutt.
You know the money we spend in this fucking
Don't be like that.
Like what?
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!
You don't want to bring the check?
Do you believe this prick?
too.
You're a funny guy.
Henry!
You want to laugh?
This prick asked me to christen his kid.
000.
You really are a funny guy.
I'm worried.
I'm hearing bad things.
I don't even know where to start.
So that's why I left.
That's why I went on this trip.
"Just to get away and make, you know, all the memories that I can... while I can."
And I know I gotta talk to her and I gotta just...
But not on this.
"You know, I just..."
I'll deal with it.
"I'll deal with it when I get back, you know."
I'll just...
"You're a good guy, Cooper."
Call your mum.
"Zero, zero, one, nine, three, nine, two, nine."
"No, I did not buy a pair of sandals in Koh Samui last night because I'm in..."
And how long does that take?
Because I need to buy a ticket back to America.
"Oh, my God."
Mm-hmm.
"Can I just say, this is the most blatant cover story for a second hook-up ever?"
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, my God."
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
Alright.
Don't forget your bag.
"The bag, yep, my bag."
Alright.
You are a top bird.
"I don't know what that means, but I heard somebody say it once, and you're it."
I got a plan.
Yeah.
It's odd jobs.
Okay.
The first letter's a B.
A. It's an A.
I think it's gonna tell us who A is.
D?
B-A-D.
Bad.
That's the whole message?
Bad?
- What's it supposed to mean?
- It means you got punked.
Toby doesn't trust us.
I don't blame him.
I don't think he'd mess with us like this.
You'd be surprised what people are capable of.
"Guys, we have to figure this out."
"This might be a joke, but it could be real."
"Look, either way, Toby's not the enemy."
"You know what, guys?"
I'm gonna go.
What was that all about?
How should I know?
Doesn't look like very much.
"Well, it's all we have."
The rest is gone.
"Mom, Mrs. Potter doesn't need that money anymore."
"No, but we can't keep it."
"No, not keep it but I don't know, maybe we could give it to somebody who needs it."
I love you for thinking that but I just want this nightmare to be over.
I'm putting the money back in the safe deposit box.
What is left of it.
- I'll see you tonight.
Put mother on.
I have to talk to her.
"Listen, firstly I'm sorry."
"Then, my condolences."
"If someone asks for me, say you couldn't reach me."
They don't know I've hired a cell-phone.
I'll be back for the seventh day of mourning.
I promise I'll be there.
Don't talk to me like that.
This is the wrong time.
All right. ls there anything else?
Take care.
Hello.
Hello.
Why aren't you singing now?
You sing so well.
"Go on, keep singing."
I dare not.
But why?
You're down there and I'm here.
We can't look each other in the eye.
I can't see you.
I can see you.
What are you doing down there?
I'm digging a well.
You don't dig wells on hills.
- l'm digging a ditch.
- Why a ditch?
For telecommunications.
Why are you alone?
Working alone makes things simple.
"It's good, you don't have a boss."
"We came this far by faith, Lord."
"And we ask you, Father, when he get in college, Lord... to keep him, Lord- keep him protected."
"We thank you for him,Jesus."
- In Jesus' name we pray.
Amen.
- Amen.
"Oh,you can cry like a river, girl."
"You're crying so bad, I won't even make fun of you."
"Oh, God."
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.
"I want you to be good, okay?"
"And don't, uh, get mixed up in none of that old stuff that, uh, you know."
I done told you what to do.
"Don't get no alcohol, no wine coolers."
None of that stuff.
Bye-bye.
I just hope he stay in there.
That's what worries me most.
"Once he get in the door, I want him to stay in there for four years."
Think he gonna make it?
You do?
I think he gonna make it.
"Well, I hope so anyway."
When I was young
"- When I was little, that's all I used to think about- the NBA."
"If I set my mind, I can"
- I can go.
I can st
- I can go.
Get in good college.
I can go.
I'll call you tonight.
"Won't you sit down, Miss Kelly?"
My money do all this?
"Yes, your money and my brains."
Except that it wasn't your money.
You stole it from me.
To steal from a thief is no crime.
"Look, I'm broke because of you."
"Well, how would you like a job?"
Doing what?
Working for me.
I could use a pretty thief in my business.
I'd wind up in jail.
Not my way you wouldn't.
Yours for sure.
I'd be no use to you.
I'm not really a thief.
I saw you pull a little job.
"Small stuff, but it showed promise."
The wallet dropped on the floor.
I was tempted.
I was broke.
I never dreamed of picking up that wallet would end that way for Chuck.
He tried to kill me.
He loved me.
He was just trying to help me.
"You know, you and I are very much alike."
"Oh, we're both crooks."
Only there's one difference.
I don't want to be.
And you can't help yourself.
I like you.
A dead man.
A dead man at the lagoon.
We have to leave!
He's been into the grog again!
"Shut your mouth, will!"
"We all saw it, right?"
It's true.
I saw it with me own eyes.
- It rose up like a demon!
- Demon?
Get the women back into the stockade!
"First it attacked you, now it's come for me."
This place is cursed.
We're all cursed!
"Calm down, man!"
We have to find another island to get provisions from before it's too late.
"- It's a devil, sir."
- He speaks the truth.
"Right, you lot."
Load all the goods into the longboat!
Did you not hear him?
Move it!
We shouldn't have taken the ship!
"Shut up, man!"
You're giving everyone the jitters!
He must be sun-struck.
Let me help.
Right.
Just keep him away from the rest of the men.
Come on.
"Roll out the barrel, boys!"
Just put your shoulder into it.
"It's my dad, ok?"
He won't let me.
Why?
I...
"It's ok, just... tell me."
"I know it's not true, but my dad won't let me sleep over at your house because he thinks you're gay."
I know you're not.
I just...
I have to do what he says.
I'm sorry.
What if I was gay?
What do you mean?
Would you not want to sleep over at my house if I really was gay?
Hey.
So... don't worry about last night.
"It was almost curfew, and there was a lot of pressure."
Yeah.
But you still want to... right?
Of course.
"Um, Saturday night, we'll do it the right way, ok?"
"Yeah, I'd like that."
I got it all planned out.
We can go to a really nice dinner.
Totally on me.
"And then afterwards, maybe we can go to the beach."
- The beach?
- Yeah.
What's wrong with the beach?
Have you ever had sex on the beach?
"I know it's supposed to be all romantic and stuff, but there's sand everywhere, in all your business, and bugs."
It's...
It's pretty terrible.
I'm sorry.
No need to be sorry.
It's my fault.
I knew this day would come.
I thought I'd be okay.
"But in reality, I can't take it."
I am sorry too.
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to leave you hanging.
"But there comes a time when we have to choose, right?"
And I just didn't choose work like you did.
Can I ask you to do one thing for me?
"Even if there's no work, call me sometime."
I'll call for sure.
"As soon as I give birth, you'll be the first person I call."
Oh shit.
I can't.
I have to call my dad.
Then I will call you 2nd.
You go do whatever you want to do then.
That photo I have lots of pimples.
Erase them for me.
No hurry.
Your deadline is 2 days.
Beyotch.
Make my boobs a little bigger too.
- Is this man the best you can do?
- When did I have time?
I'm always with you.
Surprise proposal clip of Je and Shane.
Wait.
"You have moment like this too, Je?"
Whatever.
We're probably gonna get arrested.
What do you want me to put?
Like how I said it.
"""I'll poop in your butt hole... and then you will poop it back... into my butt... and we will keep doing it""-"
- Back-
- Back-
- And forth-
- And forth-
With the same poop.
Same poop.
Forever.
"Wow, look at these beds!"
You don't have to make the beds.
I'll make 'em when I get home from work.
Where'd you learn to make corners like that?
It's just the way we like it.
Really?
"I thought you preferred the rumpled, unkempt look."
- We like it this way now.
- Yeah.
"At Mom's house, we have a chore wheel."
- What?
- Nothing.
A chore wheel.
"You put chores on it, and then you can spin it."
There's this metal thing... and it helps it to spin.
It's spinning from the metal.
Okay.
"Well- So, it's just a half shift."
"I'll be back in four hours, and we'll go do something fun, okay?"
Okay.
Dunkirk in the can.
* But I see all I want to know * To Dunkirk in the can.
* You can't black out the moon *
* I see you smiling in the cigarette glow * * But the picture fades too soon *
* But I see all I want to know * * You can't black out the moon *
* We don't grumble * * We don't worry about alarms *
* And you stumble * * You stumble right into my arms *
Too young.
"* And when you kiss me, don't you realize *"
Compared to what?
Too young to write.
* And like a love light in your eyes * * They can't black out the moon *
Thank you.
Oh!
Well done.
Thank you.
You're up.
Oh!
"No, no, no."
Oh!
Shut up Ambrose.
You know you want to.
Alright.
Well...oh!
"Wild mountain thyme... (WILL YOU GO, LASSIE, GO BY FRANCIS McPEAKE)"
Here it is!
"* Oh, the summertime is comin' * * And the trees are softly blooming *"
* And the wild mountain thyme * * Grows around the blooming heather *
"* Will ye go, lassie * * And we'll all go to heaven to pull wild mountain thyme *"
So how was London?
Quiet.
No bombings Tuesdays apparently.
"Yes, but..."
"Don't bother about us, lvy, dear."
"- Oh, Marcia!"
- Oh.
For Miss Ivy Peterson.
"Thanks, governor."
Look.
Fifty pounds.
There ain't no letter.
You don't suppose it's from him?
He must have sent it for what he's done.
"No, not him."
"He's too mean, he is."
"Oh, I don't know."
I wouldn't put it past him.
Yes.
"Yes, that's it."
Hopes I'll use it to try and run away.
"Oh, I can see him thinking it up, I can."
"And then, then he'll follow me."
"And just when I think that I've got free, he'll..."
I can't stand it anymore.
I can't stand it.
"Oh, if I could only do it I'd go down to the river."
"Oh, lvy."
"It's her nerves, that's what."
She ought to see a doctor.
There's a copy of the Winged Victory.
The real one's in the Louvre in Paris.
I know because I saw it there.
What's the sense of being victorious if you haven't a head?
"What's the sense of my taking a trip, acquiring art and culture if you're not going to pay attention?"
I'm gonna go see if I can get some answers out of her.
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to find Trudy!
Talking to locals is the best way to get information!
"You guys should be doing it, too."
That's a great idea.
We split up.
"That way, we find her twice as fast."
"Shane, with me."
"We shouldn't split up, we should stay together."
"Listen, Dave, time is of the essence, okay, and if we don't find her, here's what else."
"We meet back at the exit in, like, an hour, okay?"
Come on.
Let's go.
"Jason, there's a ton of people here."
"If we split up, we're gonna..."
Stay with Joey.
This place rocks.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm trying to have a good time.
I'm trying to have a party going on.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
We gotta find Trudy.
I don't want to get into this.
"Come on, buddy."
"What, are you dying to be part of the new singles scene?"
Look at all these people.
"They're running around, they're..."
I came to offer you true happiness.
"I'll marry you, Elise, you'll live in luxury!"
"You can even bring the child, if you want to."
You're a lucky girl.
"I was happy with my Henry, but then my luck flew away."
"Except for - look, they have the same eyes."
I'm sick of your comedy.
Keep your palace.
I don't want it.
And get out!
I'll stay true to Henry even though he's gone!
Impossible!
You must marry me!
Leave Elisa alone!
She's got to marry me!
She must marry me!
"So you won't let her be, you nasty wretch?"
We've had really enough of you.
We saw right through you!
Get out or I'll change you into a limping mare!
- You said you can't do it.
"- I know, but he doesn't."
Let's scare him out of his wits!
"Climb on my back, quick."
Don't drop me!
"Jean, it's me!"
The Duke!
"It's all her fault, and she's waiting for you!"
- Who?
- The old witch!
Our salvation!
But your Grace...
You won't for long!
"I'll have your throat out, you bloody swine!"
- Another two dozen!
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Another two dozen!
"- What's wrong with you, Evans?"
- It's got worm in it.
"I'll eat weevils and maggots, but not red worms!"
Good food thrown on the deck.
You're spoiled.
You know that's an offence.
A flogging offence.
"You know that too, don't you?"
- He sent you.
- What?
"Yes, sir."
I know it.
While we consider the best course of action pick it up!
It's fit.
Eat it.
Eat it.
That's an order.
"You'll swing for this, every man jack of you!"
He's right.
We'll hang for striking an officer.
We're all in it.
We have to move fast.
What shall we do?
There is only one thing to do.
Give the signal.
"- When, now?"
- As soon as we can.
"and half of you is man, and the other half is woman. (Chuckling)"
"Shame on you, how can you say such things to your elders?"
"Nevermind, come on, let's all have a drink."
Bastard!
I'll tear him to pieces!
"Hey, what are you saying?"
Let's not worry about those things when we have these two beautiful young ladies to enjoy ourselves with.
(laughing)
(banging)
I'm sleeping.
"Hey, what's wrong?"
"He's so cold to us, we've done nothing to him."
Didn't you see his pigtails?
He acts just like a woman!
(Laughing)
He is more like a woman than a man!
"Well, you're a man."
"So, does he love you?"
Shut your mouth!
"Come on, let's go."
"No wait, don't rush."
"No, I can't wait!"
"If you rush, then you're gonna spoil the mood."
What do you want?
I want you to come and undress me.
But not using your hands.
But how?
I can't wait!
Just how am I gonna do that?
"You idiot, you'd use your mouth."
Well?
Do you like that?
"So we won't think about it now, will we?"
"No, sir."
"When I do go, it will break your heart, won't it?"
"Yes, sir."
Well...
What would my little cherub like to do this evening?
"Oh, sir, could we go out?"
Out?
"You mean gad about a bit, see the sights?"
"Yes, sir."
"Oh, you'd like it, wouldn't you, sir?"
"Well, now, I don't know."
I don't know.
That might be very charming.
Where would we go?
"Oh, they say that the Empire and such places..."
They do?
Who does?
"Well, Marcia, sir."
She says it's ever so gay.
"- Oh, really?"
- Yes.
"We can go, can't we?"
They say that the bill is ever so good.
And I haven't been out for so long.
No.
"No, that's right."
"You haven't, have you?"
You do look a little pale.
Yes.
"Yes, that's true."
"Not that I am complaining, you understand..."
I looked through your suitcase.
How often do you shave?
Once every day.
That's better.
"Well, you're not going to give me away, are you, Mike?"
It's very important to Nancy that you don't.
She'll be in very big trouble if you do.
"Now, why are you dressed up like that?"
"Oh, well, to help Nancy."
"Okay, but why are you dressed up like that?"
To help Nancy.
"You see, I can't explain it now, Mike, except that if they find out, see, that I'm a grown-up man, it can get Nancy in all kinds of trouble, see."
We don't want that to happen.
"So you'll help me out, huh?"
Okay.
Good.
"Do you collect rocks, too?"
"No, not really."
Then what are you doing with this?
"Oh, that ain't mine."
I found this in your suitcase in your pants' pocket.
Oh.
It still ain't mine.
Can I have it?
"Sure, be my guest."
Thanks.
I'll run a test on it.
I'm going to be a geologist.
"Oh, that's swell."
What do we do now?
Let's go.
Let's go.
- You're welcome.
Is that your car stuck there?
We're waiting for a tractor to pull it out.
"I see, thank you very much."
I'd really like to repay you somehow.
- Don't worry about it.
- But still.
It was really nothing.
Let's go.
- Thank you for your help!
- You're welcome.
Get her keys.
"We're just gonna grab some stuff and then we're gone, all right?"
"hey, hey, hey."
Come on.
Army food.
Yum.
- Which one's the key to the boat?
- The red one.
Let's get out of here before I start puking again.
"Look, look, I won't tell anybody you were here."
Just take the boat and go.
Please.
"Actually, we don't really need this."
I'm gonna find them.
The people who did this are not gonna get away.
Just tell me she's gonna be all right.
"She lost a lot of blood, but her pulse is strong."
We just have to keep watching her.
Bad heart valve.
She's had it since she was born.
"Alright, buy it at four."
I'll try.
You knew something.
"Well, I told you."
It was too late when you told me.
If I'd had the pleasure of knowing you before.
Do you think he's going to get it at four?
"No, but it's a good buy at five."
I couldn't get it.
"Alright, buy it at five."
"I'm sorry, it's going to six."
Buy it at six.
I won't buy it at all.
Cancel the order.
You mustn't get mad just because you missed a good buy.
Who gave you this tip?
I specialize in tips.
Give me your card.
I'm afraid I don't have one with me.
But I'll be happy to call you when I get the next tip.
I usually don't do this.
"I'll call you, Mrs. Ryan."
"And if you're not in, I'll leave the message with your husband."
"I have no husband, I am a widow."
Who was your husband?
Peter Ryan.
Peter Ryan!
Did you know him?
"Everybody knew Peter Ryan, the financial wizard."
We were married in Europe.
He brought me to this country.
A short while after he died.
There may be some tools we can use.
"Okay, I'll try to reach it."
"There'll be a phone line as well, I heard the main house."
"Probably a burglar alarm too, so we need to... we need to get the police here if we can Okay, how're you doing?"
You okay?
"Better than you, babe."
I'll be okay.
I'll be okay.
You think Chris could have sent the postcard?
I don't know.
Maybe.
"But really, I-I-I don't know."
"Can I count on you, Luke?"
Of course.
Might get a little hairy.
I don't want you getting any ideas.
Absolutely not.
I just wanna get through this.
We all do.
Good man.
Luke.
"None of us sent the card, Justin."
Seriously... this hasn't gone too far.
"You can just set us free, walk away."
No one will talk.
You have my word.
Here's the deal...
Someone owns up to sending the postcard
- I let you all go.
- And if no one owns up?
"- Well then, we play Truth or Dare."
"- You're full of shit, man."
- It's a nice word for titties.
- Where's Mom?
- What doyou mean?
What do you think she's doing right now?
I don't know.
Screwing her new boyfriend probably.
- I think she's buying us presents.
"- Yeah, Robby."
Right now she's probably buying us each a car!
- It's a man.
- I think it's a woman.
I can tell it is.
What should wewrite?
"""I have a big wiener""?"
I want to poop back and forth.
What?
What does that mean?
"Like, I'll poop into her butt hole... and then she'll poop it back... into my butt hole."
And then we'll just keep doing it back and forth... with the same poop.
"Oh, my God."
I'm going to put that!
"""I want to poop... back and forth."""
"Oh, God."
"She's gonna think we're a crazy, perverted person."
- Ooh!
She thinks we're crazy!
"- No, tell her like how I said it."
"No, she'll never write back."
"We have to sound like we're a man, you know?"
That's just lame.
It's stupid.
"But you said I could do half, and you've done all of them before this."
I need to know what happened.
"So... there's no party and it's just us, and what, this is some sort of set up?"
You're his friends.
I thought you might be able to help.
"- Come on, Paul."
We're going.
- I can't drive.
I'm pissed.
There was a party at the end of the summer term.
I think something might have happened there.
"He topped himself, mate."
It's sad but it happens.
I don't see what we can do about it.
And you shouldn't have got us to come here under false pretenses.
That's just out of order.
This was in his pocket.
Did any of you send it?
This is the key.
This is what drove him to it.
"""Truth or Dare, bitch!"""
What does this mean?
"I mean, you're his friends, you must have some idea."
I've heard enough of this.
I'm leaving.
Who's coming?
- But we can't take the cars.
"- Yeah, well, we can take our chances."
"I'm not finish yet, Chris."
"Well, I am."
Step aside.
I can't do that.
"- Oh, my God!"
- This is the one.
One more shot.
One more shot.
Just one more.
Just one more.
"- You know, I'm on to you."
- What do you mean?
"Okay, you told me that I'm top dog but secretly, you think you're top dog, all right?"
Now you're just trying to out-top-dog the top dog.
Can you take these doors off child-lock so I can kill myself?
- Men working.
"Things are different now, man, all right?"
You're not top dog anymore.
I am.
You know what?
You are absolutely correct.
You are the top dog.
Here.
What are you doing?
There's no top dog crown.
Are you trying to make me look stupid?
"Look, man, this is about respect."
I'm a lot flyer than I used to be.
"- Yeah, much flyer."
I respect you.
"- No, you don't."
"Because if you did, you would have told me that the small room is the top dog room."
Face to face
Just when...
Just when you thought Our chance had past
What?
I own this song.
"For God's sake, let me kill them!"
Let go of me.
Don't go there!
Come back here.
It's high tide.
You'll be caught in the seaweed.
You'll be killed.
You crazy?
Don't go to the ruins.
Come back!
They were in the marshes.
They are wounded.
Let me take care of them.
- I'll look after them.
- All right.
You knew the risk you were taking bringing them here.
It's too late now.
Look after them so they can rest.
I'll speak to them afterwards.
I know you are there!
You saw them!
They can set you free if they wish.
But you're the one who has to wait!
They have to come of their own free will.
I've seen how pure they are.
How innocent they are!
"I won't intervene, but I beg you to spare them!"
So be it.
Let destiny be fulfilled!
"Don't you want to play, Madame Louise?"
Last night ended in tragedy.
- What happened?
"""This ain't no beach or park."" ""l'm resting! "" l said."
"They pull me in, they start giving me all kinds of questions."
"You know, this and that."
"""What are you going to tell us, tough guy?"" l says, ""My usual."
Zero.
"Nothing."""
"""Why tell you?"" The fuck."
"He says, ""No, you're gonna tell me something today, tough guy."""
"I said, ""All right, I'll tell ya something, go fuck your mother."""
"You saw the paper, Anthony."
My head was out like this.
I'm coming around and who do I see in front of me?
This big prick again.
"He says, ""What do you want to tell me now, tough guy?"""
"I said, ""Bing, what are you doing here?"
"I thought I told you to go fuck your mother."""
I thought he was gonna shit.
The fuckers.
"Me, I wish I was big just once."
Funny.
You're really funny.
"What do you mean, I'm funny?"
"It's funny, you know. lt's a good story."
You're a funny guy.
You mean the way I talk?
What?
"It's just, you know."
You're just funny.
"You know, the way you tell the story and everything."
Funny how?
"I mean, what's funny about it?"
"-Tommy, you got it all wrong."
And I'm proud of you.
All right.
And that's that.
Court dismissed.
"Well, I told you."
Keep your mouth shut or you'll be sorry.
"Jim, come here."
"Come here and let a guy talk to you, will you?"
What brought you back?
What's the difference?
"We're back, ain't we?"
"Charlie, I think you'd better go up and get fixed up."
"Go ahead, kid."
"Sit down, Jim."
Sit down.
I'm not going to ask you why you beat it.
I can guess that easy.
"Well, we'll let that go."
"I wanna ask, I want you to tell me the truth."
What's the matter?
Don't you like the way we treat you?
Don't you like us?
What is it?
Let's have it.
Give us a break.
There must be something you like to do.
Patsy wants to help you do it.
You're the mayor of this place.
You don't act like it.
"Well, I didn't ask for the job."
"Listen, kid."
I'm gonna tell you something and it's just between us.
- Do what?
You can't kill anyone.
What makes you think they'll let you?
They don't care about Lisa and Charlie now any more than we do.
It's all about Allie.
Then where are they?
We tried to pick up Lisa.
Lisa was helpless.
Allie can take care of herself.
Then what makes you think any of this will work?
I don't know if it's gonna work.
At least I'm not afraid to try.
"Mary, don't do this."
Listen to me.
I-I know this.
Walk away.
"Even if you lose the project, walk away... before you do something you can't walk away from."
MAN:
Here they come.
Why don't you just fade away?
You're a burden to the project.
"You don't have the stomach for it, and you don't have the brains."
You have no idea what I'm capable of?
What I've done?
I won't have any more blood on my hands.
Everybody set?
Get a tight lead on that subject.
Run away!
Take the little girl!
It's a trick!
Run!
It's a trick!
She's very upset.
This is no good.
You got to straighten this thing out.
We got to have calm now.
We don't know what the hell she's gonna do.
She's hysterical.
Very excited.
She's wild.
And you got to take it easy.
You got children.
"I'm not saying you gotta go back to her this minute, but you got to go back."
You got to keep up appearances.
The two of them come to my house every day.
I can't have it.
"I can't do it, Henry. I can't do it."
Nobody says you can't do what you want.
We all know that.
This is what it is.
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.
You have to go home to the family.
"You got to go home, okay?"
Look at me.
You got to go home.
Smarten up.
I'll talk to Karen.
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.
I'll say you'll go back to her and it'll be like when you first got married.
You'll romance her. lt'll be beautiful.
I know how to talk to her.
Jimmy and Tommy were going to Tampa this weekend to pick up something for me.
Did that...
Did that mean something or was that just us getting caught up in the moment?
"I'm not giving you the cold shoulder,"
I just don't want us to go right back to where we were.
Then... what do you want me to do?
"Amy, I want you to figure out what's important to you."
I have.
"Maybe you haven't noticed, but I have."
So what do you want?
You're gonna have to tell me what's important to you.
Say something.
Just sit down.
They'll be fine.
"Yeah, I know."
I know.
And who do we have to thank for that?
"Hey, honey."
Good night.
"Yeah, tell me again."
Who do we have to thank?
"Yeah, Mel."
"I-no, no, no!"
"These are true ""hot shot"" type horses."
"No, you have to see them."
"Yeah, I got a client roster in my phone from last month."
Is that still up-to-date?
"Okay, good."
"Thanks for spreading the word, Scott."
"Just, just, just come up."
That's it.
"If you see them, I guarantee you'll buy a few of them."
Okay.
Roll down your window.
We have to tell him.
No.
"If he stops, it'll fall off."
"Even if he slows down, it'll fall."
The best thing for that fish would be... if he could just drive steadily... forever.
I guess these are his last moments of life.
Shall we say some words?
I didn't know you... but I want you to die knowing that you were loved.
I love you.
Hey.
It was on your roof!
.
We'll go in front of you!
- Pull in front of him.
- Okay.
We've got to keep him at a steady speed.
Just keep them steady.
"Oh, God."
That little girl is gonna have towatch it.
But at least they know.
At least we're all together on this.
"When me and Pam were first in love... we hated to be apart, even for an hour."
"Oh, yeah."
I had something like that once.
- A real fuck-a-thon.
- We just slept.
We loved to sleep when it was time to sleep.
Not sex.
"I mean, we had sex... but what we really loved was to sleep like babies all day long."
That sounds perfect.
I don't want to have to do this living.
You gotta see this.
Look at this.
This is how they're separating us.
You can control the doors from here.
Watch.
There they are.
Yeah.
They don't even care we're down here.
"Yeah, but they don't know that we know about this room."
Not yet.
"Now look, I've..."
"I've been monitoring surveillance, okay, and I think I found a way out."
Where?
"Okay, look at this."
Look at this.
You see that room right there?
"Those are, those are drainage ducts right there."
"Now, it's a tight squeeze, but I checked it out, and I think you guys can fit through it."
What do you mean you guys?
"Look, I can hide."
I'll stay here.
I'm gonna slow you down.
Connor.
"Look, it's the only way to do this, Blair."
Okay.
"You guys, you guys go out, phone for help and then,"
I'll hide down here and-
- We're not leaving you again.
I would leave me.
"No, we're staying."
How many people have they killed?
"If we leave, they get away, and they'll kill again."
It's more than that.
I need help.
I can't stand it anymore.
"It's Hyde, sir."
"It's a man I know, Mr. Hyde."
It's him that's done it and more.
More I can't tell you.
He ain't a human.
He's a beast.
"And he won't let me go, sir, and I am afraid to run away."
"Marcia, she's my girlfriend, and Freddie, that's her friend, they they say it's my nerves, and that you know about such things."
And that you could help me.
"Oh, I can't bear up under it no more!"
If you can't help me give me some poison so I can kill myself.
Why didn't you try to get help before?
Why didn't you go to the police?
"I tell you, I'm afraid."
No he ain't a man.
"He's a devil, he is."
He knows what you're thinking about.
"If he knows I'm here, who knows what he'll do."
"It won't be nothing human, I can tell you!"
"Oh, please."
Please help me keep him off.
"I'll do anything you ask, sir."
I ain't as bad as you might think.
Well...
Men say that I...
I ain't a bad looker when I'm more myself.
"You liked me once a little, didn't you?"
"Really, you..."
You're such a fine and kind gentleman.

That's already too late.
What are you doing?
Yes sir.
I'll go into the palace.

Ah.
A student at our school left the guy she had a crush on... and supposedly kissed another guy.
"On top of that, it was in broad daylight at school."
How could she?
Dumping someone like Baek Seung Jo.
Dumping?!
That doesn't make sense.
With a completely old looking sunbae.
"Ah, that girl!"
Really!
"Oh, look here!"

Kiss?!
"That's right, a kiss."
Oh Ha Ni is really great.
"She even said to him ""Can you do it one more time?""."
"Then, what happens with Baek Seung Jo?"

Oh Ha Ni dumped him.
Dumped?

Yes.
Thank you.
Act of God.
I didn't do it.
God did.
It's 'Act of God'.

I didn't do it.
And now God will shoot you..
And you will die.
"Later, will your family get the claim.. ..or will that be 'Act of God' as well?"
"How nice to see you, Georgia."
I was just picking up some onions for my mum.
"Well, you know your onions, don't you, Jas?"
You've been eating organic food for ages.
Cool.
"Oh, I'm sorry."

Few of my men have accompanied me.
Send them upstairs.
I'll manage the rest.

"Sir, Shreekant called off Jimmy's engagement"
I'll wait outside.

Are those brats following us?
It looks like the car from the errands center from last time.

This couldn't happen from the control room.
Connor:
No one's got access to do that except... except maybe Dr. Niven... but he was down here.
Connor:
The sooner we get out of here the sooner we can sort it out.
Kate:
I...
I don't like it down here.
James:
It's not too far.
(Distant scream)
Amy:
What the hell was that?!
Kate:
Probably a steam valve or something... right?
James:
Probably.
Kate:
How much further is it?
James:
It's not far.
Matt: ...Great.
Matt:
Just as i was starting to get freaked out.
James:
"Look, I'm sorry."
I thought that...
Matt (Interrupting):
Do you know where we're going or don't you?
Amy:
Matt...
I don't get it.
I just don't.
How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation ?

The Crown Prince?
Yes.
Crown Prince.
Your Grace.
It's a pleasure to see you.
Shall I call for Yuning?
"No, I came to see you."
And how may I be of service?
Go see the Crown Prince.
I'm certain you can convince him.
The Crown Prince.
He's not in.
What?
Where is he?
Let's go.
"Lady Bong, Lady Bong?"
Your Grace.
We're leaving.
I want to see the Crown Prince again.
Huh?
"Yes, Your Grace."
Only through sincerity do we truly live...
It balances personal relations and is the basic virtue for all...
Prince...
Has all this business upset you?
"Yes, sir."
What happened to the Crown Prince is my fault.
"Okay, I'm done."
It's yours.
Your folks...
Hello.
"Kerim, we've arrived but we don't know where to go."
Where are you?
I don't know...
We've followed the road signs but...
- Can't you ask somebody over there?
"- There's no one to ask, around here."
"Is it my brother, give me the phone."
Give it to me.
- Abi?
- It's me.
Yenge.
What happened?
Fatmagül?
"- Fatmagül, you OK?"
- What's going on?
- Hello.

"Hang up, I'll call you soon."
Come pick us up from here.
Fatmagül...
Pull yourself together.
"It's OK, don't be afraid."
You've just passed out.
Calm down.
Don't be afraid.
Is your foot too bad?
Where are they?
What's happening over there?
Seen it?
You got a rip in it.
Jack:
Is that a rip? man:
"Why don't you film down there, Jack?"
Let's see if we see a cup.
"Come on, that's it."
Jesus.
"You're not a student now, you know."
You're a working man.
There's no excuse.
Just here. man:
Is this where we're going?
Jack:
Yeah.
man:
"Two small beef burgers, believe it or not."
Imagine what the large ones are like or the medium ones.
"Ridiculous, isn't it?"
Unbelievable.
"Anyway, here you go, Jack."
This way.
I'm gonna sit in the car.
[seagulls crying]
What do you got?
Jack:
This. man:
Oh.
Is this bit a photograph of you at uni?
Jack:
Yeah. man:
Fantastic.
Who is it?

No.

Yes.

TV and Video.
- You want TV and Video?
Why are you looking in the vegetable section?
TV and Video is over there.
Come.
We have to loot his shop.
- Speak softly.
What if he hears?
He is deaf.
Come sir.
"You sit here, and you sit here."
What will you take?
- I don't want anything.
Where did he go?
- I am here.
Why do you always do this?
- Did someone fall again?
"Not there, he fell here."
"I offer a chair, and you make him fall."
"Sorry sir, but he cannot see."
But he is good at his work.
Hello.
"- Not here, do it here."
Hello.
"- Not to the door, here."
Hello.
"- Come quickly, don't leave me alone with him."
We're coming.
"We'll be there soon, right Mukaddes?"
Almost there...
We missed the ferryboat.
But it's OK.
Are you crying?
But don't cry.
- Fatmagül's crying.
"- Come on, wrap it up Rahmi."
- Fatmagül?
- Yes?
I'll come and save you from that man.
- I'm going to the toilet.
Keep an eye on the kid.
- You heard me?
- I did.
- We'll be there soon.
OK?
- OK.
- God be with you.
"Don't be sad, don't cry."
I'll be with you by the evening.
I kiss your cheeks.
"- Abi, can you move the truck?"
- I am hanging up.
- The truck...
"- Yes please, there's a car behind."
I can't move it now...
"Murat, go fetch your mom."
Run!
"Sorry, my wife will be here now."
Ow! man:
Does it hurt?
Sasha:
Yes. man:
It'll sting for a little while.
"There, just dry yourself off."
And let's take a look at the nice...
Sasha:
Meh. man:
Nice clean shave.
"Good job, buddy."
Here.
Sasha:
This is not clean. man:
Here's what we do.
Sasha:
Agh. man:
Don't--give me-- face the camera here.
And we put a little piece on there.
See?
And it sticks to the bloody part.
"And voila, he's done."
"Hey, wait."
"High five, buddy."
You survived it.
[animal bells ring]
man:
"Guys, it's not good to fall in love with girls"
"You have wives, so you are all right."
Whereas I don't have a wife.
Bitch. man:
What day is it today? man #2:
Good luck!
I'm so sorry.
Never mind!
You sing very well.
Really?
You heard it?
"Yes, I did."
- We also saw.
What?
- We saw everything.
What?
He means to say you've got a melodious voice.
Great!
- What?
He means to say you sing so well.
- Oh!
That's great!
You people chase goons and dacoits... ...and today you were chasing the music?
"Baby, you've yet not seen our talents."
But it's not good to move around freely.
"Yes, I know."
You've got a zero knowledge of music.
I am also a police officer's daughter.
"Every day, they've got only one job."
Arrest!
Attack!
Arrest!

Maybe it's time... we start to express ourselves in new ways.
- Yeah.
- You wanna do it ?
- Yeah.
- I love you.
It's your turn.
That's not what I was thinking.
Sex.
It's always about sex.
It's not always about sex.
I just thought it was about sex this time.
"Look, Vicky, love is a term that gets thrown around, and-and people don't mean it."
"When I say it, I want it to be more than words."
- You know ?
I want it to be-- - Perfect.
- Is it hot?
- Yes.
It's very good.
Have some.
No.
I'm full!

"If you don't, it'll expire!"
Give one to your father.
"We better finish the pike, too."
One more day and they'll be bugs.
"Hey, Sunghee, come here."
Now what...

"Yes, you do."
It's going to expire.
I get diarrhea.

Brat.
Throw it out?
Why would you throw food out?
Drink up!
Flip over the kimchi that you've eaten!
Flip it over yourself.
It's too bright.
Wait!

He... he locked the door.
The pervert!
The perverted bastard!
- That's really awful.

I can see the state Ms Limmer is in.
I was faster than Rex.
Because you shut the door in his face.
"Strange, that."
Maybe it was the wind.
God doesn't exist down here.
Wake up.
Wake up.

A boy.
My son.
"Yes, a boy."

There's internal hemorrhage.

"Let us take care of him, OK?"
He's going to the ER.
We need your details.

Kate:
James was going to come meet me for dinner but he told me you guys had to...
Connor:
Oh... sorry.
Kate:
"It's ok, don't worry."
Matt:
And how did James manage to convince you that vending machine food is going to be an acceptable substitute?
Amy:
"Shift can sometimes be boring, are you going to be ok?"
James:
I told her.
Kate:
I insisted.
Dont you hear?
Go.
He seems to be mad.
Hold on.
Are you scared?

I trust lads too much.
Trust the Yank too much.
This is how you prove your point?
Backstabbing me?
Teaming up with Tommy Hatcher to kill the Major?
Kill my fucking brother?
I'll kill Tommy.

And Damodar is like my son.
I have to listen to him.
But uncle.

- You please don't tell this to uncle.
Why?

"Yes, I know."
Shreekant doesn't like to recommendation.

He's mad.
Even I had not got a job without recommendation.
"Son, your job is fixed."
"- Thank you, sir."
Thank you very much.
Chintu's father was very fond of diamonds.
That's why I wear it.
"Otherwise, I'm not fond of it."

Latest one is recently sold out.
Our sir's friend has bought it.
It's still in his hand.
Marvelous! fantastic!
It's a super piece.

"Excuse me, is he Mr. Jimmy?"
"- Yes, that's right."
"Jimmy, my son!"
"Jimmy, my son!"

JULlE KLAUSNER:
"You marry Whoopi, you fuck Robin, and you kill Billy."
That's what I would do.
TED LEO:
"Yeah, that's a good, that's a good plan."
Yeah.
"You don't want to, you don't want to fuck Billy Crystal."
"He would do like, weird voices."
"And you know, like, his characters."
BETH HOYT:
He'd do the balloon man character.
TED LEO:
"Jazz man, character, you know?"
"(IN JAZZ MAN VOlCE) That's real good, man."
Horrible.
BETH HOYT:
Right.
That is not--
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"It's not as horrible as when he actually puts on, you know, brown face to do it."
He doesn't go full black face.
Unless he does.
TED LEO:
Maybe he does.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I might be wrong.
BETH HOYT:
We don't need to find out out.
TED LEO:
That's what happens in the bedroom.
He take it to the next step.
Any story.
"Tenderly, as if whispering."
I'm busy here.
I have nothing to say.
I love...you.
Not that.
Something with a plot.
Oh I don't know.
What plot.
Hurry...
A long time ago...
In my ear.
Whisper!
"A long time ago, I was dating this woman."
She was a real virgin.
Really?
Yeah.
And so...?
"What do you mean, so?"
"Once she did it with me, she was no longer a virgin."
That's it?
Yes.
More specifically.
How did you meet her?
She lived next door.
And then?
"Well, then, one day."
Try to make it dramatic.
Like a movie.
Alright.
"One night, a night of brilliant moonlight,"
I was asleep... when the door opened quietly.
-So where's this ghost?
"Die, ghost, die!"

"Okay, the ghost is dead."
"-Oh, thank God."
[gasps]
My husband's ashes?
-The ghost did it.
"-Money, money, money [microwave beeps]"

"Hey, where are the scissors?"
"Oh, here they are."
-[shrieks]
-What?
[crunch!]
-[groans]
-S--t.
-What the hell's going on?
-Um...
I guess I killed you.
"-Oh, thanks a lot, douche."
"-Well, on the bright side, we did make a butt-ton of money from that lady."
"-What do you mean, ""we""?"
"-Oh, dude, I just got an awesome idea."
Maybe we should--
-Haunt people so we can charge 'em a bunch of money to get rid of me so we can get super rich?
-Ghosts can read minds?
"Honey, could you turn that down?"
WHOA!
Dammit!
My ankle!
Oh yeah!
I didn't want to trip on them.
Ow!
"Sweetie, is your car running OK?"
"Yeah, why?"
Great!
I'm fresh out of gas.
I'll take yours.
I'm late for work.
(DlNG-DONG!)
Just a minute.
Oh!
"Hi, Marla."
We need to talk.
Come in.
What happened to your ankle?
Getting out of bed this morning ...
Tripped over Barry's golf clubs.
Yeah.
Happened to me many times when we were married.
I still wear a brace when it rains.
"So, what's in the box?"
I thought Barry cleared all of his stuff out after we got divorced.
I was cleaning today and I found something.
What is it?
You're not gonna like it.
Like what?
"Well, all those years, I knew there was something."
Catch him.
There he goes.
Catch him.
"Don't let him go. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
""" Here comes Govinda... """
""" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
"Don't let him go, catch him. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
"Go that way. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Let's sit down and talk.
All I did was file a case.

Look behind.
Catch him.
Faster!
Who are you?
Krishna Vasudev Yadav.
What?
Krishna Vasudev Yadav from Gokul.
So you're from UP.
You can call me Kanhaiyya.
Catch him.
Careful.
Careful.
"Careful, slow down."
Slow down.
Are you a man or a stuntman?
You can call me a stuntman as well.
But people call my stunts a miracle.
Miracle.
- Hold on.
You aren't wearing a helmet either.
There he is.
"Hey, even the card companies give you three months."
"You can give me three months, can't you?"
Let's meet on Saturday for sure.
Okay?
Saturday!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Is there a forecast for rain today?
Well... the report has just come in.

- Yeah.
- And your homework?
- I did it.

- Of course.
"Hey, I told you to draw me better."
"Look, my eyes are closed again."
Watch here.
Like this.
It's not working very well.
"Mom, do you regret it?"
Regret?
About me.
Do you regret it?
Why should I feel any regret?
It was my fault.
"No, it's Dad's fault."
Who is he?
His name is Venkat.
He is handsome and 6 feet tall.
That is the main problem.
Thank you.
Do you want another?
- It is enough for now.
Are you Venkat?
Yes.
Boss is calling you.
Get in to the jeep.
- Which boss?
This territory has only one boss.
Bhadram sir.
Why does he wants me?
Hey!
He got some work.
Shut up and get in to the jeep.
The boy is with me.
You go.
I will drop him at the house and follow you.
Who is he?
He is talking opposite to what we say.
Put both of them in the jeep.
Come on.
What is this?
Why are you so angry with us?
Sorry sir.
I said I will come.
Please leave the boy.
I would not cause any harm just caress him.
Take the boy home.
"Narin, please..."
Narin!
Narin!
No Narin!
NO!
It is not going to end like this...
This is not going to end like this.

Your life won't be like this.

Don't do it.
Don't...
Don't cry...
I feel very ashamed before you.
Don't tell anybody.
I promise.
I won't tell anybody.
"But you have to promise me, too..."
"Whatever happens, don't give up on life."
Life is very valuable.
"You saw the bottom of the pain, Narin."
Not you!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!

Inspector Damodar speaking.
"Yes, this is Uma."
- Oh Uma?

I'm not going to make it.
"Hey, put him down."
Down.
Let him down.
"Bastard, why did you let him fall off, huh?"
Go drive the ambulance.
Don't stare at me.
- Did you hit my friend?
- I didn't.
I did.
Just get in the ambulance.
Go.
Don't make me hit you too.
Go.
Hurry up.
This is amazing.
How's the sea?
It's alright.
Really?
I was thinking about going.
"Hey, how much are those two bottles of pepsi?"
"Well, it's been paid for."
"The man at that table has paid, sir."
What's this?
He's your next victim.
No way.
This is way too much.
"The last time, I had to put up with that Che."
"It's disgusting, eww..."
Don't get too dramatic.
Hey.
I've always managed.
You have to--
Sick!
You're so sick!

Paul:

Water's fine.
Cool.
"So, ahem, are we, like, related?"
"Oh, no."
"Uh, Abby's not my mom."
Oh.
Good.
"Yeah, she, uh, she dated my old man back in the day."
"He was kind of a deadbeat, so when they broke up, she took me in."
Put me through school.
Didn't freak out when I totaled her car.
Twice.
She sounds...Great.
- Yeah.
- Jamie?
Don't worry about Yuning.
My mother and her cronies want to banish Yuning because of me.
They think he's a threat to my crown.
Prince.
But I have no right to the throne.
And so I won't allow an innocent like Yuning to be hurt.
What are you saying?
No right to your throne?
Does the Crown Prince know?
Does he?
Sire.
The Crown Prince to see you.
- Yun?
"- Yes, Sire."
Yun.
Father.
"Well, then, what is it?"
I'd like to see the Crown Prince.
He's gone to see the King.
What?
What's your business here?
Your Grace.
"Now, what did you want to tell me?"
"Father, I have no right to be Crown Prince."
What?
"I have a basic obligation to the Royal House, the court and the nation."
"But I'm quite ill, Father."
I refuse to hide the truth just to keep a crown.
You're ill?
What are you saying?
Yun.
Well?
lf you come to the U.S.
Make sure you stop by Santa Monica beach!
Mr. Bookworm.
I'm not used to this.
Cut! okay!
It's over.
ln Los Angeles
"My filming for the ""Coffee Shop"" MV is a wrap"
"The sunshine, the beach, the sand, everything in general was good"
None
Everything was wonderful.
I think the MV will come out well.
These shoes are too heavy I can't wear them.
"Ah, so heavy."
"Hey, seriously... stop that!"
You look scared for sure right now.
Take one hand off!
- I can't.
- It doesn't look good.
"Look here, kid."
You have to stand up straight.
Don't do that.
This is really dangerous. or you can do this.
Hi.
It's been 3 days in America.
"Ah, my back."
Shall we go?
"Good, really good."
I think I can do it now.
That's a wrap!
Great job.
Great job.
Someone else gave my mouth a six and one third.
What's wrong with my mouth?
"God, I'm having a nervy B."
We've only gone over the plan a gazillion times.
You don't need to have a breakdown.
Just stick to your lines and we'll be fine.
Okay.
How's my hair?
Very Keira Knightley.
"Just get in there, you minger."
"Remember, lower your voice so you sound sexier."
Okay.
"- Hi there, how are you?"
"- Oh, fine, thanks."
- Can I get some onions please?
- Onions.
Red ones?
- Yeah.
- How many?
"Just a pound, please."
- A pound.
- Yeah.
"- These are nice ones, these are."
- Great.
What are you doing?
Jas?
"Hey, Jas."
Quelle surprise.
What a shock to see you here.
I want this brother.
That's fine.
Just stop playing with your hair.
What are cannibals doing here?
Those are also the robots I built.
-Then stop them!
-Well that is...
They will let you go if you pay $100.
This is too much.
Making money even with this?
"If you pay extra $500, they will make you their chief."
How does that sound like?
"Atom, where in the world are you?"
"Hey, Pura."
Where are you going?
Don't go too far.
Pura!
Watch out!
"You must be Zora, right?"
What a suction power!
I could get rid of it if Pura weren't with me.
It's not that smart.
"That's not your mom, Pura."
There it is!
Follow it immediately.
Don't lose it!
Huh?
What is that?
Waterfall...
Let's take a rest.
"Ah, Pura."
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Is something there?
All right.
- The ocean!
- Really?
-You'll be back by nightfall.
Which ocean?
A tumbling open Ocean
We need to be careful.
Since your husband's is cop.
The back seat!
-Why the flowers?
- A present for you!
What's this?
You didn't wear any?
Getting bold.!
Why?
Are you cold?
Cold wind is getting in underneath.
"- Next time, let's really go to Manila."
- Don't joke.
- You don't believe me?
- No I don't.
Shall I make reservations now?
"In the summer, we'll go."
Like a honeymoon.
- I can't go.
-You promised.
I'm in front of my house.
Okay.
I'll be home soon.
-What's wrong?
- Did I leave the stove on?
The rice cooker?
- It only takes him 30 minutes to get home.
What are you doing?
Which is this way to console someone?
What consolation means to the ruined people?
We're goner!
We're ruined!
"I pray to God, why he didn't picked me?"
Those goons could have kidnapped me in place of Radha.
- God!
My God!
She's a young girl!
And that young boy.
Mohit!
Come here.
Just rub my back.
"Mohit, come here, dear."
My God!
Mohit!
Rub my back.
Come here.
"Come, dear."
Come!
Rub my back.
Why are you rubbing it softly?
Do it with pressure.
That's good!
Whatever you say.
But the girl is really nice. t seems we've got a spring in the garden.
Our life passed between thieves and criminals.
But she sings so well!
What a dance!
Wow!
Rub in my front body too.
Never...
I'm a thief.
A goon... a criminal.
I can commit any crime but not this.
Her love is so pure and I'm full of dirt.
A dirt!
"She thinks I'm Kishan and I'm Jackie, the don."
"In her eyes, I'm a police officer."
But actually I'm a criminal.
I'm her father's enemy.
I've kidnapped her.
"No, Goddess."
Don't test me in this way.
Punish me!
Punish me severely.
Kishan!
Kishan!
- That's not my name.
Didn't you hear me just now?
"Yes, I heard it."
I heard everything.
And I also saw what my density is.
Kishan!
"You love me a lot, right?"
"No, I don't love anyone. - you are lying."
"Your craving, your voice, your heart say that you love me."
Radha!
- Kishan!
Radha!
I'm an absconding criminal.
"I'm a sinner, Radha."
I'm a sinner.
- Look out!
- I can hear someone breathing.
- Where?
- There's nobody there.
"- I tell you, I can hear like an owl!"
"- Hey, Mitrofanova."
"Such an important uncle, and you are making a Babylon of your hair!"
You know what I'm saying?
"- All right, Marat."
Go on.
- Maybe it'll sting through the shirt?
- Off with it!
"- And your pants, too."
"- Oh, come on!"
"- What, you think epidemics leave tan lines?"
"Rash all over, except the butt?"
"- Go on, then!"
"- Come on, guys, can't we do it all together?"
- We can!
- Stings like mad!
"- Come on, guys!"
For the win!
"- Oh, man!"
- Okay...
Interesting.
- Pull!
- And again!
- Raise it up!
- Stretch it out!
- Stop.
That's good.
Tie it.
Go.
Go.
- Who is that imposter?
Hello.
"Play it, play it."
"Go ahead, feed Him."
- What's wrong with the mic?
Take a look.
- What's wrong with the mic?
Where's everyone going?
"Go, go."
- No.
Where are you going?
- Go.
Get down.
Play it.
- Wait everyone.
Wait.
Even Siddeshwar Maharaj is asking you to go.
"Go, go, leave."
- Leave me.
What have you done?
"No, papa."
"- Fool, breaking pots during exam times."
"Stop it, stop it."
Go and feed some butter to the Lord.
I won't stop you next time.
Stop you fool!
You'll be punished for your unpardonable sin.
He will punish you Himself.
He will punish you.
Don't try to scare me in the name of Lord.
Could we get off that subject?
"I want us to be friends, Harry."
I want us to trust each other.
Then be honest with me.
"If you knew who he was, would you tell me?"
May.
"Oh, what, Ben?"
Wait.
Aunt May.
"Oh, my."
"Oh, Peter."
"Oh, for a second there, I thought I was years ago."
"Everybody's gone, aren't they?"
Did they have a good time?
I'm sure they did.
You okay?
Of course.
But you go home.
And be careful.
I don't like that scooter thing you drive around.
I'm worried about you.
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.
"Oh, my."
You did?
"Oh, well."
So?
I'm a little behind.
Everybody is.
"Anyway, I don't want to talk about it anymore."
"I'm tired, and you better start back home."
"Here, kiddo."

- What?
"No, I love the air."
"Anyway, with my freeze ray I will stop..."
"- Hey, doc."
"- Moist, my evil, moisture buddy, what's going on?"
Life of crime.
Got your mail.
"Hey, didn't you go on a date last night?"
Conflict Diamond told me you were doubling with Bait And Switch.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It was alright.
I kinda thought I was supposed to end up with Bait but...
I hear you.
I saw Penny today.
You talked to her?
So close.
Just a few weeks from a real audible connection.
I'm gonna ask...
Oh my God!
Is that from the league?
"It's from him, that's his seal, isn't it?"
The leader?
Oh my God!
I got a letter from Bad Horse!
That's so hardcore.
"Bad Horse is legend, he rules the league with an iron hoof."
Still you better give them a call.
They are really worried.
"Especially Cemre Abla, she called me at least 20 times."
- 20?
"- Okay, maybe 10."
Where have you been?
I was worried to death!
Here I am.
"See you, bro!"
"Okay, go on."
Thanks.
God bless.
Your phone was off.
Yunus said he didn't know where you were.
I was scared.
"Here I am, in one piece."
Don't panic.
- Called you father?
- Mhm.
We kept waiting at the gates for you to come out.
"You escaped from us, huh?"
Where did you go?
What did you do?
There was a error.
I just had to fix it.
"That Barış jerk, I fixed him."
I knew you'd do something like that.\
"Don't worry, from now on."
That punk can't do anything to you.
You don't worry.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll prepare some mango juice for you.
"That's the problem, Kishen."
You don't have to make mango juice.
Why?
"- I helped you, didn't it?"
- Yes.
So what can you do for me?
Give my life?
"- No, no."
"- Yes, I can give my life."
"No, no, no."
- I will do it.
Kishen.
Listen.
You will have to do a small favour for me.
"Yes, tell me."
Remember Mala.
Mala.
That witch Mala.
"- Yes, that witch Mala."
You will have to.. - What?
I've to treat her to mango juice.
"- No, no, no."
You've to make her.. fall.
She's already fallen quite low.
How much further do you want me to make her fall down?
"No, no, I don't mean literally."
How do I explain to you?
Yes.
You've to..
No.
"- Oh, God."
"He's a singer, sings in two voices."
Male and female.
- What?
Kitchen Kumar.. how are you?
Where did you get these new set of teeth from?
"Kundan, what a surprise."
- Mala.
Bhikhu.
Where did this duet come from?
I didn't know that Kundan is also going to be here.
"How are you, brother Kundan?"
Mala.
Kishen.
- Mona.
"I am no longer Mona, but Ma Jogeshwari."
You've named a railway station after you.
Since when?
How did you stay with Kitchen Kumar so long?
What can I do?
I thought about it several times.
But its not right to throw the master out of the house.
- What?
Who is he?
"Kundan, he's my son."
Bunty.
But he is very good looking.
Like father like son.
You?
Look handsome?
- I was joking.
You only appear to be.
And that's regretting as well.
Am I looking like a mad person?
No.
The marriage will take place at the decided moment.
The bride will come.
Kasi will bring her.
We share the same blood.
"Boss, Kasi has come."
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
Kasi has come.
Shailaja has come.
Kasi!
Kasi!
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
I know that you will bring her.
You are a true brother.
Tell me where she is.
Brother!
You made me your younger brother.
You also gave me everything.
But I could not do what you wanted.
I came here because he spared my life.
I dont want such a life.
I dont want this life.
No.
Give it to me.
I am telling you.
Get up.
What are you saying?
Are you mad?
"Uncle, he says that he wants to die."
"Aunty, he says that he wants to die."
"Hey, dont die."
"Don't say anything to Cemre, okay?"
Don't let her know.
Or I won't forgive you.
"Okay abla, don't worry."
You said Cemre wasn't going to come.
It seems she changed her mind.
- Hello Sami Amca.
- Hey Cemre.
I thought you wouldn't come.
"I didn't mean to disappoint you, but... here I am."
Let me help.
- Let me help you.
- A moment.
"Could you hold these, Cemre?"
My hand is empty.
- I'll take them back.
- I could help you till the door.
"No no, you give them to me."
You can go sit in the car if you want.
Don't worry about us.
Go see your son.
"Right, for 15 minutes or so."
"Sami Amca, can you give these to Kuzey?"
From Demet and me.
Put in my pocket.
And this is my letter.
- Okay.
- Say him hello from us.
- I will.
- Kiss Kuzey for me.
Let's get in the car if you want.
"Thank you, I'm fine here."
You only have to sign your name.
Don't even have to read it.
Would you help...
No?
How about you?
- Will you lend a caring hand... - Ah!
What?
I was wondering if I could just...
Hey!
I know you.
Hello.
You know me.
Cool!
"I mean... yeah, you do."
Do you?
From the laundromat.
Wednesdays and Saturdays except twice last month you skipped a weekend.
Or... if that was you.
Could have been someone else.
"I mean, I've seen you."
Billy is my name.
I'm Penny.
What are you doing?
Hmmm... texting.
Very important or I would stop.
What are you doing?
"Actually, I'm out here volunteering for the Caring Hands homeless shelter."
Can you spare a minute?
Hum...
"Okay, go."
We're hoping to open a new location soon.
Expand our efforts.
"No, no!"
That family had drowned!
But one guy from that unlucky family had escaped!
Today he is standing in front of you as your death!
Then you will remember this knife too!
I used it to kill your father!
Where is shekhar?
- Who?
Tiger!
"- You will find it in the jungle, sir!"
Where is Tiger singh?
"I don""t know!"
"I don""t know! sir.. his grave is ready!"
- My grave?
Bury him alive!
- I will tell you!
I will tell you!
Tiger singh is in lran!
lran?
"This beauty, o beloved."
"This beauty, o beloved."
ls smitten by you.
Look here.
Let eyes lock.
And let love happen.
"This beauty, o beloved."
ls smitten by you.
Look here.
Let eyes lock.
And let love happen.
I found your love.
This is my fortunes.
It's none of your business.
Sit down.
Look at your friend.
Who got bit by a stroke.
"Yes, Sylvester."
Gaze at her and make her pay.
Pay money?!
See...
Stop laught at him.
Hush!
This is a hospital.
What's the matter?
"Nurse, get him out of the hospital."
Why you call me out?
He's my buddie.
"Good, follow me, sir."
Is it OK?
Don't you play tricks!
We contacted his family... ...but they denied know him.
We found these in his pocket.
Stop looking at him.
What do you said?
Shut your big mouth.
You're a big mouth!
What is this?
These are blood-stayed but they aren't your friend's.
"Mom, let's go look for him."
Look for who?
Your husband.
I saw him with a woman yesterday.
He's got a mistress.
Don't you know that?
"What do you mean, it can't?"
Then name me three philosophers.
What a joke!
You wouldn't even know them if I did...
"Jacques Lacan,"
"Gilles Deleuze, Claude Levi- Strauss."
Herbert Marcuse.
Miss Dewdrop.
You're so cool.
Even pretty and smart.
I want to go back to school again!
- It's awkward.
- I like it.
Wait.
Now what?
It's ridiculous.
We've just met.
You don't seem like the man I've been talking with.
Yes.
I'm that man.
Your first kiss in 8th grade.
"First sex with your husband, age 19."
In someone else's car.
After drinking two cups of soju.
What kind of a man remembers only those details?
That's what men are like.
I know that but...
I liked you because you seemed different.
I thought we'd talk a lot.
Again talk.
What talk!
You're driving me crazy.
Klaus told me to do it and I said no.
"And then, it just happened anyway."
Like it was completely out of my control.
That's why I had your mom call him.
Daddy?
"Hi, Caroline."
"I thought since he could resist compulsion, maybe he could teach me to resist a sire bond."
Can you help him?
I'm going to try.
Why?
Because he made a mistake.
And now he wants to make good.
And I understand that.
Do you want anything else?
A beer?
"Ah, I'd love one, but I've got rounds in 15 minutes."
And a drunk doctor is a bad doctor.
"Well, that depends on what kind of drunk you are."
Angry.
Oh.
Thanks for lunch.
"Yeah, sure."
"Ah, so, um, next time, dinner?"
"Yeah, that would be great."
Cool.
Take care.
Bye.
Thanks.
Who's that?
My doctor.
She's a doctor?
Ooh.
He plays very well.
"And he seems very friendly. yes, Julio, my best friend is very friendly and"
likes all the girls.
Sorry if I missed some chunks.
I've only been learning Spanish for 2 years!
"So here x is 0, y is 2."
So let's see.
3 times 0 plus 6 times 2 is equal to 0 plus 12.
"Doesn't equal 2, it equals 12."
This one doesn't work.
I'm just taking 3 times x plus 6 times y and seeing what it equals.
"In this case, we have 3 times 0 plus 6 times y."
Plus 6 times 6.
Well that's 0 plus 36.
That doesn't equal 2.
Can't be that choice.
"This one, we have 3, this 3, times 1."
Plus 6 times this y.
6 times minus 1/6.
So let's see.
That's 3.
That's equal to 3.
"And then, 6 times 1/6 is 1, but we have a negative out there."
So it's minus 1.
That is equal to 2.
So that works.
3 times 1 plus 6 times negative 1/6 is equal to 2.
So our answer is C.
Problem 29.
Let me see if I need to cut and paste this one in.
All right.
"So yeah, I think it's a good idea."
"Wow, no way."
None
You're wearing a gold necklace today.
Today's fashion is...
This is being filmed.
Why does that matter?
Zelo says his socks are a 'miss' to his fashion today.
So he doesn't want to be filmed.
- Super star Zelo!
"- No, no."
Stop filming.
"Are you playing the ""solitude game""?"
"This must be the ""solitude game"" you enjoy."
How'd you know that?
I'm scared!
I'm scared!
"Dog, you say, ruff!"
It's not a Korean dog.
You're not a Korean dog but hand!
Hand!
"Don't do that, don't do that."
Right.
"Dog will... hand, hand."
I told you not to do that.
This does connect to usb.
- I bought a few LP's too.
- He bought LP's!
- There are more LP discs in Korea.
- I gotta go to Chung-gye-cheon now.
"Finally, we head to our first MV shooting."
None
"- Hey, gimme the room key."
Here we go.
I got to fix my finger.
NARRATOR:
It looks like Lee cut himself and he might be bleeding
Lee:
"Slow down, Lee."
Slow down.
You're going too fast.
You got plenty of time.
Broken in small bits.
"If it's big, it ain't going to get cooked."
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" Yeah, if you got blood in the food then you, you can't serve that, you know."
Lee:
Still bleeding a little bit.
"Now you all, we are ready here."
This...
NARRATOR:
"Hold up, guys."
Hold up.
Lee.
Lee:
You got it.
NARRATOR:
"Looks like you cut yourself while you were cooking there, brother."
Lee:
Yes.
NARRATOR:
Let me see that.
Lee:
Right on top of the thumb.
NARRATOR:
We can't take a chance with blood being in this food and the Cub Scouts eating it.
Give us dinner.
You can go up now.
"Ha Ni, you finished everything too?"
"Yes, I'll finish up the rest."
"Okay, then it's a favor."
Good night.
Ha Ni.
Welcome.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
I want to drink some water.
"Eun Jo, you didn't sleep yet."
"This time, you helped with a lot of things."
Thank you.
Punk.
He has some cuteness to him.
You were here.
I guess I ended up moving back in.
Just don't get in the way.
Okay.
"Ah, you came?"
Why are you still here and not leaving?
I was going to go after finishing this.
Go upstairs first.
"Ha Ni, go up."
"Ha Ni, wait."
"Today, Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work was a success."
Yeah.
"Ha Ni, you haven't eaten dinner yet, have you?"
"I knew it would be like that, so I made these."
"Sit down, sit down."
"Father, sit down please."
Here.
How would you know that?
Because--
"Because we were gonna get married, that's how."
He ever talk about going back to Greece?
All the time.
It was just talk.
He never meant to go.
Think he could have killed him for the passport?
He's been running for two years.
That could change a man.
But why?
"Why the passport if he had the car and $8,000?"
( sighs ) This whole killing thing is hard to buy.
"From everything I can learn, they were friends."
Not no more.
They had a fight.
"Well, Gus found out"
I went into Johnny's room.
Johnny made me go.
"Oh, sure."
( dials phones )
Is this Gus' handwriting?
I wouldn't know.
Hello.
Who is this?
North Shore Clinic.
"Uh, this is the police."
"Will you check something for me, please?"
I'd like to know if you've given a smallpox vaccination to a Gus Priamos recently.
"Uh, Priamos."
P-R-I-A-M-O-S.
This morning?
"From the land of Mathura, where else?"
Glory to Sri Kanji Lalji Mehta.
Glory to you.
As long as people believe in toys like this.. ..our business will prosper.
Kanji.
"This is the God's idol, don't call it a toy."
The Lord is only a delusion.
"- Yes, let's go."
lsn't that Chintu?
Yes.
"Yes, that's him."
- Yes.
Yes.
He's dancing so well.
I'll put an end to all this.
Shut down the shop and get the scooter.
- Yes.
Come on.
- Kanji.
- Yes.
Look after my shop for a month.
Why?
- I'm going on Haj.
I suggest that you get your shop fixed.. ..rather than going on a Haj.
God save me from devils.
Your shop will come crashing down even if anyone sneezes.
Let's go.
- Coming.
Feed them worth 10 rupees.
- Okay.
"Let's go, let's go."
Glory to.. - Siddeshwar Maharaj.
Let him!
What do you mean?
He's got a mistress!
"And a kid, too!"
You let him do that?
Are you not going?
Fine.
I'll go myself.
I'll chop him to pieces.
No sweat!
"Don't do anything stupid, Moon!"
"Moon, don't!"
Leave me alone!
Stop it!
What's are you doing?
Then go with me!
"Listen to me, will you?"
Leave me alone.
Listen to me!
I approved him of doing that.
Stop it!
What?
You approved of hime?
You mean you had know it?
You approved him for the sale of thousand bucks?
"Moon, get on the car."
Where're you heading?
I've no idea.
"In that case, I'll just drop you alone the way."
I've to go to work.
What did you say?
"Did I hear ""work""?"
Whoa.
*(revving engine)*
Aah!
Principal Cooper?
Can you believe these people don't separate their paper from plastic?
"Egbert, down, now."
Just doing... my part to save the environment.
"Liz, wake up."
You've got to help me with my stories.
Your stories?
Don't tell me you didn't write them.
Of course I wrote them.
"OK, so maybe I didn't write them."
Jess.
It's not my fault.
I didn't get in until 3:00.
We went to the movies.
All night?
What did you see?
I don't know.
Russ was in the way.
Anyway...
"Liz, please."
Here's the pen.
I'm begging.
Why can't you do it?
I have to put on my makeup.
You've got two hours.
I know.
"It'll be tight, but I can just skip my bikini wax."
"I'm sorry, Jess, but this is your assignment."
You'll have to do it yourself.
There he is.
(pulsating echo)
Thank God.

"Oh, my God."
Oh... (gasping)
"Oh, my God, no."
Yeah.
Oh.
"Oh, my... what is..."
No.
"Go, go, go, go, go."
"Ah, there he is."
God.
That scared me.
Aw.
Did it just die?
Did the flashlight just die?
"Well, gentlemen, I think it's all over."
"I can't see anything, and he's behind me somewhere."
(footsteps crunching)
It's just a matter of time before he catches me.
"I'm smacking tree-- oh, my God."
"- (high-pitched static) - Oh, my God."
(wheezy gasping)
I love and hate this game so much.
"Ooh, my heart just dropped."

My hand is shaking.
Ksanka's got to go.
Ksanka.
Ksanka!
Get back into your girl's clothes.
You'll go to Zbruyevka.
Maybe she oughtn't to go alone?
Find out how many there are and how long they'll stay.
"You ferry her there and then back, Yashka."
Go to Aunt Darya's.
"Good luck to you, Joan of Arc!"
Why did he call you that Joan of Arch?
What does it mean?
Something like a psychologist.
He knows all sorts of bourgeois words.
Valerka told me they burned that Joan of Arc.
He probably just made it up.
- Ksanka.
- What?
I like you prettier in girl's clothes.
What things you say!
That's right.
What are you doing?
I won't let you go alone.
I'm going with you.
You want to give me away?
Don't argue.
Go back.
Ksanka!
Ksanka!
"Wait, Ksanka!"
What were Danka's orders?
It's not that.
I should stay out of danger.
Run!
Who are you?
I am a lieutenant of the police!
"If you fear this sword, then move aside!"
"I mean, I'll attack you!"
Halt!
What's this?
Why are you here?
I was worried you'd be in danger!
That you'd be caught!
You'll be in danger if you're with me.
So go back!
What about you?
The police are everywhere!
What if they see a lady from a noble house involved with thieves?
I don't care.
Then do what you want.
I don't care.
Who hit me?
Damn it.
What do I do with you?
It's better for you to be a hostage than a thief.
- Move aside!
- Stand your ground!
Move aside.
"If she gets hurt, we'll all be in trouble."
Miss Eun Hye...?
- Follow him!
"- Yes, Sir!"
Miss Eun Hye...!
Miss Eun Hye!
I'm about to lose my house.
Where will we stay?
"On the streets, or in their house?"
Do we have any other option?
Why don't you understand?
"Come on, Jigna."
Sit in the car.
Come.
- He's made a mess of things.
I won't leave papa.
I'll slap you if you refuse.
"- No, mother."
"Come on, sit inside."
Please..
Hello.
Hello.
Who is it?
- Bhagwan (God).
What?
"lf you were a Muslim, I would've said Allah."
"lf you were a Christian, then Jesus Christ."
"You're a Hindu, so Krishna."
"You, here?"
"You're an excellent stuntman, really."
Very good.
I'm sure you're acting is decent as well.
Why don't you approach some television channel?
They keep remaking Ramayan and Mahabharat.
Krishna.
Suited-booted Krishna.
Here to teach me a lesson.
Look.
Where?
Shigu Town.
So?
"Let him go, and I'll get the snakes out."
"Fine, let him go."
"Stop it, or my head will fall off."
Get the snake out.
Let him go first.
Go.
Hurry.
Now.
"Sikong Xuan, the snake has given birth to little snakes, if you kill me, they will remain in your body, for your whole life."
How about this?
"Let me go, and I'll summon a snake out everyday."
"Lingerh told me to find Xiang Yaocha, what's that?"
A person or a herb?
I have no idea.
"Old man,"
What's Xiang Yaocha?
What?
Xiang Yaocha?
You're looking for Xiang Yaocha?
That's right.
"Sorry, I don't know."
Ask someone else.
Wait.
Hand over your money.
I'll kill you if you make a sound.
"You can take everything you want, except this box."
I must bring this to Xiang Yaocha.
What?
You're a friend of Xiang Yaocha?
Take care.
We might not be able to see again until the trial.
You want anything from us?
No.
Just your good health.
Tell the lawyer if you wanna eat anything.
I'll cook and send it over.
"Okay, but it's not needed."
"I took a vow, when you get out of this place... ..."
I will feed orphans.
Look...
Stay away from the prison dogs.
- God be with you.
- Stay away from them.
Inshallah you'll be out after the first trial.
We'll see.
Inshallah.
We got the appointment for 13th of the month.
"Oh that, I got it."
I wish you the best.
Good for you...
"Goodbye, son."
See you.
- See you.
- Goodbye.

"And if anything unwanted comes up in the future, get rid of it."
And I'm sorry.
But I can't wear a skirt for you.
"A baby, crying all night."
"This poor mom, who can't do anything for him, other than to cry outside, so that he doesn't hear her."
"All night the baby cries inside the house, and I cry outside..."
"I love you, baby."
Please don't be sick.
I love you mommy.
Please don't be sick.
Why?
Hwi-chan.
Hwi-chan.
You don't need to do that for Mom anymore.
The nurse came and gave her a shot and some pills.
So you don't have to do that.
"No, when Mom did this for me I got well."
Go on.
-What?
-The song.
"Hurry, hurry and get well."
Daddy's got a healing hand.
Mommy's got a pot belly.
"Hurry, hurry and get well."
Daddy's got a healing hand.
Is anyone here?
- Is nobody here?
-We're the rescue team.
"If anyone's here,just yell."
-Anyone here?
-We're the rescue team.
"Ten, this is 101."
Let's just have a drink.
Alright.
I'll be back.
- Slow.
- Yes.
- Slow.
- Yes.
What are you doing?
We can drink with our clothes off.
At least our tops.
Let's do it when it feels right.
It feels right to me.
"Okay, then I'll show..."
I'll show you up to here... so can't we just stay like this and just talk?
No!
You've changed all of a sudden.
Humans are like that.
Then undress up to there at least.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Why are you undressing?
Let's just do it once.
Do what?!
Just once...
Come this way.
Look.
- This is funny.
Really!
- Let's just do it once.
Look.
Can you buy some more liquor?
We've drunk all.
Why not?
You challenged him to a race.
Look.
He called the lift for you.
All right.
I'll reconsider.
What's up?
Do we have to walk the rest?
Rex wanted to show you he can both call and stop a lift.
I think he's shown me enough for today.
"Hello, Anna."
What are you doing here?
"Mummy, Daddy's here."
"I know, darling."
- Did you come for something?
- Just what we agreed on.
"- One, two..."
- You can take the lot.
I want what I was awarded in the divorce settlement.
They're taking my job off me.
Have you been drinking?
Did you hear what I said?
I've lost my job.
Don't you care?
You didn't ask how Anna and I are.
"Come on, darling."
You're still talking about yourself.
"No, I don't really care."
"Bye, Dad."
I hope we've got enough to last.
Höilerer isn't here.
There should be enough.
- We're fine too.
"- I am fine, son."
- You lost weight.
"- Who, me?"
"No, I think it's just you."
I am as I should be.
- You not eating much?
- I am.
Your mommy brought a lot of nice food.
"I made karnı yarık, börek, mantı."
I made deserts.
You should definitely eat them.
Oh God you didn't have to.
"It is nothing, really."
But don't give all out.
Eat them yourself.
"- Thanks, will do."
- And I brought you cookies and stuff from the bakery.
I left them downstairs.
Eat them as well.
"- Okay, don't worry."
- Don't eat them with an empty stomach.
They might burn your tummy.
Don't listen to her.
You can eat them safely.
"Okay, don't argue at least here."
- Everyone alright?
"- They are, thanks to God."
- Güney says hello as well.
- Aleykum selam.
He wanted to come here so much.
But they let only me.
Yeah.
Thank you.
"I--Yeah, I love--"
I love you too.
I do.
Yeah.
"Yeah, my parents know."
Yes.
"Well, Grandma, they call it being gay now."
"You don't have to say ""homosexual."""
It's not--Yeah.
"Yes, it's not a disease."
Thank you.

"Miss Mu, hurry."
Hurry!
"You aren't going anywhere,"
I'll cut out your hearts and eat them.
You're dead.
You're awake.
Do you want some water?
Did you see my face?
No.
No?
Really?
Why would I lie?
"When I fainted, you could have lifted up my veil."
"I was cleaning up your wound,"
I wasn't aware of that.
You cleaned up my wound?
Then you saw my body?
That of course.
Come here.
You want water?
What was that for?
How dare you see my body?
I'll kill you.
The blood is clear now.
Let me find you some herbal medicine.
Don't pretend to be kind.

- I wish Mom would just stay sick.
- I wish Mom would just stay sick.
My son wishes that I would just stay sick.
"I don't scold him, I don't go drinking..."
How long has it been hurting?
Yes?
- Just... since the accident.
"- No, I don't mean that."
Haven't you had abdominal pain?
It must've been quite severe.
Listen carefully to what I tell you.
I already told your husband.
"Wait a minute, wait!"
Time out!
Wait!
I didn't mean to hit you.
Nice job.
You're the best human sandbag.
Excuse me!
"Sorry, but could you do me a favor?"
- Me?
- Yes.
"If he asks who you are,"
-just tell him you're someone I know.
-Yes...
Yes... hello?
I am...
What is... your name?
"Mi-ryung, Song Mi-ryung."
"Well, I'm an acquaintance of Song Mi-ryung."
And next?
I want to break up with him.
Uh... pink.
"Yes, I have a pink sari. ..."
"But, it has big flowers."
The big flowers will look very nice.
Now go!
Your daughter is very innocent.
Your dream has come true.
"Miss, your airman has come!"
"Renu, are you all right?"
What's happening?
"- Nothing, sir."
Where is Renu?
- She is inside the house.
"I am aware of that but, where is she?"
- She's inside the house.
Are you all right?!
"- Yes, sir."
"Aunty, give me my clothes."
It's getting late.
Suraj will be here soon.
I have arrived.
I thought that it was aunty.
Get out from my room!
Come out.
There's no need to feel shy.
Our wedding is also fixed.
Shameless man!
Impertinent!
Are you going or....
Get dressed quickly.
We are getting late for the function.
Give me something to wear.
"- Okay, come."
Are you blind since childhood?
- Yes.
"Me too. . . . it's okay, don't worry."
It's okay. . .say hello to aunty.
Come.
What is your name?
- Babu.
"Babu, are you Hindu or Muslim?"
Where did he go?
Strange!
I asked him his religion and he disappeared?
It's time for my bus to come.
Who throws such things on the street like that?
Hey guy! . . . idiot!
Why are you. . . .
What are you doing in the middle of the street?
Damn !
What are you doing?
Move!
Move!
Can't you hear?
The traffic has got jammed because of you.
Mangoes?
You sell mangoes?
I don't eat mangoes.
I don't sell mangoes.
The traffic has got jammed because of you.
"If you have finished work, go home."
Why tell me?
I am stuck here.
Why are you troubling me?
You tell me.
He family has abandoned him?
"I've had tried call them, but they denied knowing him."
Moon.
What?
"Hello, Ms.Lee."
Brother is looking for us.
I've got Mr Lee here.
Go ahead and I'll join you later.
See you arroud.
Ms Lee.
Where're you going?
School.
So this is the place.
"What's your old lady, cutie?"
She is out.
Really?
Come in and find out yourself.
Sure I will.
Look at you!
You should be in school!
Look at your nails!
You think you're madonna?
Where's your mom?
"She went play mabjong, I guess."
She has the money to play mabjong but not the money to pay what she owes us?
How much do we owe your bom?
A few thousand dollars are no big deal.
Just the inerest alone will cost you a lifetime to repay.
A few thousand will soon turn into tens of thousands... ...which will then became hundreds of thousands.
Here is 500 bucks.
"My father owed you $5,000."
"- And do you know how many ""Inochkins"" I've got?"
- 263.
Understand?
- I understand.
- Want some fruit punch?
- No.
- Dismissed.
"- Let's go, kids."
- Kids.
"- Hey, swimmer."
Swam one too many?
Too late now.
Here's your ticket.
- Got anyone at home?
- Grandma.
- She in good health?
- Uh-huh.
"- That's all right, then, she'll do."
Will you manage on your own?
I ain't got time to play nanny all day.
The milk will go sour.
"All right, let's say I get there."
Grandma doesn't know anything.
Probably singing some song.
She'll see me and say...
"""Kostya."
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something?"""
- Kostya.
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something? ...and then, of course, ""You'll be the death of me!"""
- You'll be the death of me!
"Yep, here we go."
"""Why did you kill your grandma?"""
"- Don't forget what I told you last night, OK?"
Vural.
- Don't (do something silly).
- OK.
"Naci, take Vural where he needs to go."
- What's the matter?
"- Last night, he kept me up till morning."
- What's his problem?
- He says Kerim didn't do anything.
- Get out of here.
- He meant it.
Selim!
He says that the girl was unconscious.
And Kerim was just sitting beside her.
He was gonna tell Kerim everything but I talked him out of it.
Is he out of his mind?
"- Selim, what are you doing there?"
"- Coming, dad."
He really didn't do it?
God damn it.
Now we're done for!
It's on the Internet now.
We can't stop it now.
It'll be on the newspapers tomorrow.
God damn it!
Did you talk to Kerim?
These idiots don't know where he is.
"I'm calling him, uncle."
He's not picking up.
Stop calling him.
He'll think it's a big deal.
Let him think it's a big deal.
She's getting comfortable.
She's not gonna leave.
[ Finch ]
She reads the articles.
[ Boys Moaning ]
Is she ?
She's goin' downstairs.
[ Moaning ]
"- Oh, my God !"
"- Jackpot, baby !"
- Can you believe this ?
"- Nadia, I would have never known."
I have an announcement that I would like to make.
There is a gorgeous woman... masturbating on my bed !
- [ Finch ]
"Thank you, Nadia !"
"- If you ever had a chance with Nadia, this is it."
- [ Scoffs ]
"What am I supposed to do, Kev ?"
- Seduce her.
Wha-- What the hell would I say ?
Go over there and ask her if she needs an extra hand.
"- That's stupid, Kev."
I can't-- - That's not stupid !
You're stupid if you don't go !
Come on !
Get over there !
"- Get goin', man."
She's prime.
- Get out of here !
- She's waitin' for you.
"- Okay, all right."
Why hasn't he?
"Oh, he's got some idea he's looking for somebody."
Oh.
Passport and all the rest was just to throw us off.
Maybe.
May have planned to change places with Priamos at the last minute.
"They were friends, weren't they?"
They had a fight.
I told you.
You think I'm lying?
They'll be closing the net.
We'd better get downtown.
What about me?
I'll get you a cab.
"Oh, no, you don't."
I'm going along.
I gotta get to Gus 'cause we're gonna get married.
You said he was dead.
"Look, I've got some rights."
"After all, I was the one who called you, wasn't I?"
Yeah.
You were the one.
( somber theme playing )
"Hey, Gus."
"Come on, Gus."
"Are we home, Johnny?"
"No, Gus."
I had to get off the streets.
We're in an alley over by the river.
Are they going to catch us?
Not a chance.
How do you feel?
The money has been paid
When did I say that?
Go now I won't fight， I didn't say I would
She's really got the nerve.
She's special
She'll crush you to death!
Miss， I give up.
I give up
I give up
Beat her
Don't!
Open up
Help， help!
I hate being hit on the chest， you bitch!
Landal， what are you doing inside?
Why so noisy?
Nothing.
I'm composing
Does it sound pleasant?
So-so
What happened?
My brother's still not back.
What about your sister?
Mimi hasn't returned either
You alone?
And me.
What do you want?
I feel a bit lonely
Shall I keep you company?
No.
Good night
Good night
- Showing them a TV.
This is not done.
- That's how I do it.
I sold all TV's.
Only one or two are left.
What are you doing?
Do you intend to loot?
How can they loot like that?
What do you mean by threatening me with a gun?
Keeping a gun on the temple means. . .
Gun?. . .
Gun ! . . .
Neelambar!
You were making a bill and demanding money?
I'll pay you !
Move it. . . move it both sides.
What are you doing?
- Kick him.
"Neelambar, call the police."
Call the police!
What happened?
- Mr. Gorpade has come.
"Mr. Gorpade, they were stealing our TV's and Videos."
Who?
Where?
- Over there.
You always give wrong direction.
- Thieves?
"Constable, arrest them."
Beat them up.
What happened?
"For the first time, while shopping with you, I made an arrest."
I will talk to him.
My boss called you.
You rejected.
So he himself came here.
Why are you sitting without respect?
I am the person who beat your people.
It was not my mistake.
You called me.
I said I will come.. ..after dropping the boy at home.
They tried to hurt the boy.
I will kill.. ..the person who tries to hurt the boy.
Uncle!
"Look here, I am an elderly person advising you."
Obey my words and forget that girl.
Which girl?
- What was her name?
Shailaja.
Shailu!?
Why should I forget her?
Because my boss is loving her.
"Hey, You will not be in Warangal."
In that case I will stay in Karim Nagar.
"Tell me uncle, he is loving her but does she love him?"
Who needs that?
My boss loves her.
That is enough.
It is not enough uncle.
Your boss is loving her.
I am loving her.
She loves me.
So she is mine.
I am an young guy asking you.
Will you answer me?
Come on.
"Now, Cheyney, no more of that."
Wake up.
Stop.
"Come on, get up."
Frank Jordan?
Who the devil's Frank Jordan?
I'm Frank Jordan.
You empty-minded jerk.
What were you doing in the car with his wife and kid?
I'm the gardener.
The boy got hurt in the yard.
I was driving him to the doctor.
Calluses and dirt under the nails.
"Well, that's no millionaire, that's the hired help."
"Congratulations, you got us a real prize, didn't you?"
"Ah, what am I supposed to do?"
The kid was even hugging him.
The gardener.
That's terrific.
"What's he worth, Cheyney?"
"Five dollars, maybe 10?"
"Oh, don't."
Don't.
"Pryor, I wanted."
I wanted to make him sweat out every minute.
What'd you say your name was?
Frank.
"Not a bad looking guy, Frank."
Never mind how he looks.
How long you been with the Pryors?
Tell Kerim to call him.
"OK, a second."
Need a pen...
Where did I put them...
"- A moment, there..."
"- Okay, no need to rush."
I'm writing.
"OK, I'll save it to my cell phone as well."
He'll be waiting for Kerim to call.
- OK.
"- Tell him to go meet him, he'll help him."
- Thanks to him.
- And how are you?
- Do you need anything?
"- No, thank you very much."
"- Good night, see you."
- See you.
Come on.
Get inside.
You'll catch a cold.
Take these on your shoulders then.
"Have your medicine, too."
That lawyer named Münir knows where they are.
He knows or he knows not.
What is it to you?
Just forget about them.
You know what...
I didn't believe a word he said to me.
He's a bastard like the others.
"Look, brother..."
I know it's hard to accept but...
Everyone knows about it now...
"I told you that I don't want to kill anyone, why aren't you leaving?"
Have you forgotten our enemy?
Charge.
Follow me.
"Mercy, please"
I didn't know you're so able.
"Miss Mu, could you slow down?"
I'm afraid.
Let me down.
What was that for?
Shut up.
"I didn't tell you to talk, shut up."
Why?
You are very violent.
Let me go.
I don't want to be with you.
Shut up.
I won't.
Shut up.
I won't.
I'll curse if you don't let me go.
Go ahead if you have guts.
"In my whole life,"
I've been cursed by many people.
Why don't you?
"I pity you, that's why I won't."
"Don't think I'm scared of you,"
"I'll kill you, are you scared now?"
I'm not scared.
"Miss Mu, wait, Miss Mu."
Miss Zhong.
"Of all the people, you want her help?"
Your yenge is calling.
If you say her anything...
What's the matter sir?
You're bothering our customers.
"- It's okay, we're sorry."
"- You can go out, and sort it out there if you want."
It's all right.
It's over now.
"- You couldn't wake up, huh?"
- I wasn't sleeping.
And we departed in the morning.
We're half way there.
- When do you think you'll be here?
- Hopefully before it's dark.
- Where are you?
- We're in a hotel in Beyoglu.
"Okay, we'll come there then."
Is it Fatmagül?
"- What's Fatmagül doing, is she with you?"
"- Give it to me, let me talk with her."
- Her brother wants to talk.
- Give it to me.
Hello?
Hello?
No body is there.
- Abi...
- Are you all right sister?
"- I am OK, are you coming?"
- We're on our way.
We hit the road before the dawn.
Are you OK?
- I think about all the time.
"So, Seung Jo liked Ha Ni all along."
"Hello, Eun Jo!"
You came again?
"Go Ri, hello!"
"It's not Go Ri, it's No Ri!"
That's right.
"Hello, No Ri!"
Hello.
I brought cake to give to you.
"So Ri, you're going to eat too, right?"
"No Ri, No Ri!"
I'm sorry.
I'm not that smart.
"No, it's okay."
"Everywhere I went, the hospital rooms were so quiet that it was no fun."
"But, it's fun and nice here."
"No Ri, have you been in the hospital for a long time?"
"Yes, about 1 year and 2 months."
"So, they said I have to repeat fourth grade."
Really?
"Then, I'll teach you your homework."
You're going to teach him?
Do you think that makes sense?
He's an elementary school student.
So rash.
Dummy how can you?
I can at least teach him the multiplication table.
I finished the multiplication table in 2nd grade though.
Really?
It's going to be more harmful than anything.
Let's just eat the cake.
Thank you.
Don't hurt her.
Ow... my leg hurts.
It's hard to walk with this.
"Well, it's a part of the plan."
"Dow, your leg is not lame."
I never thought you would be this stupid.
Ha ha.
"Why don't you kill me now, you lying bitch."
- Don't you dare call her that.
- Lying bitch.
Are you insulting my wife?
What?
What?
Let's go Rung.
I'm so sick of his face.
"Just a minute, Dow."
Let me take my revenge.
"You forced me to call you ""lord"""
I'll get you back now.
"Hey, what are you going to do?"
I'll leave this with you so you will think of me.
"Call me ""Baron"""
- What Baron?
- You won't call?
"Call me ""Ananda"""
"Call me ""Ananda""."
- I command you.
- Ow...
"Now your life depends on the weather, Che."
"Let's go, Dow."
"Let's go, Rung."

And now the speeches again.
- He urgently requires blood transfusion!
Who?
Who here will give their blood?
What blood type do you have?
- A!
- And you?
- AB!
- And you?
- B!
"- We need blood type ""XZ!"""
It's an extremely rare blood!
And here is where I come out.
- Me.
"I have blood type ""XZ."""
- And you will spare your rare blood?
- I will.
"And here, of course, everyone will applaud."
- Inochkin.
Inochkin!
You used to be my blood enemy.
And now you are my blood brother!
But I still won't let you come back to the camp.
You went swimming in the forbidden area!
Nothing I can do.
Inochkin!
Inochkin!
- Inochkin!
- It's movie night.
We'll go all together!
Nobody will see you in the dark.
I don't know.
Maybe because I'm so lonely?
"Is your husband quiet, too?"
My husband?
As he walked out of the wedding hall he closed his mouth and he's been quiet ever since.
"Ah, It's cold."
Don't.
You're going to get my clothes wet.
Stop it.
My shoes are all wet.
So what!
They're not mine.
You look lonely.
I'll buy lunch today.
Whatever you want!
"But, at student cafeteria."
"They're freshmen, aren't they?"
How do you know?
Because they look tacky.
It's good!
"Back in my day, it wasn't."
"Did you go to college, too?"
Why?
Anything say that I can't?
"No, of course not."
What was your major?
What do you think?
I don't know.
Philosophy.
Huh?
It can't be!
Brat...
"Mom, don't die..."
"Mom, please don't!"
Mom...
Don't die!
I'll behave from now on.
Ms. Eom Ju-young?
I'm from a separation agency.
You know Park Hwi-chan?
I was sent by him.
"I was going to quit this work, but since he's my last client, I came especially for him."
Now...
I'll deliver the message from Mr. Park Hwi-chan.
"Hwi-chan doesn't want to separate from you, Ms. Eom."
This is an unusual case.
Hwi-chan wants you to stand up again.
Who?
Park Hwi-chan.
My son.
Yes...
Your son has one more thing to show you.
And that is...
Didn't he draw it well?
He said he couldn't draw you well before... because you are too pretty.
Are you okay?
"Hwi-chan says he'll do what you say, keep his diary, and won't tell lies anymore, so please..."
Tell my son...
Thank you... for drawing me... so well.
I will.
Mom...
Mom...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Have a seat.
Ay!
Ay! &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;All you needed to do was open your mouth.
I can't lie.
Smart ass!
What should we eat?
Uh...
How about ribs?
I like rib patties.
That is slightly...
Then do you want to have sushi?
I know a great place.
"Their fried fish is also good. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;And, they also have Yeongdeok snow crab."
"Even that... for the time being, no..."
Then what do you want to eat?
What about pizza?
Pizza?
We haven't had it lately.
"Oh, Pizza sounds great."
Really?
Then where should we go?
How about Marco's?
Their pizza is good!
That place is expensive.
Let's go where we always go.
Ah!
The pizzeria at the crossroad?
Hey!
There is no place to sit there.
"Baek Go Dong, let's go somewhere else."
Somewhere else!
Forget it.
Go there!
It's a great site.
"Earthquake's got a thing on there, oh my god."
"Oh, I know, I always go."
"That's another thing too, there's like, there like a top link on their US business site, so that the, like, uh, the top thing that's come out."
Visited.
Yeah.
"Let's say, right now."
Have you ever been to
California?
4.5.
There was one last night too.
"It's So it, so it just ended?"
It just happened right now?
Yeah.
"Just now. ,, , What part of California do you live in?"
Los Angeles What?
"Oh, okay."
"Oh yeah, I see where it came from."
I'm just looking at the epicenter.
Yup.
"Or we can do it online, god, geez."
"Yeah, we're coming to"
"California in a, a few weeks here."
"We're in the middle of a heat wave right now and we had an earthquake last night and, and earthquake today."
And I'm just hoping that this earthquake is not a harbinger of a big one.
"Oh, oh."
I hope not.
Yeah.
Oh.
"Oh, the, the, yeah."
Cuz that's.
A big earthquake.
- Don't hit me!
Don't hit me!
- Come here right now!
- Come any closer and I'll jump and kill myself!
- Hey.. this is the first floor.
You won't die.
Ah..
It's the first floor.
Don't come any closer.
Don't.
Come over here right now!
Mom..
You dirty bastard.
Why did you bring my mother?
Why bring my poor mother here?!
I'm gonna kill myself!
Listen bitch!
Do that in your own home!
Why you!
Bitch!
You call yourself a friend?!
"You bastard, you fooled around, too!"
Remember?
He secretly loved a woman for 3 years.
And I couldn't even tell anyone... ...because I thought my mom would worry...
-Why the hell are you here?
- Come here now!
- Do you have no shame?
The neighbors!
-What's the big deal?
It's not our neighborhood.
- Come on.
Why not?
That's because he's your younger brother.
You're my daughter.
I'm your real father.
Nonsense.
I don't believe this!
We have different surnames.
My child
"No matter what your surname is, you're indeed my daughter."
"I have a jade pendant here, it's the same as the one you're carrying."
They're the love tokens of your mother and l;
Take a look.
Mother.
Mother.
What's going on?
It's all because of your father.
Do you know that?
Miss Mu is your elder sister.
What are you doing?
Royal Uncle asked us to keep you under watch.
Yellow Robe Man...
Canglong.
Back off.
I'll deal with them on my own.
Move over.
Let me deal with him.
Moonlight Palm.
"If I jump, then there is nothing to worry about."
Catch her.
What are your wicked plans?
Senior.
Where are we taking them to?
- Okay!
Did he say something?
Forget it.
"Okay, you handle these customers, I'll go to the counter."
What if anyone steals something.
What do you want?
- TV and Video.
I bought this clock from you.
It came with a guarantee of one year.
Then come after one year.
None of its needles move.
What?
- None of its needles move.
I'll repair it for you in a jiffy.
Key.
Here's the key.
The parts of this car are no good.
"- This was not a car, it was a clock."
Clock?
Shouldn't you have told me before?
And why did you bring a clock here?
You should have taken it to a clock shop.
Strange man.
You bought so many things?
- Yes.
Just a minute.
"Okay, I'll make the bill, you make the payment."
Bill?
- Yes.
Pay him money.
"- Here, take."
What are you doing?
Thank you.
"Take it, man."
Take it.
It's my habit to help poor friends.
"Keep it, man."
"- No, thank you, sir."
Your size is smaller than mine.
As my chest is wider than you.
Neither my poverty nor your friendship can cover it.
Hey... this guy is self-made.
I like it.
Is this your bike?
"- Yes, it's mine."
Which model?
- Yamah Rajdoot 350.
"It's a very good bike, sir."
A latest model of our company.
No 1 bike in India.
Indian bike!
Indian bike is a Indian bike!!
"Shit tank, shit tyre!"
And shit model!
"What nonsense is this, Jimmy?"
"Don't get angry, darling."
He's right.
Indian is Indian and foreign is foreign.
"Now see, this foreign metal."
It's very strong.
You can punch it anywhere.
Nothing will happen to it.
Hit it here or there...
Keep hitting... keep hitting anywhere.
- I did everything for you!
"I did everything, what else do you want me to do?"
"For God's sake, Basha."
Is your heart that cold?
"I beg you, answer me!"
What?
Answer me!
Popoy stop it!
Basha...
I love you.
And it hurts.
Take me!
Right now!
Take me right now!
Hello?
Where are you?
Huh?
Where?
"I've been going around here over and over, where are you?"
I'm coming.
You keep saying you're coming but I still can't find you!

E B B and T I D E
I say whoops!
Don't take tings granted..
"It could be really bad, at the end."
"What are you saying , man?- Don't use every opportunity, to come close to Mira."
I don't want to see you next to her again.
"Man, Nylon (Plastic), Whom are you threatening?"
"Get away from my girlfriend, otherwise I will cut your legs."
"Man, i would chew you on this soil and plant parsley over your body."
Leave..
Tell me.
- No.
"Kanji, what are you doing?"
Why are you scared?
Take the gun.
"Get down now, come on."
The phone's ringing again.
Forget it.
You switched of your mobile.. ..that's why they're calling on the landline now.
Tell them I am not at home.
They say if we don't arrange for the money.. ..we'll have to vacate the house in a month.
I had so many dreams.
I wanted to make Jigna a pilot.
And my son a cricketer.
But soon I'll even lose this house.
Everything's lost.
Everything will be fine.
What will be fine?
All I have is the shop property.
"I'll sell that and repay the mortgage. "" Om Jai Jagdish Hare. """
""" Swami.. """
Yes.
"Yes, he's here."
It's Nimish.
- Who?
Who Nimish bhai?
- The estate agent.
Oh yes.
"Yes, Nimish."
Go ahead.
Did you find a buyer for that property?
What are you saying?
"Oh, this is a deathtrap right here, I swear."
"Okay, I'm just gonna leave that place."
"Oh, God, there he is."
(high-pitched static)
I knew I shouldn't have gone towards the tunnel.
"Oh, no, I'm in a fence."
"Oh, my God, what am I supposed to do?"
"(gasping) Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
He's gonna find me.
"- ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, my God."
(high-pitched static) (footsteps crunching)
"- ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
I don't see him. - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh!
Oh-ho!
- (high-pitched static) - What the heck?
Please don't be in here.
"Oh, my God."
I thought there was something behind me.
(laughs) (sighs) Okay.
(pulsating echo)
"Oh, no!"
No!
No!
No!
- No!
No!
No!
- (high-pitched static) (muffled scream)
What's that for?
It's my granddad's cross.
It'll keep trouble away.
I'm off.
Go ahead.
You abandoned her!
You hear?
You got cold feet.
Say something!
Tell him he's a coward!
Shut up.
"You mean, everyone run for your life?"
- Yashka couldn't have helped.
- You would've abandoned her too?
What's the use?
He'd have got caught himself and not saved Ksanka.
For shame...
Wait for me here.
"If I'm not back by evening, you come..."
Valerka.
Who's there?
"It's me, Father Mokei."
Danka?
Thank God...
I thought you'd followed your father.
I'm still alive.
Everybody's gone mad.
They threw the bell-ringer from the belfry for spite.
The bell's not been rung since Christmas.
- What are you here for?
- Looking for my sister.
She's at the inn - a waitress.
- Don't hurt her.
- I'm not going to.
We have to get out of here.
They won't take me.
They won't take me.
Not again.
No!
No!
Manuel!
No!
No!
Manuel!
Hello?
"Pablo, where are you?"
"Malena, listen."
The son-of-a-bitch who's behind this is connected with the military.
Where did you find the diary?
What the fuck does that matter?
"- In the car, right?"
- So what?
"Pablo, do me a favor and just for once try and think with your head."
Who could have written that diary?
Think about it.
"No, not that, Malena."
Dad was a son-of-a-bitch.
"He may have been a son-of-a-bitch to you, but not to me."
I was thinking...
"Imagine he had the diary, but he found it and it wasn't his."
Whose was it otherwise?
Some other doctor's.
How should I know?
Give him a break.
"So, it starts with level one, holding hands."
"Two, arms around waist."
"Three, good night kiss."
"Four, kiss lasting over three minutes without breath."
"- Five, open mouth kissing."
"- Number six, tongues."
"Oh, my God."
"Seven, upper body fondling outdoors."
Eight...
"Oh, my God."
I've gone all jelloid.
- Who are those fitties?
"- They're well beyond fit, they're lush."
They are sex gods.
- They must be newbies.
"- Ace Gang, it's boy-stalking time."
Ladies?
- They have mushy peas and chips.
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, definitely."
I want them!
You're here.
You're late.
Get changed.
We're going on a family outing.
- Do we have to?
"- What do you mean, do we have to?"
You used to love doing things with the family.
"Georgia, don't start, not tonight."
We're going to the Bonker's Buffet and your granddad's coming as well.
"Oh, look out."
"Oh, no."
Did you think I wouldn't know?
Did you think I was that stupid?
I knew you looked familiar!
I should have known then!
I knew that you knew me!
I'm really stupid.
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
"Was it you, Chief?"
Don't try to trick me again!
I know everything!
"Long time no see, Doe Eyes."
So it was you!
Have you become a bandit for the people?
- I guess you can say that.
- I'm so glad to see you!
You're amazing!
We should rush your marriage to In Hyung.
I'm not interested in it.
You do what you have to.
This marriage was never what I wanted anyway.
Alright then.
Go and rest.
How do I get rid of that little...!
- But you're hurt.
- I'm alright.
It's alright if it hurts.
Miss Eun Hye!
"I heard you were safe, but I still had to come."
- Are you hurt?
- Go back.
I will do everything in my power to catch the man who did this to you!
How?
Let's call it even if I go to bed with you.
500 bucks?
"You're not telling me that it'll cost $4,500 to get laid with you?"
What do you think you are?
Julia Roberts?
Let me get it straight.
I nerver paid for getting laid.
Come on!
There's no one it the house except us.
Relax!
I won't hurt you.
Answer me.
What color is your panty?
Guess.
Black and white.
Show me.
What's that?
This is no panty.
What the best!
Let's get on with it.
Why are you laughing?
Something funny going on here?
"Must be your mom, isn't it?"
She wants to put me into jail?
"You only listen to your mom, don't you?"
You'll regret this: it's my first time.
Your first time?
Are you pulling my leg?
Every girl I've fucked told me it's her first time.
You think this is the Middle Ages?
First time my foot!
"It's my first time, too -- I mean for today."
Really?
"There're so many of us, we're not afraid of her sword."
Right...
Eat...
"They want to kill her, what now?"
"If she dies, then no one could save Miss Zhong."
Right.
"I'll send her a message first, then she won't kill me."
Waiter.
For the bill.
"""Shigu Town"""
This is it.
Anyone home?
"There're eight people coming to hassle you,"
I'm here to give you this message.
Anyone home?
You are...
"Don't be so sneaky, get in here!"
I have...
"I know that they're going to hassle you, that's why I rushed here."
But it's too late.
What's your name?
Tuan Yu.
Any last wishes?
You better tell me now.
"There's a young lady called Zhong Ling, she's trapped by the Poisonous Moths Clan... at Wuliang Hill, she sent me here for you."
"Don't waste anymore time, better go."
Get out!
I don't want to kill anyone today.
What are you talking about?
Go.
After her...
He studies to be a journo.
His old man is a journo.
What's the fucking difference?
You let one of them get in with us.
- I wasn't trying to get anything.
- You shut the--
I don't care who he is or what he's done.
You don't do someone on the deck.
"What's fucking wrong with you, eh?"
"He'll bury us all and, what, you just gonna sit down and watch him do it?"
No.
"No, Steve, you're the Major."
You started this firm.
"I'm speaking for all the boys, we got the biggest ruck... ...of our lives coming up and your brother's too much of a bottle job to lead us."
The GSE is Pete's firm.
All right?
He calls the shots.
Yeah?
"Well, fuck the lot of you."
GSE?
Get out of the fucking way!
Move!
Get yourself cleaned up.
Tommy.
"This is it, mate."
We'll finally get back at those fucking Hammer cunts.
Millwall!
Millwall!
Millwall!
Millwall!
Millwall!
Millwall!
Happy birthday.
You need it more than I do.
"No, I can't take that from you."
"Yes, you can!"
You can take this money from me.
"For God's sake, is not much."
"Now, take it!"
And don't you dare leave it here.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Is just that I miss your uncle Ben so much.
Can you believe that is two years next month since he was taken?
"I think to myself at times... ...were I to face the one responsible for what happened, I'd..."
"Oh, I don't know what I'd do."
Now... ...you better take the rest of your cake home.
Hey.
Hey.
You're still here.
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.
Don't be.
Is nice.
I get to see you every day now.
"I liked seeing you tonight, Peter."
"Oh, boy, yeah."
"""Oh, boy, yeah"" what?"
Nothing.
Do you want to say something?
I...
...was... ...wondering if you're still in the Village.
You're such a mystery.
Peter.
"You, don't tickle me!"
Don't tickle me!
Don't tickle me!
I'm going to kill you.
I have to start from the toe...
"This won't do, you make me laugh."
Put on a serious expression!
Serious!
I bought some!
This way.
Oh!
They're made in China.
I can't trust them.
They're okay.
"If you're nervous, I'll use two."
I don't use any Chinese products even at home.
- Wait!
- Now what?
The buttons can't get ripped.
Wait.
Let me catch my breath.
I'm breathing so hard I think I'm going to suffocate.
You're really nervous.
Can't we just have a drink?
You want me to go buy some?
We can have it delivered.
No.
I'll go buy some.
Delivery's expensive!
Just have it delivered.
No.
I'll just go out and get some..
I served four years instead of one.
I won't let you bully this boy.
It's not like everyone will experience what you did.
Right?
Don't talk!
Don't talk!
"Okay, stop it guys."
Don't stir up trouble.
"No need to make it a big deal, brother."
We're just joking around.
"It's okay, abi."
It isn't that important.
Don't be in bad terms with anybody because of me.
- You here for how long?
- One and a half year.
- Why?
- Homicide.
"A matter of honor, abi."
I killed the guy I saw with the girl I love.
May God save you.
"- Shall I enter, abi?"
Shall I?
"- Okay, come in."
"Okay goes, keep it up."
Where are you?
"Okay, I'll be there soon."
Canım...
Welcome.
We have two hours before the meeting.
Come let's get away for a while.
- Burak was here.
"- What, why did he come?"
A woman by the water took off her clothes and...
"You love me, don't you?"
Don't talk nonsense.
Love?
"In the chat room, yes."
Not in reality.
No.
"I love you, too."
Alright?
I love you.
Don't go.
"Love, my ass!"
Bastard.
"Are you selling out love now, too?"
You bastard.
You deserve it.
I love you.
For real.
What happened with the college student?
- He's going off to complete his army duty.
-Why?
All of a sudden?
He's running off from my husband.
That hurts.
"If the sun comes up will he come, When the wind blows he'll leave."
"When I look at you, you're ignoring me."
Please wind stop blowing.
Why are you eating everything?
Stop eating the bone.
"It's no use holding you, you just go away."
Please wind stop blowing.
I don't know
"If you don't want to do it, just say so."
It's so tacky hedging like this.
I'm not good at talking.
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Do you know howl feel every time I go home after we meet?
No.
What do you think?
You don't think about that?
No.
Your underwear.
Can't you give me a call when you're not coming home?
It's not a big deal.
- Eat before you go.
- That's okay.
I'll just go.
Where are you going?
I'm going to look for a job.
You never last three days.
"Still, I'm going to look."
I don't want to shrivel up and die at home like this.
- It's tingling.
"-Why, why, why?"
"Ah, My beard?"
- Yes.
Go shave!
- I don't want to.
- Go shave!
Go now!
- Let's just do it.
- Don't get it on me.
- Come here.
"You don't know, but I do."
I'd string up his dead body if I had my way.
"He was a bastard, that pa of yours."
"Here, drink."
Danka's a long time in coming.
Don't worry about him.
Valerka!
Valerka!
"Wait, Valerka!"
- Hear that shooting in the village?
- So what?
Could anything have happened to Danka?
"You're no psychologist, Yashka."
"They're shooting wild, without any aim."
Just to keep their spirits up.
"What kept you so long, Danka?"
What's wrong?
I hurt my back.
The Whites are in Zbruyevka.
- Many of them?
- Lots.
- Come for long?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you find out?
I couldn't stay there.
Lyuty recognized me.
- What do we do now?
- Go scouting.
I'll go.
There're 40 houses in Zbruyevka and not a single man or boy left.
"Some have joined the Reds, some the Whites."
If one of us boys went they'd quickly spy us.
- 30 minutes?
We can get there before he arrives.
How can we get there in 30 minutes?
Don worry.
"Oh, just leave it."
It won't explode.
- It probably will.
- Really?!
"Oh, no."
Why is it so loud.
Who is it..
What the hell?
What's he doing here...
How?
- Don't open the door!
"Hey, why is he here?"
- He happened to call I told him you're here.
- Go home and fight it out!
- Crazy bitch.
Hurry up and leave.
Do you know how many days you've been here already?
- My husband told me to send you home.
- Crazy bitch.
Tell him I'm not here.
You're crazy.
Hurry up and come out.
- Hey!
That man might kill me!
- Then beg him to kill you first!
"- I beg him to do that, he might really do it!"
- Then beg for your life instead!
Whatever!
I said stay there.
You hear me?
Where's my mommy?
"She's gone, but..."
I can't do it.
I can't fucking do it!
Your mommy... told me she'd be back soon.
She said you have to be good... and wait for her here.
Okay?
- You're a liar.
She's not coming back.
- I promise she is.
I'm scared.
Don't leave me here alone.
The son-of-a-bitch!
"Stop, please!"
Where are you?
I don't want to see her die again!
"Please, I beg you."
Help me.
Please.
This is yours.
"January 11, 1974."
There's a problem with your brother's certificate... we couldn't find it.
"You said he was born in June 1980, but it's not here."
What do you mean it's not here?
"He may not have been born here, or it could be a mistake."
"However, we just moved here and everything still has to be saved on the computer so..."
Pablo?
God.
We found your brother's car this morning in the woods 20 miles away from Tolhuin.
It'd been there all night.
Then buy me a long line at least.
About 500 meters long.
So I can drag the line along to make phone calls.
This is so awkward.
This really is awkward.
My face's burning.
My lips are so dry.
You look Handsome.
"Hey, I showed you my picture."
I couldn't even see your face.
You're really young.
Are you sure you're married?
I told you I married when I didn't know better.
I am a young miss.
You're very beautiful.
Thank you.
"You're very handsome, too."
And so honest.
Nuts.
This is nuts!
Excuse me?
Nothing.
Just talking to myself.
This is nuts.
This coffee is strong.
"You're 21, then what year does that make you?"
Sophomore.
- Have you dated before?
"- By that, do you mean..."
- if I slept with anyone?
- Yeah.
- Really?
"Yes, sure."
"No, father."
Mother has told you not to play flute.
You just keep quiet.
Can't you see sir is going to pay us a big amount.
"C'mon, sit down."
"- Yes, go ahead."
Father!
Father!
- That's it?
Are you done?
Pasha sir!
I'll play flue.
Let me rest for some time.
"No, father."
You will not play flute.
I'll play it.
"Pasha sir, I'll play flute."
Will you play flute?
"C'mon, go on."
Ramu!
Your wife died.
Father!
"No one understand the language of flute, my child."
They only understand the language of stick.
Only of the stick.
"C'mon, I'll teach you my language."
"You name is Jaikishan, right?"
- Yes.
"But I'll call you only Kishna, you know why?"
Because you play such nice flute.
From where did you learn it?
- That's not right.
I'll cook the food and serve you too.
Now go and take a bath first.
You all look like goons.
"We're goons, we'll look like goons."
- What?
He means that we've taken up a disguise of goons.
So we must look like one.
- Oh!
That's fine.
But I didn't ask your names. - your?

"Whatever you say, but she's so charming."
Remember one thing.
We should not forget our objective for this girl.
This girl will not stay here for 18 days.
- I got stuff to do.
Did you go back to that night club?
The place where you did pole dancing.
No...
I would really like to watch you.
You lost your chance.
What if I insist...
What if I gave you presents?
Wouldn't you dance for me?
Just once?
Doesn't your wife wait for you at home?
Cemre left home.
We are divorcing.
"Besides, all her roads go to north (Kuzey)."
- Where are we going?
- To my house.
Okay...
"Hüseyin Bey, sorry for the trouble."
"I could come and get it, you didn't have to Huseyin Amca."
I was kinda worried about you.
Since I didn't see you at the shop today.
- Hoped you didn't get sick or something.
"- No, no."
Not sick or anything.
I just didn't feel like going to work.
So I took a day off.
Why don't you come in?
Let me offer you a coffee.
"Thank you but, I shouldn't."
Zeynep will be home soon.
She works too much these days.
She gets tired.
"And now, I will alone shut down all his shops.. ..or my name isn't Kanji Lalji Mehta."
And this isn't my concern for you.
It's a direct warning.
Yes.
"You're safe here, it's a government property."
But how will you escape them?
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Sir.
The case has been accepted.
I'm worried about Sushila and the children.
"I'll take a cab, you go."
But how can I leave you alone.
"I'm going to the police station, for protection."
Drop her home as well.
Go.
"Be careful, dear."
"Go, go, go."
Are the boys ready?
Remember.
Kanji shouldn't get to see daylight.
That's it.
There he is.
"Catch him, beat him."
Don't let him go.
"Wait, where are you running to?"
He's hiding there.
They were only a first pass.
You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied.
"Not to worry, I'll redo them."
"Oh, Rarity."
You don't have to do that.
They're fine.
I want them to be better that just fine.
I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
Are you sure?
"I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose."
"Oh, it's no ???."
"Really, I insist."
"Well, in that case..."
"Thank you again, Rarity."
What have I gotten myself into?
Hello?
"You wanted to see me, Rarity?"
Fluttershy!
Your new-new gown's ready.
I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it.
What do you think?
I... ...love it.
"Oh, you're just saying that."
"No, no."
I do.
It's... nice.
"""Nice""?"
Nice.
"If you don't like it, you should just tell me."
"Oh, but I do like it."
Like it or love it?
Um... both?
"- Yes, sir. keep my luggage inside."
"Daddy, I am so sorry I am late."
You are always late!
"Have a seat, dear!"
"Mr. Rajesh, meet my daughter seema."
I have already met her in a pleasurable way.
l..
I am still ashamed for that.
You are embarrassing me by saying this.
Please have a seat.
- Thank you.
Great!
Have this.
- Thank you!
Not so much!
Enough!
- Have some more!
You too have some.
My plate is already full.
I will take.
But you are not eating at all.
I am eating it.
"Enough, seema!"
- Please!
Thank you!
You too have some!
"- No. lt""s okay."
"Look, don""t feel shy. otherwise I will think that you are still angry with me."
You are giving me so much food.
I will have to go to the hospital from here.
"lf such a situation arises, then I will be your nurse."
You can surely kill me.
"Why can't you harness that strength to eat?"""
"""But why?"
"Why do I need to eat?"""
Captain Carpenter.
"I would like to talk to Lieutenant Gerard, please."
Lieutenant Gerard isn't here.
Be glad to take a message.
I'd like to talk to him.
"It's about this fellow, uh, Kimble."
Kimble?
You have something on Kimble?
I sure have.
I'd like to say it to the lieutenant.
I'm afraid you'll have to say it to me.
Lieutenant Gerard's out of town.
SOPHlE:
"I never liked him, right from the beginning."
"So when I saw this picture, I called the cops."
"You think he killed your friend, Priamos?"
Sure he killed him.
"Gus found out who he was, so he killed him."
"He's been spotted before, and he didn't kill."
"What do you mean, ""didn't kill""?"
"He killed his wife, didn't he?"
The law says he did.
Okay.
"So if Gus ain't dead, where is he?"
He hasn't been seen all day.
"The car's gone, and the money's gone."
Where's the money?
What money?
"Gus had 8,000 bucks."
"Yep, and now they'll do speeches."
"""When he was a little boy..."""
"- When I was a little boy... ...he, of course, ""also had a grandma."" - ...I also had a grandma."
"And in his whole life ""he couldn't, and I could."""
"- But in my whole life, I could not manage to disappoint her to death."
But he could!
"And thus, Kostya Inochkin began his clandestine life."
"- Hey, Nelya."
Do you know how to dance Charleston?
- All girls here can.
- Can you show me?
- All right.
- Can you teach me?
"I can teach you something, too."
- Want me to teach you telepathy?
- What now?
"- You know, make people do stuff with your mind."
"- Kosmos, Kosmos!"
Come here!
- Try to make him do stuff.
- Easy.
Like what?
"- I don't know, something."
- Hang on.
- Dolt.
"- I swear, that wasn't me."
He did that on his own.
- There's something in there!
- Smells like a wolf.
Or a badger.
- Have you ever smelled a badger?
- A hundred times!
- Do you have an superstitions like that?
- No.
"- So it's fine, then?"
- Yes.
It's fine.

You're not playing.
- No.
You're opposing me?
Fuck off.
Take that back.
Take that back.
"- What's your problem, bro?"
- Take that hand away.
"Lay a hand on that boy again, I'll rip your hand off."
"- They are just joking around, abi."
- They won't joke around from now on.
No one will raise a hand against this boy again.
No one will make him do their stuff from now on.
"- Abi, it's not a big deal."
- It is a big deal for me!
It is a big deal.
"What is going on, brother?"
What is your problem?
"You are my problem, dick heads."
I ruined my youth not to be like him.
Too modern.
Too empty.
Too touristy.
Your knees gone yet?
- Not yet.
What are you doing here in Paris?
It's our wedding anniversary.
And you only have time just for each other?
Shut up!
Idiot.
You make my blood boil like nobody else!
Sign of a deep connection!
Once the kids have gone...
What's left of us?
Beckett says  'Do we mean love when we say love?'
What else do we mean?
That's stupid.
Oooh!
"- Oh God, Nick!"
You cannot love and hate the same person.
[laughing]
- It really hurts!
Usually in the space of 5 minutes in my experience.
I think we've earned a very good time.
People don't change.
They do.
They can get worse!
[French accent]
"Do I please you, monsieur?"
Here's the bill.
- That is quite a lot of money.
Get your coat.
If you can't trust your wife that much then go live happily by yourself.
What do you mean who?
"It's my friend, Misook."
Here check for yourself.
Hear that?
Bye!
Oh my god.
It flipped over.
"Uh, What happened?"
How old is your kid?!
- Eight!
- How old?!
First grade?
-You met him through the Internet.?
- He was closer than my husband...
I wasn't sure who my real husband was.
I'd get so confused...
You lived in a total illusion.
"Anyhow, love is an illusion!"
"You liked him so much that he felt burdened, right?"
Or Are you...maybe a perv?
Do you like to hit?
Or like to be hit?
Maybe to be bounded?
"- Um, isn't that the College guy?"
"- Uh, it is..."

No Abi.
No one got arrested.
"Ok, Ok."

How much do you make out of rooster fights?
Is it enough?
I always find a way to make money.
"I should find a new way for you to make money, Kibrit."
You're right.
But all the ways are taken.
It's a heavy traffic.
"Harun said I had to go, but I am not going."
You... ...only thought of us...
"It is enough, my daughter..."
There is nothing left to do for your father..
We have to wait for the hearing...
"Look, my darling."
There are people who can take care of us here..
Don't think of us.
Think of yourself from now on
Your husband. ..it is not good to leave him alone.
- Go - I won't go..
What are you are going to do?
Narin..

"You went to Serdar, didn't you Narin??"

"Go, my daughter."
"I am Baek Sung Jo, Baek Sung Jo."
"At a time when she's not even thinking, when she bites her tongue..."
That's when it's easy to get them to fall for you!
When she bites her tongue.
"Hey, Hey!"
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Why are you doing this?
This is practice.
Practice?
The timing is important.
Look at this.
If the girl says
"""What is this?"
"What are you doing?!"" then you put your hands like this"
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me."" and just go in for the kiss."
Hey!
"You have talent, it's very real."
- Really?
"- Wow, so if the girls say ""What are you doing?"""
"Then, slam..."
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me"""
Wait!
"Here, the timing is important."
When the girl lifts her head like this...
"Then,"
When she lifts her head...
"""Why?"
"What are you doing?"""
"Slam.  "" Try to forget me if you can."""
That's right.
That's it!
Anthony Gonsalves.
Did I really make this?
I don't believe it.
I can't believe that I made this?
The way it has landed I am completely sure you've made it.
What did you say?
- That's why professor.. ..only you can tell me how I can go back.
But why did you come here?
You mean to say.. ..you came here to make your parents fall in love.
What a rotten idea.
It's a stupid idea.
- You gave me.
"Professor, can you lend me some money?"
How much do you want?
"Professor, you're a rich man, whatever you can spare."
For Tanya.
- For Tanya.
Give me tea and bread.
"""Julie.."
"Brother Kundan."""
"""I love you."""
"""Julie.."
"Brother Kundan."""
"Brother Kundan, do you want to stay unmarried all your life?"
"Have you ever thought about love, marriage, girls.. ..or will I have to do that for you as well."
I did.
I also did.
- I see.
Thrice.
'The first time..'
"'I love you, Kamla.'"
'I want to marry you.'
I will after we do it once.
I feel so refreshed.
Thought I was gonna die.
"The dumber they are, the stronger they are."
What did you just say?!
What?
Are you yelling at me?
"I mean, what did you say?"
I said you're good.
I heard what you were saying.
Dammit!
I did you a favor.
What did you say!
You did me as a favor?
What a crap!
Where did you pick up such bad manners?
Don't you think you're going too far?
You're feeling pretty mighty all of a sudden.
It wasn't good because you were good.
It's because I was born sensitive.
"Still, aren't you being too hard on me?"
"Alright, brat."
Such pride...
If you only studied like that.
Dammit!
"Okay, okay."
Enough!
A man doesn't get pissed off over such things...
Let's do it later.
Let's just talk now.
- About what?
-What painters do you like?
Are you serious?
(nervously) Wait.
"No, no!"
"No, no, please, please, no!"
No... (speaks indistinctly)
"I don't know how to play, no."
(hyperventilates)
"Oh, my God."
I'm so scared.
"I don't know how it even starts yet and I'm already scared, man."
"This reminds me of ""The Hunger Games."""
"I'm gonna, like, get eaten by one of those dogs."
I don't even know where to go.
(chuckling) Where am I going?
Am I going the right way?
This kind of reminds me of my home.
"I live, like, deep in the forest."
"(singsong) Come out, come out, wherever you are."
I feel like I'm actually in the dark.
This isn't as scary as I thought.
What is that?
No.
"Okay, never mind."
I'm shaking.
(chuckles nervously)
Is that the wind?
Is that the wind that I hear?
I think that's the wind.
I don't want to go in this building.
I really don't.
- (footsteps) - There we go.
There's a page.
"Let it be, tormentor."
Let our eyes remain close.
I found your love.
This is my fortunes.
"Let it be, tormentor."
Let our eyes remain close.
"This beauty, o beloved."
ls smitten by you.
Look here.
Let eyes lock.
And let love happen.
You rule my heart.
You can ask people.
You are not aware. of the chaos that eyes have created.

Where is the gold?
"- I have the gold, sheikh."
But how could I have brought it here?
I have hidden it in the mountain.
You can take your share.
"Let""s go."
Where is the gold?
Sit over here.
"Stop playing around, dad."
Wait a sec Young-hoon.
Will be with you shortly.
"Thought you were hurt, look well to me."
My sincere apology for being well.
Are these even washed?
Should've never come here!
"Well, Ji-hwan says you will wash them again, for sure and told me to soak them and hang."
And those... socks need to be sewed.
I'll let you pass just for today.
Are these rags or socks?
Shit!
I guess you're a writer.
Yeah.
A novel.
"Oh, I see."
Why do you look at me like that?
Do I look that handsome to you?
"Yes, you're handsome."
Kissing my ass?
So young yet corrupted already!
Um...
Did you want to tell me something?
Have a seat.
Okay.
I consider Dal-rae like a daughter
How long have you been a couple?
It's been about three months.
You two can't be serious then.
Huh?
Are you close to Ji-hwan?
Again you taunted me!
Duty is duty!
Duty.. what must be your duty in this small town?
"Friend, this is a small town."
But many activities are carried out here!
I will explain to you when l am free.
I will leave now.
"Listen.. don""t forget your friend for the sake of your duty!"
"All the best! - see you! sir, he is chief lnspector of customs."

And you have come from a long journey.
You must be tired.
Rest for now.
Have dinner with me in the evening.
And we will discuss the matter there.
"Thank you, sir."
I am lucky that I got the chance to have home made dinner.
Pleasure is mine.
- Thank you.
"Thank you so much. - see you tonight, Mr. Diwan!"
Bye!

"You're gonna get it now, you little Yank."
"Bov, you wanna make up for what you've done?"
Get my brother's family out of here.
Tommy!
"Don't you want to finish me off, then?"
"You're already finished, little Petey."
"The NTO will take care of you in a minute, you mug."
"We didn't kill your son, Tommy!"
You did!
"You should have protected him, mate!"
He was your son!
- Don't you talk about my fucking son.
"- He was your son, Tommy!"
- Get in the fucking motor!
Get in the car!
- Get Pete!
Only a poor little Hammer!
His face was all battered and torn!
He made me feel sick!
I hit him with a brick!
Now the cunt's not laughing or singing No more!
"- He's not laughing or singing-- - No, Tommy, he's had enough!"
I'll get us out of here.
Go.
- You can't leave him.
- Pete!
Pete!
Fucking help him!
Pete Dunham's life taught me there's a time to stand your ground.
His death taught me there's a time to walk away.
I would never have the chance to thank him.
But I could live in a way that would honor him.
Fish contains all the vitamins!
Eat this and your face will glow like gold!
"Mama and saridon""s health is not fine. so I got fish!"
How is that possible!
I will eat this fish!
And their health will improve! of course it will!
I will improve my health!
- Yes!
Take your fish and leave!
"- He won""t leave!"
He will leave!
"- He won""t leave!"
He will leave!
- He will come with us!
I will fry this fish! come on! come! - okay!
This man is a fool!
People are crazy for fish!
And he is returning fish!
Gold!
Gold! oh my God! ..oh my God!
Did you see?
"DDT, you crook!"
You have made a big blunder!
Why are you yelling?
"I didn""t do anything!"
Your husband made a blunder!
Yes!
You idiot!
"Had you not asked for dowry, we wouldn""t have got in this mess!"
You fool!
You took the dowry!
You took it!
Fine.
I feel all right.
( ferry whistle blows )
We're gonna have to get rid of the car.
We can take that ferry.
You'll have to walk a little.
"I can't, Johnny."
Come on.
"I'll help you, Gus."
I can't.
I will only hold you back.
"You gotta go alone, Johnny."
You got to.
I'll stay here.
I'll make it.
I'll send you a postcard.
( tense theme playing )
"I'm not gonna leave you like this, Gus."
Go.
"Go on, Johnny."
Run.
"Go on, run."
SUNDAY DOCUMENTARY
ROSLlNG'S WORLD
"I slept in the kids' room, or rather, the grandkids' room."
That way I won't wake Agneta.
As usual we were...
When I left Stockholm we weren't done with the presentation.
At midnight I downloaded the final version.
It's only four AM and the paper has already come.
There...
"When you hold a lecture, you need to make sure you're up on the news."
"Hey, a daughter wants to talk to her dead mother."
- She is just being a good daughter.
- It's her business.
"If this makes everyone uncomfortable, I'll go there by myself."
- You'll walk there yourself.
Good idea.
- Add.
This is too much.
Do you have a heart?
"Hey, if you don't want to go with me, Get out of the truck."
What did you just say?
Read my lips.
I won't go.
I'm not going either.
"Ood, Add, where are you going?"
Come back now.
I won't.
What is this?
I'm not going.
"Since you have picked us up and raised us, you never did this to me."
Who is she?
You've just met her.
She's a liar.
Why are you serious with a whore?
What the...
Don't ever say that again.
I don't want to cause any more troubles.
I'll go.
Hold on.
"Shut up, you two."
Don't ever talk to my woman like that.
I don't like it.
I danced on stage with all my might.
"So my bones are thick, not thin."
Scanning Zelo's leg's to the end.
Shall we get started!
Shall we get started!
Who is this?
Shall we get started on filming?
It's my turn to lip sync for the MV.
I'm looking forward to it.
Since the background is so pretty.
Anybody with that background will come out very well for sure.
- Great job.
- Great job.
Great work.
MV lip sync is over.
Great work.
None
We have to shoot again.
My face is probably bloated right now.
I slept a lot.
It was past three thirty when I checked in the car earlier.
I feel tired but it was a good all-nighter.
"- oh, Jong Up is here too."
- Hi.
He's my manager for the day.
- Bring me some water.
- Water?
Then I gotta dig up soil...
"Then hurry and dig, here."
- It's cement so you'll be done in no time.
"- I don't think I can, I'm too sleepy."
This is an elevator in Las Vegas.
I go to my post abroad tomorrow.
It's for a year.
Why didn't you tell me?
Let's meet and talk.
- Let's talk later.
I'm busy.
"-Wait, don't hang up."
- Wait...
-What do you want?
I'm sorry.
Call me later?
Here.
30 dollars.
Have you had lunch?
"If you haven't, would you like to eat together?"
"I'll treat, to thank you for everything."
You look like a young miss.
Isn't that your guy?
Bastard.
He told me he was away on business.
Where are you going?
"You can't be too happy right now, let's go for some fresh air?"
I don't understand guys like him.
Definitely not my type.
What's with the sunglasses?
They don't even suit you.
-Wait here.
I'll be back right away.. - I thought you were buying me lunch.
- Oh...
I didn't recognize you.
Hello.
- Don't pretend to know her!
He has a muffler round his neck and wore kurta pyjama.
Its all right.
I will search.
Did you see a person in kurta pyjama and a muffler.
No sir.
See the other side.
You dont worry.
I am asking.
Look that side.
"Sir, please wait sir."
Dad!
Are you here?
"No, I am under the train."
Come on.
"Listen, my father is has boarded the train."
"Wait madam, I am searching."
I am saying that my father is has boarded the train.
I said I am searching.
Why dont you understand?
My father is in the train.
What?
He is in the train?
Come soon.
"O rain, do not go away after dropping on the eyes."
Stay with me always just like the showers and lightning.
Why did you go away having roused the feeling of love?
If you want to come will I stop you?
Why are you standing here?
He could not catch the train.
What can you do about it?
Come on.
"How is your health, father?"
You took a lot of risk for us till now.
You just go.
How can we leave you like that?
"Yes, we will also come with you."
You go from here.
- Listen to me.
They have entered the forest.
We got a message from Kasi.
He said that he will kill that man and .. .. bring the girl before the hour of marriage.
He said he will not be your brother if he fails.
"Uncle, make me as bridegroom."
He kept the ring I gave to him.
That means father lied to me.
And I believed his words.
I did a big mistake.
Come on.
Move away.
Do you want to die?
What do you want?
- I want a lift.
This bus belongs to a marriage party.
You will not get the lift.
"This is your bus brother, come inside."
Why dont you pick up the cell?
- It is your cell phone.
What?
My phone?
Hello?
Who is it?
I am unable to listen.
"Tayaru, is that you?"
We are coming.
I want to go somewhere quiet.
What about you?
What's wrong?
No.
It's just... a bit uncomfortable.
Is it very discomforting?
"The world seems strange, doesn't it?"
Don't worry.
No one knows.
Let's go some place far.
It's so strange.
I don't think I'll ever come to a place like this again.
My heart is racing like a fish's.
"My heart's beating like a goldfish's, too."
Are we really going to do this?
"We don't even have any protection, do we?"
Condoms?
We come all the way here and don't do it?
Okay.
I'll go get some.
This place is not bad.
"Look at you, getting nervous."
Your face is burning.
I'm not nervous.
Wow!
You're really sensitive.
I am a little.
I like sensitive women.
Hey!
That tickles!
Don't!
I'm gonna start from the toe.
Shame on you.
Shame on you.
"No, shame on you..."
For you raised that demon.
Shame on you.
How's your foot?
Is it swollen?
I see you wrapped it.
But heat won't do good if it's sprained.
Let's go see a doctor before it gets worse.
Don't be stubborn.
We can have breakfast too.
And buy you some clothes.
That's enough...
That's all we wanted to say.
It's up to you now.
Isn't she his sister?
Hoşgeldin.
- What's going on?
"- Nothing, come on inside."
It's something that can't be forgotten.
Let everyone know that.
He should never come back to town again.
- Is he talking about Kerim?
- Never mind him.
You heard me Galip Usta?
He better not come back just because his abla is here.
Or he'll have his answer from the town folks.
What's this?
What are you trying to do?
"Meryem Hanım, let's go inside."
"It's Reşat Yaşaran who is making you do this, isn't he?"
"- Kerim, are you at work?"
"No, abi..."
I've quit the job.
What's up?
"Oh, why?"
"Anyways, maybe this is the best for us."
- Listen to me now...
"- What's wrong, abi?"
Come home now...
Or don't...
As there are still many reporters here.
It's better you park your car in the auto-park near the shore.
Then walk over here and call me when you're two streets away from us.
But don't let anyone see you.
- I don't get what this is about.
- I'll take you away from here for a few days.
It was five of six years ago.
Your dad made me buy this house.
This land is valuable.
You can do anything you want here.
"You can change it completely, if you want."
Why would I change it.
What is it to me.
"This land and this house is yours, Kerim."
"No, abi."
We're just guests here.
"Besides, I don't want a house or anything."
"We'll just spend a few days here, that's all."
- Thank you.
- Anyway... ...
It's too early to talk about all this.
There it is.
- Show- off.
I'll just get a job probably.
As if someone would hire you!
"You really sucked at high school, didn't you?"
"If you didn't study in high school, you should at least study at college."
Going after housewives!
And what kind of name is that for a chat room?
"""Welcoming Dumpy Housewives"" Weird taste!"
Miss Dewdrop.
I think I'm just going to go home.
Why?
To go study?
No.
You're disrespecting me and I can't stand it.
Let's eat first.
Fine!
Okay.
But we're only eating.
"Well, of course."
What else can we do with that thing...
Total mental castration...
My thing is fine.
"- Hey, why are you getting in?"
- Huh?
I have to go somewhere.
Take a taxi or walk.
There' no taxi here.
That's your problem.
Close the door!
You drive me crazy.
Really.
I was just kidding.. Get in.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Why did you climb up?
"Aren""t you ashamed?"
Why to feel ashamed in doing my duty? show me your baskets!
Hey!
You want to seize our baskets!
The basket contains fishes and not gold!
I know you all very well!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
"What are you doing? constable, what are you doing?"
Are you mad?
Yes!
You have spoiled the fishes!
Now who will buy these fishes?
"Not just these fishes, I will cut open all the fishes in the oceans.. ..to check whether gold is hidden in it or not!"
Why are you after our fishes?
Go and check the fishes in the oceans!
Fine!
I am leaving!
I am leaving!
"Why are you screaming? seema, why are you running away from me?"
My friends have told me so many things about you.. ..that now I am afraid of you.
What did they tell you?
"- I won""t tell you!"
It will kill me!
Tell me!
What do your friends say? sit at a distance!
More! - oh God!
I said I won't charge you for this idol.. ..but I will have to pay the sage.
"Yes, of course."
Here you go.
100 rupees.
Only 100.. - Mahadev.
Mahadev.
This is a question of devotion.
We cannot force anyone.
Do you how much I had at that time?
Only 20 rupees.
Only 20 rupees.
Remember?
So do you know what I did?
I was wearing a similar gold chain.
And I gave that to him.
It's all about faith.
Anything you give is less.
Anything you give is less.
Wow.
What a thought.
"Not just my gold chain, I will give up my gold ring too."
That's it.
Here.
Here you go.
- Great.
Take of everything.
Take of everything.
- Take it.
"Great, great, great."
Glory to.. - Lord Krishna!
Glory.
"Now, where will this idol emerge from?"
So what?
Things are expensive!
Don't you have a job yourself?
How much can I make?
How about Moon?
What can he do?
I won't count on him.
Go to hell and don't ever come back! 你干嘛挂啦?
What are you doing?
Why begged him for his money?
I'll have money next week.
Thank you very much!
I don't want your dirty money.
What do you mean my ditry money?
You think his money is clean?
"Don't worry mon, I'm different now."
You can ask Ms.Lee.
I thought you said you'd go back to school.
Did you do that?
You're the same as your father.
Are you OK?
You may go home after 10 mins...
When will she come back again to further consultation with a doctor?
I'll call and inform you.
Make your daughter have a rest.
Hi there!
Your daughter got a stroke?
Stroke yourself.
Let me remind you.
You played me last time.
Don't ever try play tracks with me!
Pay!
Move over.
Let's go to the station first.
I'm gonna throw them into the can!
I'm gonna throw you into hell!!
"-You guys come along too, we need witness."
- Ok.
You stop!
Stop there!
You stop right there.
"Come here, you..."
Don't come any closer.
Let go of me.
Don't follow me!
Stop right there!
"Man, I'm dumb."
"I should have ran downhill. if you don't have the smarts, the body suffers."
"Dammit, look who it is?"
Dear hubby.
You bastard.
You put someone after me!
Where are you?
Tell me now!
I You're dead!
You crazy?
Tell you where I am?
You think I won't catch you?
I'll chase you to the end and throw you in the can.
Sure.
I'll just go to the ends of the earth and wait.
We'll have it out there!
Are you in your right mind?
Making jokes?
Will you... will you listen to me?
You can ask for my life.
Because now I will not be able to live without you.
Kishan!
You...
You... surrender yourself.
"Sacrifice makes love immortal, Kishan."
Love is a test.
"And those who fear it's result, their love is just a pretence."
You may be a criminal in the eyes of society... ...but you are a true man in my eyes.
And I want to show this to the world.
- Radha!
Kishan!
Show them that even your heart is full of love.
You too can feel pain.
You are a true person.
I'll do as you say.
- Kishan!
Radha!
Don't cry!
"Don't cry, Radha."
Now that I've got you... ...I don't even fear gallows.
I'll surrender myself.
Kishan!
I'm proud of your love.
And I'll always be proud of it.
- Radha!
"Kishan, promise me that whenever you'll return... ...we'll meet at this place."
Near this temple.
- Sure!
If I'll come back.
"Don't say that, Kishan."
- Yes.
- Or are you protecting someone?
No.
Or are you carrying the can since you don't got much time left?
- No.
"- Tell me, who wanted this from you?"
- Who are you protecting?
- I killed Ferhat.
Brother.
"Hey, brother."
- What's your problem?
- What do you want?
We just wanted to wake you up for breakfast.
"Okay, thanks."
You were on duty again last night?
You didn't sleep.
Was it hard last time you were in jail as well?
What is it to you?
Whatever man.
"Hey, what is this?"
Did it again?
You did it again?
You washed my pants with the letter in it?
Why don't you check it before?
What am I gonna do with this now?
"- I am sorry, abi."
- Fuck your apology.
When are you gonna stop being stupid?
You're the one who shouldn't have kept your letter in your pockets.
Fuck you.
Eat your breakfast.
Do it like he does.
Tell me!
What do they say?
"My friends say.. that by saying no, men become women""s slave."
ls that so? so you want to make me your slave?
- Yes.
What else did they say?
"My friends also say.. when men become fervent.. ..then they should meet the girl""s father and not the girl."
I think your friends have fallen in love with me.
And by teaching you wrong things they want to get rid of you.
And they want to form a relationship with me. seema.. how is your friend?
ls she very beautiful?
ls she young?
- Yes!
ls she capricious?
- Why?
"What""s your problem?"
I have no problem!
Filthy man!
You think about other girls!
"Yes, now I will have to think!"
Why?
"What""s the flaw in me?"
"Not flaw, injustice!"
"I want to come closer to you and you are going away! seema.. you won""t go away from me, will you?"
- No.
Your love has made my plight bad!
"Yes, seema."
"You belong to me, don""t you?"
- Yes. only you dwell in my heart.
Believe me.
"Beloved, this is true."
"Let""s love in the open. only you dwell in my heart."
Today...
I'll sell all my flutes on half rates.
Now leave your hopes for me.
And take care of yourself.
Doctor has warned you not to play flute.
Doctor only identifies our disease... ...but not our pain and poverty.
"Shanta, you are my life."
I can't live without you.
Don't say that.
Yet our Kishan has to grow up.
He has to study and be a good citizen.
"Yes, okay, Shanta."
I'll not play flute.
But at least I can sell them.
"C'mon, Kishan, today we'll sell all the flutes."
"Ramu, come here."
Come!
You won't get anything by playing flutes.
Mr. Pasha!
My wife is very sick.
I'm in need of money.
Do you want money?
Take this money.
Take it.
Buy all my flutes and give me the charges.
Flutes?
What will I do with your flutes?
Play some tune!
Your favourite one.
The one that expresses love.
"Yes, I'll play it too."
I'll play all the tunes.
Do you see this star?
I want you to draw this star down here.
Take your time.
You worked so hard on that!
I want you to pick up a penny in one hand and then you're going to put it in these fingers.
Drop it in here.
OK can you do three of them?
You do one at a time.
Take one from that hand and put it in that one.
Great job!
Let's put them back.
This time I'm going to count while you do it and then time you.
So you're going to go as fast as you can when I say go.
Ready?
Go.
OK.
Let's do it one more time.
Ready?
Go.
OK.
Start with one hand and one foot in front of us and the other hand and other foot are going to be behind us.
I'm going to jump and switch them.
Jump and switch them.
Can you try it?
Alright.
You have to switch your hands and your feet at the same time.
OK are you ready?
When I say go I want you to go until I say stop.
Ready?
Go.
Good.
Stop.
"You are blind, your father is blind !"
What are you doing?
Why are you boxing?
Neelambar!
How come you are here?
I'm in trouble.
- Are you out of it?
How did you get rid of the trouble?
- I stuck it on someone else.
That's the rule.
Everyone transfers his trouble to someone else.
What's happening?
Why are horns blaring?
I think there is a queue for petrol.
- It's a traffic jam.
Tell him!
"Before the traffic gets jammed, let's go to our Neelambar Pitambar store."
Let's go to our store.
Understand in one attempt sometimes atleast.
Where are you going?
"Drive fast, sister."
- I am driving fast.
"This is not a plane, it is a rickshaw."
Where do you want to go?
Left or right?
- Take a right.
Take a left.
Stop.
In the garden.
Over there.
- Where?
I'll tackle him.
"Hey, why are you going away like that?"
What will you lose if you stay with me for some more time?
Oh God!
Did you get wet again?
Take this and dry yourself.
Pandarta?!
The train has no scheduled stop here.
Why did it stop?
- How should I know?
Then why are you sitting there?
Go and find out.
Oh!
My ring fell down.
This is a valuable ring.
You should not lose it.
Keep it.
This is the ring your father gave the first time.
Keep it.
Bananas!
Apples!
Salutations sir.
Why did the train stop?
The water is going over the tracks.
It may take about two hours to recede.
Please come and sit in my room until then.
Idiotic rain!
"Hey, ring up uncle and find out how father is."
At the same time ask him to send some vehicles.
We cannot stay here a long time.
Who is he?
"- He is Badri, son of Dasanna."
"He has so many people around him, is he such a big shot?"
Is it okay living here?
"Since it is a guest room, it is kind of small."
But it's tolerable.
I'm only staying here for a little bit anyways.
We're staying here until the new house is built.
Will it be okay?
What?
I'm talking about Hae Ra.
She was the one you were meeting today. . .
How could you have parted that way.
"Well, since she was with Kyung Su Sunbae."
"Excuse me, Hae Ra."
I have something to tell you.
"It's really hard for me to say, so I hope you will listen."
I know.
I am not good enough.
Pardon?
Not good enough?
Then have mine too.
I didn't mean...
Foo... food is enough.
I'll continue.
"I have tried my best not to think about it,"
But I keep thinking of you. . .
Should I just leave?
I have a headache.
"You have a headache? then, you should take some medicine for it."
"Take your time, I will pay and leave now."
Hae Ra.
I know that I lack a lot of things.
That's why
I decided to try hard and not think of you
I'm asking you to leave.
Please.
You got the newspapers?
What does it write about us?
"Look, I'm asking you, please, don't open your mouth no matter what they ask you."
"Okay, Kadir Bey."
Don't you worry.
- And Kerim has just went out.
"- Yeah, I saw."
"- ""They admitted they money""  - Fatmagül better not see this."
Good morning.
"- Fatmagül, don't read it."
- I agree.
This is sweet.
This will reduce all  the cheering to nil.
- You see how the tide has turned.
- That's right.
Just you wait...
Let's go to the hospital and visit my yenge then.
That's what we're doing right now.
- You're gonna talk to her today?
- Nope.
I won't... until she comes and apologizes to me.
You're the man!
- What are you doing here?
- Can we ask you a few questions?
"- No, you can't."
- Just a few.
"Look, we said it all at court."
You are helping them by doing this.
"But you took the money and  set up a business with it, didn't you?"
"No, no."
I need to go.
I'm sorry.
Ms. Eom!
What is this money for?
Here is today's weather forecast.
Heavy clouds and showers are expected tonight.
How was it?
Was it okay?
Too slow.
It'll be night and raining by the time you finish.
"And smile, won't you?"
"Good, good."
Su-eun!
Let's do it again.
I can't hear you.
"Once more, please?"
I'm your only sister!
"So you're clumsy, aren't you?"
"You're a lousy artist, but your face is well-drawn."
I didn't know we had such a cutie in our park.
Oh?
This...
How did you know it was mine?
"Is there any other artist around here, dummy?"
It's all smudged.
Tell me it's a very important painting for you...
You could've just thrown it out.
But thanks anyway.
Damn!
You punk!
"I was going to be generous since you're cute, but..."
"Well, I'll let you off this time Today is your lucky day."
He is tall handsome guy.
Is it not enough?
I am not able to understand you.
"Mother, is it proper to teach her all this things?"
You shut up.
The society has changed.
You are an old woman by birth.
Do you think he will meet you again?
My friend rain will take care of that.
It will unite us.
None of the cards are useful.
When you dont have luck how can you win?
Show.
- What?
- Show.
My score is 60.
What about you?
50.
- What about you?
- Ten.
What is this?
Are you trying to cheat us?
"Do you know, here people will bash you if you try to cheat."
Is it new for me?
Just joking.
Distribute once again.
I will have the show and pay you.
Are you trying to fool us?
Give the money.
I dont have any.
I have given all of them to you only.
Dont try to scare me.
"That's right, I'm crazy."
You must have suffered living with a crazy woman!
Do you think I have nowhere to go?
There are men everywhere.
"Hang up, moron."
"Dammit, it's a mountain."
Man...
I'm at the top.
I guess I have to go down.
Bring me some money.
Why?
I got caught at a motel having an affair.
"By My husband, of course..."
He brought the cops.
The moron got those errands people to follow me.
"They took my bag, too."
I don't even have a damn coin.
Who?
College what?
So what if he's young.
So you're bringing some money or not?
"Listen, bitch, if you weren't gonna come, what's with the twenty questions?"
"Bitch, you said you were jealous of me having an affair, too."
Bitch...
Being a friend means to help out in times of need.
Bye!
Hey could you lend me about 50 dollars?
Me?
"If you have some money, Lend me about 50 bucks."
30!
That's all I've got.
I'll pay you back
"No, let's take him right in."
( suspenseful theme playing )
"Is he gonna hurt me, Frank?"
Maybe a little.
"But you're a brave boy, aren't you?"
"Will you stay with me, Frank?"
"Yeah, sure I will."
( dramatic theme playing )
"Yes, yes."
We're at Dr. Garber's office now.
"No, no."
I don't think it's serious.
Probably nothing but a simple sprain.
We'll take an x-ray at the hospital to be sure.
We're going over to the hospital.
Why don't you meet us there?
"I-I know you're busy, but-but this is Saturday."
"All right, then you can just stay there."
It's only his son.
DR. GARBER:
"All right, young man, let's test that ankle."
How does it feel?
Okay.
Fine.
We'll have that arm fixed up in no time.
Would you want me to go with him?
"No, don't bother, Frank."
You can take the car back.
Dr. Garber will drop us off later.
"Then you'll tell me about it when you get home, huh?"
Frank... thank you.
You having trouble?
Did Jamie take care of him?
He did.
But she's not going to talk now.
There's no way.
I tried.
"Well, you should try again."
What did you do to me?
You'll be fine.
But don't try and use spells.
Those herbs I used muted your magic.
Where's Elena?!
"She'll be fine, too."
"Bonnie, listen to me."
I need your help.
I need you to tell me where those coffins are.
Why?
"Because if you don't, that man compelled Jamie to kill himself."
I can't.
This goes beyond you and me.
All you need to do is tell me where they are.
Then we'll have held up our end of the bargain.
"Bonnie, please."
I've almost got it.
Abby hasn't called yet.
"Jamie, please, just let us go."
No!
"Please, don't do anything."
"Look, I don't know why I shot him."
"I don't know why I'm holding this gun, but if you move or do anything,"
I'm going to shoot him again.
"Ok, I won't."
Who gave you that gun?
"Look, there's a crime here and the guilty ones will get their punishment."
- And you?
"- I said ""anyone guilty""."
We told everything to a friend of yours.
All right?
"Kerim Bey, what did you do with the money?"
Bought this car?
I'm wasting my breath with you.
You're a waste of time!
"Kerim Bey, please!"
"I'm sorry, Usta."
They are in front of our house as well.
- They are everywhere now.
- But that's a bit over the top.
What did I tell you before?
All I care about is my business.
- I don't want this in front of my shop.
- You're right.
"You're right, but it's not like  I'm calling them to come here."
"What the hell, man?"
- Damn it.
- Kerim...
This won't go on.
It's so troublesome to have you here.
"I promised your dad, but... ..."
I can't continue with you any more.
What did you promise to my dad?
- Don't go and tell the man now.
"- No, I just want to now."
Did my father tell you to give me the job?
I'm sorry...
I have a daughter who is to be married.
- So?
I didn't realise whether it was a cow or a bull.
Why?
Was the bull wearing pants that you couldn't find out?
You fool.
Go and get betel leaf for me.
I am in the mood for betel leaf today.
"Father, money?"
I gave you 10 rupees in the morning.
I.. lent it.. to friend?
On what interest rate?
- One..
One percent.
None.
If you don't get the money in 24 hours.. ..then I will recover the money by selling you off?
"But father, who will purchase me?"
Quiet.
Get out.
You fool.
Who are you?
10 rupees.
And 50 paise interest.
But how can I take this?
I can't accept this?
- Keep it.
Everything I own belongs to you as well as me.
"No, no, no, no, no.."
"You shouldn't touch my feet, da.."
Kishen.
I suggest you accompany me to my restaurant.
I will treat you to a cup of tea.
Or let's go to my place.
I'll be 'the last but not least Snow Maiden'!
"And I will, I beg your pardon, be Santa."
Then that makes me the Christmas tree.
That's right!
"And we will decorate you, and dance the round dance around you."
"What will we dance, I beg your pardon?"
Ooh!
The round dance.
"The boa's home is Africa, ln Africa he lives, -"
"So cute, and slim, and ever-green, Just like the summer leaves."
Why - green?
Because I'm a Christmas tree.
You won't make a Christmas tree.
And why is that?
Why won't he?
A Christmas tree is prickly.
And he is soft.
A Christmas tree has to have needles.
Ha!
We can stick needles into him.
"Oh no, don't stick needles into me!"
The parrot is right:
I won't make a Christmas tree.
Then we don't have a Christmas tree?
But we have the Snow Maiden and Santa Claus.
We don't have Santa Claus either.
Santa is cold.
"And the elephant - there, feel him - he is warm."
We'll freeze him!
There!
No!
Please don't freeze me!
I had a chance to be somebody else.
"To be Abby Wilson, the woman..."
"Not Abby Bennett, the witch."
"I'm not proud of what I did, Bonnie."
I ran.
I know I ran.
"But you had your dad and your grams, and, ok, let's face it..."
Your grams is way better at this stuff than I am.
You don't know?
What?
Oh.
How?
We were doing a rough spell...
And we both exhausted ourselves.
Her more than me.
"Well, she raised you right."
I'm sure she was very proud of you.
"Well, now you know my whole story."
Yep.
How about you tell me yours?
What brings you to me?
"It was a dream, actually."
I thought you were supposed to help us.
"But if you don't have any magic, it's..."
"Well, no spells, no."
But I'm not completely useless.
"I mean, the earth still provides herbs and such."
There might be something I can do.
I...Don't think so.
"Bonnie, please."
Let me help you.
"So what, you'd think I wouldn't find out?"
Don't wait here then go mind your business.
Don't worry this much about me.
"- Is where you will go, a near place?"
- No.
It's not like Kuzey will reply to your letter right away.
"I'll leave you alone, but it's best if I go now."
It is best.
You could wait.
How are you gonna go from here?
"It's okay, I saw a taxi stand near here."
Want me to walk there with you?
"Okay, as you wish."
- Goodbye.
- Bye bye.
Annoying.
"Sorry, for making you having to put up with this."
It's clear enough for me.
You don't have to explain anything.
"If I tried to explain it would take ages, anyway."
I have no hurry.
I will get to know you guys slowly.
- My son!
- Don't leave your seat.
- Hoşgeldiniz.
"- Hoşbulduk, my son."
"The air is damp, it could rain any minute."
"- You won't start will you, mom."
"- No, son."
I won't cry this time.
- How are you?
"- Fine, thanks to God."
How are you guys?
And the court wants to punish me for it.
Prince.
Will I be banished?
Will I have to go away again?
Will my mom have to go through that cause of me?
"No, Prince Yuning."
- Crown Prince.
- Prince.
That won't happen.
What's with the long face?
Guess you're not glad to see me.
"No, not at all."
I'm really REALLY glad to see you.
Then why do you look so depressed?
"Look, you haven't even called me, 'Brother.'"
It's just...
I thought maybe you didn't want to see me again.
What?
"You went through lots cause of me, though."
"No, cause of you?"
Where'd that come from?
It was my idea to skip out.
But you told Father it was yours.
"Listen, you're the one that's had it tough because of me."
I'm really sorry.
"You stood up for me, worried about me."
"Some brother I am, watching you take the blame."
"No, I'm to blame."
If I didn't go on the bridge you wouldn't have been arrested or gotten sick...
It's all my fault.
No.
"No, Yuning."
I will not be scared?
Nothing is left with me.
I dont have watch or chain.
What will you do?
Bash me?
Do it.
Continue the game.
"Who are you, sir?"
He is Badris man.
Why are you giving me the money?
- Play.
"You please play, sir."
I dont know how to play?
You play.
We can settle terms later.
There is a bar nearby.
Come there after you finished the game.
When does it rain?
When black clouds appear.
When does the black clouds appear?
Just before the rain comes.
You idiot!
I can tell you when the petrol tanker will come.. ..but how could you expect me to know when it will rain.
"Not only me, nobody can tell you that."
I can tell.
- Tell what?
What is the program on TV at 7 p.m.?
A serial named Jeevanarogalu.
After that?
- We will get headache.
After that?
- News will come.
"He wouldn't say ""See you later"" slowly unless he means ""See you later."""
"Otherwise he would just say ""See ya later."""
- Don't you get it?
- When is later then?
I don't know.
I'm not boy lingual yet.
But I tell you what.
I see a snog at the end of the tunnel.
Big fish little fish cardboard box
Big fish little fish cardboard box Fill the trolley fill
"Lindsay, stop it."
You don't have to come.
"Oh, Robbie, stop."
I promise I won't get in the way.
"Oh, no."
"I don't mind, honestly."
Come on.
"Lindsay, stop messing about there."
All right?
Or you'll just have to sit in the back then.
"Oh, Robbie."
Maybe they're just mates.
"Don't be a plonker, El."
Mates don't hold hands.
"I already feel fed up with boys, and I haven't had anything to do with them yet."
I don't know how she got in there before you.
- I can never compete with Lindsay.
"- Yes, you can."
You've got much better qualities than her.
Yeah?
Like what?
"- Well, you're really funny."
Maybe you can help me get my magic back.
I thought you said you didn't want it anymore.
I don't.
But if it's what you wanted...
I would do that for you.
You're better.
Yeah.
"I shouldn't be, but I didn't have any say in the matter."
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I lost control.
Again.
I knew the risks when I decided to help you.
So...
Was it worth it?
How do you feel?
Different.
A little more myself.
Then we'll continue tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I turned.
Once.
To break the sire bond.
Turning needs to be painless.
And from what I saw today...
We're still a long way off.
I can't put myself through that again.
You will.
"Because until you're capable of acting on your own free will,"
I'm not going to let you anywhere near my daughter.
You told me your secret.
This is mine.
You're a vampire hunter.
Someone's coming!
So this is where you've been?
Shall I paint you a portrait?
It's for free.
Can't you take that off?
Wait!
"Okay, I'll paint you like that."
"But next time you'll take it off, right?"
Take it off?
This punk...
He's got a weird taste...
You punk... what are you smirking about?
- Aren't you hot?
-Wouldn't you be?
- I'm roasting in here.
"- If I were you, I'd take it off."
I'm dying of curiosity.
Are you a man by any chance?
There are plenty of guys with long hair.
And lots of guys have pretty legs.
Right... men don't wear bras
"All right, stop it."
You little cutie... don't be so shy.
I know...
Your face is really ugly!
I'm joking.
You're so cute.
This is what I like about my job.
Jin-woo...
"If you don't show up, we're through."
We apologizes to customers that the fire alarm has begun.
Please evacuate to the...
I have turned into a horse.
Know what she gave me for breakfast today?
Egg shampoo.
You are laughing?
Thank your stars she served you egg shampoo.
She gave me a white handkerchief in my milk as cream.
Take this file.
Go through it.
- Is this the file of your murder case?
What did you say?
"I meant, whose murder case file is this?"
A man named Manish will strike a deal in diamonds worth millions. . . in Hotel Blue Diamond.
Then let him strike the deal first.
- Why?
Because law says that until someone commits a crime. . . you cannot nab him.
"As soon as he strikes the deal, you will catch him red handed."
Both saw the time.
Both jumped in.
Something fishy.
Even I will jump in.
I won't spare you !
I won't spare you !
Where are you going?
"- Girls, what are you doing?"
"I am on duty, let me go."
Where are you hiding?
Come out soon !
Did you see?
- Yes sir.
Sexy figures in the pool.
"Not that figure, you fools!"
Look.
Where's the fourth?
Show me!
"Well, ehh, here's the thing."
They can't.
It's not here.
What did you do?
"Well, Bonnie gave me the head's up."
"I mean, I didn't have enough time to get all four, but I did have time to get one."
I will tear you limb from limb.
"And only then, when you are a writhing mass of blood and flesh, will I rip your heart from your chest."
Sorry.
Same rules apply.
Leverage and all.
I know you want your family back.
But something tells me you want what's in that coffin a lot more.
You want to tell me what you're up to?
You talked to Damon.
"Yeah, I did."
He wasn't supposed to wake up so soon.
I used enough vervain to sedate him for hours.
"Well, he drinks it, every day."
To build up an immunity so people like you don't get the jump on him.
"I'm not crazy, Ric."
Really?
Then what are you?
Watch your back.
You really want to know?
Stick around.
Is that bill Forbes?
Aaah!
I'm just trying to help!
"Just get it out, Elena, please."
"I'm afraid that uh... ...that you're going to have such a direct attack that uh, you're going to get me in the corner, and I'm afraid of that."
I want you to be more on my side.
"You said I'll get you in a corner, and you put your hand on your chest."
-Mm-hmm.
-Is this your corner?
"Well, it's like...yeah, it's...like I'm afraid."
You know.
Where would you like to go?
Can you describe the corner you'd like to go to?
Yeah.
Uh...it's back in a corner where...
I'm completely protected.
And you would be safe of me?
From me?
"Well, I know I wouldn't really, but it feels safe."
[overlapping]
But while you're in this corner you're perfectly safe now.
What would you do in that corner?
I'd just sit.
-Just sit?
-Yes.
How long would you sit?
"I don't know, but this is so funny you're saying this."
This reminds me of when I was a little girl.
"Every time I was afraid, I would feel better sitting in a corner."
Not panicky.
Okay.
Are you a little girl?
"Well, no...but it's the same feeling."
Are you a little girl?
This feeling reminds me of it.
Are you a little girl?
- Is that so?
- I'm sorry.
It must have been precious to you.
"No, it's alright."
"It was used to save lives, so I'm sure its owner would have been glad too."
But the frame should still be there.
I should go find it.
At this hour?
You should go when it's light.
That's alright.
I'll be going now.
You're really as impetuous as he said you were.
He?
Do I know that person?
Everyone's gone now.
We should go too.
"Gil Dong, do you want to wear this and go to the brothel for a while?"
- Shall we?
- No one will recognize us if we wear this!
You're right.
I haven't been to the brothel in a long time!
I am filled with past memories!
- Then I'll wear the black.
- Go ahead.
"I look great, don't I?"
"Are you sure you'll be alright, half-balls?"
You may be ready for the brothel yet.
Let's just go back.
How do I look?
Let's just wear this to scare the kids.
- You handsome fellow!
"- Hey, Sir Moonlight Black Hat!"
My legs. . .I cannot climb a mountain.
Can't my legs be cured?
"Ofcourse dear, your legs will get cured."
You have me.
Why do you think I drive the rickshaw?
I'll collect lots of money.
I'll get you treated by the best doctor in the world.
"You will walk, run, walk in step with the world."
Can't you see?
Are you blind?
Who did you call blind?
Me?
"You are blind, your father is blind. . . your whole family is blind."
Why are you looking there and talking?
I am here.
"Wherever you may be, for me, you are here."
I'll thrash you !
"I'm sorry sister, did I hurt you?"
"- That's a pole, not a lady."
"I know it is not a lady, it is a pole."
You mind your own business.
What's wrong with the municipality?
They put up poles everywhere.
It's quite a huge pole - Are you blind?
"I am not a pole, I am a woman."
Woman?
"I'm sorry sister, I made a mistake Forgive me."
I think he is mad too.
Someone help me cross the road.
- Who is this?
I am blind.
Help me cross the road.
Is it him?
I thought you guys split.
I sent him a message that I was in the hospital.
"You really like him, don't you?"
I don't know why I'm like this...
Wow this room is warm.
Wait.
I'm sorry about last time.
"Damn, look at your wounds."
"I told myself...that this is the last time so if you have something to say, please say it."
The last time?
Then why don't we do it for the last time before we go on our way?
Don't worry.
I can be careful so you won't get hurt.
Like this....
I went to an inn in the country and the woman next doorways screaming like crazy.
- I cracked the door to listen to her.
- Not interesting.
Not interesting?
Then I'll tell you another story.
Let's just do it once.
"A long time ago, I was going up the mountain..."
A woman...
Don't call me again.
"Fine, we don't have to see each other again."
Let's do it for the last time.
Come on!
Fine.
Do it.
Then do it.
Okay.
"A long time ago, I was going up this mountain..."
I don't like any!
How boorish coming to a motel and talking about painters.
I went get drinks and even condoms.
You're angry.
I understand.
But you know what?
It'll be better to do it when we really want to do it.
I really want to do it
Then let's do it when we really really want to do it.
It wouldn't be hard doing it with you.
But the fantasy will be broken.
What fantasy?
Of a good friend!
A friend I can really talk to.
We talked for six months.
I don't think I've ever been happier.
Do you know what the worst kind of woman is?
Who acts like she's going to put out but doesn't.
Do you really want to do it?
Yes
"Then, do it with your mouth."
Maybe later.
When we want to do it.
Then.. do it with your hand.
Let's do it later.
I'll do it later for sure.
You can't even do it with your hand?
Oh my god.
Weren't you going to buy some mackerel?
No.
We have a lot of fish.
Have some.
- Do you think you got rid of Burak?
Is this how you thought of getting rid of him?
Shame on you.
Where did these come from?
What are these?
You wanted to kill Burak.
"God damn you, Barış."
You lied to me all along.
Where did they come from?
"Who gave you these, mom?"
A courier left them at the door.
God damn it.
We're going home.
The murderer has been found.
Put an end to this tension.
I think the killer is still out there among us.
- What does this mean?
- Burak hired that man.
"This way, not only he cleared his name from the accusations... ... but also, he can still claim that he's the victim."
- Why would he do that?
- That man absolutely hates us.
He wants to have us on a string.
But I won't take that.
I won't let that happen.
Don't rise yourself to the bait then.
"Either way, Burak will be in your life."
I am not very sure about that.
- I need to hang up.
- Is Ebru Hanım in her room?
"- She won't be here today, sir."
- Why?
I wasn't told the reason.
"- I will kill him! son.. son, go and inform the police immediately!"
"Don""t let the smugglers escape!"
"Don""t let Raman succeed in his plan."
You all risk your lives!
But.. but.. but the police..
Father! shekhar..
I will go and inform the police.
"You won""t be able to do this!"
Because you all know a lot! so as per our law.. you have no right to live!
You are right!
And you.. traitors have no right to live!
You all are not humans!
"You all are traitors! shut up! otherwise I won""t spare you!"
"Even God can""t stop a person from speaking the truth! shut up!"
No! scoundrels!
"Even if time and law spare you.. ..even if people forgive you.. but God will never spare you! kaka sir.. let""s kill all of them here only."
Why should we commit this sin?
"Why don""t we send all of them to Mr. shebiro""s boat? so that they all will drown."
"There can""t be any person more evil than you!"
Remember!
Your end too will be like this!
You too will drown. shut up!
Take them! come on! come on!
Leave me!
Leave me!
Leave me!
Leave me!
Leave her!
- Leave her!
You people killed my husband!
Now you want to rape my daughter!
"I can""t see all this!"
No wonder the world is left with on more virgins.
I've more class than the rest of them all.
Very high sounding!
"Your figure isn't too bad, though."
I can see that you have a hard on.
Have you made up your mind?
"If you want to do it, act fast before my mon returns."
What?
You're telling me to do it here?
You want to do it in the corridor?
Stop pulling my leg.
Who's calling the shots here?
You'd better find out.
I've never counted how many wet dreams I'm used to having.
I come twice that night.
...which made it a bad night for me.
Set the toxic fire.
The net.
Chief...
"If you try anything else, I'll blow the whistle, and the little snake will take a tour inside, and then emerge from your head."
Do you think you'll be alive?
"Hurry, get them out!"
"Let us go first,"
I won't fall in your trap.
"If I let you go, you won't help me."
I don't trust you either.
"What about this,"
"let Master Tuan go, he knows no martial arts."
No.
How can I leave you?
"Don't try to be a hero,"

Dimensional analysis
"Dimensional analysis is a method used in chemistry, physics, and other sciences. It is used to convert measurements and to find out something's dimensions. Sometimes it is called factor label method or unit analysis."
"Any math done with numbers must also be done with their unit labels. For example, when dividing 50 miles driven by 2 gallons of gas used, you not only divide 50 by 2 to get a result of 25, you also have to divide ""miles"" by ""gallons"", which gives the unit ""miles/gallon"" or ""miles per gallon"". The final answer is ""25 miles per gallon""."
"Looking at the unit labels can help in choosing what to do with the numbers. For example, to convert 2.3 miles to some number of meters, use the equation ""1609.34 meters equals one mile"" or 1609.34 meters per mile. Using division, the unit labels will be miles/meters/mile, which ends up as miles2/meter, which is not just the meters. With multiplication, the unit labels will be miles × meters/mile. The miles will cancel, leaving just meters."

"Pembroke College, Oxford"

"The letters č, š, ž and dž are like the English sounds in ""ch""in, ""sh""in, vi""s""ion and ""j""uice."
"The letters ď, ľ, ň, and ť are called “soft consonants” and are pronounced with the blade of the tongue at the roof of the mouth."
"The letters c, dz and j are also soft, like ""ts"" in ba""ts"", ""ds"" in ro""ds"", and ""y"" in ""y""es."
"Signs over a vowel show that the vowel is pronounced long: á, é, í, ó, ý ú. A long vowel is never followed in the next syllable by a short vowel."
"The letter ô is like English ""wo""man, and ä is the same as the letter e."
"The letter ch is like ""ch"" in Scottish lo""ch"". V is more like English ""w""."
"The letters b, d, ď, dz, dž, g, h, z, ž are voiceless when they are at the end of a word (for example, 'd' will sound like 't')."
"The accent is always on the first syllable of the word. That is different from Russian, for example, in which the stress can be anywhere."
"Like other Slavic languages, Slovak is difficult for English-speakers to pronounce., especially because several consonants often come together. In the sentence: “Strč prst skrz krk!” there is not one single vowel (it means: “Stick a finger through your neck!”)!"
Grammar.
"The grammar is similar to Russian, but there are some differences. Slovak, unlike Russian, has a separate word for “to be”:"
"Unlike English, Slovak does not have articles (such as “the” and “a”)."
"There are three genders in Slovak, therefore it is important to know whether a noun is masculine, feminine or neuter. There is no article to make it obvious (unlike in German), but it changes the adjective's ending."
"Like many other European languages, Slovak verbs agree with the person, and there are different forms for 'I', 'you', 'he', etc. Verbs have different aspects to show whether or not the action is complete. There are also different cases that show how a word is used in a sentence. Different prepositions use different cases. All of that makes grammar quite complicated for English-speakers."
Sample words and phrases.
The numbers from 1 to 10 are .
"Use the familiar form when talking to a child, and the polite form when talking to an adult."

"The battalion of German paratroops were from the German 1st Parachute Division under ""Generalleutnant"" Richard Heidrich. The Canadian forces were from the 1st Canadian Infantry Division under Major General Chris Vokes."
"It was part of the fighting on the Adriatic area in Italy. The battle has been called ""Little Stalingrad"" because of the violent, close fighting. The battle took place in the Adriatic Sea town of Ortona, with a population of 10,000."
Background.
"The Eighth Army's attack on the Winter Line defences started on 23 November. By the end of the month, Allied troops broke through the Gustav Line defences. The Allied troops were fighting towards the Moro river, near Ortona."
Ortona was one of Italy's few deep water ports on the east coast. The Allies wanted to capture the port. The Germans had constructed a series of defensive positions in the town.
The battle.
The Canadians had to battle the German 1st Parachute Division. These soldiers were experienced after many years of war. Adolf Hitler ordered them to defend Ortona.
The Canadian attack on the town was on December 20. The Germans had hidden machine guns and anti-tank guns in the town. This made it hard for Canadian tanks and infantry to move. The fighting was very violent. The soldiers fought for every house.
"After six days fighting, 2nd Brigade's third battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, joined the battle. Tanks from 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade also joined the battle."
"On 28 December, after eight days of fighting, the Germans withdrew from the town. The Canadians had 1,375 dead."
Battle of Anzio
"The Battle of Anzio, which is also called Operation Shingle (January 22, 1944) was an Allied sea landing in the Italian Campaign against German forces of Anzio and Nettuno, Italy."
The attack was commanded by American Major General John P. Lucas. He wanted to get around German forces on the Winter Line. Then he wanted to attack Rome. Making a sea landing in a marshland needed to be done quickly.

"After a month of heavy fighting,"
the Allies finally got past the beaches in May. The Allies went north-west to Rome which was captured on 4 June.
The German Tenth Army at Cassino were able to go north of Rome. Then they got ready to defend the Gothic Line.
Background.
"At the end of 1943, following the Allied invasion of Italy, Allied forces were stuck at the Gustav Line. Thid was defensive line across Italy. The land of central Italy helped the defence."
Operation Shingle was planned by Winston Churchill in December 1943. He planned to land two divisions at Anzio and capture Rome.
"General Harold Alexander had thought of a plan using five divisions. However, the 5th Army did not have enough troops or a way to transport them."
"The Anzio and Nettuno beaches are on marshland. When Truscott's 3rd Division was selected for the attack, he said everyone would die. Lucas was told lead the Fifth Army's U.S. VI Corps in a landing in the Anzio/Nettuno area."
Plan.
"Planners thought that if German forces left the Gustav Line to defend against the Allied attack, then Allied forces would be able to break through the line. If troops were left on the Gustav Line, then the Allies could try to capture Rome."
"The Allies planned to attack from the south. They wanted to capture a beach near Anzio, move forward, and be ready to go to Rome."
Availability of naval forces.
One of the problems with the plan was there was mot enough landing ships.
"Only enough tank landing ships (LSTs) to land a single division were available. Later, Churchill made sure enough were available to land two divisions."

William Bradford (Mayflower passenger)
"William Bradford (15901657) was a passenger on the ""Mayflower"" in 1620. He travelled to the New World to live in religious freedom. He became the second Governor of Plymouth Colony and served for over 30 years. Bradford kept a journal of the history of the early life in Plymouth Colony. It is called ""Of Plymouth Plantation""."
Childhood.
"Bradford was born to William and Alice Bradford in Austerfield, Yorkshire, England. His family were farmers. The Bradford family owned a large farm and were considered rich."
"Bradford's father died was he was one year old. When he was four years old he was sent to live with his grandfather. Two years later, his grandfather died and he returned to live with his mother and stepfather. A year later, in 1597, his mother died. Bradford became an orphan at age 7. He was sent to live with two uncles."
His uncles wanted Bradford to help on the farm but Bradford was ill and was not able to work. Bradford started to read many books. One of the books was the Bible. This may be where he started learning of a religion that was different from the church of England.
When Bradford was 12 years old he went with a friend to hear the pastor Richard Clyfton. Clyfton was a minister who did not believe in the Church of England. Bradford believed in Clyfton’s words. His uncles told him not to go to that church but he went anyway.
During one meeting he became friends with William Brewster. Brewster did not live far away and Bradford borrowed books from him about the new church.
King James I of England started to punish the people who did not follow the Church of England. They were called Separatists. By 1607 many members of the Separatists were arrested. Brewster was made to pay a fine for going to the church. Some members were put into prison and others were watched night and day. The people also learned that other Separatists in London had been put into prison and left to starve to death.
Hanamachi
"A hanamachi (花街) is a Japanese word used to call a neighborhood where courtesans and geisha lived and worked. The word's literal meaning is ""flower town"". These neighborhoods used to have many ""okiya"" (""geisha houses"") and ""ochaya"" (""tea houses"", where geishas entertained guests). The term ""hanamachi"" is used in modern Japan to call the areas where modern-day geisha are still living and working. Today, ""hanamachi"" are rare outside of Kyoto."
Japanese traditional dance
"There are two types of Japanese traditional dance: ""Odori"", which was created in the Edo period; and ""Mai"", which was created in the western part of Japan. Odori came from ""Kabuki"" drama, where it is danced by men. Mai derives from ""Noh"" drama, also danced by men. Today it is usually danced by female dancers, and is mostly done in houses, instead of on stage."
"A type of the Mai style of Japanese dance is the ""Kyomai"" or Kyoto style dance. Kyomai was created in the 17th century Tokugawa cultural period. Noh drama, music and dance was heavily influenced by the elegance of the manners of the Japanese Imperial Court. Kabuki drama, and hence Odori, was a more democratic form, but still (viewed with modern eyes) quite traditional."
Parkour
"Parkour is an activity in which the goal is to move from one place to another as quickly and efficiently as possible, using the abilities of the human body. Parkour helps to overcome barriers, and is practiced in rural and urban areas. Parkour practitioners are called ""traceurs"", or ""traceuses"" for females."
"Founded by David Belle in France, practitioners only use efficient movements to develop their bodies and minds, and to be able to overcome barriers in an emergency. It may also be a form of entertainment or a hobby."
"Acrobatics (such as flips and wall flips) are not part of parkour, because of inefficiency in a difficult situation (emergency). Freerunning is the branch of parkour, when such flips are used rather than efficient movement."
"In 1988, David Belle was 15 years old. His father Raymond Belle was a great fireman. David was influenced by his father. He left school at the age of 16 and his father helped him to make him stronger. David and his classmates began to create new actions to train themselves. They named it parkour."

Parts of the speech.
The Memphis Sanitation Strike.
Non-violence.
"When talking about the Strike, King focuses on the importance of non-violence. At a protest on March 28, some protesters had become violent and started breaking windows. King says:"
"King thought that if protesters or the people on strike were violent, other people would only pay attention to the violence. They would not pay attention to how badly the sanitation workers were treated."
Boycotting.
"King suggested boycotting things sold by white businesses as a nonviolent way of protesting and getting people's attention. He explains that one black person might be poor, but all together, they spent a lot of money. This gave them power. If they stopped buying things from businesses owned by white people, then those businesses would lose a lot of money. Then they would have to pay attention, or else they could go out of business. Meanwhile, black people could use their money to buy things from businesses owned by other blacks. King says:"

King was a Baptist pastor. He often mentioned stories from the Bible in his speeches.
"In the end of this speech, King is talking about a story from the Old Testament. Moses was the leader of the Israelites (the people of Israel). The Israelites followed Moses because they thought he would lead them to a Promised Land. In this Promised Land, they could live in peace."
"However, before the Israelites got to the Promised Land, God spoke to Moses. God said he would let Moses see the Promised Land with his eyes. However, God would not let Moses enter the Promised Land. The Bible says:"
"Soon after this, Moses died. Joshua replaced him as leader, and led the people of Israel into the Promised Land."
"King is saying that like Moses, he has ""been to the mountaintop"" and seen the Promised Land a society where black people have peace and equal rights. He knows that he may not get to this Promised Land with them, because he might die first. However, he tells his listeners that, like the people of Israel, African-Americans as a people will get to the Promised Land."

T-shirts are usually made from cotton fabric or fabric which contains a mix of cotton and polyester. T-shirts are usually considered a casual type of clothing. Both men and women wear T-shirts in Western countries, such as the United States, Canada, England, and France. In some countries, such as Muslim countries, women do not wear T-shirts outside of the home."
Sleeve
A sleeve is a piece of material which covers an arm. It is usually a part of a shirt or other garment.
Taxi
"A taxi (taxicab or cab in the United States) is a car, or other vehicle which is used for public transport. People use them to get to where they want to go. This means there are no stops in between where they get on and where they get off. Many big cities have taxis."
"In most other types of public transport, such as a bus, tram, or train, the rider does not get to choose the locations where they want to get picked up or dropped off. These vehicles often take certain roads or follow a very specific route. Because of this, they usually do not stop exactly where people want to go."
"Riding a taxi is a lot like having your own car, but you don't drive it. You only tell the taxi driver where you want to go and he or she will take you there. How much you pay for the ride, in most cases, depends on how far you are going from where you get on. It is common for the price for a taxi ride to be more expensive than other forms of transport."
History.
"The first taxi-type system started in Paris and London in the early 17th century. These were carts pulled by (carriages) and could be hired. The monarchies that ruled these cities controlled the rules. In the 19th century, Hansom cabs were mostly used because of their higher level of safety."
Taximeter.
"Most coral fungi grow on the ground, but some grow on well decayed logs and stumps."
They are usually found in forests but some can also be found in fields. They are decomposers.
Eating.
"Although they are not poisonous, some kinds are a laxative and some can cause stomach pain."
Stone fruit
"A stone fruit, also called a drupe, is a fruit with a large ""stone"" inside. The stone is sometimes called the seed, but that is a mistake, as the seed is inside the stone. The stones can also be called a pit. These fruits are edible and used frequently in cooking."
Identification.
What makes a fruit?
"A fruit is the matured ovary of a flower. Fruits consist of two main parts: the pericarp, or ovary wall, and the seed(s)."
"The pericarp has three layers: the exocarp (skin/rind), the mesocarp (bulk of the pericarp), and the endocarp (innermost layer)."
Berries vs. drupes.
"The two main classes of fleshy fruits are berries and drupes, or stone fruits."
"Berries have a fleshy mesocarp and endocarp, and may have multiple seeds."
"Drupes have a fleshy mesocarp, but a tough endocarp, and of course, a ""stone"" or ""pit"" at its center. Drupes typically have only a single seed."
Humpback whale
"A humpback whale (""Megaptera novaeangliae"") is a large baleen whale with long flippers and a knobbly head. They can be found in every ocean."
They can grow to 15–16 m (49–52 ft) long and weigh up to 40 metric tons.
Life history.
Humpback whales can live up to 45 years. They migrate between the places they feed in the winter and the places they give birth in the summer. They usually live alone.
Feeding.
"Humpback whales eat krill and small fish, for example herring, capelin, and sand lance. They scoop up their food in their large mouths. Sometimes they round up their prey by swimming in tight circles and blowing curtains of bubbles around them. They often hunt in small groups, called pods."
Whale song.
"The male whale is known to sing for up to 22 hours at a time. Because whales do not have vocal cords, they make songs by forcing air through their nasal passages. Every male has a different song. We don't yet know why they sing, it might be to call a female or scare away other males. The songs are made up of a pattern of low notes repeated over a period of hours or days. The whales slowly change their songs over a period of years."
Other sounds.
"Both the male and female humpback whales make other sounds, such as moans and grunts, to communicate with each other."
Slovak language
"Slovak is the language spoken in Slovakia, a country in Central Europe. It is a language from Slavic language family. It is very similar to Czech, and Czechs and Slovaks understand each other quite well when they speak their own language. Polish and Sorbian are also quite similar. All of them belong to the western branch of Slavic languages. Slovak is spoken by more than 5 million people."
Pronunciation.
"Slovak is written using the Latin alphabet, but some letters have special signs (called diacritics)."
"Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality cooking television show that airs on Food Network. It began on August 11, 2013. It is hosted by Alton Brown."
Format.
"Four chefs are given three cooking challenges. Each challenge has a type of dish that the chefs have to make in 30 minutes. Before then, the chefs have one minute to get ingredients out of a pantry. After 30 minutes, a judge tastes each dish, and the chef with the worst dish is eliminated."
"At the start of the game, the chefs are each given $25,000. In the first two challenges, Brown shows items that are put up to auction for the chefs to buy using their money. The chefs can use these items on other chefs to change their ingredients, what cooking tools they can use, and other things. For example, an item may force a chef to cook using canned ingredients instead of fresh ones. The chef who is eliminated has to give back the money that they have. In the last challenge, no items are shown at first, but during the first minutes of the challenge, Brown will put items up for auction. This makes it so the person who gets the item has to change their dish based on what the item does. The chef that wins keeps the money that they have left."
Pescetarianism
Pescetarianism means having a diet that is vegetarianism but with fish and other seafoods.
Semi-vegetarianism
"Semi-vegetarianism means eating seafood or poultry, or both, but no red meat. People who eat red meat on rare occasion are ""flexitarians"". Real or semi-vegetarians, though, usually resent ""flexitarian"", looking down on this term and calling it cheating."
"A pescetarian is a person who eats fish, shrimp and seafood. They do not eat poultry."
"A ""pollotarian"" is a person who eats chicken. They do not eat red meat, seafood or fish."
"""Pollo-pescetarians"" eat seafood, shrimp and poultry but no red meat."
"People who have semi-vegetarian diets are usually doing so for health reasons, including avoiding heart disease, diabetes and strokes."
Ovo-lacto vegetarianism
"Ovo-lacto vegetarianism (alternate: lacto-ovo) is a diet in which people do not eat the flesh of animals. They do, though, eat eggs and dairy. Ovo-lacto vegetarians are the most prevalent types in the Western world. Such people are well served in restaurants, especially in certain parts of Europe and in North America."
Ovo-lacto vegetarians use this diet sometimes for religious reasons. Others use it for health.

"As Chingphulon Konthousu grew up, she was known for her beauty and gentleness. She used to go to woods, lakes and open meadows for fun. One day, while Tampha was out in an open field with her friends, a strong wind blew. Tampha was lifted up by a whirlwind towards the sky. Her friends could do nothing but watch. The wind took her to heaven, the abode of Salailen. He was waiting for her."
"Tampha was unhappy about being far away from her parents and friends. To please her, Salailen promised her that the people of her native place would attain immortality and be safe from all diseases. Still, her parents, family and friends cried for the loss of her. Salailen told them that Tampha was safe with him. He told them about the promises he kept to her. Many years had passed and Salailen and Tampha had a son. She and Salailen named their son Khoriphaba."
"Tampha's parents wanted to see her. So they planned to meet her. Men went on a hunting expedition with their hunting dogs across the Thangjing Hills. Unfortunately, they could not catch even one animal. The tired hunters rested under the shade of a tree. Meanwhile, one of their favorite hunting dogs wandered away. The dog saw a large python sitting in sun. It barked at the python. The python killed it. Later, the hunters found the dead dog and carried it home. They prepared a funeral for the dog. The smoke from the funeral rose up towards the sky."
"Up in Heaven, Tampha saw the smoke rising from her native place. She knew it was for a funeral. She worried about her people. Perhaps someone had died even though Salailen had promised to keep them safe from disease. She asked Salailen about his promises. Salailen told her that the funeral was only for a dog. She did not believe him and wanted to see her parents. Reluctantly, Salailen allowed her to meet people under some conditions. She should leave only after their son Khoriphaba had gone to sleep and should come back before he woke up. Also, she should not consume any earthly foods or drinks. Then, he placed a golden ladder (or ""golden stairs"" in another version) for her to climb down. She landed on the Thangjing Hill and then went to Konthoujam, her native land. She met her near and dear ones. Her mother offered Tampha delicious foods."
"Tampha did not accept her mother's offers. However, her mother caught hold of her and tried to force her to eat. Tampha told her mother of the conditions with which she was leaving heaven to meet them on earth. Then, her mother arranged a shade with seven layers of false ceiling, enclosed by seven layers of drapery. Her plan was to block the vision of Salailen from above. Inside the shades, she served out delicious food for Tampha. Poor Tampha was compelled to eat what her mother had so lovingly prepared for her. But the God Salailen saw it happen even through the drapes. As Tampha started eating, Salailen proclaimed from heaven that she could not come back to his abode. He spat a blob of spit on her hand (or ""on her food"" in another version). The golden ladder (or ""golden stairs"" in another version) was also lifted up. Poor Tampha was abandoned from heaven. Salailen also took back his promises of immortality and immunity to disease."
"Later, she lived in the outskirts of Konthoujam. Since then, she came to be known as Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi."

Can't Be Tamed
Can't Be Tamed is the third album made by American singer Miley Cyrus. The album has twelve songs including three singles.
Development and singles.
"""Can't Be Tamed"" is Cyrus's first single. It was released May 18th, 2010. ""Can't Be Tamed"" had good reviews from critics. The song peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached its highest peak at number five on both the Irish Singles Chart and New Zealand Singles Chart. The music video is Cyrus performing with backup dancers throughout a museum. Cyrus is first trapped in a giant cage, being watched by people in the audience as they were trying to see the rare creature 'Adias Cyrus' she then escapes and trashes the museum. She has promoted ""Can't Be Tamed"" by performing it at several places, including a performance on ""Britain's Got Talent"" and the critics had negative ratings and reviews. The song is also a part of Cyrus' second world tour, Gypsy Heart Tour."
"""Who Owns My Heart"" is Cyrus' second single. It was released on October 22, 2010. Cyrus described it as a ""total dance track"" with a cool idea. Cyrus' ""Who Owns My Heart"" is a club-oriented song that speaks of meeting a potential love on the dance floor. The song tries not to proceed to question, ""Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?"" Bill Lamb of About.com thought that, despite its beat, the overall sound of ""Who Owns My Heart"" is faceless and dull. The video starts with Cyrus asleep, blindfolded on a mattress in a bedroom. She wakes up and shakes on the mattress. Following, Cyrus goes to a bathroom, her outfit is a white tank top, white boy shorts, a fishnet hair wrap, rollers, and heavy metal jewelry. While in the bathroom scenes, Cyrus sings as she sits on the edge of a bathtub and prepares herself for a party. When the chorus comes on, Cyrus appears shaking in the backseat of a limousine, costumed in a low-cut gold halter top, black hot pants, a black jacket with shoulder pads, and big hair. Once arrived at the mansion party, she is first seen dancing on top of a big, wooden table. In continuing after, Cyrus dances with multiple people on the dance floor. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus in all prior scenes or dancing with others in the mansion's study. The video finishes with Cyrus back in her bedroom, once again waking up."
"""Every Rose Has Its Thorn"" is Cyrus' third single. It was a single on June 11th, 2011. It was made by Poison in 1988. Miley's version is one minute and 29 seconds shorter than Poison's official song. Hollywood Records released Cyrus' cover in June 2011, and a music video was created and released in 2010."

Graham's number
Graham's number is a very big natural number that was defined by a man named Ronald Graham. Graham was solving a problem in an area of mathematics called Ramsey theory. He proved that the answer to his problem was smaller than Graham's number.
"Graham's number is one of the biggest numbers ever used in a mathematical proof. Even if every digit in Graham's number were written in the tiniest writing possible, it would still be too big to fit in the observable universe."
Context.
Ramsey theory is an area of mathematics that asks questions like the following:
"It turns out that for this simple problem, the answer is ""yes"" when we have 6 or more points, no matter how the lines are colored. But when we have 5 points or fewer, we can color the lines so that the answer is ""no""."
"By asking that the 4 points lie on a plane, we have made the problem much harder. We would like to know: for what values of ""n"" is the answer ""no"" (for some way of coloring the lines), and for what values of ""n"" is it ""yes"" (for all ways of coloring the lines)? But this problem has not been completely solved yet."
"In 1971, Ronald Graham and B. L. Rothschild found a partial answer to this problem. They showed that for ""n""=6, the answer is ""no"". But when ""n"" is very large, as large as Graham's number or larger, the answer is ""yes""."
"One of the reasons this partial answer is important is that it means that the answer is eventually ""yes"" for at least some large ""n"". Before 1971, we didn't know even that much."
"There is a much smaller limit for the same problem called N. It is equal to formula_1, where formula_2. This weaker upper bound for the problem, attributed to an unpublished work of Graham, was eventually published and named by Martin Gardner in Scientific American in November 1977."
Definition.
"Graham's number is not only too big to write down all of its digits, it is too big even to write in scientific notation. In order to be able to write it down, we have to use Knuth's up-arrow notation."
"We will write down a sequence of numbers that we will call g1, g2, g3, and so on. Each one will be used in an equation to find the next. g64 is Graham's number."
"First, here are some examples of up-arrows:"
"After that, g2 is equal to formula_18; the number of arrows in this number is g1."
"g3 is equal to formula_19, where the number of arrows is g2."
"We keep going in this way. We stop when we define g64 to be formula_19, where the number of arrows is g63."
This is Graham's number.

Takalik Abaj
"""Lo, the Princess is at band."""
"Thoibi heard the shout. She instructed her companions to sit near her if the man was Khamba but far away if the man was Kongyamba."""
It was Kongyamba and not Khamba.
"However, she went on. She pretended to be friendly with him. She sat on the red carpet of Kongyamba's possession. However, she placed a stick between Kongyamba and her. She asked him for fruits to eat. Kongyamba brought her fruits. But she did not eat the fruits. She pretended to get ill due to her long journey from Kabaw. Kongyamba was worried."
"She asked Kongyamba to let her ride on his horse. He agreed. So, Thoibi rode Kongyamba's horse. Kongyamba rode in Thoibi's palanquin."
"Surprisingly, Thoibi galloped off on the horse towards Khamba's house. Khamba received her from the long time exile at his house. They wept for their reunion."
"On the other hand, Kongyamba was angry for being tricked by a girl. He tried to gain support from the King's ministers to intervene into the matter. In the meantime, Minister Thonglen and Minister Nongtholba sent men to guard Khamba and Thoibi."
"The matter was set before the King in the Royal Court. The king wanted to solve the issue by the trial of the spear. During the discussion, an old man came to the meet the king. The old man informed him that a ferocious tiger was a great threat to the villagers of Khoirentak region."
The King changed his mind. He announced that the tiger will be the determining point of the matter. He added that the killer of the tiger will marry Princess Thoibi.
Death.
King Chingkhu Telheiba of Moirang announced that the killer of the man-eating tiger of Khoirentak could marry princess Thoibi. Nongban Kongyamba and Khuman Khamba were chosen for the task. The ferocious tiger killed Nongban during the hunt.
Rebirth as a singing bird.
"In his dying bed, Nongban requested Khuman Khamba to allow him to sing a song about princess Thoibi (alias Thadoi). The request was granted. After he died, his soul turned into a legendary bird named ""Pithadoi"" (""Pee Thadoi""). Pee Thadoi continued to sing songs about Thadoi. His songs are sung in pathetic and tragic notes."
In popular culture.
"Kao, the sacred bull."
"In 2011, ""Kao, the sacred bull"" was produced by the Laihui Ensemble. This theatrical show was based on the story of Kao (bull) captured by Khuman Khamba. According to the story, the Oracle (Nongban himself) chose Khamba to capture the bull."

The play is based on the legend of capturing the bull in Ancient Moirang.
Quagga mussel
"The Quagga mussel is a freshwater mussel. Originally it occurred in the drainage basin of the Dnieper river, mostly in Ukraine. The mussel is named after the Quagga, an extinct species of zebra. The mussels live for three to five years. Since about the 1940s, they have spread a lot outside their original range. They are considered an invasive species in most of Europe, and North America. It looks like certain species of perch have developed an appetite for thes mussels. They are now considered as a natural form of pest control."

Chess databases.
"Chess databases do not actually play. They give access to the recorded history of master chess. There are two components. First, there is the software, which lets one search and organise the database material. Then there is the actual database, typically one to four million games."
"In practice, databases are used for two purposes. First, for a player to train his/her ability at specific openings. Second, to look up specific opponents to see what they play, and prepare against them beforehand."
The existence of chess databases is one way that young players can achieve mastery at an early age.
ChessBase.
"ChessBase is the biggest database, and widely used by masters. Although it can be used online, most users download the software and data onto their laptop. Then they take the laptop to tournaments, to help prepare for games. Players may not use computers or any other aid during games, but much preparation goes on behind the scenes. ChessBase has to be purchased, and it is not cheap."
New in Chess.
"This is a Dutch magazine for advanced players, which runs an on-line database called NicBase as part of its services. NicBase is free, and has over a million games."
Chessgames.
"Chessgames.com runs an on-line database of games. It is partly free, but requires registration. Full access to all its facilities is by a fairly modest subscription. It has over half a million games on its database."
On-line playing sites.
"There are websites which a player can join (for a fee) and play on line. In this case, the subscriber will play against other subscribers, not a computer. All standards of players are amongst the members, and various events are on offer at different rates of play. The two leaders in this market are:"

History.
"Legends say that one day, an old man was taking care of his flock when an old lady called to him. She asked the man to get her some water to drink. The man said he would do this. He went to a nearby well and got water for the woman. The woman then asked him to take care of her hair. That night, the man had a dream. The woman appeared in his dream. She asked him to build a small temple for her. The next day, the man told his friends and neighbors about his dream. They set up a small hut and began to worship the woman as a goddess. People have believed that she chose this place because she thought it would be a good place to live. It is believed that the area had many types of trees. The area still has many trees today."
"The Dutch ruled the area in 1658. They ruled from 1658 until the British took control in 1796. During this time, a history book was written by A. Muthuthambipillai. The book says that Saravanamuthu Mudaliar was a Panchayat judge. It says that he held his court in a place now called 'Sathiyakadu'. This place was is in Tolpura at that time. With the permission of the Governor of Holland, a temple was built at Tolpura."
Architecture.
"According to documents from near the year 1650, the temple was built using burnt bricks. Laterm descendants of the original builders rebuilt the temple using stone. The cost of rebuilding the temole were paid for by the people of Valakkamparai in Tholpuram."
Special events.
The main religious festivals at the temple are celebrated during June or July. They include the Chariot Festival.
Wedding hall.
There is a large air-conditioned hall at the temple. It is used for the weddings of the Hindu people. The wedding hall can also be used for other activities. The hall can hold a maximum of 500 people. This hall started functioning in 2015.
Akkrum
"Akkrum is a village that lies in the municipality of Heerenveen, which is in the province of Friesland, the Netherlands. It is in the northern part of the municipality, and had about 3,400 people in 2017."
"Akkrum belonged to the former municipality of Boarnsterhim until 2014, and to the municipality of Utingeradeel until 1984."
It has a railway station that connects Akkrum with Leeuwarden in the north and Heerenveen in the south. Motorway A32 is to the right of the village.
The village of Nes is just right of Akkrum.
"The lake Sneekermeer (Snitser Mar) lies in the neighbourhood, to the southwest."
Maruoka Castle
"Maruoka Castle (丸岡城, ""Maruoka-jō"") is in Sakai, Fukui Prefecture. It is also called Kasumi-ga-jō (霞ヶ城). The castle tower was built between 1624 to 1644. It is one of the twelve existing castle towers in Japan (現存十二天守, ""genzon-jūni-tenshu""), and also one of the national important cultural properties."
History.
"In 1576, Nobunaga Oda ordered Katsutoyo Shibata to build Maruoka Castle to get ready for the ikkō-ikki, a rebellion by believers of the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism in the 15th-16th centuries. In 1613, Narushige Honda became the first lord, castle owner, of the Maruoka Castle. After the Honda family, the Arima family were lords of Maruoka Castle from 1695 to 1869. Shigesumi Arima was lord from 1772 to 1830. He rebuilt the local domain economy. On 8 July 1948,  an earthquake hit Fukui. The quake destroyed the castle tower of Maruoka Castle. But, in 1955 the castle tower was repaired by recycling more than 70% of the original materials of Maruoka Castle."
Structure.
"Maruoka Castle’s stone walls are about 6.2 meters high. The stone walls were built using ""nozura-zumi"" (野面積み), an architectural method to build stone walls with a good system of drains. This protects the building from damage by heavy rain. Maruoka Castle is also famous for its steep stairs. The stairs that go up from the first floor to the second floor are at an angle of 65 degrees. The stairs from the second floor to the third floor are at an angle of 67 degrees."
Events.
Cherry Blossom Festival.

Classes of natural numbers.
Prime numbers.
A prime number is a natural number which has only two divisors: 1 and itself.
Highly composite numbers.
"A highly composite number is a natural number that has more divisors than any smaller natural number. They are used a lot in geometry, grouping, and time measurement."
The first 20 highly composite numbers are:
"1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 720, 840, 1260, 1680, 2520, 5040, 7560"
Perfect numbers.
A perfect number is an integer that is the sum of its positive divisors (all divisors except itself).
The first 10 perfect numbers:
Integers.
"Integers are a set of numbers. They usually are in arithmetic and number theory. There are many subsets of integers. These can cover natural numbers, prime numbers, perfect numbers, etc."
Popular integers are −1 and 0.
Orders of magnitude.
"Integers can be written in orders of magnitude. This can be written as 10""k"", where ""k"" is an integer. If ""k"" = 0, 1, 2, 3, then the powers of ten for them are 1, 10, 100 and 1000. This is used in scientific notation."
"Each number has its own prefix. Each prefix has its own symbol. For example, ""kilo-"" may be added to the beginning of ""gram."" This changes the meaning of ""gram"" to mean that the gram is 1000 times more than a gram: one kilogram is the same as 1000 grams."
Rational numbers.
"A rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction with two integers. The numerator is written as and the denominator(which cannot be zero) is written as . Every integer is a rational number. This is because in integers, 1 is always the denominator of a fraction."
"Rational numbers can be written in infinitely many ways. For example, 0.12 can be written as ""three twenty-fifths"" (), ""nine seventy-fifths"" (), etc."
Irrational numbers.
Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as a fraction. These are written as algebraic numbers or transcendental numbers.
Real numbers.
The real numbers are a superset(or category) of numbers. They cover algebraic and transcendental numbers.
Hypercomplex numbers.
A hypercomplex number is a word for an element of a unital algebra over the field of real numbers.
Transfinite numbers.
"Transfinite numbers are numbers that are ""infinite"". They are larger than any finite number. They are, however, not absolutely infinite."
Physical Constants.
Physical constants are constants that can be used in the universe to figure out information.

Beriberi
Beriberi (also called vitamin B1 deficiency) is a disease of the nervous system. It happens when a person does not get enough thiamine (vitamin B1) in their diet.
"Thiamine helps the body turn food into energy. People need thiamine for good brain function and a healthy liver, skin, hair, and eyes. It also helps the nervous system work properly."
"Without enough thiamine, a person’s body cannot create all the energy the person needs. As a result, people with beriberi have severe lethargy and feel exhausted. Beriberi can also cause muscles to get weaker. These symptoms can make it hard for a person to do simple things."
Some people with beriberi have heart problems or even die. Beriberi can also cause problems with the gastrointestinal system.
"Most people get enough vitamin B1 in their regular diet. However, some groups are more likely to get beriberi. These include people who drink a lot of alcohol and people who eat an unhealthy or unbalanced diet, like a diet of mostly white rice."
There are two kinds of beriberi: wet and dry. Wet beriberi mainly affects the cardiovascular system. Dry beriberi affects the nervous system. There is also a rare type of genetic beriberi.
"Most of the time, dry beriberi and wet beriberi happen at the same time in the same person. When this takes place, the victim is likely to only get the symptoms of one beriberi."

Species.
Scientists say there are three species in this genus:
Grotte Mandrin
"The Grotte Mandrin is a cave near Montélimar. It is near the small French town Malaverne, in the Drôme department. It is more like a shelter, that protects from the weather, and not really a cave. It is an archeological site: There are many well-preserved finds from the transition from the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic. The oldest layer of finds is 120,000 years old."
It is named after the French folk hero Louis Mandrin.
Location.
"The Abri is about southeast of Malataverne town center. It is at the foot of an exposed limestone cliff at 245 m height. At the site, the valley is very narrow, only about . Important traffic routes pass through there: the A7, N7, D169 and the high-speed line LGV Méditerranée ."
Topography.
"Today, the Grotte Mandrin has a depth of . At some point part of it collapsed. Today, large boulders on the slope below are still there. The covered area was originally much larger. There is an opening of about facing north. At the front, the cave has a height of about . From the middle of the cave, it gets lower. At the back, the height is about less."
"In 2013, a fence was built on the space in front of the case. In 2016, video surveillance was installed."
History.
"When he found traces Bronze Age settlements there in 1960, Gaston Etienne (1923-2010) recognized that the case was important for archaeology. Etienne was a councillor in Malaverne. Since 1993, there have been excavations each year. Since 2006, Ludovic Slimak - a research associate from the University of Toulouse and the CNRS is overseeing these excavations. There are twelve cultural layers at the site, In 2014, seven layers had been excavated. The layers date from 42.000 BP (called early Aurigacien) to 56,000 BP (La Quina-Mousterian)."
"The oldest known evidence that anatomically-modern humans (homo sapiens) were present in Europe was found in the Batcho Kiro Cave in Bulgaria; this evidence is 45,820 to 43,650 years (Cal BP) old. In February 2022, it was announced that part of a tooth was found at the Mandrin Cave. It came from a layer of the Mandrin Cave under and over which Neanderthal remains have been recovered, but this ""baby tooth"" has been attributed to a child of Homo sapiens. Articles in the Journals Science, as well as in Nature, said that the tooth was too badly damaged to be able to tell with certainty if it was from a Neanderthal, or a human."
Superabundant number
A superabundant number is a type of natural number. They were defined by Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erdős in 1944.
Definition.
"Any natural number ""n"" is called superabundant when a certain equation is true."
"In this equation, ""m"" is every integer less than ""n"". ""σ"" is the sum of every positive divisor of that number."
"An example would be to use the number 9. For every number less than 8, the sigma is 1, 3, 4, 7, 6, 10, 8 and 16. (""σ""(""m""))/""m"" is 16/9. (""σ""(n))/n is equal to 13/9. 13/9 is less than 16/9. This makes 9 not a superabundant number"
"The first few superabundant numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, ... ."

Chicken
"Chicken (""Gallus gallus domesticus"") is a term which refers to a species of poultry. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs. They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Some breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance. Some sleep in trees (if there are trees around)."
"A male chicken is called a rooster or a cock(erel). Roosters do not have penises. A female chicken is called a hen; a young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs. The eggs hatch into chicks."
"When raising chickens, a farmer needs a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes. Fences are often used for this."
Chickens can also be farmed intensively. This lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs.
Eggs.
Chickens are well known for their eggs. Many people eat them for their breakfast. The eggs can be prepared in many different ways.
Meat.
"Because of their low cost, chicken meat (also called ""chicken"") is one of the most used kinds of meat in the world. Americans eat 8 billion chickens every year. Some popular dishes with chicken are: Buffalo wings, butter chicken, chicken rice, chicken balls, chicken pot pie, chicken soup, fried chicken (see picture), roasted chicken and tandoori chicken."

"There are different cuts of chicken. Chicken meat can also be bought whole. The leanest part is known as the breast. Sliced pieces of the breast are known as the tender(loin). There are also wings, thighs, and legs (also known as drumsticks)."
Chicken and chickenpox.
"Chickenpox has nothing to do with chickens. When chickenpox was first described, people thought that the pox spots looked like chickpeas placed upon the skin. The Latin word for chickpeas is ""grana"". That is the original word that chickenpox got its name from."
Gaming.
In some parts of the world people breed chickens to fight. They bet money on which of two birds will win. In many places this is illegal.

"Milparinka, New South Wales"
"Milparinka is a very small town in New South Wales, Australia. About ten people live in Milparinka, which is about 296 kilometres north of Broken Hill. It is built beside a waterhole on Evelyn Creek, named by the explorer Charles Sturt after his wife in 1844. Sturt and his group had been trapped at a waterhole they called Depot Glen nearby on Preservation Creek for seven months while they waited for rain."
"Gold was found at Milparinka, which became the centre for the Albert Goldfields in the 1880s. Two other nearby gold towns, Albert and Mount Browne, were abandoned because of the lack of water. During the peak of the goldrush, Milparinka had a population of more than 3000 people. By 1893 most people had left. Today there are only a few buildings left, the hotel, the courthouse, police station, and the remains of the post office."
The courthouse was built of local sandstone in 1896. The final court session was in 1921. The building has been restored and is used as a local museum.
Skin cancer
"Skin cancer is the term that is used for all bad forms of growth of the skin. In everyday use, people often talk about melanoma, but there are other forms of skin cancer, too. These are usually named after the type of cell that grows uncontrollably. Most skin cancers develop in the epidermis. Very often a tumor can be seen, so it is often possible to detect skin cancer at an early stage. Very few people with skin cancer will die of the disease., though it can be disfiguring. Melanoma survival rates are poorer than for non-melanoma skin cancer, although when melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage, treatment is easier and more people survive."
"Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer. Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers combined are more common than lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Melanoma is less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but it is the most serious — for example, in the UK there were over 11,700 new cases of melanoma in 2008, and over 2,000 deaths. It is the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15–34 in the UK. Most cases are caused by over-exposure to UV rays from the sun or sunbeds."
"Non-melanoma skin cancers are the most common skin cancers. The majority of these are basal cell carcinomas. These are usually small spot growths caused by too much exposure to the sun over time. They do not usually spread, and rarely kill."

History.
Early history.
Mandalay was started by King Mindon. He started the city on 13 February 1857. He built Mandalay as the new capital city of the Kingdom of Burma.
Mindon's city was in size. There were rivers on each side. It had 144 square blocks in a grid. In the middle was a palace that was 16 square blocks in size.
The palace had four walls that were each long. Around the walls was a moat that was wide and deep. Each wall had turrets (towers) for watchmen. These turrets were placed every . Each turret had a spire made of gold. Each side had three gates and five bridges across the moat.
"The king also built some other buildings in the city. These buildings were the Kuthodaw Pagoda, the ""Pahtan-haw Shwe Thein"" upasampada hall, the ""Thudamma"" ""Good Dharma"" zayats (), and a library for the Pāli Canon. A ""zayat"" is a building where Buddhism is taught."
"In June 1857, the king moved the royal palace to Mandalay. The palace had been in Amarapura. The building was taken apart. Each piece was moved by elephants to Mandalay. The palace was put back together and finished on 23 May 1859. The palace is now at the bottom of Mandalay Hill."
"Mandalay was the capital for 26 years. It was the last royal capital of the Konbaung Dynasty. (The Konbaung Dynasty were the last rulers of the Kingdom of Burma before it was taken over by the British Empire.) On 28 November 1885, the British conquered Burma. This ended the Third Anglo-Burmese War. King Thibaw Min and Queen Supayalat were sent into exile."
Mandalay in British Burma (1885-1948).
Mandalay was still an important city in British Burma. The city of Rangoon became the capital of Burma.
"The British wanted to make Mandalay an important commercial city. They did not want it to be important for politics, education, or other reasons. Mandalay was connected to Yangon by railroad in 1889. The first college in Mandalay wasn't built until 1925."
The royal palace was looted by the British. All of the treasures were stolen. Some treasures can be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The British changed the name of the palace to Fort Dufferin. British soldiers used the palace as a barracks (a place to camp.)
"Mandalay was the most important city for Burmese culture during the time the British were in charge. It was also the most important place for Buddhist learning. The Burmese people saw Mandalay as a symbol. Between World War I and World War II, there were many protests in Mandalay against the British."
"During the time the British were in charge, many people moved to Mandalay from India. (India was also a British colony.) From 1904 to 1905, a plague happened. About one third of the people of Mandalay left to get away from the disease."
"During World War II, Mandalay was bombed by the Japanese. The British moved all of their airplanes to India. Mandalay had no defenses against the Japanese air raids. On 3 April 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service bombed the city. Three-fifths (3/5) of the houses were destroyed. More than 2,000 civilians (people who are not military) were killed."
The Japanese soon invaded Burma. The Imperial Japanese Army took over the city of Mandalay. They were in charge from May 1942 until March 1945. The palace citadel was made into a supply depot. (A supply depot is a building that stores supplies like food and machines.)
The Allied forces bombed the city after the Japanese took it over. Much of the palace was destroyed. Only the royal mint and watch tower were not destroyed. The palace was rebuild in the 1990s.
Mandalay today (1948 - now).
"In 1948, the British left Burma. Mandalay was still the most important city for culture, education, and commerce in Upper Burma."
"Until the 1990s, most students went to university in Mandalay. Until 1991, there were only three universities in Upper Burma: Mandalay University, The University of Medicine, Mandalay, and the Defense Services Academy. All of these universities are in Mandalay. Only some other cities had schools called ""Degree Colleges."" These were small schools that were part of Mandalay University. These colleges had classes in a small number of subjects."
"From 1962 to 1988, Ne Win was in charge of the government. He was very isolationist. This means that he did not want Myanmar to be part of global trade or tourism. In the 1980s, Mandalay was the second biggest city in Myanmar. It looked like a town with low buildings, dusty streets, and more bicycles than cars."
"During the 1980s, there were two big fires. In May 1981, a fire destroyed more than 6,000 buildings. 36,000 people were left homeless. On 24 March 1984, there was another fire. This fire destroyed 2,700 buildings. 23,000 more people were made homeless."
"Fires are still a big problem. In February 2008, there was another big fire in Mandalay. It destroyed the Yadanabon Market. This was the second-biggest market in the city. In February 2009, a fire destroyed 320 houses. More than 1,600 people were made homeless."
"The fires during the 1980s destroyed a lot of buildings. This made a lot of land empty. Many Chinese people in Burma bought this land. A lot of these people had come from Yunnan in China. Many Chinese people came to Upper Burma and Mandalay from Yunnan and Sichuan in the 1990s. 250,000 to 350,000 people from Yunnan came to Mandalay in the 1990s. Today, about 30% to 40% of the people of Mandalay are Chinese. The native Burmese people complain that Mandalay is now like a part of China."
"The Chinese have rebuilt the parts of the city that burned down. They built apartment buildings, hotels, and shopping centers. They helped make Mandalay again an important city for trade and commerce. It now connects trade for Upper Burma, Lower Burma, China, and India."
Mandalay has grown much bigger over time. It now includes what used to be Amarapura. (Amarapura was where King Mindon's capital city used to be before he moved it to Mandalay.) Mandalay celebrated its 150th birthday on 15 May 2009 at 4:31:36 am.
Important places.
There are many important places and buildings in Mandalay.
Mandalay Palace.

Area code 404
"Area code 404 is an area code for Georgia. It was one of the first area codes created in October 1947. It covered the entire state until it was split by 912 in 1954, 706 in 1992, and 770 in 1995. It now covers the Atlanta region of Georgia. It covers counties such as Clayton, DeKalb, Fulton, Cobb, Douglas, and Gwinnett counties. It was overlaid by 678 in 1998, 470 in 2001, and 943 on March 15, 2022."
Isthmohyla pseudopuma
"The meadow tree frog or Gunther's Costa Rican tree frog (""Isthmohyla pseudopuma"") is a frog that lives in Costa Rica and Panama. In Panama and parts of Costa Rica, it lives between 1000 and 2400 meters above sea level. On the Pacific side (west) of the mountains in Costa Rica, it lives no more than 864 meters above sea level."
Appearance.
The adult male frog is 37.6 to 42.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 41.1 and 45.6 mm long.
This frog is brown and light brown on the back and yellow on its belly. It has a white stripe on both back legs. Some of them have blue color on their middles.
Actions.
"This frog hides during the day in bromeliad plants and other plants with large leaves. At night, it goes to trees and bushes to look for food."
"These frogs lay eggs after heavy rains. The males go to water, deep water if they can, and sing for the females. The females choose the largest male frogs. The female lays 500 eggs at a time, 1800 to 2500 eggs per female per year."
"The tadpoles eat plants and dead things. They will also eat frog eggs and smaller tadpoles. They will eat eggs and tadpoles from other species or other Gunther's Costa Rican tree frogs. If the pond starts to dry up, the tadpoles become frogs quicker than if it did not dry up."
Threats.
"This frog is not in danger of dying out but there are fewer of them than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives, because of climate change, and because there is more ultraviolet B light than there was. This light can hurt this frog."
Area code 405
"Area code 405 is an area code created for Oklahoma. It was one of the first area codes created in October 1947. It initially covered the entire state of Oklahoma, but after it was split by 918 in 1953 and 580 in 1997, it now covers the central portion of the state. It was overlaid by 572 in 2021."
Failed supernova
"A failed supernova, also known as an unnova, is the opposite of a supernova. When a large enough star runs out of fuel, it turns into a red supergiant. When these stars die, they cause an incredible explosion. This is a supernova. In the case of a failed supernova, the star will just collapse into a black hole. It does not explode into a supernova."
Failed supernovas may be a cause of rogue planets. Rogue planets are planets without a star.

Batman: The Ride opened to much fanfare and was ""cloned"" many times at other parks. The inverted coaster quickly became an favorite with custom designs installed nearly every year. The tallest and fastest inverted coaster is Wicked Twister at Cedar Point at 215 feet (66 m) tall and reaching speeds up to 72 miles per hour. Although, it was not built by B&amp;M. The longest inverted coaster is Banshee at Kings Island which travels along 4,124 feet of track."
"In the 11th century, Richard II of Normandy chose an Italian architect called William de Volpiano to build the abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel. Volpiano had already built the Abbey of Fécamp, in Normandy. He designed the Romanesque church of the abbey. He chose to place the transept crossing at the top of the mount. He also built a lot of crypts and chapels below the ground. These are to support building above, because it is very heavy. Today, Mont-Saint-Michel has a church of Romanesque style."
"Robert de Thorigny was a great supporter of Henry II of England. Henry was also Duke of Normandy at this time. Thorigny made the structure of the buildings stronger. He also built the main façade of the church in the 12th century. In 1204, the Breton ""Guy de Thouars"", a friend of the King of France, attacked the mount with an army. He set fire to the village and killed lots of people. However, he had to retreat (leave) under the powerful walls of the abbey. The fire extended to the buildings, and the roofs burnt. Philip Augustus, Thorigny's friend, was unhappy about the cruel actions and the destruction. He offered Abbot Jourdain some money to build a new Gothic-style architectural set. The abbot added the refectory (""dining room"") and cloister."

"Mont-Saint-Michel is also the subject of a traditional rivalry between Normans and Bretons. Bretons say that the Couesnon River marks the limit between Normandy and Brittany. It is only because the river has changed its course over the centuries that the mount is on the Norman side. This legend amuses the area's inhabitants. They state that the border is not located on the Couesnon river. They say it is on the mainland, to the west, at the foot of the solid mass of Saint-Brelade."

"In 1853, he wrote his first novel, ""Hatchie, the Guardian Slave"". Adams taught in the Boston public schools for many years. While teaching, he discovered what kinds of books boys liked best. In 1855, he wrote The Boat Club series for boys. This series was a great success. He wrote many more boys' series."
"In 1865, he stopped teaching. He wanted to devote all his time to writing. He became editor of the children's magazines ""The Student and Schoolmate"", ""Our Little Ones"", and """". He served in the Massachusetts legislature for one year. Adams died at his home in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1897."
Children's writer Louisa May Alcott did not like his books. She did not like the slang and settings such as saloons. Librarians did not like Adams's books either. They threw them away. They also threw away the books of other boys' writers. Adams kept writing boys' books though. He got good reviews from the critics. His books sold well. They were reprinted many times.
"Alameda, California"
Alameda is a city in California.
History.
The city was founded in 1853 as 3 smaller towns. At the west end it was called Woodstock. The east end was called Fernside. In the 1940s the land was filled to make Bay Farm Island.
Energy for other kinds of welding.
"OFW uses a flame from burning fuel gas and oxygen to heat up the metal. This fuel gas is almost always acetylene. Acetylene is a flammable gas that burns very hot, hotter than any other gas. That is why it is used most of the time. Other gases like propane, natural gas, or other industrial gases can be used too."
"Some kinds of welding do not use heat to make the weld. These kinds of welding can get hot, but they do not make the metal melt. Forge welding is an example of this. Friction stir welding is a special kind of welding that does not use heat. It uses a very powerful motor and a special spinning bit to mix the metals together at the edge. This seems odd because metals are a solid. this is why it takes a lot of force to do and is very hard. The energy for this kind of welding is mechanical energy from the spinning bit."
Stalking
"Stalking means following something or somebody secretly. In the animal kingdom, Predators often hunt by stalking, or by combining stalking with ambushing."
Someone who likes to watch other people known as a voyeur. When this is continually done to a person it can have a bad effect.
Criminal stalking.
"Stalking in a way that makes someone feel unsafe is a crime in many countries. It is not just one event but an ongoing process that threatens or makes that person feel scared. Someone who does this is called a stalker. The stalker may do this because they want to be involved in that person's life, because they want to have power over that person's life, or for other sexual reasons. The stalker can make that person feel scared. They may feel they do not have the power to stop the stalker. Psychologists say stalking is a way of hurting someone's mind. Sometimes a stalker may go on to hurt that person's body by assaulting, raping or murdering that person."
Cyber-stalking.
Stalking can sometimes be done on the internet. This is called cyberstalking.

Three Kingdoms.
"Between 57 BC and the year 668 there were three kingdoms in the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria. The names of the kingdoms were: Silla, Goguryeo and Baekje. In the year 372, the religion Buddhism came from China to Korea. Buddhism was very important in Korea."
"In the year 660, the kingdom of Silla invaded the kingdom of Baekje. In the year 668 the kingdom of Silla invaded the kingdom of Goguryeo. The people of Goguryeo ran away and made a new kingdom with the name Balhae. After a little time, the kingdom of Balhae was invaded by Liao Dynasty."
"When Silla was the only country, it had the name Unified Silla. In the Silla kingdom Buddhism was very important."
The northern and southern kingdoms.
"In the year 698, Balhae was founded by allies of Goguryeo. We call the time when united Silla and Balhae were existing together (698∼926) ""The northern and southern kingdoms period""."
Goryeo.
In the year 918 the kingdom of Goryeo began. The name Korea comes from Goryeo. The kingdom of Goryeo had power until the year 1392.
"The kingdom of Goryeo wrote the law in books, and had a big government. Buddhism was very important in the kingdom of Goryeo. Bronze-type printing technology was invented in Goryeo Dynasty. This is known as the world's oldest bronze-type printing technology."
"The Mongol empire conquered Goryeo and forced Korea to pay a tribute in Korean girls and eunuchs to the Mongol court with about 500,000 Korean girls and eunuchs taken to Yuan China. Mongol and Central Asian Semu Hui Tammachi army officials in Korea itself also took Korean women as concubines and Korea officials complained about it, begging the Mongol court to withdraw them from Korea. Koreans wrote erotic songs about how Korean women were seduced by Central Asian Muslims in their bakeries."
"An amusing incident is reported as having occurred about this time. A courtier named Pa-gyu observed to the king, “The male population of the country has been decimated but there are still plenty of women. For this reason it is that the Mongols take so many of them. There is danger that the pure Koryŭ stock will become vitiated by the intermixture of wild blood. The king should let each man take several wives and should remove the restrictions under which the sons of concubines labor."" When the news of this came to the ears of the women they were up in arms, as least the married portion ; and each one read to her spouse such a lecture that the subject was soon dropped as being too warm to handle. When the king passed through the streets with Pa-gyu in his retinue the women would point to the latter and say “There goes the man who would make concubines of us all."""
Joseon.
"In the year 1392 a man from the military of Korea went to China. His name was Yi Seonggye. His job was to attack Yuan China. But he returned without doing it. When he came back to Korea, he changed the kingdom. He became king."
"The name of the kingdom was Joseon. In the year 1394, the people of Joseon moved the capital to Seoul. The religion of Buddhism was not important. A new religion, Confucianism was important. Confucianism came from China."
In the year 1443 King Sejong ruled Joseon. He invented the Korean alphabet Hangeul.
"In the year 1592 and the year 1598 the people from Japan fought Korea. A man from the military made very strong ships, including the famous turtle ship. The name of the man was Yi Sun-sin. With the strong ships, the people of Korea won."
The people of Joseon were friends with the people of China.
"Today, North Koreans use the name Joseon (officially Chosŏn) to mean Korea."
19th century.
In the 19th century the people of Korea did not want to trade with other people. People called Korea Hermit Kingdom.
"The people of the United States and Japan wanted to trade with Korea. Before 1876, people failed when they tried to use force to trade with Korea. In the year 1876 the military of Japan fought Korea. Korea and Japan made a contract to trade."
"In 1895 Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War in the Korean peninsula. This ended Chinese influence in Korea. Empress Myeongseong, also called Queen Min, wanted the Russian Empire as a friend, to help Korea against Japan. Agents of the Ambassador of Japan killed her in October 1895."
"In 1905 Japan won the Russo-Japanese War. In the year 1910, the emperor of Japan made Korea a colony of Japan."
Colony of Japan to today.
Korea was occupied by Japan from 1910 to 1945.
"When World War II started, the policy of the Japanese government changed. The government made the religion of Japan (Shinto) the religion of Korea."
In 1945 Japan lost World War II. The United States and Soviet Union made a contract. United States occupied the south of Korea and Soviet Union occupied the north of Korea.
The people of Korea wanted to be independent. The United States and the Soviet Union agreed the people of Korea would be free and independent. But soon the United States and Soviet Union were not friends and the Cold War started. United States and Soviet Union refused to settle a deal. In 1948 the people in the south made an independent country called South Korea (also called the Republic of Korea). The United States helped them. In 1948 the people in the north also made a country North Korea (also called the DPRK or Democratic People's Republic of Korea). The Soviet Union helped North Korea.
"In 1950 a war started in Korea. The name of the war was the Korean War. The war ended in 1953, but no peace treaty was signed. The border line between North and South was almost the same in the end as it was before the war."
English as a second language
"English as a second language is a common phrase which has related acronyms, including"
"In some countries, most notably where the weather is warm, there is a tradition to take a nap right after noon, or early in the afternoon. This tradition is called siesta, and is most common in Spain and Latin America. Some stores and services close while their owners and/or employees take their siesta."
Word.
"The word ""sleep"" comes from the old Old Germanic verbs for sleep. In Old and Middle High German, it was called ""SLAF"". The original meaning of the word was ""to slap"", which was related to the word for ""flabby"" (not hard or firm)."
"Many words related to ""sleep"" have very different meanings. For example, ""sleep"" may be used to mean death, so that ""putting an animal to sleep"" means to kill the animal without pain. ""Sleep with someone"" can also have a sexual meaning."
What sleep is for.
"Sleep helps the brain function. The details are not fully understood, but it is important to get enough sleep for the body and the brain to be healthy and to work properly. In general, animals (and people) sleep at periodic intervals, such as once a day. Certain animals send out signals to the others that they will soon go to sleep. Yawning is such a signal."
"Both humans and many animals sleep about once a day. Some animals, such as cats, sleep many times a day for short periods up to 15 hours a day (or even longer)."
"When people sleep, they often have dreams. Probably some animals do, too."
"Not only people sleep, but all mammals and birds, and most fish, reptiles and other animals also too."
Brief stages of sleep.
There are four stages during sleep:
"While humans sleep, REM and NREM are sleep patterns that help with long-term memory, remembering information, procedural memory, and creative thinking."
Different types of sleep.
REM sleep.
"In mammals and birds, sleep can be divided into two categories. In one of them, the eyes move rapidly. It is called REM-sleep (rapid eye movement). Most dreams take place in this phase. as the body becomes relaxed and the eyes move while sleeping. This phase helps prepare one for the next day. REM-sleep occurs normally at intervals throughout the night, and the periods of REM-sleep increase in length in the second half of the night. It is often encountered 90 minutes after falling asleep, and continues to occur every 90 minutes. REM-sleep was first discovered in 195253."
"REM sleep is found in mammals and songbirds, but is ""poorly established"" in reptiles and fish. According to a survey:"
NREM sleep.
"The other category, where this movement of the eyes does not happen, is called NREM-sleep (Non-REM sleep). In general, dreams do not occur during this time. There are three or four stages of NREM-sleep. Stage I is just barely sleeping, or dozing. Stage II is also light sleep. Normally, in adult humans, about half of the time spent asleep is spent in light sleep. Stages III and IV are called deep sleep. Deep sleep is necessary for growth and healing. It can be quite difficult to awaken someone who is in stage III or stage IV sleep. Sometimes, stages III and IV are combined and called stage III."
"Adult humans normally sleep in cycles of 90 to 110 minutes each. The night's sleep can be 4 or 5 of these cycles. Each cycle includes, in this order: stage I, stage II, stage III (IV), and REM."
Getting enough sleep.
"People who regularly get less than 8 hours of sleep a night tend to complain more and feel very fatigued throughout the day. Getting the appropriate amount of sleep is extremely important, as it could affect one’s body and increase the chances of serious health problems. For each age group, there are different amounts of sleep that are recommended:"
- Toddlers (4 to 12 months): 12 to 16 hours (w/ naps)
- Toddlers (1–2 years): 11 to 14 hours (w/ naps)
- Preschoolers (3–5 years): 10 to 13 hours (w/ naps)
- Grade Schoolers (6 to 12 years): 9 to 12 hours
- Teenagers(13–18 years): 8 to 10 hours
- Adults (including old age): 7 to 9 hours
The timing of sleep and the amount of it are both important. Both are different for different people. Some adults sleep best from 22:00 to 05:00 or 06:00 or 07:00. Some sleep best from midnight to seven or eight. These variations are normal.
"How much sleep is enough also depends on age. Children need more sleep than adults. Newborn babies sleep about 18 hours per day. Small babies sleep many times a day; human babies do not develop circadian rhythms before they are 3 – 4 months old. At the age of 1 year, they sleep for about 14 hours."
"A nine-year-old should sleep about 9–10 hours per day and teenagers, too, also need that much sleep. Adults who sleep less than about 8 hours a day perform worse than those who sleep that long."
Bad habits.
Poor habits could affect one’s sleep schedule in many ways without taking notice. A few habits that are very common and ruin sleep are:
TV programs.
"He appears on a TV variety program every Sunday. This program is called ""1 night &amp; 2 days""."

One Fine Day
"One Fine Day is a picture book by Nonny Hogrogian. It was published by Macmillan in 1971. It was awarded the Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished picture book in 1972. The pictures have bright colors to express main character's personality. Also, it is simple story for young children (aged 0–8) to read. The red fox steals an old woman's milk and has his tail cut off. He starts to find his tail again. This is a short and humorous retelling of a favorite American folktale."
Summary.
"There is a red fox that is very thirsty in the great forest. He wants to drink, so he steals an old woman's milk. She gets upset and cuts off his tail. To get back his tail, he tries to find some milk from a cow. The cow wants grass for him to give milk. He finds a grass but the grass wants some water. Again, he runs to stream to beg some water but the stream asks him to get a jug. Like this pattern, the red fox goes travel to find milk. Finally he meets kind miller and cries. The good miller gives him the grain and he brings it to a hen to get an egg. The egg is given for a peddler to get a bead. After all paying is done, he can get some milk for the old woman so she carefully sews his tail again."
Main character.
"The main character is the fox that walks around the great forest. He cares about his looks, so he doesn't want to go back to his friends without his tail. He thinks that his friends will laugh at him. Also, he is sensitive. He cries a few times when the old woman gets angry or he meets a kind miller. It can be seen from the illustration, as his eyes always look pitiful to describe these personalities."
Gumi
"Gumi is the second largest city in Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea. It is in the mid central part of Gyeongsangbuk-do. The Nakdong River runs through the city. Gumi is well known for its National Industrial Complex which was built in the 1970s. Manufacturing is the major industry of Gumi now, but agriculture was the main one before the Complex was built."
Tourist attractions.
"Gumi is famous because Geumo Mountain (Geumo San) is there. Geumo San, designated as a provincial park in 1970, is 976 meters above sea level. It attracts many tourists because of its beautiful scenery; such as oddly formed rocks and strangely shaped stones, forests, and valleys. The mountain is best known for its own unique shape. Seeing the mountain from a distance, it resembles the profile of a giant lying on the ground. It has become one of the favorite sites among photographers because it looks most spectacular at sunset. There are a variety of post cards with pictures of its side face of a giant."
People.
"Park Chung-hee is one of the former presidents of South Korea and he was born in Gumi in 1917. Gumi became prosperous during his presidential term. The Gyeongbu Expressway and Gyeongbu Line railway, which are the principal traffic routes of the country, were built to pass through the city. The routes could have been connected directly from Daejeon to Daegu. The rapid economical growth of Gumi resulted from the president’s care for his hometown."

"Mont-Saint-Michel, Quebec"
"Hemingway's sentences were short, the way he had been taught to write at the Kansas City Star newspaper. He wrote about what he knew and felt. He used few descriptive words. His statements were clear and easily understood."
"He had learned from earlier writers, like Ring Lardner and Sherwood Anderson, but Hemingway brought something new to his writing. He was able to paint in words what he saw and felt. In later books, sometimes he missed. Sometimes he even looked foolish. But when he was right he was almost perfect."
Marriage with Pauline Pfeiffer.
"With the success of his novel, Hemingway became even more popular in Paris. Many people came to see him. One was an American woman, Pauline Pfeiffer. She became Hadley's friend. Then Pauline fell in love with Hemingway."
"Hemingway and Pauline saw each other secretly. One time, they went away together on a short trip. Years later, Hemingway wrote when he returned that ""...I wished I had died before I ever loved anyone but her. She was smiling and the sun was on her lovely face."""
"But they wouldn't stay married. Hadley knew Hemingway was also in love with Pfeiffer. Hemingway was seeing her in secret, even though he was married with Pauline. Because of this, Ernest Hemingway and Hadley separated. She kept their son. He agreed to give her money he earned from his books. In later years, he said that his marriage to Hadley as the happiest time of his life."
"At twenty-five, Hemingway was living in Paris. He was a famous writer. But the end of his first marriage made him want to leave the place where he had first become famous. Much later he said, ""the city was never to be the same again. When I returned to it, I found it had changed as I had changed. Paris was never the same as when I was poor and very happy."""
"Hemingway and his new wife returned to the United States in 1928. They settled in Key West, an island with a fishing port near the southern coast of Florida."
His well-known books.
"Before leaving Paris, Hemingway sent a collection of his stories to New York to be published. The book of stories, called ""Men Without Women"", was published soon after Hemingway arrived in Key West."
The Killers.
"One of the stories was called ""The Killers."" In it, Hemingway used a discussion between two men to create a feeling of tension and coming violence. This was a new way of telling a story. Here is an example:Nick opened the thingy and went into the room. Ole Andreson was lying on the bed with all his clothes on. He had been a heavyweight prizefighter and he was too long for the bed. He lay with his head on two pillows. He did not look at Nick."
"""What was it?"" He asked."
"""I was up at Henry's,"" Nick said, ""and two fellows came in and tied me up and the cook, and they said they were going to kill you."""
"It sounded silly when he said it. Ole Andreson said nothing, ""they put us out in the kitchen,"" Nick went on. ""They were going to shoot you when you came in to supper."""
"Ole Andreson looked at the wall and did not say anything. ""George thought I ought to come and tell you about it."""
"""There is not anything I can do about it,"" Ole Andreson said."
"Any new book by Hemingway was an important event for readers. But stories like ""The Killers"" shocked many people. Some thought there was too much violence in his stories. Others said he only wrote about gunmen, soldiers, fighters, and drinkers."
This made Hemingway angry. He felt that writers should not be judged by those who could not write a story.
"Hemingway was happy in Key West. In the morning he wrote, in the afternoon he fished, and at night he went to a public house and drank. One old fisherman said: ""Hemingway was a man who talked slowly and very carefully. He asked a lot of questions. And he always wanted to get his information exactly right."""
A Farewell to Arms.
"Soon afterwards, he heard that his father had killed himself. Hemingway was shocked. He said, ""My father taught me so much. He was the only one I really cared about."""
When Hemingway returned to work there was a sadness about his writing that was not there before.
"His new book told about an American soldier who served with the Italian army during World War One. He meets an English nurse, and they fall in love. They flee from the army, but she dies during childbirth. Some of the events are taken from Hemingway's service in Italy. The book is called ""A Farewell to Arms""."
"Part of the book talks about the defeat of the Italian army at a place called Caporetto:""At noon we were stuck in a muddy road about as nearly as we could figure, ten kilometres from Udine. The rain had stopped during the forenoon and three times we had heard planes coming, seen them pass overhead, watched them go far to the left and heard them bombing on the main highroad. . . .""Later we were on a road that led to a river. There was a long line of abandoned trucks and carts on a road leading up to a bridge. No one was in sight. The river was high and the bridge had been blown up in the center; the stone arch was fallen into the river and the brown water was going over it. We went up the bank looking for a place to cross. . . . we did not see any troops; only abandoned trucks and stores. Along the river bank was nothing and no one but the wet brush and muddy ground. """
Death in the Afternoon.
"""A Farewell to Arms"" was very successful. It earned Hemingway a lot of money. Because of this money, he could travel to other places."
"One place he visited was Spain, a country he loved. He said, ""I want to paint with words all the sights and sounds and smells of Spain. And if I can write any of it down truly, then it will represent all of Spain."""
"He wrote a book called ""Death in the Afternoon"". It describes the Spanish custom of bull fighting. Hemingway believed that bull fighting was an art, just as much as writing was an art. And he believed it was a true test of a man's bravery, something that always concerned him."
The Snows of Kilimanjaro.
"Hemingway also travelled to Africa. He had been asked to write a series of reports about African hunting. He said, ""Hunting in Africa is the kind of hunting I like. No riding in cars, just simple walking and feeling the grass under my feet."""
"The trip to Africa resulted in a book called ""The Green Hills of Africa"" and many smaller stories."
Air raid on Bari
"The air raid on Bari was an air attack by German bombers on Allied forces and shipping in Bari, Italy."
"It occurred on 2 December 1943 during World War II. In the attack, 105 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers of ""Luftflotte"" 2 bombed ships from the Allied Italian campaign. They sunk 27 cargo and transport ships and a schooner in Bari harbour."
"The attack, which lasted one hour, destroyed the port. Not It was not fixed until February 1944. The attack was called the ""Little Pearl Harbor""."
The release of mustard gas from one of the cargo ships added to the deaths. The British and American governments hid the news about mustard gas and its effects on victims.
Background.
"In 1943, during the Italian campaign, the port of Bari in southern Italy was important for Allied forces. Ammunition, supplies, and provisions were unloaded from ships at the port, then moved to Allied forces."
Bari did not have good air defences. No RAF fighters were based there. There was not good anti-aircraft defences.
"The Allies did not think the Germans could bomb Bari. They thought that the ""Luftwaffe"" in Italy could not do a major attack."
German air raids by KG 54 had bombed the Naples port area four times in the previous month.
"Thirty ships of American, British, Polish, Norwegian and Dutch registry were in Bari Harbour on 2 December. The port was lit on the night of the raid to help the unloading of supplies."
Raid.
"On the afternoon of 2 December, a ""Luftwaffe"" pilot flew over Bari. His report made Albert Kesselring order the raid."
The Germans thought that destroying the port might slow the advance of the British Eighth Army. Only 105 Ju 88 bombers were available.
"The attack started at 19:25, when two or three German aircraft circled the harbour at . They dropped ""Düppel"" (foil strips) to confuse Allied radar."
The German bomber force surprised the Allies. They bombed the harbour and its ships and many of the bombs hit targets. Two ammunition ships were bombed. A petrol pipeline was cut and the fuel caught fire. The fire spread to many of the ships.
Twenty-eight merchant ships with more than of cargo were sunk or destroyed. Twelve more ships were damaged. The port was closed for three weeks. It was reopened in February 1944.
"""John Harvey""."
"One of the destroyed vessels—the U.S. Liberty ship ""John Harvey""—had been carrying a secret cargo of 2000 M47A1 mustard gas bombs. Each held of the chemical. According to Royal Navy historian Stephen Roskill, the Mustard Gas had been sent to Europe to use if Germany used chemical warfare in Italy."
"The destruction of ""John Harvey"" caused liquid sulfur mustard from the bombs to spill into waters. The many sailors who had jumped into the water became covered with the chemical."
"Within a day, symptoms of mustard poisoning had appeared in 628 patients and medical staff. Symptoms included blindness and chemical burns."
"Hundreds of Italian civilians also seeking treatment, who had been poisoned by sulfur mustard gas. By the end of the month, 83 of the 628 hospitalized military victims had died."
Cover-up.
The Allies tried to hide the disaster.
"There were too many witnesses to keep the secret. In February 1944, the U.S. admitted to the accident. They said they did not plan to use chemical weapons unless Germany used them first."
Renée Asherson
"Dorothy Renée Ascherson (19 May 1915 – 30 October 2014), known professionally as Renée Asherson, was an English actress. Much of her theatrical career was spent in Shakespearean plays, appearing at such venues as the Old Vic, the Liverpool Playhouse, and the Westminster Theatre.

"Asherson was married to fellow actor Robert Donat from 1953 until his death in 1958. His severe asthma led to their separation, although a reconciliation had seemed possible just before the end of his life. Although Donat had three children from his previous marriage, they had no children together."
"She never remarried. She died on 30 October 2014, aged 99. Among her surviving relatives is her nephew, the journalist Neal Ascherson."
An inquest into Duggan's death began on 16 September 2013. On 8 January 2014 a jury decided that his death was a lawful killing. It was decided that it was lawful because the police officer who shot Duggan told the jury he believed that Duggan was holding a gun and was going to shoot it. Witness B said that Duggan was not holding a gun. He said that Duggan was holding a mobile phone. There was a gun in a sock 10–14 feet away from where Duggan was shot. The sock and the gun did not have Duggan's DNA on them. Duggan's family were angry about the jury's verdict.
On 11 January there was a vigil for Duggan outside Tottenham police station. Hundreds of prostesters were there.

"Duggan was born on 15 September 1981 to a white mother, Pamela Duggan, and a black father, Bruno Hall. He grew up in Broadwater Farm. At age 13, he left home to live with one of his maternal aunts in Manchester. Duggan had three children with his partner Semone Wilson at the time of his death, as well as three other children by other women."
"After his death police and other people said that he was a drug dealer. His family and friends said that he was not. Tony Thompson of the ""London Evening Standard"" wrote that Duggan may have been one of the first members of North London's ""Star Gang"". Duggan's family said that ""He was not a gang member and he had no criminal record."" Duggan had been convicted of having cannabis in 2000 and having things that he knew had been stolen in 2007. ""The Daily Mail"" said that he had also been arrested many times. The things he was arrested for included the murder of Gavin Smith and attempted murder. He was not charged with the murder of Smith because there was not enough evidence."
In March 2011 Duggan's cousin had been stabbed to death at a nightclub. Some people said that this made Duggan want to carry a gun.
"Duggan was under investigation by Operation Trident. ""Trident have jammed me,"" he wrote in a text message minutes before his death."
Shooting.
"Officers of the Metropolitan Police Service stopped a cab that was carrying Duggan as a passenger at about 6:15pm on 4 August 2011. They did this because they had been told that Duggan had a gun. A firearms officer said that Duggan got out of the cab and pulled a gun from his waistband. He then ran away. Police shot him twice. An eyewitness said that Duggan ""was shot while he was pinned to the floor by police."" Paramedics came, but he died before he could be taken to hospital. A 9mm gun was found 10–14 feet away from where Duggan was shot on the other side of the fence. Witnesses told the IPCC that they saw police throw the gun over the fence."
Aftermath.
Police waited a day and a half to tell Duggan's family to tell them that Duggan was dead.
Riots.
The 2011 riots started with the peaceful protest of Duggan's death.
"At about 5:30pm on 6 August 2011, Duggan's family and people living in the area marched from Broadwater Farm to Tottenham Police Station. They chanted ""we want answers"". Around 8pm a 16-year-old girl was beaten by police with a baton. A witness said that she had thrown something at the police. Around 8:20pm members of a crowd waiting to speak to a police officer set fire to two police cars. The next day people rioted in other areas of London. Most of the rioters were young men. On August 9 a man died after being shot in Croydon on August 8. On August 10 three men were killed in a hit-and-run. A man died on 8 August from injuries from an attack by a mob. By 15 August 2011, about 3,100 people had been arrested."
Media coverage.
"Duggan's death quickly became a big news story. Duggan was called a 'gangster' and a 'thug' by the ""Daily Mail"". On September 8 2011 an article by Martin Samuda, a friend of Duggan, was published in ""The Guardian"". Duggan's brother Shaun Hall also wrote an article for ""The Guardian"" in September 2013 which said that Duggan's family did not trust the police anymore."

Two witnesses said that they saw a police officer move something from the minicab to the place where the gun was found. Duggan's lawyers argued that police had put the gun found near where Duggan was killed there to make Duggan's killing look lawful.

Prince of Condé
"The title of Prince of Condé was a title used in France while the country was a monarchy For example prior to 1793. The holder of the title was a member of the extended royal family and therefore held the rank and further title of prince of the blood and the style of Serene Highness but the style was only used when in writing. The holder of the title also held the important further rank of First Prince of the blood. The heir was usually given the title of Duke of Bourbon and at other times the Duke of Enghien. The title was ""only"" to be inherited by the male line as females were expelled from to succeeding to titles. The title existed for almost two centuries and during that time the prince was one of the highest ranking prince behind that of the actual royal family."

Floppy disk
"The floppy disk (or a 3 1/2 floppy for today's standard) is a removable magnetic storage medium. Floppy disks are used for moving information between computers, laptops or other devices. Some early digital cameras, electronic music instruments and older computer game consoles use floppy disks. Floppy disks are inserted in to a floppy disk drive or simply floppy drive to allow data to be read or stored."
Floppy disks store much less data than a CD-ROM disk or USB flash drive. A normal 3 inch disk can store 1.44 megabytes of data. This is usually enough for simple text documents.
"A special type of floppy disk was made in the late 1980s. It could store 2.88 MB of data. They did not become popular. Larger size floppy disks became available in the 1990s. The two most popular were the Zip drive and the Jaz drive, both made by Iomega."
"Floppy disk technology has been around since the early 1970s (the 8-inch floppy was the first). Today, floppy disks have been replaced by other storage media, like USB flash drives. Floppy disks and drives are no longer manufactured, but are still widely-available as new old stock."
The floppy drive.
"A floppy drive (often called drives “A” and “B” on a computer running DOS or Windows) can be connected to or installed in a personal computer (PC). It is the part of a computer that reads and writes the disk that can be removed. A disk, often called a ""floppy disk"", is used to store files and carry them from one computer to another by using the floppy drive. The floppy drive reads the disk (or diskette) and the user is then able to open and change the files saved on the disk."
Nat King Cole
"Nathaniel Adams Coles, professionally known as Nat King Cole, (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965) was an American jazz musician, singer and songwriter. He was born in the southern city of Montgomery, Alabama. His father was a Christian minister. Millions of Nat King Cole’s recordings were sold while he was alive. He died of lung cancer in February, 1965, when he was forty-five years old. People around the world still enjoy listening to the music of one of America’s greatest performers of popular and jazz music."
Early years.
"When Cole was four years old, his parents moved the family to North Chicago, Illinois. His younger brother was Freddy Cole. He learned to play the piano when he was very young. His mother was the only piano teacher he ever had. He gave his first public performance when he was four. By the time he was twelve, Cole was playing piano at his father’s church. His father was pastor of the First Baptist church in North Chicago, Illinois for 29 years."
His interest in jazz.
"Cole played piano in New York City and Los Angeles, California when he was a young man. In 1937, he formed a group that played jazz music. Oscar Moore played the guitar and Wesley Prince played the bass. The trio reportedly did not need a drummer because Cole’s piano playing kept the beat so well. They named the group, The King Cole Trio. At the same time, Cole also changed his name into Nat King Cole. The trio soon became very popular. Nat sang some songs, but mostly played the piano."
Well-known popular singer.
"By the middle 1940s, Nat King Cole was beginning to be known as a popular singer as well as a jazz piano player. He was one of the first musicians to record with new Capitol Records."
"The first song he recorded for Capitol was “Straighten Up and Fly Right.” He wrote the song. The words were based on his father’s teachings. The song became one of the biggest hits of 1943. It sold more than 500,000 copies."
"Nat recorded hundreds of songs. Some of the most popular include “Sweet Lorraine,” “Nature Boy,” “Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer,” “When I Fall in Love,” and “Mona Lisa.” In 1950, the American film industry gave him an award for his recording of “Mona Lisa.” That song made him famous as a singer."
"Nat King Cole also acted in movies. The best known one is ""Saint Louis Blues"". He played the part of the jazz composer W.C. Handy. He also appeared in a movie about himself called ""The Nat King Cole Story""."
"In the 1950s, he sang with some of the best known orchestras of the time."
He received many awards during his life. He also received many more after his death. One was a 1990 Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.
His success as a black man.
"By 1956, Nat King Cole was known internationally. He signed an agreement to perform at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada."
Cole often performed in places that only admitted white people. Black leaders did not like this about him. Cole said he tried to take legal action against those places but often failed.
"Cole earned more money and moved to California. He bought a house in an area where white people lived. At that time, many white Americans did not want to live near blacks. White home owners nearby protested the purchase of a house by a black family. Cole and his family refused to leave and lived in the house without problems."
"Cole was the first black man to have his own television program. His program began on NBC Television in 1956. NBC agreed to support ""The Nat King Cole Show"" for a while. It hoped American companies would pay to sell their products on the program. However, major companies were not willing to advertise on a program that had a black performer. They believed that white people in the southern part of the United States would not buy their products. Many Americans watched the show, but NBC stopped production after a year."
His family.
"Nat King Cole was married two times. In 1936, he married a dancer, Nadine Robinson. Their marriage failed. In 1948, he married Maria Ellington. They had three children. They also adopted and raised two other children."

She was attracted to his handsome looks and personality. The two fell in love at first sight. She was proposed by Nongpok Ningthou to elope with him. But the already married goddess did not accept the instant proposal very soon. It was because it was not even five days passed after her wedding. She insisted him to spend some time."
Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou secretly met many times. This causes the in-laws of Panthoibi to have suspicion over her. Her mortal husband tried to win her heart many times. But all of these attempts failed. Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou finally eloped. They wore the attires of the .
"The two divine lovers ultimately got united on the sun-washed slopes of the Nongmaiching Hills. Their happy union was celebrated with dances and music by the gods (by the ""Langmai people"" and not the ""gods"" in another version). These celebration gave birth to the Lai Haraoba festival."
Another version.
"In another version of the story, Panthoibi first met Nongpok Ningthou when she was helping her father at jhum cultivation (Slash-and-burn). The two fell in love at first sight without any talks. But Panthoibi got married to another man against her wish. She left her husband's house to search for her true lover. Nongpok Ningthou also left his home for the same purpose. The two lovers met at the Kangla. Kangla became the place of their divine union. So, it is considered to be a special place of coronation of the Meitei kings."
Panthoibi and the Sun God.
"According to the Numit Kappa text (c. 1st century), two suns shone in the ancient sky. One was wounded by an archer hero (""many men"" in some version). The two brother suns fled from their positions. They hid for ten long days. So, the world remain in darkness. No men could work. Crops perished. Cattles died. So, the ten godly kings (or ""kingly gods"") approached to many divinities. They requested each to with the Sun God. None succeeded to do so. Finally, the ten gods came to Princess Panthoibi. It was because she knew many mysteries and secrets. So, she showed them magical ceremonies to the Sun God. They did the same to the Sun God. The unwounded Sun God returned. But the wounded one never returned."

So, she started making pots. In the beginning, she lacked the idea how to make a pot. Later, she looked around. She saw a flower - ""Nura Khudonglei"" (""""). She imitated the shape and the design of the flower. Then, she produced a pot. Since then, human civilization starting making pots for cooking food and drinking water."

"The Sims 4 is a life simulation video game developed by Maxis and The Sims Studio and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released on September 2, 2014 and is the sequel of The Sims 3. The game is available on Microsoft Windows and OS X."
It was revealed during Gamescon via gameplay demo and release trailer.
"The game does not require an internet connection to play, but it will need an Origin account and internet access during the initial installation process."
Gameplay.
"The Sims 4 is made from the same idea of the other games in the series. The player controls their Sims' everyday lives. The game is open-ended and has barely any limits. The lots are connected with a large map. Sims can go to lots close to where they are by walking there, but can use their cell phones to go anywhere."
Create-A-Sim.
"Create-A-Sim is needed to create Sims characters. With no Sims, you can't play the game. Sims 4's Create-A-Sim is easier to use than it is in other Sims games. The Sim's body type can be changed by clicking and dragging parts of the Sim's body. There is a slider to change how muscular the Sim is and another slider to change how fat the Sim is."
"A Sim's clothing can be customized by the player. Mods can change this, but mods can also damage the game. Sims have several outfits. Each outfit is made in Create-A-Sim. They wear different outfits in different situations: an everyday outfit, a formal outfit, an athletic outfit, a sleep outfit, a party outfit, and swimwear. The player can change the Sims' outfits at any time in Live Mode."
Traits.
"Traits are what give Sims their personalities. Every trait you give a Sim will add something to their personality. For example, giving a Sim the cheerful trait will make them happy more often. When you are first creating your Sim you can give them three traits, and when you choose their aspiration you get one more. After that you can give them more traits by completing aspirations. There is no limit to the number of traits a Sim can have. The aspirations are:"
"• Active, which makes the Sim more likely to exercise (the Lazy trait cannot be used with this)"
"• Creative, the Sim is more likely to read books, paint, etc. This can link well with most traits."
"• Genius, the Sim is very intelligent. They will become upset if they have not read in a while, and can link well with the Creative trait."
"• Happy, the Sim is cheerful and optimistic. They will become tense around people with the 'Sad' trait."
"• Sad, the Sim is the opposite of the Happy trait, which means a Sim can't have both traits."
"• Playful - The Sim is more likely to have the Playful moodlet, and is the opposite of the Snob trait. It links well with the Immature trait."
Aspirations
"A Sim's aspiration is their biggest goal. You can change your Sim's aspiration whenever you want. The first aspiration you choose when you are creating your Sim will give you a special trait, but changing your Sim's aspiration after that won't change your Sim's traits. Each aspiration gives your Sims a set of tasks to complete. When you complete all these tasks you will get a second special trait. The trait you get will be different for each aspiration. These can be completed if wanted using cheat codes in the game."
Child and Toddler Sims have their own group of aspirations to complete. These aspirations cannot be given to adult and teen Sims.
Live Mode.
"Sims can only move and be controlled while the player is playing in Live Mode. In Live Mode, 1 second of real time=1 minute in in-game time. In Live Mode, the player can control one Sim in the selected household."

History.
"""Sim City"" was made by game maker Will Wright and first released by the company Maxis. They are now owned by Electronic Arts. The game was first officially released in 1989."
It was very popular because the game had no end. A player could not win or lose. This was the start of all simulation games.

"Smaller areas are marked out. These are made either residential, commercial, or industrial zones. Zones are the only places where buildings can develop. Every city needs the right amount of each zone otherwise the city will not grow."
"Roads, schools and hospitals must all be built for the city to get better. Parks and libraries make more people want to move to the city. Railways and highways provide ways to connect to other neighborhoods."

"One story is one of Hemingway's best. The story, called ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"", tells of Hemingway's fears about himself. It is about a writer who betrays his art for money and is unable to remain true to himself."
For Whom the Bell Tolls.
"In 1936, the Civil War in Spain gave him a chance to return to Spain and test his bravery again. He agreed to write about the war for an American news organization."
"It was a dangerous job. One day, Hemingway and two other reporters were driving a car near a battlefield. The car carried two white flags to show they were not fighting. But rebel gunners thought the car was carrying enemy officers. Hemingway was almost killed. Later he said that ""bullets are all the same. If they do not hit you, there is no story. If they do hit you, then you do not have to write it. """
"The trip to Spain resulted in two works: a play called ""The Fifth Column"", and a novel called ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"". The novel tells the story of an American who has chosen to fight against the fascists. He realizes that there are lies and injustice on his side. But he sees no hope except the victory of his side. During the fighting, he escapes his fear of death and of being alone. He decides that ""he can live as full a life in seventy hours as in seventy years."""
Later days and his married life.

He had met her while they were working in Spain. They decided to live in Cuba, near the city of Havana. Their house looked out over the Caribbean Sea."
But this marriage did not last long. Hemingway was changing. He began to feel that whatever he said was right. Martha went on long trips to be away from him. He drank heavily to forget his loneliness.
"When America entered World War Two, Hemingway went to Britain as a reporter. Later he took part in the invasion of Europe and the freeing of Paris."
"During the war, Hemingway met another reporter, Mary Walsh. In 1945, when his marriage to Martha was legally over, he married Mary."
"After the war, Hemingway began work on his last important book, ""The Old Man and the Sea"". It is the story of a Cuban fisherman who refuses to be defeated by nature."
"Hemingway said, ""I was trying to show the experience of the fisherman so exactly and directly that it became part of the reader's experience."""
"In 1954, Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for Literature. But he was too sick to take part in the ceremony."
"Ernest Hemingway was 60 years old, but he said he felt like he was 86. Even worse, he felt that he no longer was able to write. He seemed to be living the story about the writer who had sold his writing skill in order to make money."
"In 1961, Ernest Hemingway shot himself dead. Among the papers he left was one that described what he liked best:"
"""To stay in places and to leave. . . to trust, to distrust. . . to no longer believe and believe again. . . to watch the changes in the seasons. . . to be out in boats. . . to watch the snow come, to watch it go. . . to hear the rain. . . And to know where I can find what I want."""
"Ernest Hemingway owned many cats, especially cats with extra toes. Today these cats are sometimes called ""Hemingway cats"" in his honor. His house in Key West, Florida is now a home for his cats and their kittens."

As well as conversations using text, this program also allows voice and video conversations. You can even use small ""emoticons"" to express what you are trying to say. Messages are sent and received very quickly from around the globe. Its current messenger client is Windows Live Messenger."
MSN Hotmail.
Hotmail is a free email service from MSN. It started in 1995. It was bought by Microsoft in 1997. Microsoft Hotmail accounts are used to log in to MSN Messenger.
Reed (instrument)
"A reed is a piece of dry bamboo that is used in some musical instruments such as saxophones, clarinets and oboes. The musician blows air through the mouthpiece where the reed is firmly placed, and the air makes the reed vibrate; this vibration in the mouthpiece produces sound all along the instrument, which is changed into specific musical notes depending on the physical nature of the instrument."
"Musical instruments that use reeds are members of the woodwind family, because many years ago the instruments were all made of wood. Today the instruments can be made of metal (brass, silver, gold), wood, or a hard plastic made to look like wood."
"The bassoon family of instruments and the oboe family of instruments play with a double reed. Players play through blowing air through the double reed, making the reeds vibrate. A mouthpiece is not needed."
The name 'Dodo'.
"The history of the word 'Dodo' is not clear. Dutch admiral Wybrand van Warwijck discovered the island and the bird in 1598 during an expedition to Indonesia. He called the bird 'walgvogel', meaning ""disgusting bird"" because he disliked the taste of the meat. Four years later, the Dutch captain, Willem van Westsanen, used the word 'Dodo' for the first time."
"The ""Encarta Dictionary"" and the ""Chambers Dictionary of Etymology"" say ""dodo"" is a Portuguese word, coming from ""doido"". It means ""fool"" or ""crazy"". Another idea is that 'dodo' was a copy of the bird's own call, a two-note pigeon like sound, ""doo-doo""."
"In 1606 Cornelis de Jonge wrote a description of the Dodo, and of other animal and plants on the island ."
Description.
"The dodo was a large bird and weighed about . They had grey feathers and yellow feet. Their big hooked bill was a green/yellow color. It had short wings that were only stubs. They ate fruit, seeds and nuts. Portuguese sailors said that they saw the Dodos eating fish. They also ate rocks and stones which might have helped them digest food. They are eaten by humans who come in the search of treasure or spouting."
Extinction.
"The dodo was not scared of people which made it easy to hunt and kill. Dogs, cats, rats and pigs were left on the island and also killed the dodos. Because dodos built their nests on the ground, the new animals ate their eggs. The forests were chopped down and the dodo lost its habitat. Within 80 years, the dodo was extinct."
"The last known stuffed bird was at Oxford University and was thrown out as rubbish. Only a foot and a head are left. The American Museum of Natural History in New York has a skeleton showing. It was put together out of bones from several different Dodos. The Natural History Museum of Mauritius has the only complete skeleton of a dodo, found in a swamp."
Tolkāppiyam
Tolkaapiyam (தொல்காப்பியம்) is a book on grammar of the Tamil language.
Tol (தொல்) means Old and Kappiyam (காப்பியம்) means a literary work.
"The name of the author could not be identified (usually referred as ""Tholkappiyar"") and the work apparently relates to Grammar in Tamil."
"It is learnt that the author was one of the 12 disciples of Sage Agastya the Father of Tamil Grammar. This sage was living in the south near Madurai, during the visit of Lord Ram to the south in search of his wife, abducted by the Lankan King Ravan."
The age of Lord Ram precedes that of Lord Krishna and hence the work can safely be said to precede 3000 BC (the ideal period of Mahabharat Yudh).
"Lord Shiva and his Son Murugan is said to have laid the first tenets for the Tamil Language, probably long long time before sage Agastya could compile the same."
Great auk
"The great auk was a large bird, that could not fly. People hunted it for meat and feathers. It grew rare, because it was too easy to kill, and the ones left could not breed fast enough to make up for the lost ones. The last known great auks (there were two auks) were killed on June 3, 1844 in Iceland. It lived mostly in the water, like a duck."
"Penguins got their name from the great auk. The word ""penguin"" was the Celtic word for ""great auk"". When sailors saw penguins for the first time, they thought they looked like great auks."
"The great auk was covered in black feathers, but had white feathers on its chest and abdomen. It had very short wings, like stubs, which meant it could not fly. On land it stood upright and was about 75 cm tall. They spent most of their time at sea, coming to shore in the summer to breed. They lived in large breeding colonies on low rocky islands in the north Atlantic Ocean from Canada to Norway. Females laid one egg on bare rock. In winter they went as far south as Florida and southern Spain."
Abbey Road Studios
"Abbey Road Studios, usually called just ""Abbey Road"", are the recording studios in EMI's headquarters in St. John's Wood, London, England."
"Abbey Road had three different studios for most of its history. Other space was turned into a fourth studio later. Studio One is large, and used to be a ballroom. Symphony orchestras and very large bands and groups are recorded there. Studio Two is smaller, and works best for small combos or groups of musicians. Studio Three is much smaller, and is meant for soloists and duos. Studio Four is mostly for post-production, where changes are made to earlier recordings."
Ujamaa
"Ujamaa, meaning 'familyhood' is the group of ideas of Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. They are based on the traditional African society."
Prisoner
"A prisoner is a person who is forced to stay in a prison against their will. People who are suspected of a crime, for example, a murder, may be arrested and held in jail so they won't escape before their trial. After conviction a prisoner may be punished. For example, they may be imprisoned for a fixed number of years, or receive a life sentence meaning they stay in jail until they die."
"He wrote seven stories, six short ones, and two non-fiction ones. Three of his stories, four collections of his short stories, and three non-fiction ones were released after he died. Because he did many exciting things, some people say that, of the many characters he created in his books, he was his best creation."
Hemingway's early life.
"Ernest Hemingway was born in 1899. He grew up in Oak Park, Illinois, near the midwestern city of Chicago. He was the second child in a family of six. His father was a doctor. His mother was a painter and a pianist."
"Each summer, the family traveled to their holiday home in northern Michigan. Ernest's father taught him how to catch fish, hunt, set up a camp, and cook over a fire."
"At home in Oak Park, Ernest wrote for his school newspaper. He tried to write like a famous sports writer, Ring Lardner, and he made his writing skills better."
Start as a news reporter.
"In 1917, Hemingway decided not to go to a university. The United States had just entered World War I and he wanted to join the Army, but they rejected him because his eyesight was not good enough."
"Ernest found a job with the ""Kansas City Star"" newspaper in Kansas City, Missouri. He reported news that happened at the hospital, police headquarters, and the railroad station. One reporter said: ""Hemingway liked to be where the action was."""
"The Kansas City Star told its reporters to write short sentences, and to report unusual details of an incident. Hemingway quickly learned to do both."
His life outside of America.
Hemingway worked for the newspaper for nine months. He then joined the Red Cross to help on the battle fields of Europe. His job was to drive an ambulance and to take wounded soldiers off the battlefield.
"The Red Cross sent him to Italy. There, he soon saw the first wounded. This was when a weapons factory in Milan exploded. Later, he was sent to the battle front. He went close to the fighting to see how he could act in the face of danger. Soon, he was seriously wounded."
"Soon after healing, the war ended. Hemingway returned to the United States. After less than a year he had changed forever: he needed to write about what he had seen. Hemingway wrote many short stories about people who experienced World War I."
Gone to Chicago.
"Some time later, Hemingway left home for Chicago to prove to himself, and to his family, that he could earn a living from his writing."
"But he ran out of money and began to write for a newspaper again. The Canadian newspaper, the Toronto Star, loved his reports in Chicago. They hired him and paid him well."
"In Chicago, Hemingway also met Sherwood Anderson. Anderson was one of the first American writers to write about common people. Hemingway saw that Anderson's stories showed life as it really was. This was similar to what he wanted to do."
Anderson gave Hemingway advice about his writing. He told Hemingway to move to Paris. Life was less costly there. Anderson said that Paris had many young artists and writers from many nations.
In Paris.
"Hemingway decided to move to Paris. Before he did, in America, he married a woman he had recently met. Her name was Hadley Richardson."
"Paris was cold and grey when Hemingway and his new wife arrived in 1921. They lived in one of the poorer parts of the city. Their rooms were small and they did not have water from pipes. But the ""Toronto Star"" employed him as its European reporter, so they had enough money for the two of them to live. That job gave Hemingway time to write his stories."
"Hemingway enjoyed exploring Paris, learning French customs, and meeting friends. Some of these new friends were artists and writers who had come to the city in the 1920s. Among them were poet, Ezra Pound, and writers Gertrude Stein, John Dos Passos, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Seeing that Hemingway was a good writer, they helped him publish his stories in the United States. He was thankful for their support at the time, but later denied that he had received their help."
"Hemingway travelled all over Europe. He wrote about politics, peace conferences, and border disputes, as well as sports, skiing, and fishing. Later he would write about bullfighting in Spain. The ""Toronto Star"" was pleased with his work, and wanted more of his reports, but Hemingway was busy with his own writing."
"He said this: ""Sometimes, I would start a new story and could not get it going. Then I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think. I would say to myself: 'All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know.' So finally, I would write a true sentence and go on from there. It was a wonderful feeling when I had worked well."""
His first success in 1925.
"Hemingway's first book of short stories was called ""In Our Time"". One of its stories, ""Big Two Hearted River,"" told of the effects of war on a young man who was taking a long fishing trip in Michigan. Hemingway had learned from his father, when he was a boy, about living in the wild."
"The story is about two kinds of rivers. One is calm and clear, and is where the young man fishes. The other is a dark, threatening swamp. The story shows its main character trying to forget his past, as well as the war. He does not talk much about the war. The reader learns about the young man, not because Hemingway tells his readers what the man thinks, but because he shows that man learning about himself. Many people believe it is one of the best modern American stories of all time. Because of this, ""Big Two Hearted River"" is often published in collections of best writing."
"After the book was published in 1925, Hadley and Hemingway returned to the United States for the birth of their son, after which they quickly returned to Paris."
"Writing ""The Sun Also Rises""."
Hemingway was working on a long story. He wanted to publish a novel so he would be recognized as a serious writer. And he wanted the money a novel would earn.
"The novel was called ""The Sun Also Rises"". It is about young Americans in Europe after World War One. The war had destroyed their dreams and had given them nothing to replace those dreams. The writer Gertrude Stein later called these people members of ""The Lost Generation."""
"The book was an immediate success. At the age of 25 Ernest Hemingway was famous. Many people, however, did not like Hemingway's art because they did not like what he wrote about."
Swift
The swift is a bird in the family Apodidae. It is in the order Apodiformes with treeswifts and hummingbirds. The swift is very good at flying. It spends all of its time in the air.
"The scientific name for the swift (""apus"") comes from the Ancient Greek word απους, ""apous"" which means ""without feet"". This is because swifts have very small, weak feet. Swifts use their feet to hold on to vertical places (for example, the wall of a house, or a cliff). Swifts do not want to land on the ground. It is often thought that if they land on ground, they cannot fly up again, but that is not true. They can take off but with difficulty."
Description.
"Swifts are small birds. They can fly very well and very fast. Some swifts can fly at 514m per second. If a swift needs to fly very fast, it can fly at 60m per second for a short amount of time. When catching insects, they fly in a series of swoops, changing direction rapidly as they pursue the prey."
"Swifts have long, curved wings. The wings are in the shape of a sickle or boomerang. They have a forked tail. This means it looks like a V shape."
"Swifts can be seen all over the world. They like to live in warmer places and they migrate every year. For example, Swifts fly to Europe in the spring and summer. When it gets cold at the start of autumn, the Swifts fly to Africa where it is warmer."
Nests.
"Swifts make their nests in a corner between two walls. For example, near the roof of a house, or in an area between rocks in a cave. They use mud and saliva (spit) to make a cup-shaped nest."
"There are some swifts which only use saliva to make their nests. These swifts are in the genus ""Aerodramus"". In Asia, people take the nests and use them to make bird's nest soup. This soup is very popular in China."
"Wangaratta, Victoria"
"Wangaratta is a city in the northeast of Victoria, Australia. About 19,000 people live there. It is about from Melbourne along the Hume Highway. The city of Benalla is to the south west, and Albury and Wodonga to the north east. The Ovens and King Rivers which flow from the Victorian Alps meet at Wangaratta. It is in the local government area of the Rural City of Wangaratta."
History.
"Gold was found in the area during the 1850s. A Post Office opened on 1 February 1843, as Ovens, and moved to the town and was renamed Wangaratta in 1854. The Ovens office, and the Kilmore office which opened the same day, were the fifth and sixth to open in the Port Phillip District (Victoria). They were also the first two inland offices."
"The small town of Glenrowan about 10 km away is known as the site of the final shootout that led to the capture of Australia's most famous bushranger, Ned Kelly."
"Chiltern, Victoria"
"Chiltern is a town in the north east of Victoria, Australia. It is between Wangaratta and Wodonga, in the Shire of Indigo. In 2006 there were 1063 people living in Chiltern. The town is close to the Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park. Chiltern was once on the main road between Melbourne and Sydney but is now by-passed by the Hume Freeway a few kilometres to the east."
History.
"The area of Chiltern was on the Wahgunyah cattle run and was called Black Dog Creek. The township was named after the Chiltern Hills in England. It was surveyed in 1853 but not started until gold was found in 1858—59 during the great Victorian Gold Rush period. The Post Office opened on September 1, 1859."
"Many of Chiltern's old buildings are protected by the National Trust. In 1859, many shop-keepers and miners from around Beechworth and the Ovens Valley followed the gold rush and moved into Chiltern."
"The Grape Vine Hotel, on the corners of Main St and Conness St, has the largest grapevine in Australia, planted in 1867."
News release
"A press release, news release, media release, or press statement is a written or recorded communication for news reporters. Its purpose is to let them know about something that is news. These are mailed, faxed, or e-mailed to editors at newspapers, magazines, radio stations, television stations, and television networks. There are companies whose job is to send out this information."
"The use of a press release is common in public relations. People use this to get the media to take notice of them, or get publicity for a product, or event that they might be holding. A press release gives reporters the basic information they need to write a news story. Press releases can announce a range of news items such as: events, promotions, awards, new products and services, sales and other financial data, accomplishments, etc."
"A ""press statement"" is information given to reporters. This is an official statement or account of a news story that is specially written for newspapers and other news media for them to make known to the public."
Alice (song)
"""Alice"" is an alternative rock song written and performed by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne for the soundtrack to the 2010 movie ""Alice in Wonderland"", entitled ""Almost Alice"". The song is a mid-tempo ballad sung from the perspective of the film's lead character, Alice. According to Lavigne, she wrote the song after asking Disney executives and director Tim Burton for a role on the soundtrack. The song was produced by Butch Walker and mixed by Lavigne's former husband Deryck Whibley."
Concept.
Description.
"The soft-feathered, brown birds reach up to in height. Their feathers are in a double layer which helps keep the emu cool. They have bare skin on the sides of the face and their neck. They can weigh up to . They have two large legs, with three toes on each foot. Their wings are very short, about"
", and are hidden under their feathers."
They can live up to 10–20 years
The emu is common over most of mainland Australia. It avoids very thick forests and very dry areas. Emus can travel great distances at a fast trot. If necessary they can run at up to for some distance at a time. They may travel long distances to find food. One emu was found to have traveled .
Diet.
"They feed on a variety of plants (seeds, flowers, new growth) and insects. Because of their size they need to eat a lot."
Breeding.
"Emus are solitary birds. However, the young chicks stay with the father until they are 18 months of age. The breeding season is between February and July, when the female can lay between 5-15 eggs in a ground nest built by the male. The male then sits on the eggs for 8 weeks until hatching. The baby chicks have very clear stripes on the feathers which act as camouflage."
"On the east coast of Australia, emus were once common but have become uncommon with increased human population. On the other hand, the development of farms and the supply of water for stock have increased the range of the Emu in arid (dry) regions. Emus are farmed for their meat, oil and leather. The first emu farms began in Western Australia during the 1970s."
In captivity.
There are approximately 1100 emus in zoos.
The history of the name.
"The first written description of the emu was under the name of the New Holland Cassowary in Arthur Phillip's ""Voyage to Botany Bay"", published in 1789. The species was named by ornithologist (bird expert) John Latham, who worked on Phillip's book. He provided the first descriptions of and names for many Australian bird species. Its scientific name, Dromaius novaehollandiae, is from the Latin words, meaning ""fast-footed New Hollander"". The history of the common name, ""emu"", is not certain, but is thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird. This word was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related Cassowary in New Guinea. In Victoria, some Indigenous Australian words for the emu were ""Barrimal"" in the Djadja wurrung language, ""myoure"" in Gunai, and ""courn"" in Jardwadjali."
Kiwi
"The kiwi is a type of bird from New Zealand. They are the genus Apteryx of the family Apterygidae. There are several species and sub-species of kiwi. The kiwi is a symbol for New Zealand. People from New Zealand are nicknamed ""Kiwis""."
"They have a long beak and brown feathers. The feathers look like fur. Kiwi cannot fly, and their wings are so small that they cannot usually be seen. Kiwi cannot see well, but they can hear very well. They are the smallest ratite birds."
Life.
"Kiwi are night (nocturnal) birds. They mostly eat invertebrates, like worms and insects. Kiwi keep a territory where they live alone or with their mate. In their territory they build several small caves where they sleep, or lay their eggs."
Kiwi are monogamous; the male and female stay together until one of them dies. The male and female live in the same territory and raise their children together.
"Female kiwi lay 1-3 eggs. Compared to the size of the mother, the eggs are the largest of any bird species. Kiwi are mature when they are 2 years old, and they can live more than 20 years. One kiwi kept in a zoo even reached 35 years old."
Eggs.
"The female brown kiwi lays enormous eggs, which are almost one-sixth of her own body weight. These eggs take 11 weeks to incubate, the longest time for any bird. In comparison, Yellow-breasted Chats' eggs take only 11 days, and chickens' eggs take 21 days."
Habitat.
"Kiwi prefer to live in burrows they make in forested areas. They either make their burrows in the ground like rabbits, in between the roots of trees, or in hidden sheltered places such as hollow logs. Kiwi line their burrows with leaves to make them more comfortable and warm. Sometimes they hide the entrance to their burrows using piles of twigs. Kiwi may have more than ten different burrows in their territory and will swap between them sometimes."
Kiwi are threatened by many mammals. Stoats are the main threat for the kiwi chicks. Ferrets and dogs kill adult kiwi.
Dodo
"The dodo ""(Raphus cucullatus)"" is an extinct species of flightless bird from Mauritius."
"Like many other island birds, they lost the power of flight because it was no advantage where they lived. Dodos were in the same family as the pigeon. They were endemic to (only lived on) the island of Mauritius. They became extinct in the late 17th century."
The Dodo has become a symbol of extinction caused by the arrival of humans in ecosystems where humans had never before lived.
Description.
The house sparrow is small bird. It is between 14–18 centimeters (5.5–7.1 in) long. It weighs between 24–39.5 grams (0.85–1.4 oz). Females are smaller than males.
"Male and female house sparrows are different colors. The male is brown, gray and white. It has a black throat. The female and young house sparrows are brown and dark yellow or cream. They have streaks (stripes) on their heads and wings."
Habitat.
"The house sparrow lives close to humans, often near human houses in towns or cities. It also lives near farms and makes a nest in a bush or small tree. It can have two or three broods per year. This means it has two or three sets of eggs and chicks each year."
"Nest sites are varied, though cavities are preferred. Nests are most frequently built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes in cliffs and banks, or tree hollows, are also used.p52–57 A sparrow sometimes digs out its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches. More often it uses the nests of other birds, such swallows' nests in banks and cliffs, and old tree nest holes. It often uses deserted nests. Sometimes it takes over active nests by driving away or killing the occupants. Tree hollows are more commonly used in North America than in Europe. This puts the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters so the native bird population declines."
Conservation.
"The number of house sparrows in the United Kingdom has gone down, perhaps because their hedgerow habitat has shrunk. They are now 'endangered' in the United Kingdom. However, in other countries, the bird is still very common. Hedges are necessary to the bird because predators cannot usually get at their nests. They would have no defence against magpies (for example) if face-to-face."
Sparrows in Mao's China.
"Sparrows eat some grain. So Mao decided that sparrows should be eliminated in China. The result was a disastrous famine, with grain yields a fraction of what went before. Apparently no-one knew enough about sparrows. They are major predators of locusts. With few sparrows, locusts thrived and ate much of the wheat. It is difficult in an autocracy to tell leaders they are wrong."
Couch
"A couch, sofa or settee is a kind of furniture that is designed to seat more than one person. It usually has a place to rest your arm on each side. Couches are normally found in the living room or in front of the TV."
"In the 17th and 18th centuries, a couch was thought as a long, upward seat for resting on. One end would slope up high enough to provide a place for the head to rest."
"Some late 18th-century kinds of couches had an arm running partly down one side, and this type continued to be made in England. In Greek places, there were flowing designs with all kind of elegant colors. Many of them had scrolled ends and short legs. The couch was later taken over by the overstuffed sofa during the Victorian age."
Expression.
"Because the couch is usually set in front of the TV, it is the main place where people usually sit and watch it. Lazy people would eventually seem to be stuck to it all the time. This person, a person who does not do a lot of physical activity, was called a ""couch potato"". This was also because potatoes do not move at all, and does not do anything but just sits there. This may also be considered as slang. Couch came from the word ""couche"", which means, ""a bed, lair,"" or from the word ""coucher"", which means ""to lie down."""
Types.
"The most common types of couches in homes are the ""love seats"" for two, or the ""sofa"" for more than two. Other couches include the ""divan"" or the ""fainting couch"", which usually does not have a back. Couches are usually bought in a set together with cushions, which give them a bouncey and decorative comfortable touch."
Jena Lee
"Jena Lee (born 29 July, 1987 in Chile) is a French singer."
"She was adopted by a French family at the age of nine months. In 2007, Jena Lee met Sulee B Wax, who was interested in her work. At this point in time Lee wrote the song ""Some Share"". The song was used in an album by Sherifa Luna. Jena Lee wrote six out of the thirteen songs that are on Sherifa Luna's album."
"In 2008, Jena Lee won the Urban Music Nation contest by Skyrock. Her first single ""J'aimerais Tellement"" was released in April 2009 along with a music video. It was at the top of the French single charts for eleven weeks. It had the highest number of downloads in November 2009."
Sinik
Sinik (real name Thomas Gerard Idir; born on 26 June 1980) is a famous French rapper. His parents are Algerian. Thomas was four years old when his parents moved to Bergères in France.
Porridge
"Porridge is a food which is made with a cereal, usually oats. The oats are boiled in water or milk, or both. It is usually served hot in a bowl or dish. Some people add things to their porridge such as sugar or syrup. In Scotland salt is often added."
"Porridge is a traditional food in many countries in Northern Europe. It is usually eaten for breakfast. In some countries barley or other grains may be used. Porridge is cooked in saucepans or in a microwave. Traditionally, it was cooked in large metal kettles over hot coals. Porridge was often served as food for prisoners in prisons. This is why in English there is a slang expression ""doing porridge"" which means ""being in prison"". Porridge is also given to people who are ill because it is healthy and easy to eat and digest."
"Semolina and gruel are foods which are quite similar to porridge. Semolina is usually served as a pudding. Gruel is a thinner version of porridge that may be also drunk and may not need to be cooked. Oliver Twist, in the famous book by Charles Dickens, was given gruel to eat."
Productions.
"The musical premiered on Broadway on 15 March 1956 at the Mark Hellinger Theatre. It moved to other theatres in New York during its original run, and closed on 29 September 1962 after 2,717 performances. It starred Rex Harrison, Julie Andrews, Robert Coote, and Stanley Holloway. It was directed by Moss Hart."
"The West End production opened on 30 April 1958 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Harrison, Andrews, Coote, and Holloway played their Broadway roles. It ran for five and one-half years for 2,281 performances."
Awards.
The musical won the Tony Award for Best Musical.
Adaptations.
The musical was made into a movie in 1964 starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison.
A Man for All Seasons
A Man for All Seasons is a play by Robert Bolt about the life of Sir Thomas More that was first put on in 1960. It was made into a movie in 1966 that won the Best Picture Academy Award that year. It was also made into a TV movie in 1988.
Composite number
"A composite number (or simply a ""composite"") is a natural number, that can be found by multiplying prime numbers."
"For example, the number ""9"" can be found by multiplying ""3"" by ""3"". Another example is the number ""12"", which is obtained by multiplying ""3"", ""2"" and ""2""."
All natural numbers (greater than 1) can be put in one of the two classes below:
Fundamental theorem of arithmetic
"The Fundamental theorem of arithmetic (also called the unique factorization theorem) is a theorem of number theory. The theorem says that ""every"" positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers (or the integer is itself a prime number). The theorem also says that there is only one way to write the number. If two people found two different ways to write the number, the only thing that can be different is the order in which the primes are written. For example, we can write:"
"and if somebody else finds ""another"" way to write 6936 or 1200 as product of prime numbers, we can put those prime numbers in the right order and find out that it is the same as what we have here. Finding the prime numbers is called factorization."
This theorem can be used in cryptography.
Proof.
"The first person who proved the theorem was Euclid. The first detailed and correct proof was in the ""Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"" by Carl Friedrich Gauß."
"Some people may think that the theorem is true everywhere. However, the theorem is ""not"" true in more general number systems, like . This was first mentioned by Ernst Kummer in 1843, in his work on Fermat's last theorem. For more information about that: read ."
"The proof consists of two parts: ""first"" we show that every number can be written as a product of primes; ""second"" we show that if we write a number as a product of primes for a second time, then the two lists of prime numbers must be the same."
First part of the proof.
"We show that if ""not"" every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes, we end up in some kind of impossibility. So after that we conclude that it ""must"" be true that every number can be written as a product of primes."
"So, now see what happens when somebody says that he/she knows a positive integer, greater than 1, which can ""not"" be written as a product of primes. In that case we ask him/her to mention ""all"" the numbers, greater than 1, that can ""not"" be written as a product of primes. One of these numbers must be the ""smallest"": let's call it ""n"". Of course, this number ""n"" cannot be 1. Further, it cannot be a prime number, because a prime number is a 'product' of a single prime: itself. So it ""must"" be a product of numbers. Thus-"
"where both ""a"" and ""b"" are positive integers that are of course smaller than ""n"". But: ""n"" was the ""smallest"" number that can not be written as a product of primes. So it must be possible to write ""a"" and ""b"" as products of primes, because they are both smaller than ""n"". But then the product"
"can be written as a product of primes as well. This is an impossibility because we said that ""n"" can not be written as a product of primes."
We have now shown the impossibility which exists if the first part of the theorem would not be true. In this way we have now proven the first part of the theorem.
Second part of the proof.
Now we have to prove that there is only one way to write a positive number greater than 1 as a product of prime numbers.
"After some time, the tadpoles begin to grow legs: first the hind legs and then the front legs. Then they are called froglets. Soon after, froglets grow lungs and begin to breathe air and lose their tails. The tail disappears because the cells in the tail gently die. Each tadpole's mouth changes from small to as wide as its head. Its intestines become shorter. They grow larger, and eventually become adults."
Species.
"How fast or slow the eggs hatch and how fast or slow the tadpole becomes a froglet is different in different frogs. Some tadpoles take months to become frogs. Some stay tadpoles all winter and do not become frogs until the next spring, or even three years later. Some frogs lay their eggs in bodies of water that are only there in the spring and dry up in the summer, so the tadpoles must become frogs in only a few weeks."

Harry Nilsson
"Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 - January 15, 1994) was an American singer-songwriter."
"Nilsson was born in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York City. His paternal grandparents were Swedish."
"""Without her"" is one of his early hits. This number is nowadays considered one of his standards as Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears did later an jazzy cover on their album. His biggest hits were during the late 1960s and the 1970s. His songs include ""Me And My Arrow"", ""Coconut"", ""Cuddly Toy"", ""Spaceman"", and ""One"". ""One"" was also a hit for the band Three Dog Night. Nilsson's two most famous songs were ""Without You"" and ""Everybody's Talkin'"". These songs were written by other people. ""Without You"" has been re-recorded many times by other singers. It was written by Peter Ham and Tom Evans of Badfinger. ""Everybody's Talkin'"" was used in the 1969 movie ""Midnight Cowboy"". The song was written by Fred Neil."
"Nilsson recorded a tribute to The Beatles on his first album. He used lines from fifteen of their songs in one cover version of ""You Can't Do That"". Derek Taylor, who worked for the Beatles, sent them copies of the album, and Nilsson became a friend of the band. He later shared a house with John Lennon and Ringo Starr. They worked together on each other's music."
"Nilsson also wrote a cartoon movie named ""The Point!"". It was broadcast on ABC. It was about tolerance and diversity. ""The Point!"" was later turned into a musical. One production of the musical starred former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones. The Monkees had recorded two of Nilsson's songs, ""Cuddly Toy"" and ""Daddy's Song"", after they met him through producer Chip Douglas."
"Nilsson died of heart failure in Agoura Hills, California."
"The movie ""You've Got Mail"" uses several of Nilsson's songs in its soundtrack."
Acoustic guitar
"An acoustic guitar is a string instrument. It has six strings which pass from tuning pegs over the instrument's neck which is marked with lines called frets. These marks show where to press a string with the fingers of the left hand, to change the note that string plays. The right hand plucks or strums the strings, either with the fingers or using a plectrum (""pick""), to make them sound. Acoustic guitars are used in types of music ranging from classical to rock and roll, to bluegrass and folk. The six strings can be steel or nylon. Nylon strings are typically used for classical and related styles of music. Steel strings are typically used for most other styles."
How the guitar became a popular instrument.
"The acoustic guitar came from Spain (an instrument with six strings), created by Antonio Torres Jurado. But at the beginning, the guitar was different with what we see the guitar now. In the 16th to 17th centuries, the guitar became popular in Europe. In the 18th century, the guitar changed to be similar to how it is now. But before the 19th century, many people thought the guitar could not be same as a piano or violin. They thought it could not play classical music. But at the beginning of 19th century, a famous guitar player, Fernando Sor, made the guitar become more popular and he made more people like playing the guitar. Before the 20th century, people played the acoustic guitar. In the 20th century, a musician in United States, Leo Fender, invented the electric guitar."
Guitar and ukulele compared.
"The guitar and the ukulele are similar in shape and other ways, but they are also different. The ukulele looking like a small guitar. But the guitar has six strings, and the ukulele has just four strings. The six strings in a guitar are tuned: E, B, G, D, A, and E; the four strings in a ukulele are tuned: G, C, E, and A. Also, the ukulele comes from Hawaii, and the guitar comes from Spain."
Flipper
"A flipper is a special kind of limb that is flattened like a paddle for moving through water. Many animals that live in water, such as whales and seals have flippers. The flipper of a fish is called a fin."
It can also be an item worn on the foot to help people swim more easily.
Coral fungi
"Coral fungi or clavarioid fungi, are mushrooms that are usually shaped like coral, but can also be shaped like forks, worms or clubs. They are rubbery and at times are brightly coloured."
"Originally, such fungi were put in the genus ""Clavaria"", and called ""clavarioid"", which means ""Clavaria""-like. It is now known that clavarioid species are not all closely related. Since they are often studied as a group, we keep the informal (non-taxonomic) name of ""clavarioid fungi"", and it is frequently used in research papers."
Habitat.
"Schreuder died on 30 January 2021 in Amersfoort, Netherlands at the age of 91."

Khoriphaba
Khoriphaba () is a God in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). He is the son of Sky God Salailen. He came down from heaven to earth to search for his mother and then for a bride. He is best known for wrestling with Loyalakpa in the Lai Haraoba festival. He is also a polo playing God.
Description.
"God Khoriphaba is a Lainingthou. In Ancient Meitei language, ""Lai"" means God or Deity and ""Ningthou"" means King or Ruler. However, the term ""Lainingthou"" carries many meanings. It may refer to ""king of gods"", ""godly king"" or ""kingly god"". Since Khoriphaba is not the king of gods, he is a kingly god."
Khoriphaba is a sportsman. He participated in polo as well as wrestling championships.
"Among the deities, God Khoriphaba and God Loyalakpa possess the epithets of being the best wrestlers. The two powerful gods wrestled during the Lai Haraoba festival."
"God Khoriphaba is one of the polo player gods. He participated in the divine polo match. During the godly polo championship, Khoriphaba joined the southern team. His team was led by God Thangjing while his opponent's team (northern team) was led by God Marjing."
Mythology.
"God Khoriphaba was born with the divine union of God Salailen (alias Soraren) and Goddess Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi at Heaven. When Khoriphaba was three months old (or ""three years old""), his parents got separated. His mother was abandoned from entering into Heaven. So, little Khoriphaba was looked after by the 1000 queens of heaven. But he cried for his mother. Salailen tried to pacify the baby's cry but in vain. He gave him milk but it was of no use. He summoned his nobles and subjects. He asked them to make his son stop crying. Thousands of gods and goddesses tried but all of them failed to stop the boy's cry. Finally, Chingkheirel Apamba tried his luck. He sang hymns in praise of the baby God. Suddenly, the boy stopped crying. At this, Salailen named his son ""Khoiriphaba""."
"One day, Angoupalba Yaibirel Sidaba found Khoiriphaba crying near a tree. He brought the boy to his home. He asked his family to take care of the boy. The clan members looked after the child like their own child. They named him ""Puthiba""."
"One day, Khoiriphaba heard some women talking about him. They said, ""Look how cute the child is! We love him so much! His mother would have loved him many times than we love him. How much his mother would have suffered for the loss of the child."" Khoiriphaba immediately asked them about his mother. But none knew the answer to his question. So, he decided to search for his mother by himself."
God Khoriphaba descended from sky down to earth in search for his lost mother Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi.
"He came to Moirang near Khoiri Keithel. The sun already set when he was there. Not knowing what to do, he started crying. God Thangjing and his consort Koiren Leima came to him. They came to know about the identity of the boy. The divine couple took care of Khoiriphaba."
"Under the guardianship of God Thangjing, Khoiriphaba grew up. He made many friends. He was nine years old. He started wrestling (), race, and so on. He was always the champion of all the competitions. This made his friends fell jealous of him. So, one of his friends told him about how he grew up under the care of Thangjing. Khoriphaba was told that they would not allow him to play with them because he was an inferior God. Khoriphaba felt dejected for many days. Thangjing noticed it and asked him. Khoiriphaba narrated him the incident. So, Thangjing decided that Khoiriphaba should be sent to his mother without further delaying. He summoned all the 27 friends of Khoiriphaba. He asked them to challenge Khoiriphaba for wrestling and race championships. None were ready for the challenge. Then Thangjing asked them about a tug of war in which all of them would stand together at one side and Khoiriphaba alone at another side. There was a condition. If they won, they would be the winner. But if Khoiriphaba won, they should send Khoiriphaba off to his mother's place at Haorok Konthou, carrying him on a palanquin. The 27 friends accepted the challenge. But all of them got defeated in the hands of Khoiriphaba."
"On the next day, the 27 friends proceeded for the journey with Khoiriphaba on a palanquin towards Haorok Konthou. They came from a long distance from Moirang. On the way, they came across a beautiful place. They could not control themselves to rest at the beautiful place for a while. They requested Khoiriphaba who agreed. The beautiful place where they rested was named ""Toubul"" (). Some friends were waiting for the resting friends at another place. The place where they waited was named ""Ngaikhong"". After some time, little by little, all of his friends left Khoiriphaba alone. So, Khoiriphaba continued his journey alone. On the way, he came across a river. On the river, many women were fishing using nets. Since morning, they could not catch a single fish. He was helped by a woman to cross the river."
"Finally, he reached Haorok Konthou. The people of the place were greatly awed to see him. They have heard of his quest. But Goddess Tampha was not at the place. Due to the fear of Salailen, the villagers sent her off to another place. She was looked after by the Kabui tribes in the hills. So, Khoriphaba set off for the next journey riding on his mare Ngangrubi."
"On reaching the village of the Kabui tribes in the hills, he was warmly welcomed by the tribesmen. He finally met his long departed mother. He proposed her to return home back to heaven. But she did not agree because she was abandoned by her husband. So, he sadly left his mother."
"There are also legends about God Khoriphaba looking for a bride. He veiled his face and hold a polo-stick over his shoulder. While searching for a lover, he was riding on a mare."
"God Khoriphaba reached Koubru's place. God Koubru offered him to choose any lady of his choice from his place. Khoriphaba chose Goddess Nungthel Leima. But Nungthel Leima was already the consort of Loyalakpa. So, God Koubru could not give him the desired lady. Koubru did not want to take back his own words. He asked Khoriphaba to choose any lady but he should do it blindfolded. Blindfolded Khoiriphaba attempted to choose but he could not get Goddess Nungthel Leima. This action is enacted by the maibis in the Lai Haraoba festival."
Worship.
"During the Lai Haraoba festival, there is a special ritual named ""Kanglei Thokpa"" dedicated to God Khoriphaba. In this ritual, a group of maibis sing a song depicting Khoriphaba's search for a bride."

Literary works.
"Bradford wrote ""Of Plymouth Plantation"". It was a history about Plymouth colony. It is often called a journal. It was a collection of what he saw and what he thought was important. This was written in two books. The first book was written in 1630 but the second was never finished. During the years 1646 and 1650, he wrote about the colony's history up to 1646."
"In ""Of Plymouth Plantation"", Bradford saw what was happening to be like what happened in the Bible. As Philip Gould writes, ""Bradford hoped to show the workings of God to future generations."" The book was not published until 1656, the year before his death, and it was well liked. Bradford has been called the father of American history. Many American authors have put what Bradford said in their books. Thomas Prence did so in his book named ""A Chronological History of New-England in the Form of Annals."" Today it is considered very important and studied in American schools and colleges. Bradford's journal was included in another work entitled ""Mourt's Relation"". This was written in part by Edward Winslow, and made into a book in England in 1622."
Homeless Bird
"Homeless Bird is a book by Gloria Whelan, an American author, about life in India for a 13-year-old girl named Koly. Like many Indian girls her age, Koly becomes a teenage bride in an ""arranged marriage."" Her husband soon dies and Koly becomes a widow, living with her late husband's parents. When this situation doesn't last, Koly has to find a way to make her future."
"This book won the National Book Award in 2000 in the category of Young People's Literature. It has been translated into German, Spanish, and Polish."
Plot Summary.
"Koly is a 13 year-old girl who lives in Vrindavan India with her parents and two brothers. Based on Indian tradition, her family has made an arranged marriage for her. Her husband is a sickly, young boy named Hari. Once they are married, Koly must go to live with his family. But soon Koly finds out that Hari has tuberculosis and he will die very soon. Hari's parents had decided to take Hari to the Ganges River and Koly comes along too. While going to the city of the Ganges River, Hari dies. When Hari dies, Koly becomes a widow. Koly's sassur (father- in-law) is a kind man who teaches students. He teaches Koly to read and shows her a book of poems signed by the author Tagore. Koly's sass (mother-in-law) is not a nice woman. She treats Koly as just another mouth to feed."
Hari's sister Chandra is soon married. Koly is sad because Chandra was her friend and now she is leaving. Soon Koly's sassur dies and now both Koly and her sass are widows.
Sass and Koly are very poor. One day Sass gets a letter from her brother inviting them to live with him in Delhi. They make a stop in Vrindavan to pray at a temple. They take a rickshaw to the temple. Sass gives Koly money to buy lunch. Koly goes to buy the food but when she goes back to the temple her sass is not there. She looks around and cannot find her. Finally she sees the rickshaw driver. He tells her that her sass left on a train hours ago.
"Koly cries because her sass has left her. The rickshaw driver says to go to the temple and pray so the monks will give her food. Koly is very unhappy and scared. She sees the rickshaw driver again and he offers to bring her to a house for widows. At the home Koly meets a nice widow named Tanu. Together they find jobs making marigold garlands and beaded bracelets. However, Koly's talent is embroidery. She finally gets a job embroidering. Her new boss' name is Mr. Das."
"Koly also teaches the rickshaw driver, Raji, how to read. Raji owns a farm and drives rickshaws for money. They talk and become friends. However he leaves to fix his farm."
"At her new job, Koly makes friends with a girl named Mala. Mala is good at embroidery but very outspoken. Mala also steals expensive cloth and thread from Mr. Das. This later causes Mala to lose her job."
"Raji comes back and tells Koly that he is fixing up his farm and building a home. He wants Koly to come to his farm with him. She is confused until Raji says he wants her as his wife. Koly is surprised that Raji wants to marry her because she is a widow, and in her society it is shameful to be a widow. However Raji wants to marry Koly because he does not care about appearance and only wants someone he can talk to. Koly is still unsure but agrees to think about it."
Tanu and Koly finally have enough money to buy a room for more widows to live in. Koly decorates the room with embroidered quilts.
"In the summer Raji writes that he has built a room for her work on her embroidery. Koly is happy and agrees to marry him. She works on a wedding quilt and says they will marry when she is done embroidering it. She keeps her job, and agrees to take her work to Mr. Das every couple of weeks."
"Koly, just like the homeless bird in one of the Tagore poems, has finally found her home."

Anne Hutchinson
"Anne Hutchinson (baptized July 20, 1591 - 20 August 1643), was a religious dissenter in Puritan New England. Her parents are Francis Marbury and Bridget Dryden. Her father, being a clergy, homeschooled Anne Hutchinson. She got more education than most other girls at that time. She was the defendant in the most famous of the trials intended to suppress religious dissent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She was born Anne Marbury in Alford, Lincolnshire, England. She, her husband William, and their children left England for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634. Once settled, she began holding weekly meetings in her home to discuss sermons and theology."
"Her religious views did not agree with those of her Puritan neighbors. They believed good works were necessary for salvation. Hutchinson believed that only faith (Sola fide) was necessary. She also believed that God revealed himself to people without the help of the clergy. Community leaders viewed Hutchinson as a threat. She was found guilty of heresy in 1637, and told to leave the colony."
"Hutchinson and her family moved first to Rhode Island. After her husband's death in 1642, she settled near present-day Pelham Bay on Long Island Sound. In 1643, Hutchinson, all her children except one, and all her servants were killed in an attack perpetrated by Native Americans. Her death was regarded by some in Massachusetts Bay as evidence of divine judgment."

"On the next day, Kongyamba announced to the people,"
"&lt;poem&gt;""It is evil for land if a poor man win the race. It might bring scarcity more than the people can bear. Let's say this among the people before the race begin.""&lt;/poem&gt;"
"This words spread among the public. Khamba was stopped and told that his name was not in the list of the contestants. Khamba believed them. So, he sadly returned home. He told everything to Khamnu. The two siblings told Nongtholba about it. Nongtholba went to the king. The king told Khamba to participate if it was not still late to join."
"Khamba and Feiroijamba went to the starting place of the race. The race was about to be started. Khamba ran swiftly as fast as he could. Then, Kongyamba's men interrupted Khamba on his way. But Khamba stroke all of them aside. At last, he reached up Kongyamba. Kongyamba was running slowly as he got tired. Suddenly, fifteen horsemen of Kongyamba stopped Khamba. But Khamba kicked out all of them from his way."
"Finally, Khamba reached the final destination. He was the champion and Kongyamba was the second. Both saluted the King. The King was more pleased with Khamba."
The false oracle and the feral bull.
"Kongyamba was thinking about an evil plot against Khamba. But the Gods did not give him any evil hints in his dreams. So, he built a hut. Inside the hut, he tried to connect with a spirit. But he failed. One day, he met fisher women from the Khuman kingdom in the region of Moirang. Both the Khuman kingdom and the Moirang kingdom were in shores of the Loktak lake."
"The women came to Moirang besides having their own fishing area. So, Kongyamba asked them the reason for coming to Moirang."
"The women told him:&lt;poem&gt;""There is a great bull that lurks among the reeds of the shores of the lake, and it had claimed life of many. So, we dare not to fish there.""&lt;/poem&gt;"
"Suddenly, an idea came to Kongyamba's mind. He went to the king. He acted as a person possessed by a divine spirit. Kongyamba told the King,"
"&lt;poem&gt;""God Thangjing had spoken in my ears and I have his behest upon me. Verily said the God, I am sated with offerings of flesh and fish, but this year, my heart longs for the sweet savour of the flesh of the mighty bull that lurks in the reeds that border the water of the lake. My servant Khamba vows that he will bring it for my honor and for the welfare of the State.""&lt;/poem&gt;"
"The king called and asked Khamba about his promise. Khamba denied it. There resulted a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba. Later, Khamba told the king he would catch the bull if it was the God’s will."
"The king was pleased with Khamba. So, he promised him to give Princess Thoibi hand in marriage if he succeeded in the adventure. Minister Thonglen put seven marks on the lintel post of the capital city. It was the record of the King’s promise."
The king of Moirang sent an embassy to the king of Khuman. The embassy proposed the great sport to be organized. The Khuman king agreed. A grand Colosseum was built. The Colosseum could hold a capacity of the audiences from both the two kingdoms.
"Khamba captured the bull. He was bringing it to the two Kings' residing place. On the way back, Kongyamba came to him before anyone saw them. Kongyamba pretended to help Khamba to hold the bull. Kongyamba hold the rope. When everyone saw, Kongyamba claimed that he had captured the bull. He added that he even rescued Khamba who fell into the ditch. Once again, there was a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba over the claim. The two Kings could not find out who was right. So, Kongyamba was asked to fight the bull within an enclosure. But Kongyamba got frightened of the bull. So, he climbed up on the heights to save himself. Khamba faced the bull bravely. He once again captured the bull."
Royal archery contest and Nongban's advantage of gaining favour.
"Annually, a Royal archery contest was held in honour of God Thangjing in Ancient Moirang. The contest was for the royalties of the Moirang kingdom. Nongban Kongyamba was selected to pick up the arrows shot by the King. Khamba was selected to pick up the arrows shot by the Crown Prince (King’s younger brother). Chingkhu Akhuba, the Crown Prince asked his daughter Thoibi about his Coat Of Golden Embroidery. But Thoibi had already given the coat to Khamba. So, she told him a white lie."
"On the day of the competition, the target was set. The royal priests sang charms over the arrows and the bows of the contestants. The King shot his arrows. Kongyamba fetched the arrows and gave back to the king. For the Crown Prince, Khamba was to fetch the arrows. The Crown Prince shot his arrows so swiftly. Khamba ran swiftly to pick them up. At this, Khamba's outer cloth get loosened. The Crown Prince saw the inner cloth worn by Khamba. It was his golden embroidered coat. He got furious. When Khamba gave him the arrow, he did not take it. He turned away from Khamba. Kongyamba took the arrow from Khamba. He gave it to the Prince. The Prince was pleased with Kongyamba. He told Kongyamba that princess Thoibi would be given to him within five days. From this time onwards, Nongban Kongyamba gained favor from Thoibi's father, the Crown Prince."
Torture by Elephant: Collective evil planing of Nongban and Thoibi's father against Khamba.
"The Crown Prince and Nongban Kongyamba planned an evil plot to kill Khamba. They sent messengers to Khamba. The messengers told Khamba that he was called by the Crown Prince. On his way, Khamba was interrupted by Kongyamba and his men. Kongyamba asked Khamba to give up Thoibi. Khamba replied that he will not give up."
"As a result, they fought. Khamba threw Kongyamba's men upon the ground. Khamba knelt upon Kongyamba's belly. He pressed Kongyamba's throat. He was about to kill Kongyamba. But Kongyamba's men dragged Khamba off. They beat Khamba. His clothes were torn. They bound him so that he could not move. The Prince also came up on his elephant. He told the men to beat him. They fastened him to the elephant's leg with ropes. However, the elephant driver knew that Khamba was innocent. So, he bound him leaving him some spaces to breathe."
"Then they stimulated the elephant to harm Khamba. But God Thangjing let it not to move. Finally, Kongyamba hit the elephant with a spear to move in pain. But it did not harm Khamba."
"In that night, Goddess Panthoibi told Thoibi in her dream that her beloved man was bound by her father’s orders to the elephant and was nearly killed. Thoibi arose and took a sword. She immediately came to the spot for Khamba. The criminals feld from the spot. She saved Khamba from the criminals as well as the elephant."
"The news was informed to Khamnu, Feiroijamba, Nongtholba and Thonglen. Nongtholba, Feiroijamba and Thonglen went to the Royal Court with all their armies. Feiroijamba said to the Court three times about the harsh cruelty to Khamba. However, the Prince did not pay attention to the complaint."
"Nongtholba and Prince Chingkhu Akhuba had a conflict on the matter. The conflict could not be resolved without the King. Finally, both went to the King for the judgement."
"Before their arrival, Princess Thoibi had already informed the king all the crimes committed by her own father."
"The King proclaimed that all the criminals would be punished. So, Nongban Kongyamba, Prince Chingkhu Akhuba (Thoibi's father) and other men were sent in the prison. The King told the Prince to stay there untill Khamba was well again."
"The King sent his own men to take care of injured Khamba. He sent him gifts every day. Thoibi personally took care of Khamba. He got well again. So, Nongban Kongyamba and the Prince were set free."

"The Prince asked his daughter Thoibi to marry Kongyamba. But she rejected. So, in anger, he exiled her to Kabaw chiefdom. He did not want to see her anymore."
"During her exile, Thoibi always missed her beloved Khamba as well as her hometown. God Thangjing softened her father's heart. He sent men to bring her back. However, he asked Kongyamba to forcibly elope Thoibi from her return journey."
"Kongyamba and his men were waiting for Princess Thobi's return. When they saw the princess returning, his men shouted,"
"Experts say ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" was an example of the way Copland changed the kind of music he wrote during the 1940s. He began writing music that was more easily understood and more popular. Copland wrote about this in 1941 in his book, ""Our New Music""."
He wrote that the radio and record player was helping people who had never listened to music before to enjoy music. He said that there was no reason to continue writing music as if these things had not been invented. So he decided to write music in a simpler way.
His interest and activities beyond music.
"Copland spread his ideas about music in other ways. He taught at the New School for Social Research in New York City and at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. One of the many awards he received was the Pulitzer Prize. He won it in 1945 for his famous music for a ballet called ""Appalachian Spring."" It is one of his most popular works. The last part of the ballet is based on a traditional song, ""A Gift to be Simple""."
"Copland also wrote music for several major movies. He won an Academy Award in 1950 for composing the music for the movie ""The Heiress"". Then he began experimenting with what is called the twelve-tone system. His music was no longer as easy to understand, nor as popular."
"Copland stopped composing at the end of the 1960s. Yet he continued to be active as a conductor and speaker. In 1982, Queens College of the City University of New York established the Aaron Copland School of Music."
"Copland was a strong supporter of liberal ideas. In the early 1950s, he and other famous writers, actors and intellectuals were accused of supporting communism. Public opinion changed, though. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It is America's highest award to civilians. Aaron Copland died in 1990 at the age of 90. But his music lives on."

Diphthong
"A diphthong (pronounced ""DIF-thong"" or ""DIP-thong"") is a vowel where the speaker has to move their mouth into two different positions to make. It is a vowel where two different vowel qualities can be heard. Examples are:"
"waist, die, noise, road, house, fierce, bear, sure. Each of these is a different vowel sound."
"A monophthong is a simple vowel sound that a person does not have to move his or her mouth to make, like the ""oo"" sound in ""book."" In a diphthong, the person combines two different monophthongs, as with the ""oi"" sound in the word ""oil"". The speaker starts with the mouth in the position to make an ""o"" sound, then quickly moves the mouth to make a hard ""e"" sound. Another example is the ""ou"" sound in the word ""house"". The mouth starts out making a sound like the soft ""a"" sound in ""flat"", then moves to make the a hard ""oo"" sound like the one in ""caboose""."
"Just like with every other part of language, the exact way to pronounce a diphthong is a little different for different accents."
"The word diphthong is derived from the old Greek language. Here, ""di"" means ""two"" or ""double"", while the part ""-phthong"" means ""sound"" or ""tone"", from the basic word ""phthalein"", which means ""speak"", ""creating sound by the voice""."
"A diphthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it may be one syllable, but rarely."

"In this game, a person uses his shopping skills to correctly guess the price of different products, like in a market. Some products are simple household items, like toothpaste and vitamins. Other items are more expensive products, like furniture and cars. After the third and sixth games, the ""Showcase Showdown"" is played. The three players who got on stage in both halves of the show spin a wheel. They get two spins of the wheel. They have to be closest to $1.00 without going over. The person with the highest total moves on to the Showcase at the end of the show. If a player gets $1.00, they win $1,000 and get another spin. If they hit the $1.00 space on that spin, they win another $25,000. If they hit the 5¢ or 15¢ space, they win another $10,000. In the Showcase, the winners of the two Showcase Showdown games are shown prize packages. They make a bid on them, and whoever comes closest to the price of their showcase without going over wins it. If they are $250 or less from the price of their showcase, they win both showcases. If someone's bid was higher than the price of the real price, that person went over, and was disqualified from winning in that round."
"From 1956 - 1963, the show aired on NBC and was hosted by Bill Cullen. From 1963 - 1965, the show aired on ABC and was also hosted by Bill Cullen."
"Three nighttime syndicated versions of the show aired. The first one aired from 1972 to 1980. Until 1977, it was hosted by Dennis James. For the rest of its run, it was hosted by Bob Barker. From 1985 - 1986, another nighttime version of the show, named ""The Nighttime Price Is Right"", was made and was hosted by Tom Kennedy. A third nighttime version, ""The New Price Is Right"", was made from 1994 - 1995 and was hosted by Doug Davidson. Also special million dollar prime-time episodes where people could play different versions of games for $1,000,000 were made due to CBS shows being canceled."
Monophthong
"A monophthong (pronounced ""Mono-F-thong"") is simply a vowel. The word monophthong comes from the old Greek language. ""Mono"" means ""one"" or ""single"", and the ""-phthong"" means ""sound"" or ""tone"", from the basic word ""phthalein"", which means ""to speak"", ""create sound with the voice"". The word monophthong shows that a vowel is spoken with exactly one tone and one mouth position. For example, when you say ""teeth"", then while you are creating the sound of the ""ee"", nothing changes for that sound."
A monophthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it can as well be a syllable. There is no shorter syllable than a single monophthong.
Kalua
"Kalua is a Hawaiian cooking method. The word ""kalua"" means ""to cook in an underground oven"" in Hawaiian. The oven is a hole in the ground called an imu. Kalua is most often used to cook pig. Kalua pig is a popular food at luaus."
"""Thumbelina"" has been adapted to different media. The earliest animated version of the tale is a silent, black-and-white release by director Herbert M. Dawley in 1924. Lotte Reiniger released a 10-minute movie adaptation in 1954 featuring her ""silhouette"" puppets."
"Don Bluth's full-length animated movie, ""Thumblina"" may be one of the best known versions. The story was also adapted to the live-action television program, ""Faerie Tale Theatre"". This production starred Carrie Fisher. The direct-to-DVD animated movie, ""Barbie Presents Thumbelina"" was released in 2009. Russia and Japan have also released animated productions."
Mike McGlone
"Michael ""Mike"" McGlone (born 10 August 1972) is an American actor, singer, songwriter, and comedian. He is best known as the GEICO insurance spokesperson."
Puss in Boots
"""Puss in Boots"" is a fairy tale. It was written/recorded by Charles Perrault. The story is the classic ""animal as helper"" tale. It is about a cat who uses tricks and lies to gain power, money, and a princess in marriage for his lowborn master. The story first appeared in a handwritten manuscript in 1695 with four other tales by Perrault. It was published in Paris in 1697 by Claude Barbin in ""Histoires ou contes du temps passé"" (), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault. The book was a great success."
"A tale from Gianfrancesco Straparola's ""Le piacevoli notti"" () (1550-55) and another from Giambattista Basile's ""Pentamerone"" (1634) are similar to ""Puss in Boots"". Straparola's story was published in France in 1560. It may have influenced Perrault. ""Pentamerone"" was not published in France during Perrault's lifetime. It is not likely he knew Basile's tale."
Story.
"A miller dies. He leaves a cat to his youngest son. The cat requests a pair of boots. He tells the boy he will make his fortune. The cat makes friends with the king by bringing him wild game in the name of his master. One day, the king rescues the boy from drowning. He dresses him in clothes from his own wardrobe. The king's daughter falls in love with the handsome boy at once. The cat takes possession of a castle for his master by killing an ogre. The boy marries the king's daughter."
Golden Sun
"Golden Sun is a Game Boy Advance handheld role-playing video game. It was developed by Camelot and published in 2001 by Nintendo. It's the first of the ""Golden Sun"" series. In Japan, it's named Ōgon no Taiyō Hirakareshi Fūin (, meaning ""Golden Sun: The Broken Seal""). In 2003, the second of the series named """" was released. The game's ""Djinn"" setting is unusual."
"The game's story take place on a magic world named ""Weyard"". It's an alchemy world, and alchemy can be controlled by adepts. Long long ago, Alchemy was sealed, but one day some young adepts let it return to Weyard. To keep world safety, they have to travel to let alchemy be sealed again."
"IGN's Craig Harris said ""Golden Sun"" ""is the best game in all 2D-based Japanese RPG""."
Stories or Tales of Past Times
"Stories or Tales from Past Times () is a collection of eight fairy tales by Charles Perrault. It was published in Paris in 1697 by Claude Barbin. The collection is also known as ""Mother Goose's Tales"" (). The eight tales are ""The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood"", ""Little Red Riding Hood"", ""Bluebeard"", ""Puss in Boots"", ""Diamonds and Toads"", ""Cinderella"", ""Rickey with the Tuft"", and ""Hop o' My Thumb"". Later editions included three verse tales by Perrault: ""Griselda"", ""The Silly Wishes"", and ""Donkeyskin"". The stories have been translated into many languages. They have been published around the world."
Bluebeard
"""Bluebeard"" () is a fairy tale by Charles Perrault. It first appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript in 1695 titled ""Contes de ma mère l'oye"" (). The deluxe volume was intended for Mademoiselle, the 19-year-old niece of Louis XIV. It included four other tales by Perrault. ""Bluebeard"" was first published anonymously in January 1697 in Paris by Claude Barbin in ""Histoires ou contes du temps passé"" (), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault. The tale is about a cruel man who murders his wives so that he will inherit their wealth. He puts their corpses in a secret room opened only by a magic key."
"Jacque Barchilon believes the tale is original with Perrault because there are no close antecedants. The taboo of the forbidden room is found in eastern literature, and Barchilon writes that the tale has an ""Oriental character"". He points out that the French associated beards with Turkish fashions, and early illustrations depict Bluebeard wearing a turban-like headdress."
"Medieval murderer of children Gilles de Rais may have been the inspiration for the character of Bluebeard. De Rais was a Marshal of France and Joan of Arc's military companion. His victims (mostly young boys) were said to number 140. The Breton king Comorre the Cursed (c.500 AD) is another candidate. Tales similar to ""Bluebeard"" include ""The Fitcher's Bird"" by the Brothers Grimm and the English tale ""Mr. Fox""."
Story.
"A rich man has a blue beard which frightens young women. He has been married several times but no one knows what has happened to his wives. He woos two young sisters in the neighborhood but neither are inclined to consider marriage. He treats them to a lavish time in his country house. The younger sister decides to marry him. Shortly after the wedding (and before he travels to a far land on business), Bluebeard gives his wife the keys to his house. One key opens a door to a distant room. He forbids her to enter this room. He leaves and his wife opens the door to the forbidden room. Here she finds Bluebeard's former wives, all dead and lying on a floor covered with blood. She drops the key. It is magic and becomes stained with blood that cannot be washed away. Bluebeard returns. He discovers the blood-stained key and knows his wife has disobeyed his order. He tells her she will take her place among the dead. He grants her a few minutes to pray. She calls her sister Anne and asks her to go to the top of the tower to see if her brothers are on the road. After several tense moments, Anne reports seeing the men approaching. Bluebeard raises a cutlass to decapitate his wife. Her brothers burst into the room. They kill Bluebeard. Their sister is safe."
All That Heaven Allows
"All That Heaven Allows is a 1955 romantic drama movie. It stars Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson. Douglas Sirk directed. It is based on a story by Edna L. Lee and Harry Lee. The movie was produced by Ross Hunter, and released by Universal Pictures. It was chosen for preservation in the United States National Film Registry."
Story.
"Cary Scott is a rich widow. Her social life is dull. It centers on her two adult children, her country club friends, and a couple of men with romantic hopes. She falls in love with young landscape designer Ron Kirby. He is her social inferior. He proposes and she says yes. Her children and friends disapprove. Because of this, Cary ends the relationship with Ron. Cary returns to her lonely life. She sees other women getting engaged and living lives of happiness. She finds the courage to defy social norms and commits to loving Ron."
Criticism.
Chibbley.
"Chibbley was the ship's cat aboard the tall ship ""Picton Castle"". She was rescued from an animal shelter. She circumnavigated the world - sailed all the way around it - five times. Because ""Picton Castle""’ was a training ship, Chibbley had many visitors. She became a celebrity, and people even sent her fan mail. Chibbley died on November 10, 2011, in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She had sailed over 180,000 miles at sea."
Convoy.
"Convoy was the ship's cat aboard HMS ""Hermione"". He was named ""Convoy"" because he often went with the ship on convoy escort duties (where the ship would sail with a group of other ships for protection). Like the ship's sailors, Convoy was listed in the ship's book, and given a full kit, including a tiny hammock where he would sleep. He was killed along with 87 of his crew mates when ""Hermione"" was torpedoed and sunk on 16 June 1942 by German submarine U-205."
Emmy.
"Emmy was the ship's cat on RMS ""Empress of Ireland"". She was an orange tabby cat who never missed a voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy tried to escape the ship. The crew could not get her to return to the ship, and ""Empress of Ireland"" left without her. This was thought to be a very bad sign. Early the next morning, ""Empress of Ireland"" ran into SS ""Storstad"" while sailing through fog at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. ""Empress of Ireland"" sank quickly, killing over 1,000 people."
Felix.
"Felix was the ship's cat aboard ""Mayflower II"" when she set sail from Devon, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1957. The goal of this voyage was to show cooperation between the UK and the US after World War II. Felix was given his own life jacket for the trip. During the voyage, he broke one of his paws. The paw was set by the ship's doctor. After Felix returned to the US, photos and stories about him appeared in ""National Geographic"" magazine, ""Life"" magazine, and ""Yankee"" magazine. The cat and the rest of the crew marched in a New York ticker tape parade and toured the East Coast that summer. Felix was eventually adopted by the cabin boy's girlfriend, Ann Berry, and settled in Waltham, Massachusetts. The captain of the Mayflower II wrote a children's book about Felix called ""Felix and his Mayflower II Adventures"". The book was published during the celebration of the ship's fiftieth anniversary at Plimoth Plantation."
Mrs. Chippy.
"Mrs. Chippy was the ship's cat aboard ""Endurance"", the ship used by Sir Ernest Shackleton for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. (The Expedition's goal was to cross the Antarctic by land.) After about a month, the crew realized that ""Mrs. Chippy"" was actually a male cat. However, by then, everyone was used to the name ""Mrs. Chippy,"" and kept using it."
"The ship became lost, trapped and then crushed in pack ice. At that point, Shackleton ordered his men to shoot the sled dogs and Mrs. Chippy, because he did not think they could survive."
Simon.
"Simon was the ship's cat of HMS ""Amethyst"" during the Yangtze Incident in 1949, during the Chinese Civil War. During the Yangtze Incident, the HMS ""Amethyst"" was attacked and was trapped on the Yangtze River for months. The ship and its crew were badly hurt in the attacks on the ship. These attacks killed 25 of ""Amethyst""’s crew, including the commanding officer. Simon was also hurt in the attacks, but soon he recovered. He started killing rats again, which was very important since the rodents had been destroying the ship. Simon also did the important job of keeping up the crew's spirits."
"After the ""Amethyst"" finally escaped the Yangtze River and returned to Britain, Simon was given the rank of 'Able Seacat' Simon. He became a celebrity. However, not long after he returned to Britain, he died from an infection. Many people sent tributes to honor Simon, and his obituary appeared in ""The Times"" (an important newspaper in London). After Simon's death, he was awarded the Dickin Medal. He is the only cat ever to earn this award. Simon was also buried with full naval honors."
Trim.
"Trim sailed on many ships commanded by Matthew Flinders during 1801-1803. These ships' goals were to circumnavigate (sail all the way around) Australia, and also to create maps of its coastline. Trim became a favourite of the crew, and was the first cat to circumnavigate Australia. Trim stayed with Flinders until Trim's death. A statue to Trim was later built in his honor. It sits on a window sill on the outside of the State Library, in Sydney, Australia. There have also been many books written about Trim."
U-boat.
"U-boat was another ship's cat aboard a Royal Navy ship in the Second World War. Whenever his ship came into port, U-boat would take shore leave (he would leave the ship to do things on shore). He would spend days on shore, and usually would return only just before his ship sailed away. One day, U-boat did not return in time for roll call and his ship was forced to sail away without him. As the ship pulled away, U-boat was seen running down the dock after the sailing ship. He made a death-defying leap onto the ship and made it aboard. The crew thought that he seemed unafraid by what had just happened, and calmly started to wash himself on deck. The crew members were very happy that U-boat had come back, since they thought he brought them good luck."
Unsinkable Sam (Oscar).
"Oscar was the ship's cat of the German battleship ""Bismarck"". When ""Bismarck"" was sunk on 27 May 1941, only 116 sailors out of over 2,200 survived. Oscar was picked up by the destroyer HMS ""Cossack"". ""Cossack"" herself was torpedoed and sunk on 24 October, 1941. 159 sailors were killed, but Oscar again survived to be rescued, and was taken to Gibraltar. He became the ship's cat of HMS ""Ark Royal"". Then this ship, too, was torpedoed and sunk in November of 1941. Oscar was again rescued, and it was decided that it was time for him to have a home on land. By now, Oscar had been renamed ""Unsinkable Sam."" He was given a new job as mouse-catcher in the Governor General of Gibraltar's office buildings. He eventually returned to the UK and spent the rest of his life at the 'Home for Sailors'. A portrait of him hangs in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich."
Ship's cats today.
"Starting in 1975, the Royal Navy no longer allowed cats or any other pets to ride on any Royal Navy ships. This rule was created because of concern about hygiene (cleanliness)."
"Cats still ride on many private ships today. For example, ""Toolbox"" is a ship's cat who rides on the second ""Kalmar Nyckel""."
"American sailor Robin Lee Graham sailed with many cats on his ships ""Dove"" and ""Return of Dove"", while he was trying to circumnavigate the world by himself (starting in 1965)."
Calendula officinalis
"Calendula officinalis (pot marigold, ruddles, common marigold, garden marigold), is a plant in the genus ""Calendula"" of the family Asteraceae. It is probably native to India. It was the state flower of Junagadh and Bantva-Manavadar State, now part of Gujarat."
Uses.
Pot marigold florets are edible. They are often used to add colour to salads or added to dishes as a garnish instead of saffron.
The leaves are edible but are often not palatable. They have been used as a herb and in salads.
"The flowers were used in Ancient Greek, Roman, Middle Eastern, and Indian cultures as a medicinal herb and a dye for fabrics, foods, and cosmetics. They are also used to make oil that protects the skin."
"Wine making begins with growing red or white grapes. Wine grapes have thicker skins and bigger seeds compared to table grapes for eating. After the grapes are ripe, they are picked off the plants. There are different ways of picking (for example, using machines, or picking by hand, in the day, or at night)."
"After harvest, the grapes are crushed to release their juice, which is very sugary. Before, this was done by people stomping on grapes with their bare feet. Today, machines are used, but people sometimes use their bare feet in festivals. The person making the wine also decides now if the wine will be red, white, or rose:"
"Next, the sweet grape juice is fermented, by adding yeast. In a few days, the yeast turns the sugar into alcohol, and also releases carbon dioxide."
"After fermenting, the wine is stored for a while (called ""aging""). The person making the wine can make different choices, which will change the flavor of the wine. They can choose to store the wine in a steel container, or a barrel made of oak wood. If they choose wood, the wine will absorb some of the wood flavor, which wine drinkers call ""oakiness"". This process can take only a couple of weeks, up to several years, depending on what kind of flavor the wine maker wants."
"Lastly, the wine is bottled and sent to a customer, restaurant or store to be enjoyed."
Wine and people.
People have been making wine for about 5000 years.
Wine is a popular drink in many countries. The countries that drink the most wine (using numbers from the year 2000) are:
"However, if you make a list of countries where the average person drinks the most wine, the list is different:"
"Luxembourg, France, Italy, Portugal, Croatia, Switzerland, Spain, Argentina, Uruguay, and Slovenia."
Wine is made in many countries. The countries that make the most wine (using 2015 numbers) are:
"Italy, France, Spain, USA, Argentina, Chile, Australia, South Africa, China and Germany."
Width
"Width or breadth is the side-to-side length, measuring across the object at right angles to the height."
"For example, the distance between the left side and right side of a chair is its width."
Water
"Water () is a transparent, tasteless, odourless, and almost colourless chemical substance and covers over 70% of Earth's surface. No known life can live without it."
"Lakes, oceans, seas, and rivers are made of water. Precipitation is water that falls from clouds in the sky. It may be rain (liquid) if it is warm, or it may be frozen if it is cold. If water gets very cold (below ), it freezes and becomes ice, the frozen variant of water. If water gets very hot (above ), it boils and becomes steam or water vapor. It is moved around in the water cycle. Water is essential for life."
Physical chemistry of water.
"Water is a fluid. Water is the only chemical substance on Earth that exists naturally in three states. There are over 40 anomalies (strange things) about water. Unlike most other liquids such as alcohol or oil, when water freezes, it expands by about 9%. This expansion can cause pipes to break if the water inside them freezes."
Water is a molecule made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Its chemical formula is H2O.
"Like other liquids, water has a surface tension, so a little water can make drops on a surface, rather than always spreading out to wet the surface."
"Things having something to do with water may have ""hydro"" or ""aqua"" in their name, such as hydropower or aquarium, from the Greek and Latin names for water. It is also called the ""universal solvent"", because it dissolves many other compounds."
"In small amounts, water appears to have no colour but in large amounts (such as seas or lakes), it has a very light blue color."
Uses of water.
"Plants and animals (including people) are mostly water inside, and must drink water to live. It gives a medium for chemical reactions to take place, and is the main part of blood. It keeps the body temperature the same by sweating from the skin. Water helps blood carry nutrients from the stomach to all parts of the body to keep the body alive. Water also helps the blood carry oxygen from the lungs to the body. Saliva, which helps animals and people digest food, is mostly water. Water helps make urine. Urine helps remove bad chemicals from the body. The human body is between 60% and 70% water, but this value differs with age; i.e. a foetus is 95% water inside."
"Water is the main component of drinks like milk, juice, and wine. Each type of drink also has other things that add flavor or nutrients, things like sugar, fruit, and sometimes alcohol. Water that a person can drink is called ""potable water"" (or ""drinking water""). The water in oceans is salt water, but lakes and rivers usually have unsalted water. Only about 3% of all the water on earth is fresh water. The rest is salt water."
"Many places, including cities and deserts, don't have as much water as people want. They build aqueducts to bring water there."
"Though people can survive a few months without food, they can only survive for a day or two without water. A few desert animals can get enough water from their food, but the others must drink."
"Water has no smell, taste, or color."
Guilt (law)
"In criminal law, a person is guilty if a court has decided they have done something illegal. If a person has broken a law by stealing, for example, they are guilty of a crime."
A person is guilty if a court says they are. The court has blamed them for doing something wrong. A guilty person is punished. The punishment is called the sentence.
Length
"Length is a measurement. A ruler can measure length. The length of something is the distance between two ends of the thing. Short means a small length. Long means much length. Short and long are opposites. For two dimensional things, length is usually the longer side."
Length of Time.
Length also describes time.
Time Example.
"John sits down at one o'clock, or 1h. John waits until three o'clock, or 3h. John stands up at three o'clock, or 3h. John was sitting for 2 hours. The length of time John was sitting was two hours."
Weight
"The weight of an object (or the weight of an amount of matter) is the measure of the intensity of the force imposed on this object by the local gravitational field. Weight should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of mass. For small objects on Earth, the weight force is directed towards the center of the planet. For larger objects, such as the Moon orbiting around the Earth, the force is directed towards the center of mass of the combined system."
"In common language, the weight of something is typically understood to be the value measured at or near the Earth's surface. Unfortunately the common terms used to describe the weight of an object are units of mass such as kilograms or pounds. For almost all of human history, weight has been measured on the surface of the Earth. Here, the weight is proportional to the mass. Objects which have the same mass have the same weight. An object with the twice the mass of another will also have twice the weight. As a consequence it is common practice to use the two words, mass and weight, as if they mean the same thing and to use kilograms and pounds as the units for both mass and weight. Using the same terms to describe and measure the two different properties has led to confusion between these two properties, mass and weight. Mass and weight are not the same thing."
Units of weight.
"The unit of weight in the International System of Units is the newton, which is represented by the symbol 'N'."
"Other units have been in use in the past but have been abandoned, such as the dyne (the unit of force in the old CGS system) or the kilogram-force, which is the force exerted on a"
kilogram of matter by a 'standard' Earth: a body with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 9.81 N at sea level.
Measuring weight.
"The weight of an object, or of an amount of matter, is typically measured with an instrument such as a spring scale. The scale includes a spring which provides a force to oppose the gravitational force on the object which is being weighed. The gravitational force pulls down, the spring pushes or pulls upwards. Typically, the scale has a readout which gives not the weight (which is a force) but rather the mass of the object. Spring scales are made with the assumption that they are being used on the surface of the Earth. If a spring scale was taken to the Moon it would give a misleading reading."
A balance style weighing scale is a device that compares the weights of two object in the same gravitational field: it determines whether one object is heavier or lighter than the other.
Weight is variable.
Weight is not an intrinsic property of matter because the local gravitational field that generates the force called weight is variable in space and time:
Truth
The truth is what is true. It may be everything that is true (reality) or just a part of it (a fact). It may also be a statement that is true: a truth. Things or statements that are not true are untrue or false. True things exist (or have existed); false things do not (or never have).
"Aristotle said: ""To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true."" However, a statement may be about how things once were; this would be a true statement if it is clear that it is not a statement about how things are now. Most often, the tense of the verb will indicate this, but there may be other ways in which the statement is qualified: for example, by saying when the statement was true."
"Truth is a noun, and the corresponding adjective is true. The word ""true"" also functions as a noun, a verb and an adverb. The English word ""truth"" is from Old English ""tríewþ, tréowþ, trýwþ"", Middle English ""trewþe""."
Most of the discussion on truth is about one of two things:
Many philosophers have given opinions on these issues.
In Other words.
"The first ""The Legend of Zelda"" game was the fifth best-selling game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. ""The Wind Waker"" was the fourth best-selling game for the GameCube. ""Twilight Princess"" had sold well. In the PAL region, which covers most of Asia, Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and most of Western Europe, ""Twilight Princess"" is the best-selling ""Zelda"" game ever. During its first week, the game was sold with three out of every four Wii purchases. The game had sold 4.52 million copies on the Wii as of March 1, 2008. 1.32 million copies were sold on the GameCube as of March 31, 2007."
Awards and recognition.
"The name of the main character of the PC game ""Daikatana"", Hiro Miyamoto, is for Miyamoto. The character Gary Oak from the Pokémon anime series is named Shigeru in Japan. He is the rival of Ash Ketchum (called Satoshi in Japan). Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri was mentored by Miyamoto."
"In 1998, Miyamoto was the first person to be in the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences' Hall of Fame. In 2006, Miyamoto was made a ""Chevalier"" (knight) of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres."
"On November 28, 2006, Miyamoto was in ""TIME Asia""'s ""60 Years of Asian Heroes,"" alongside Hayao Miyazaki, Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa, Bruce Lee and the Dalai Lama. He was later one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People of the Year in both 2007 and also in 2008. At the Game Developers Choice Awards, on March 7, 2007, Miyamoto received the Lifetime Achievement Award. Both GameTrailers and IGN placed Miyamoto first on their lists for the ""Top Ten Game Creators"" and the ""Top 100 Game Creators of All Time""."
"He was made a Fellow of BAFTA at the British Academy Video Games Awards on March 19, 2010. In 2012, Miyamoto was the first interactive creator to be awarded the highest recognition in the Spanish-speaking world, the Prince of Asturias Award."
Personal Life.
"Miyamoto has a wife, Yasuko, and two children. In 2010, his son was 25 and working at an advertising agency. His daughter was 23 and studying zoology at the time. His children played video games in their youth, but he also made them go outside. Although he knows some English, he is not fluent and would rather speak in Japanese for interviews."
"Miyamoto usually does not sign autographs. He is worried that if he signs an autograph for one person, many other people will ask for autographs too. He also does not appear on Japanese television because he likes privacy. More foreign tourists than Japanese people recognize him."
"Miyamoto does not spend much time playing video games in his personal time. He likes playing the guitar, mandolin, and banjo. He likes bluegrass music. He has a Shetland Sheepdog named Pikku. The dog was why Miyamoto wanted to create ""Nintendogs"". He is also a semi-professional dog breeder. He has been quoted as saying, ""Video games are bad for you? That's what they said about rock and roll."""
"Miyamoto like to move the furniture in his house, even late at night. He also said that he has a hobby of guessing how long something is, then checking to see if he was correct. He carries a measuring tape with him everywhere. In December 2016, Miyamoto showed his hobby on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"". He also played the ""Super Mario Bros."" theme on guitar with The Roots during the same show."
Individual
Individual can be an adjective or a noun.
"As an adjective, a living thing that is individual is not in a group (by him/her/itself). An object that is individual is for only one person or thing (not shared by a group). Something that is individual can also be different from anyone else (unique)."
"As a noun, an individual is only one person or thing, not a group. An individual can also mean someone who is different from anyone else (one a kind)."
Truck
"A truck (or lorry in British English) is a motor vehicle used to transport goods. The word ""truck"" comes from the Greek word ""trochos"", which means ""wheel"". Most trucks use diesel fuel."
Sizes of trucks.
Light trucks.
"""Light trucks"" are trucks the size of cars. They are used by individuals and also companies. In the United States, a truck is a light truck if it weighs less than 6,300 kg (13,000 lb). Light trucks are only a little heavier than vans or pickup trucks, but require a special driver's license."
Medium trucks.
"""Medium trucks"" are heavier than light trucks but lighter than heavy trucks. In the United States, a truck is a medium truck if it weighs between 6,300 kg (13,000 lb) and 15,000 kg (33,000 lb). Trucks that are used for local delivery and public service (dump trucks, garbage trucks) are normally around this size. Medium trucks have usually two axles: one at front and one at rear. The rear wheels may be coupled (that is: two wheels hitched together) to enable heavier load, but they may also be single."
Heavy trucks.
"""Heavy trucks"" are the heaviest trucks that are allowed on the road. In the U.K. they are known as ""lorries"". Usually heavy trucks have three axles: one at front and two at rear, and the rear axles have coupled wheels to enable heavy loads. Often heavy trucks pull trailers. They can be either ""full trailers"" which have both front and rear axles or boggies and their own brakes, and are connected to the towing truck with a towbar, or ""semi-trailers"", which are attached to a special kind of a truck called ""tractor unit"" with a turntable coupling (""fifth wheel""). A semi-trailer is a kind of trailer which has wheels only in the back and the front rides on the back of the tractor unit. The tractor unit has an engine and the semi-trailer does not. Driving a heavy truck requires a professional driver's license. Truck drivers are called ""truckers""."
"The laws of various countries say what kind of vehicle combinations are allowed. A semi-trailer can be converted into a full trailer with using a ""dolly"". A dolly is a small trailer which has only a bogie (= set of wheels), fifth wheel coupling for the semi-trailer and a towbar. Using a dolly, the semi-trailer can now be hitched to an ordinary cargo-carrying truck and does not need a tractor unit."
A heavy truck-trailer combination is often called a big rig or eighteen-wheeler.
"The largest heavy trucks are the Australian ""road trains"" which may have up to four semi-trailers coupled to a tractor in a train-like fashion and may carry up to 200 tonnes of cargo."
Body types.
"Box trucks or Dry vans (""tilts"" in the UK) have walls and a roof, making a closed cargo room. The rear has doors. Some have a side door."
"Concrete mixers have a turning drum on back. Turning it one way mixes the concrete. Turning it the other way pushes the concrete out. The concrete goes down ""chutes"" (like large pipes with an open top). On most trucks the concrete comes out the back. Some new types have the concrete goes over the cab and down chutes in the front. Concrete is very heavy and hard to mix. Concrete mixers have to be very heavy duty."
Wolf
"The wolf (""Canis lupus"") is a mammal of the order Carnivora. It is sometimes called timber wolf or grey wolf."
"It is the ancestor of the domestic dog. A recent study found that the domestic dog is descended from wolves tamed less than 16,300 years ago south of the Yangtze River in China."
"There are many different wolf subspecies, such as the Arctic wolf. Some subspecies are listed on the endangered species list, but overall, ""Canis lupus"" is IUCN graded as 'least concern'."
Appearance.
Adult wolves are usually in length from nose to tail depending on the subspecies. Wolves living in the far north tend to be larger than those living further south. As adults they may weigh typically between . The heaviest wolf recorded weighed .
"The wolf has a long muzzle, short ears, long legs, and a long bushy tail."
"Wolves usually measure at the shoulder. Wolves have fur made up of two layers. The top layer is resistant to dirt, and the under-layer is water resistant. The color of their fur can be any combination of grey, white, taupe, brown, and black."
Life.
"Wolves live in groups called ""packs"". They are pack hunters. The members of the pack are usually family members, often just the parents and offspring. Wolves that are not family may join if they do not have a pack of their own. Packs are usually up to 12 wolves, but they can be as small as two or as large as 25. The leaders are called the parent (breeding) male and the parent (breeding) female. Their territory is marked by scent and howling; they will fight any intruders. Young wolves are called 'pups' or 'whelps'. Adult females usually give birth to five or six pups in a litter."
Wolves make a noise called a howl. They howl to communicate with each other from long distances and to mark the edges of their territory. Wolves have a complicated body language.
Wolves can run very fast and far. A wolf can run in a day.
Grey wolves can live six to eight years in the wild. They can live in captivity for up to 17 years.
Diet.
"Wolves are carnivores and eat mostly medium to large size hoofed animals (unguligrades), but they will also eat rodents, insectivores and foxes. Some wolves have been seen eating salmon, seals, beached whales, lizards, snakes and birds. They also eat moose, bison, deer and other large animals."
"Wolves usually stalk old or sick animals, but they do not always catch what they stalk. They may go days without food. Sometimes only one out of twelve hunts are successful. But the way they eat stays the same. The alpha male and female feed first. Then the other members feed. Sometimes (especially if the prey they have killed is large) wolves may store food and come back that day to feed on it. Wolves have very sharp teeth which helps them tear large chunks of meat from a dead animal. They will eat up to 2/7 their body weight. Wolves will also swallow food and then bring it back up for pups to eat."
Habitat.
"Wolves are found in Europe, Asia and North America. They can live in forests, deserts, mountains, tundra, grasslands and sometimes around towns and cities."
Arctic wolf.
"The Arctic wolf may be a subspecies of the grey wolf. They live in the Canadian part of the Arctic Circle, as well as Greenland and Iceland."
"The habitat of Arctic wolves is very hostile. Not much is known about their lifestyle. They are more friendly than other wolves, but they can still be very aggressive."
"Their winter fur is highly resistant to the cold. Wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably in open areas at by placing their muzzles between the rear legs and covering their faces with their tail. Wolf fur provides better insulation than dog fur, and does not collect ice when warm breath is condensed against it. Since about 1930, the skull of many Arctic wolves has become smaller. This might be because of hybridization between wolves and dogs. They are tall when they're adults. Adult arctic wolves weigh about . Arctic wolves live in a group of 7-20 wolves. They may live up to 5–10 years in the wild. They can live for 14 years if they are well cared for in a zoo."
Wolves and humans.
"Even though many people think that wolves are terrible, mean creatures, they are actually much gentler than many people imagine. The main reason wolves become violent is because they may be sick or to protect other wolves in the pack. Many people around the world, especially in Canada and Alaska, have huskies for pets: they are a close relative of the wolf."
"A few years ago wolves were put back into Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming to breed, because they were becoming endangered. The wolves have been very successful in the park. There had been no wolves there for a long time, because of hunting and poisoned water. Many people were not happy about this because they were afraid that the wolves would eat the sheep and cows near the park. However, wolves only eat livestock when they can not find wild prey."
Extinction in Britain.
Wolves in Britain were all killed after centuries of hunting. The last wolves survived in the Scottish Highlands. There is a legend that the last one was killed there in 1743 by a character called MacQueen.
"Within the past ten years, there have been studies that are in favour of allowing new wolves to come and live in the English countryside and Scottish Highlands again. One study was in 2007. Researchers from Norway, Britain, and Imperial College London decided that wolves would help add back plants and birds that now are eaten by deer. The wolves would keep the deer population lower. People were generally positive, but farmers living in rural areas wanted to be paid for livestock that were killed by the wolves."
Frank Lampard
"Frank James Lampard (born 20 June 1978 in Romford, London, England) is an English former footballer and manager whose the current manager of Premier League club Everton. He was known at his playing time at Chelsea. He is the son of Frank Lampard Senior, a former West Ham and England player. Lampard went to Brentwood School in Essex, where amongst other subjects, he studied Latin and gained an A* grade."
Płońsk
"Płońsk is a city in Central Poland in the Masovian Voivodeship. It has a population of 23,000 and has an area of 12 km². It is the birthplace of the Zionist leader and first Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion."
Frances Burney
"Frances Burney (13 June 1752 – 6 January 1840) was an English novelist, diarist and playwright. She was also known as Fanny Burney. After her marriage, she was known as Madame d’Arblay. She was born in King's Lynn, England. She was born to musician Dr Charles Burney (1726 – 1814) and Mrs Esther Sleepe Burney (1725 – 62). She mostly taught herself. She began writing what she called her ""scribblings"" when she was ten. Her first novel, ""Evelina"", was published in 1778. This novel made her very famous. ""Cecilia"" came out in 1782. It was an even greater critical success. Her major novels, ""Evelina"", ""Cecilia"", and ""Camilla"" are about a young girl. The girls are clever and beautiful, but does not have a lot of experience. The girl goes out into the world and grows in character. Her books were liked by Jane Austen. In 1786, she became Second Keeper of the Robes to Queen Charlotte. She wrote many journals and letters. Her journals and letters have interested historians. In 1793, she married a French exile, General Alexandre D'Arblay. They had a son in 1794. His name was Alexander. He was their only son. While living in France from 1802 to 1812, Burney wrote ""The Wanderer"". It was a novel about the French Revolution. It was published in 1814. Her last published work was the ""Memoirs of Doctor Burney"" (1832). She died in London in 6 January 1840. She was buried in Bath near her husband and son."
Family life.
"On 13 June 1752, Frances Burney was born in King's Lynn. She was baptized on the 7th of July. Her older brothers and sisters were Ester (Hetty) (1749 – 1832) and James (1750 – 1821). Her younger brothers and sisters were Susanna Elizabeth (1755-1800), Charles (1757-1817) and Charlotte Ann (1761 – 1838). Susanna Elizabeth became Frances Burney's close friend. James Burney became an admiral. He sailed with Captain James Cook on his second and third trips. The younger Charles Burney was a scholar. Her younger half-sister, Sarah Burney (1772 – 1844), also became a novelist. She published five works that she wrote herself. Esther Sleepe Burney also had two boys who died at birth."
First mother.
"Esther Sleepe Burney was three years older than Charles Burney. She had her oldest daughter, Esther, with Charles before they married. Frances Burney kept this as a ""family secret"". She even said nothing about the date of her father's marriage. Also, she did not say when his children were born in the ""Memoirs"". Some people have thought that she hid the dates to make everyone believe she published ""Evelina"" when 17."
"Her mother suddenly became sick. She took a trip to Bath and Bristol Hot Wells. This is where main character in ""Evelina"" go to try to become healthy again. However, she did not get better. The sickness was thought to be tuberculosis. It is also possible that it was cancer. In 1760, her mother, Esther Sleepe Burney, died. She was described by historians as a gentle woman of ""warmth and intelligence"". It is possible that Esther Burney's French birth influenced Burney's writing. One example is the conflicts between Madame Duval and Captain Mirvan in ""Evelina"". It may also have been one reason for her love of and marriage to Alexandre D'Arblay. Fanny was very shocked and sad when she heard that her mother was dead. Her neighbor, Mrs. Pringle, commented. She later said, ""...she never saw such affliction"" and that Fanny would ""take no comfort--&amp; was almost killed with [""sic""] Crying"". Her father, Charles Burney, was also very unhappy. He comforted himself with writing sad poems about his wife."
Father.
"Her father was respected by many people as a musician. He was also well-educated. He wished to show that a musician could be a gentleman. Frances Burney often saw many opera singers, dancers, musicians, and actors (like actors Garrick or Christopher Smart), that spoke in many kinds of languages. She mentioned him in ""Evelina"": ""Well may Mr. Garrick be so celebrated, so universally (everywhere) admired—I had not any idea of so great a performer...every look ""speaks""!...I am afraid you will think me mad (crazy), so I won't say any more; yet I really believe Mr. Garrick would make you mad too, if you could see him."" She also saw more of the world than most ""young ladies"" could. She wrote down many rude things people said in her diaries. Traveller Richard Twiss once embarrassed the family by talking about improper things. He said that an immodest book, ""The Dictionary of Love"", was very good. After Twiss left, Burney wrote in her Diary, 'Even my gentle &amp; candid (truthful) Father says that ""he has quite mistaken the Thing,"" &amp; that he will never see a ""Table Cloth"" in his House again'."
"Some people have said that Burney may have been shy because of her father. People said that Mr. Burney's only fault was ""obsequiousness"" (too much serving to men). Frances never openly criticized her father. She even carefully destroyed everything bad about him. In her ""Memoirs"", she wrote that her father had no faults. However, she wrote explanations and excuses for things her father thought were right."
Second mother.
"In October 1767, her father married a rich widow. Her name was Elizabeth Allen. She already had three sons. The Burney children did not like their stepmother. Hester, Frances's older sister, married her cousin. His name was Charles Rosseau Burney. He was a musician. She married him in September 1770. She probably did this to leave her home. Because of this, Frances lost a sister who was like another mother. The Burney children did a ""secret war"" with Mrs. Allen. They called her ""Mrs. Precious"", ""Madam"", and ""the Lady"". A letter from Frances Burney to her sister Hester said, ""The excuse to be ""fudged"" up (made up, lied) for the purpose, I leave to your own ingenuity."" Although at this time Frances was 25 years old, she had to find an excuse to visit her married sister. Even their old friend, Samuel ""Daddy"" Crisp, joined in with mocking Mrs. Elizabeth Allen."
Education.
"Her father educated her sisters Esther and Susanna much more than Frances Burney. When she was eight, she still had not learned the alphabet. She was also so shy that visitors at her father's house called her the ""old lady"". Some scholars think she might have had a kind of dyslexia. Her brother used to play tricks on her by pretending to teach her to read and giving her a book upside-down. She did not find out that it was actually upside down and tried to read it. People said that ""the little dunce"" should be whipped. However, Esther Sleepe Burney always replied that ""she had no fears about Fanny"". Her sister Susanna said that Fanny has ""sense, sensibility, and bashfulness (shyness)"". She also added, ""I am afraid...that my sister Fanny is too reserved""."
"In 1763 or 1764, Samuel ""Daddy"" Crisp became close to the Burney family. He helped Frances write by asking for many journal-letters from her about her family and her life. He influenced her writing very much."
Works.
"Frances Burney d'Arblay made a new kind of English novel, recording things that happened from George III's madness to what happened after the Battle of Waterloo. She also wrote comedies that had a great influence on many writers to come. For example, Jane Austen found both the theme and the title for ""Pride and Prejudice"" in the last chapter of Frances Burney's novel ""Cecilia"". William Makepeace Thackeray, the writer of Vanity Fair, was also influenced by Burney. Her first novel, ""Evelina"", was a new kind of fiction in English. It was a fiction where women in society were shown in realistic, modern ways - the novel of manners. ""She showed the manners and morals of polite society with a relish (liking) for the ridiculous (funny) and a respect for the conventional (traditional)"".(""Norton Anthology of Literature by Women"", p. 242) Burney was the first woman to make the writing of novels ""respectable"". Her second novel, ""Cecilia"", published in 1782, was an even greater critical success. Her third novel, ""Camilla"", was very popular; the sale was ""4 times that of ""Evelina"", &amp; nearly double that of ""Cecilia""""."

Verses written with Hester Thrale
Works by Fanny Burney at Project Gutenberg
"Lake Placid, New York"
"Lake Placid is a village in northern New York State. It has a population of 2,638. It was founded in the early 1880s to look for iron. Today it is a ski resort. It has hosted the Winter Olympics twice, in 1932 and 1980."
Grebe
A grebe is a medium sized bird. They are in the family Podicipedidae. There are 22 species of grebe.
"Description, color and shape."
"Most grebes are a medium or large size. Some grebes, such as the Little Grebe are smaller. All Grebes have large feet with lobed toes. This means that each toe is separate on the foot (the opposite of this is webbed feet which is seen in ducks and geese). Some grebes find it difficult to walk on land because their feet are so big. They are much better at swimming and diving in water."
"On his journey home, Odysseus lands on the island of the Cyclops Polyphemus. They go inside his cave at the sight of sheep, cheese and milk. Polyphemus catches them and eats some of Odysseus' men. Odysseus tricks and blinds him and they escape. The Cyclops prays to his father Poseidon that Odysseus would not get home to Ithaca and if he was fated to make it home, Odysseus would lose all of his men, his ship and find trouble at home. This prayer becomes the plot line of the Odyssey."
The Sirens.
"Odysseus and his ship have to pass the Sirens' island. The Sirens were always singing very beautifully, so sailors would try to go to them, but their ships would get destroyed, and they would die."
"Odysseus tells his men to put wax in their ears, so they will not hear the song of the sirens. He also tells his men to bind him to the ship's mast, so he cannot go to the sirens when he hears their song. His men can then look at Odysseus and see when he cannot hear the sirens anymore, because he is calm again. Then they can take the wax out of their ears, and free Odysseus."
Calypso.
"After escaping from the sea, and the death of his men, Odysseus comes to the island Ogygia. On this island lives the nymph Calypso, and Odysseus stayed with her for seven years. But then the god Hermes came and told her that the gods said that she had to let Odysseus go. Calypso promised Odysseus immortality (that he would live forever) if he stayed, but he wanted to go back to his wife Penelope. So Odysseus built a raft and left her."
The Phaeacians.
"After a storm, Odysseus comes to the island of the Phaeacians. There he is found by the king's daughter Nausicaä. Nausicaä brings him to the palace of her father, King Alkinoos. During his time there, Odysseus tell the story of his journey. After this, Alkinoos gives Odysseus a ship and sends him home to Ithaca."
Return home.
"During all this time, Penelope has been keeping the suitors at bay with a ruse (trick). She promises ""I will choose when I have finished weaving this cloth"", the cloth being a burial cloth for Odysseus' father. However, every night her servant unpicks the work of the previous day. The story is made more real by Penelope becoming restless. The goddess Athena causes Penelope to feel the need to display herself, and fan the flames of the suitors' desire."
"Odysseus finally returns to Ithaca, where he disguises himself as a beggar. He goes to his home and meets his son Telemachus. Together they kill the suitors, who are trying to marry Penelope in order to gain his kingdom. Later, the families of the suitors come to kill Odysseus for revenge. The goddess Athena helps Odysseus by making them stop and give up the fight."
Mae West
"Mae West (August 17, 1893 – November 22, 1980) was an American actress. She worked in vaudeville and later in movies. She is best-remembered for her dirty jokes and comedy movies."
"Her name when she was born was Mary Jane West. She was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and died in Hollywood, California. Her mother was a German immigrant and former model."
Lenny Bruce
"Lenny Bruce (October 13, 1925 – August 3, 1966), was an American comedian. His real name was Leonard Alfred Schneider. He is considered an innovator of modern stand-up comedy and changed the way many people see comedians. His jokes and routines were very improper and off limits for the time and he got in a lot of trouble for them. He is considered a hero for the defense of the First Amendment rights in the United States, especially for free speech."
"In the 1960s he was the last person arrested for impersonating and swearing, overwatched by martial law and police and banned from many cities and comedy clubs."
"He appeared on the cover of The Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album."
He died in 1966 of an accidental morphine overdose whist on trial.
"In 1970 the New York's highest court of appeals decided that he is ""not guilty for using bad words""."
Kimchi
"Kimchi (; ; ), also spelled kimchee or gimchi, is a traditional fermented Korean side dish made of vegetables with many seasonings. In traditional preparation, kimchi was stored underground in jars to keep cool during the summer months and unfrozen during the winter months. There are hundreds of varieties of kimchi made from napa cabbage, radish, scallion, or cucumber as a main ingredient."
"Kimchi is usually very strong for non-Koreans. There are many different types and Koreans typically eat kimchi in every meal. It is a staple of Korean food. Kimchi can be stored for a long time and it does not go bad easily. However, when it is exposed to hot weather for certain time, kimchi turns sour. So, it should not be put out unless it is going to be eaten soon. In Korea kimchi pots are a common sight. They are large terra cotta pots where the kimchi is stored until it can be eaten or until it ferments. Kimchi usually takes about 2 weeks to ferment, but some varieties can be eaten right away. Some must be stored for over a year to be finished."
The fermentation gives the kimchi a pickle-like quality and generally soggy or limp kimchi is not good.
Varieties.
"Every different kind of kimchi has a special taste and a different amount of time to ferment. Baechu Kimchi is one of the most famous kimchi. Kkakdugi is made of cubed Korean radish (mu). It’s especially contains more water and is hard to chew. Baek kimchi uses milder ingredients. It’s not spicy. Chonggak kimchi has a smallish white radish that comes with a ponytail. Gat kimchi is made from dark green Korean mustard (gat) leaves and stems. These can be kept for months or even longer. As these age, they taste like lemons. Oi Sobagi has a refreshing, cool, and hot taste. Cucumber is the main ingredient for it. It can be kept for about a week. As it ages, it also taste like a lemon. Dongchimi is a food and a beverage all in one. When it ferments, it becomes sweet and taste a lot like lemon water. It can be kept for about a month."
Preparation.
"The most common variety of kimchi is made from cabbage, radish, garlic, red pepper, salt and sugar. The cabbage is soaked in salt water for a few hours. Coarse rock salt is then rubbed in between the leaves of the cabbage. Red peppers are also rubbed in and most Kimchi has a lot of pepper in it. The radish is usually cut into long thin strips and added to the mix. A little sugar is added to help the fermentation process along much in the same way beer is made. The amounts of each ingredient vary between the type of kimchi you are making and the personal taste of the maker. Most kimchi has a special taste with shrimp or fish. The kimchi is allowed to ferment for a period of time, usually outdoors in a large kimchi pot. It is also quite common for these pots to be buried under ground. Kimchi can be kept for a long time and does not go bad. Koreans make kimchi with their families in December."
"Grebes have narrow wings. Some grebes find it difficult to fly. There are two species of grebe that cannot fly at all. This means that if grebes are in danger, they will dive under water instead of flying away like other birds do."
"Grebes can have long or short bills. If they eat insects in the water, they will have a short bills. If they eat crustaceans (for example, crabs) they will have a long, sharp bill."
"Most grebes are brown, white and red/orange. They have many, waterproof feathers. This means they can easily float on water and dive into water without getting cold or wet. In spring and summer, grebes have orange crests on their heads. This is so they can attract a mate. Some grebes do a mating ritual. This is when they ""dance"" in the water."
Grebes make their nest from plants found in the water. The nests float on top of the water. Baby grebes can swim when they are born. They are usually brown and white and do not get their orange crests until they are adults.
Habitat.
"Grebes live in freshwater (lakes or rivers). Some species of grebe will go to saltwater (sea/ocean) when they are migrating. This is when birds fly to live in a different place in summer or winter. Grebes only migrate if they live in North America, Europe or Asia. Grebes in South America, Africa and Asia do not migrate. They are found in every continent on earth."
Funeral director
"A Funeral Director also called a mortician or undertaker is a person who has the job of organizing a funeral. This often includes embalming and burial or cremation of the dead, as well as the planning and arrangement of the actual funeral ceremony. They place the body into a coffin or casket. If people are going to come and look at the body before burial, the funeral director will have the body dressed, and made up with cosmetics to make it look better."
Mangrove
"Mangroves are trees or shrubs that grow in salty water in hot places like the tropics. Mangroves make a special saltwater woodland or shrubland habitat, called a ""mangrove swamp"", ""mangrove forest"", ""mangrove"" or ""mangal"". Mangroves grow on 1/3 of tropical shores. They are also found in sub-tropical Africa, Asia, and the southwest Pacific. Their twisted, tangled roots collect sediment. Over time, the sediment may become islands, or extend the shoreline."
Description.
"Mangroves live right in the sea, or at the sea edge. Their seeds fall from the tree and grow roots as soon as they touch any kind of soil. During low tide, they may fall in soil rather than water and start growing where they fall. If the water level is high, they may be carried far away from where they fell. Mangrove trees are often the beginning of what will one day be a small island. As soil and other things collect in their roots, little bodies of land are formed – just the right place for other island vegetation to grow. This is an example of seed dispersal by water."
"Mangroves have special root-like structures. They are aerial roots or ""pneumatophores"". These stick up out of the soil, and are covered in lenticels. They take in oxygen through their pores. These ""breathing tubes"" may reach heights of up to 30 cm, and in some species, over 3 m. Smaller roots with air passages move oxygen from the air to parts of the plant underwater. For more information please visit a geography site https://www.kidsgeog.com THANK YOU Mangrove"
Benefits.
"Mangrove roots give clear water to the coral reefs which often surround them. They trap dirt and clean water by filtering land runoff and removing pollutants. The tree also protects the shoreline (and, through this, the coral reefs) from being eroded by storm waves. Mangrove thickets are a good place for many coral-reef fish, shrimp, and crabs to grow."
BBC account.
"Mangroves are a group of about 80 different salt-tolerant species of trees. They can live along the intertidal zones of tropical and sub-tropical coastlines. Their roots stand the ebb and flow of tides. The roots slow the flow of the tidal waters. This lets sediment settle and build up as nutrient-rich mud. The habitat is a valuable shelter and breeding site for fish. It stabilises coastlines, and reduces erosion from storm surges and tsunamis."
Great crested grebe
"The great crested grebe is a water bird. It is a member of the grebe family. Its scientific name is ""Podiceps cristatus""."
Description.
The great crested grebe is a medium sized bird. It is 46–51 cm long. Its wingspan (both wings open) is 59–73 cm long.
"The bird is white, brown and black, and it has orange crest feathers on its head. It has a long, sharp pink bill. Baby great crested grebe have black and white stripes on their heads."
Habitat and behaviour.
"The great crested grebe is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. It is the biggest grebe in Europe. It lives in freshwater lakes. It eats crustaceans (for example, crabs), insects and small frogs. It dives into the water to find food."
"The bird has an interesting mating ritual. This means two birds (male and female) do a ""dance"" in the water before they mate. Grebes dance every time the pair meets, and the dance varies according to the circumstance. Returning to the nest is different from meeting out on the water, for instance. Most dances end in a bout of head-shaking."
"The great crested grebe makes a nest from plants. The nest floats on top of the water. A pair of grebes will usually have two eggs. When the babies are born, they cannot swim. Their parents teach them to swim and dive. Sometimes the babies will sit on their parents backs while the parents swim in the water."
Conservation.
"The bird nearly became extinct in the United Kingdom in the 19th century. This is because people wanted to use their orange head feathers. People wanted to put the feathers on their hats and clothes. The RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) stopped this. There are now many great crested grebe in the United Kingdom, where their conservation status is ""green"" (""least concern"")."
Amazon River
"The Amazon River (also called ""Rio Amazonas"" in Portuguese and Spanish) is the largest river in the world by the amount or volume of water it carries. It flows through the tropical forests of South America, mainly in Brazil. Its headwaters are in the Andes Mountains in Peru, on the western edge of South America and flows eastward into the Atlantic Ocean near the equator."
"The Amazon River moves more water than the next eight largest rivers of the world combined and has the largest drainage basin in the world. It accounts for about one fifth of the world's total river flow. During the wet season, parts of the Amazon exceed in width. Because of its size, it is sometimes called ""The Sea"", but it is not the world's ""longest"" river system. The world's longest river is the Nile River, with the Amazon being second-longest."
Overview.
"All the main tributaries to the Amazon River have their own names. They start in the mountains (Andes) as clear water with high oxygen content, and connect with the other rivers as they all flow towards the mouth of the Amazon."
"The water of the Amazon ends up full of mud. This is especially true of its Rio Negro tributary). In the nutritious mud live a huge number of insects, small crustacea, parasites. On these small fry live predators, birds, fish and life generally. The mud is what causes this huge array of life. The mud has nutrients, and on this the flies and fish all the other animals depend."
Size and path.
"It is one of the longest rivers in the world. There have been different studies that have tried to measure its exact length. As the studies have come up with different numbers, it is therefore difficult to give an exact number. The length also changes in the rainy season. Several studies from Brazil, Spain and Chile say it is the longest river in the world, longer than the Nile. The Nile has a length of . The Amazon may have a length of . The Spanish daily newspaper El País gives its length at . In 2007, scientists from Peru and Brazil calculated a length of ."
"A study done in 1969 says that the Amazon has a length of . This was measured from a part of the River Apurimac. Until the 1970s, it was thought that the Marañón River was the source of the Amazon. In 2001, an expedition found that Nevado Mismi was in fact the source of the Amazon. Another document of the Geographic society of Lima gives the length of the Amazon at over ."
"The source of the Amazon is in the Andes Mountains of western South America. It flows east from there to the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the huge river and its many tributaries are in the country of Brazil. There are many places on the Amazon where a person on one side of the river cannot see the other side. The Brazilians call the Amazon the ""River Sea."" The Amazon is navigable from the ocean to Peru. Ocean ships can travel on the Amazon all the way across Brazil, and most of South America, to the city of Iquitos in Peru."
"One characteristic of the Amazon river is the ""Brazo Casiquiare"", a water connection to the Orinoco river into Venezuela, that connects the two basins."
Estuary.
"The estuary of the Amazon is about wide. The width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo do Norte to Punto Patijoca. Generally, the outlet of the Para River is included. It is wide, and forms the estuary of the Tocantins. The estuary also includes the island of Marajó, which lies in the mouth of the Amazon. This means that the Amazon is wider at its mouth than the entire length of the Thames river in England."
"Along the coastline, near Cabo do Norte, there are many islands partially covered with water. There are also sandbanks. The tides of the Atlantic generate a wave that reaches into the Amazon river. This wave goes along the coast for about . The phenomenon of this wave generated by the tides is called a tidal bore. Locally it is known as ""pororoca"". The pororoca occurs where the water is less than deep. It starts with a loud noise, and advances at a speed of . The bore is the reason the Amazon does not have a delta. The ocean rapidly carries away the large amount of silt brought by the Amazon. This makes it impossible for a delta to grow past the shoreline. It also has a very large tide, that can reach . The place has become popular for river surfing."
Uses.
The Amazon River has many uses:
"""Uses"" suggests that the wonders of the Earth are there for our taking. They are not. It is up to us what we do, and the Amazon has already been greatly damaged by greed and corruption. Logging its trees and changing the ecosystem to farmland is already far advanced."
Bridges.
"There are no bridges across the entire width of the river. This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry, so there is no need to build a bridge. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro (a tributary of the Amazon)."
"The river is the main route of traffic in the region. Most cities are on the banks of the river. The biggest city on the river is Manaus, which is also the capital of the Brazilian State of Amazonas. Many native people live in the Amazon, such as the Urarina who live in Peru."
Trade route.
"Big ocean boats can get up the river until Manaus, which is almost 1500 kilometers (900 miles) from its mouth. Smaller ocean ships of 3,000 tons and 7.9 m (26 ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos in Peru, 3,700 km (2,300 miles) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780 km (486 mi) higher as far as Actual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently go up to the Pogo Ode Escherichia's, just above Actual Point."
Pyramid
"A pyramid is a structure, usually made of stone, built in the shape of a pyramid. From ancient to modern times people in many different parts of the world have built such structures."
"The word ""pyramid"" comes from the Greek word ""pyramis"" which meant ""wheat cake."" The ancient Egyptian word for them was something like ""Mer"". The Great Pyramid of Giza was one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world."
The first pyramids were built in 2630 B.C. The oldest known pyramid was made for king Djoser of the third Dynasty.
Egyptian pyramids.
"In Egypt, kings and queens, called Pharaohs, were buried in the tombs of huge square-bottomed pyramids built of stone. They were usually built to be used as tombs for Pharaohs. The ancient Egyptian pyramids are very well built. Some of the pyramids still stand today."
"The oldest man-made pyramid found is called the Step pyramid. It is in the Giza Necropolis in Saqqara, near Cairo, Egypt. It was built for King Djoser thousands of years ago. Later pyramids were built much larger. The largest one was the Great Pyramid of Giza. It is near Cairo. It was the tallest building in the world until the Eiffel Tower was built in Paris, in 1889. The Great Pyramid was built by the pharaoh Khufu (= Cheops) from the Ancient Egyptian Old Kingdom. Herodotus was told by his Egyptian guides that it took twenty years for a force of 100,000 slaves to build the pyramid (with another ten years to build a stone causeway that connected to a temple in the valley below)."
"People once thought pyramids were built by slaves. More recent evidence suggests that the workers who built the pyramids were paid and well-cared for. They were loyal to the Pharaoh. Inside the Great Pyramid, famous man-made objects have been found from ancient times. Many valuable items were buried with the dead Pharaohs, in the hope that they would take them to the afterlife. Pyramids usually had traps to stop thieves from escaping easily. Tomb thieves were punished by death if they were caught. However, by 1000 BC, many of the pyramids had been robbed of their precious treasures."
A large statue of a Sphinx stands near the pyramids at Giza. It has the body of a Lion and the head of a Pharaoh.
Other zinc compounds are:
Occurence.
"Five isotopes of zinc are found in nature. 64Zn is the most common isotope, with 48.63% of naturally occurring Zinc. This isotope has a half-life of 4.3x1018 years. This is so long, that its radioactivity can be ignored. Similarly, (0.6%), with a half life of 1.3x1016 years is usually considered to not be radioactive. The other isotopes found in nature are (28%), (4%) and (19%)."
"Zinc is not found as a metal in the earth's crust. Zinc is only found as zinc compounds. Sphalerite, a mineral that is made of zinc sulfide, is a main ore of zinc. Very little zinc is in the ocean. Zinc ore is normally found with copper and lead ores."
"There are some other zinc ores, such as smithsonite (zinc carbonate) and a zinc silicate mineral. They are less common."
Preparation.
The zinc sulfide is concentrated by flotation. There is a detergent that collects the zinc sulfide. The impurities sink to the bottom and are removed. Then the zinc sulfide is heated in air to make zinc oxide and sulfur dioxide.
The sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide.
The sulfur trioxide reacts with the zinc oxide to make zinc sulfate. This makes a soluble form of zinc which can be processed more.
"The zinc sulfate is purified and electrolyzed. This electrolysis makes oxygen, zinc, and sulfuric acid. This makes a pure zinc that is known as ""SHG"" or special high grade."
The sulfuric acid is reused in place of the sulfur trioxide to leach more zinc oxide.
Zinc oxide can also be reduced by carbon to zinc metal and carbon dioxide at high temperatures. This is a blast furnace process similar to how iron is made.
This form of zinc is cheaper but is not pure.
Zinc is the fourth most commonly used metal in the world. About 10 million tons are made every year.
Uses.
As a metal.
Zinc is used in electrical batteries. The alkaline cell and the Leclanche cell are the ones that use zinc the most. It becomes oxidized and provides electrons for the battery to run.
"About 59% of zinc is used for corrosion prevention, which includes galvanizing. 47% of the world's zinc is used for galvanizing. This is used to protect another metal, usually iron, from rusting. The zinc coating corrodes instead of the iron. The zinc coating can be placed on the metal in two ways. The metal can be dipped into a pot of melted zinc. The zinc can also be electroplated on to the metal. Dipping lasts longer but has a patchy surface that some do not think looks nice. It is also used in motorboats and pipelines to slow rusting. The motor of a motorboat often has a ""bullet"" of zinc, that will corrode easily, but will help other metal parts of the motor to stay rust free."
"Zinc is used in alloys. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Brass is the most common zinc alloy. Zinc can form alloys with many other metals. Zinc aluminium is an alloy of zinc and aluminium, which makes good bearings. Commercial bronze has zinc in it. Sometimes cadmium telluride is reacted with zinc to make cadmium zinc telluride, a semiconductor. Nickel silver is another zinc alloy."
"Zinc can be used in the pipes of a pipe organ. An alloy of tin and lead was used in the past. Zinc is used in the US penny, which only has a thin layer of copper. The core is zinc. Older pennies were made completely out of bronze."
"A mixture of powdered zinc and sulfur can be used to propel a model rocket. This reaction makes zinc sulfide, heat, light, and gases. Zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars."
As zinc compounds.
About 1/4 of zinc is used to make zinc compounds. Zinc oxide can be used for sunscreen or paint pigment. Zinc oxide also is a semiconductor. Zinc chloride is used to preserve wood so it does not rot. Some fungicides have zinc in them. Zinc sulfate is used in dyes and pigments. Zinc sulfide is used in fluorescent bulbs to convert the ultraviolet light to visible light.
In biology.
"Humans need a little bit of zinc to help their body run well. If they do not get enough zinc in their food, they can get a mineral deficiency. Almost two billion people have a zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency makes one more easily get infections. Some people say that when we get colds, we should take more zinc. Others say that zinc does not make a difference. There are medicines that one can use when they have a cold. People add tiny amounts of zinc compounds to vitamin pills and cereals to make sure that they get enough zinc. Most single-tablet vitamins have zinc in them. Zinc is found in at least 100 enzymes. It is the second most common transition metal other than iron. Zinc also is used by the brain. The human body contains 2 to 4 grams of zinc. A zinc enzyme helps remove carbon dioxide from blood. Whole wheat has much zinc in it."
Safety.
"Large amounts of zinc metal are toxic. It can dissolve in stomach acid. When too much zinc is eaten, copper and iron levels go down in the body. Zinc compounds can be corrosive in the stomach. Zinc compounds put in the nose can ruin the sense of smell."
Zinc ions are very toxic to fish and many things that live in water.
Zebra
"Zebras are mammals of the family ""Equidae"". Zebras are African horses. They are in the same genus as the common horse, ""Equus caballus"", and donkeys. Zebras are known for having many black and white stripes. There are three main species of zebra, Grevy's Zebra, the Plains Zebra, and the Mountain Zebra."
Appearance.
"0 (zero) is also used as a numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals. It is used to hold the place of that digit, because correct placing of digits affects a numeral's value."
Examples:
Telling zero and the letter O apart.
"The number 0 and the letter O are both round, though of different widths. The difference is important on a computer. For one thing, a computer will not do arithmetic with the letter O, because it does not know that it should have been a zero."
"The oval-shaped zero and circular letter O came into use together on modern character displays. The zero with a dot in the centre seems to have begun as a choice on IBM 3270 controllers (this has the problem that it looks like the Greek letter theta). The slashed zero, looking like the letter O with a diagonal line drawn inside it, is used in old-style ASCII graphic sets that came from the default typewheel on the well-known ASR-33 Teletype. This format causes problems because it looks like the symbol formula_1, representing the empty set, as well as for certain Scandinavian languages which use Ø as a letter."
"The rule which has the letter O with a slash and the zero without was used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers; this is even more of a problem for Scandinavians, because it looks like two of their letters at the same time. Some Burroughs/Unisys computers display a zero with a backwards slash. And yet another convention common on early line printers left zero without any extra dots or slashes but added a tail or hook to the letter O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter O."
"The letters used on some European number plates for cars make the two symbols look different. This is done by making the zero rather egg-shaped and the O more circular, but most of all by cutting open the zero on the upper right side, so the circle is not closed any more (as in ). The style of letters chosen is called """" (abbr.: ""FE Schrift""), meaning ""script which is harder to falsify"". But those used in the United Kingdom do not make the letter o and the number 0 look different from each other, because there can never be any mistake if the letters are correctly spaced."
In paper writing you do not have to make the 0 (zero) and O (letter O) look different at all. Or you may add a slash across the zero in order to show the difference.
Zeroes of a function.
"Functions are explained in the Function (mathematics) article. If the function ""f""(""x"") = 0, then ""x"" is called a zero (or root) of the function ""f"". For example, if the function ""f""(""x"") is ""x""2 − 1, then the zeroes of the function are +1 and −1, because ""f""(+1) = (+1)2 − 1 = 0, and ""f""(−1) = (−1)2 − 1 = 0."
"Zeroes of a function are used because they are another way to talk about solving an equation, which is a main goal in algebra. If we want to solve an equation like ""x""2 = 1, then we can subtract the right-hand side of the equation from both sides, in this case 1. Whatever we get on the left-hand side, in this case ""x""2 − 1, can be called a function ""f""(x). The right-hand side has to be zero, because we subtracted it from itself. So ""f""(x) = 0. Finding the zeroes of this function is the same as solving this equation. In the paragraph before, the zeroes of this function are +1 and −1, so they are the solutions of this equation. We got this equation by subtracting the same thing from both sides, so we also have solutions to the equation we started with, in this case ""x""2 = 1. More generally, if we could find zeroes of functions, we could solve any equation."
Zoology
"Zoology is the science of studying animal life. It is part of biology. The word is pronounced ""Zō-ölogy"", not ""Zoo-ology"". Animal life is classified into groups called phyla, of which there are at least thirty."
"Zoologists are scientists who study animals. They may work in laboratories, or do field research. The methods are many and various. At the heart, they cover the structure, function, ecology and evolution of animals. The structure is investigated by dissection, and microscopic examination. The function is investigated by observation and experiment. Palaeontology supplies information about extinct animals. Zoologists may be employed by universities, museums, or by zoos."
Short-list of zoologists.
Some zoologists:
Zinc
"Zinc, sometimes called spelter, is a chemical element. It is in the group of metals called the transition metals. It is sometimes considered a post-transition metal. Its symbol on the periodic table is ""Zn"". Zinc is the 30th element on the periodic table, and has an atomic number of 30. Zinc has a mass number of 65.38. It contains 30 protons and 30 electrons. In total, 29 isotopes of zinc are known, and five of these occur in nature. Some isotopes are radioactive. Their half-lives are between 40 milliseconds for 57Zn and 5x1018 years for 70Zn."
Zinc is a metal that is mostly used for galvanizing and batteries. It is the fourth most common metal used by people.
Properties.
Physical properties.
"Zinc is a shiny bluish grey metal. When it has just been cut, zinc has a whitish-grey color. If it is exposed to air, it will not stay shiny for long. Its melting point is (), and its boiling point is (). This temperature is lower than most transition metals but higher than tin or lead. It can be melted on a cooking stove. It boils at a low temperature for a metal. It is not magnetic. When heated a little, it becomes very flexible. If it is heated more, it becomes very brittle. It forms alloys easily with other metals."
Chemical properties.
"Zinc is a reactive metal. It is about as reactive as aluminium and more reactive than most of the more common metals, such as iron, copper, nickel, and chromium. It is less reactive than magnesium. Zinc can react with acids, bases, and nonmetals. It does not rust in air, though. A coating of zinc oxide and zinc carbonate forms on the surface of the zinc when it is in air. This coating stops corrosion. Acids can dissolve this coating and react with the zinc metal. This reaction of zinc with an acid makes a zinc(II) salt such as zinc chloride and hydrogen gas. This is a very common chemical reaction. The reaction below is the reaction with hydrochloric acid."
"Zinc can burn when powdered or in small pieces to make zinc oxide, a white powder. The flame is bright blue-green."
Zinc oxide can dissolve in strong bases. This reaction happens in some batteries that have zinc in them.
"Zinc is a chalcophile. This means that it would rather react with sulfur and elements below it on the periodic table than oxygen. That is why zinc sulfide is the most common zinc ore, not zinc oxide."
Chemical compounds.
"Zinc can make chemical compounds with other elements. These chemical compounds are only in one oxidation state: +2. A +1 compound has been found but it is hard to make. There are no other oxidation states other than +1 or +2. Most of these compounds have no color. If they have a color, it is not the zinc that is making the color."
Zinc chloride is one of the most common zinc compounds. They are quite unreactive. They are a little acidic when dissolved in water. They make a green flame when heated in a fire.
Ascent stage.
"This was the roundish upper half of the LM, the command center and crew cabin as well as the launching rocket for leaving the moon."
"To save weight, there were no seats for the men. They would stand, loosely held in place by straps. In front and on either side of them were control panels for the LM’s guidance, communication, environment and propulsion systems. On the left side, there was a window by which commander could look out to steer the LM. Overhead in the middle section was the of diameter hatch where the astronauts transferred to and from the Command Module when two vehicles were linked. LM’s ascent rocket to meet Command Module was below the deck of the midsection. Although ascent rocket was small, it was sufficient because the moon’s weak gravity – one-sixth that of earth’s – meant that the LM would not require a strong push to rise from the lunar surface."
First flight of Lunar Module.
"On Monday, January 22, 1968, a 16-ton unmanned Lunar Module surrounded by a protective shield stood on top of a two-stage Saturn 1-B rocket called Apollo 5. This flight was made to do two important tests. One was to check separating stage from main rocket. The second was to check test firing of the descent engine, but this mission did not succeed. The Apollo 5 test ended after eight hours, and the LM remained in earth orbit. It eventually dropped into the atmosphere and burned up."
Mont-Saint-Michel
"Le Mont-Saint-Michel (; ) is an island and commune in Normandy, France. It is in the Manche department. It is located about one kilometre () from the country's northwestern coast. It is at the mouth of the Couesnon River near Avranches. It is in size and it has a population of 44 (2009). People that live there are called the ""Montois""."
"The island has had strategic fortifications since ancient times. The name ""Mont-Saint-Michel"" comes from the monastery built there in the eighth century AD. The way in which the town is built is an example of how feudal society worked. At the top there is God, the abbey and monastery. Below this, there are the great halls, then stores and houses. At the bottom, outside the walls, there are the houses of fishermen and farmers."
"Mont-Saint-Michel is one of France's most famous landmarks. The island and its bay are part of the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. Every year, more than 3 million people visit it."
Geography.
Formation.
"In prehistoric times, the ""Mont"" was on dry land. It is now a rocky tidal island. Sea levels became higher and erosion changed the landscape of the coast. Several layers of granite or granulite came to the surface in the bay. These layers of rock resisted the damage by the ocean better than the other rocks around them. These included Lillemer, the Mont-Dol, Tombelaine (a small island just to the north), and Mont Tombe, which later became Mont-Saint-Michel. The mount has a circumference of about 960 metres (3,150 ft). It is 92 metres (301 ft) above sea level at its highest point."
Tides.
"The difference between the high and low water marks is about . Medieval pilgrims who crossed the flat land sometimes called the mount ""St. Michael in peril of the sea"". Today, it can still be dangerous for visitors who do not use the causeway. It can be a risk to walk across the sands from the opposite coast. This is because of quicksand."
"Polderisation and occasional flooding have created salt marsh meadows. They are ideal for sheep. The meat has a good flavour because of the sheep's diet. The ""pré salé"" (salt meadow, in French) is home to ""agneaux de pré-salé"" (salt meadow lamb). This is made into a local specialty (a famous type of food). The local lamb is sometimes on the menus of restaurants in the area."
Tidal island.
"Before 2013, Mont-Saint-Michel was linked to the mainland with a tidal causeway. It was a path covered at high tide and shown at low tide. This connection changed over the centuries. The coastal flats (the sand) have been polderised to make pastureland. This means Mont-Saint-Michel became closer to the coast. The Couesnon River was canalised. This helped make the flow of water similar every time the tide rises or falls. However, it developed a silting-up of the bay. In 1879, the tidal causeway was changed into a raised, dry causeway. This stopped the tide from cleaning the silt around the mount."
"On 16 June 2006, the French prime minister and regional authorities announced a €164 million project (""Projet Mont-Saint-Michel""). The wanted to build a hydraulic dam using the waters of the river Couesnon and of tides. This would help remove all of the silt deposited by the rising tides. It would make Mont-Saint-Michel an island again."
The construction of the dam began in 2009. It was completed in 2013. The project was also to remove the causeway and its visitor car-park. The new car-park is on the mainland. It is about two kilometres () from the island. Visitors can use small shuttle buses to cross the causeway. The bridge is also open to pedestrians and vehicles without a motor.
"Architect Dietmar Feichtinger designed the bridge. It opened to the public on 22 July 2014. The bridge lets the waters go freely around the island. It makes the dam more efficient. The project cost €209 million, €45 million more than planned. President François Hollande officially opened the bridge."
"Sometimes, weather conditions make the tide very high. This is called a ""supertide"". For example, the sea completely covered the new bridge on 21 March 2015. It was the highest sea level for at least 18 years. Many people travelled to Mont-Saint-Michel to take photos."
History.
"Mont-Saint-Michel was an Armorican stronghold of Gallo-Roman culture in the sixth and seventh centuries. In the seventh century, the Franks took the mount. From about the fifth to the eighth century, Mont-Saint-Michel was part of a region called Neustria. At the start of the ninth century, it was an important place in the marches of Neustria."
"Before the eighth century, the island was called ""Mont Tombe"" (). The Catholic Church built the first religious building in the eighth century, and the mount became Mont-Saint-Michel. According to legend, the Archangel Michael appeared in 708 to St. Aubert, the bishop of Avranches. The angel told him to build a church on the mount. Aubert didn't listen to the angel until Michael burned a hole in the bishop's skull with his finger."
"The king of the Franks could not defend his kingdom against the attacks of the Vikings. The king agreed to give the Cotentin peninsula and the Avranchin, including Mont-Saint-Michel, to the Bretons in the 867 Treaty of Compiègne. For a short time, the mount belonged to the Bretons. In effect, these lands and Mont-Saint-Michel never belonged to the duchy of Brittany. They remained separate bishoprics from the newly created Breton archbishopric of Dol. When Rollo named Franco as archbishop of Rouen, the diocese of Rouen took the lands and the mount. They became part of Normandy once again, but not officially."
"The mount became strategically important again in 933 when William ""Long Sword"" (the Duke of Normandy) annexed the Cotentin Peninsula from the weakened Dukes of Brittany. This made the mount part of Normandy officially. This is shown in the Bayeux Tapestry, which commemorates (helps remember) the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The tapestry shows Harold, Earl of Wessex helping two Norman knights from the quicksand around Mont-Saint-Michel during a battle with Conan II, Duke of Brittany. Norman dukes paid for the development of the abbey in the following centuries. It became a good example of Norman architecture."
"In 1067, the monastery of Mont-Saint-Michel gave its support to Duke William of Normandy in his claim to the throne of England. William gave houses and grounds on the English side of the Channel as a reward. These included a small island off the southwestern coast of Cornwall. It became a Norman priory named St Michael's Mount of Penzance. It looks similar to Mont-Saint-Michel."
"During the Hundred Years' War, the English made many attacks on the island. They were not able to take it due to the abbey's very good fortifications. The English first attacked the mount in 1423, and then again in 1433. Thomas Scalles was the leader of the English army. Scalles left two wrought iron bombards when he stopped his attack. They are still there today. They are known as ""les Michelettes"". The resistance at Mont-Saint-Michel gave hope to the French, especially Joan of Arc."
"When Louis XI of France founded the Order of Saint Michael in 1469, he wanted the church of Mont-Saint-Michel to become the chapel for the Order. However, it was far from Paris so this was not possible."
"The wealth and influence of the abbey helped other foundations, for example St Michael's Mount in Cornwall. However, it started to become less popular as a centre of pilgrimage due to the Reformation. At the time of the French Revolution, there were almost no monks living there. The republicans closed the abbey. It became a prison. At first, this was to hold clerical enemies of the French republic. Later, there were also important political prisoners at the mount. In 1836, famous figures, such as Victor Hugo, started a campaign to restore the mount. The prison closed in 1863, and the mount became a historic monument in 1874. Mont-Saint-Michel and its bay became UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1979. The factors for listing included cultural, historical, and architectural importance, as well as man-made and natural beauty."

Inspiration and references.
"Harriet Beecher Stowe was born in Connecticut. She was an abolitionist. Stowe wrote her novel because of the 1850 passage of the second Fugitive Slave Act. This law punished people who helped slaves run away. It also made the North stop and return the South's black runaways. Mrs. Edward Beecher wrote to Harriet (""Hattie""), ""If I could use a pen as you can, I would write something that will make this whole nation feel what an accursed thing slavery is."" At that time, Stowe was a wife with six children who sometimes wrote for magazines. Her son, Charles Stowe, said that his mother read this letter out loud to her children. When she finished the letter, she stood up, and with ""an expression on her face that stamped itself on the mind of her child"", she said, ""I ""will"" write something...I will if I live."" That is how ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" began."
"According to Stowe, she began thinking about ""Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly"" as she was in a church in February 1851. She had a vision of a Christian black man being beaten and praying for the people who were beating him as he died. She was also partly inspired to write her novel by the autobiography of Josiah Henson. Henson was a black man who had run away and helped many black slaves. She was also helped by the book ""American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses"" by Theodore Dwight Weld and the Grimké sisters. Stowe also said that she got lots of ideas for Uncle Tom's Cabin by talking to runaway slaves when she was living in Cincinnati, Ohio."
"In her book ""A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin"" (1853), Stowe wrote about the stories that inspired her when she was writing ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". However, later research showed that Stowe did not actually read many of the stories inside the book until after her novel was published."
Publication.
"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" began in a series in an anti-slavery newspaper, ""The National Era"". ""The National Era"" had also printed other works Stowe had written. Because everybody liked the story so much, John P. Jewett of Boston asked Stowe to turn the serial into a book. Stowe was not sure if people would like to read the story as a book. However, she finally agreed. John Jewett, sure that the book would be popular, asked Hammatt Billings to engrave six pictures for the book. In March 20, 1852, the finished book came out. By June it was selling ten thousand copies a week. By October American sales alone were 150 thousand copies. In the first year it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold, and it was translated into many important languages."
Summary.
"Eliza's escape, Tom is sold."
"A Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby is afraid of losing his farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife, Emily Shelby, are kind to their slaves, he decides to sell two of them: Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of his wife's maid Eliza. Emily Shelby is shocked and unhappy because she promised Eliza that she would not sell her son. George Shelby, her son, is unhappy because he admires Uncle Tom as his friend and Christian."
"When Eliza hears about Mr. Shelby's plans to sell her son, she decides to run away with her only son. She writes a letter saying sorry to Mrs. Shelby and runs away that night."
"Meanwhile, Uncle Tom is sold and put into a boat, which sails down the Mississippi River. There, he makes friends with a girl called Evangeline (""Eva""). When Eva falls into the water and he saves her, Eva's father, Augustine St. Clare, buys Tom. Eva and Tom become good friends because they both love Jesus very deeply."
"Eliza's family hunted, Tom's life with St. Clare."
"During Eliza's escape, she meets her husband, George Harris, who had run away before her. They decide to try to run away to Canada. However, they are hunted by a slave hunter named Tom Loker. Tom Loker finally traps Eliza and her family, so that George shoots Loker. Eliza is worried that Loker might die and go to hell. Because of this, she persuades her husband to take him to a Quaker town to get better. The gentle Quakers change Tom Loker greatly."
"In St. Clare's house, St. Clare argues with his sister, Miss Ophelia. She thinks that slavery is wrong, but is prejudiced against blacks. St. Clare buys Topsy, a black child, and challenges Miss Ophelia to educate her. Miss Ophelia tries, but fails."
"After Tom has lived with St. Clare for about two years, Eva becomes very sick. She has a vision of heaven before she dies. Because of her death, many people change. Miss Ophelia loses her prejudice of black people, Tospy decides to become ""good"", and St. Clare decides to free Tom."
Tom's life with Simon Legree.
"St. Clare, however, is hurt when he tries to stop a fight at a tavern and dies. Because of this, he cannot keep his promise to free Tom. His wife sells Tom to a plantation owner named Simon Legree. Legree takes Tom to Louisiana. There, he meets other slaves, including Emmeline (who Legree bought at the same time that he bought Tom). Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom disobeys his order to whip the other slaves. Legree beats him, and decides to destroy Tom's faith in God. However, Tom secretly continues to read the Bible and help the other slaves. At the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another black slave. Her two children had been sold, and she had killed her third child because she was afraid that her child would be sold, too."
"Loker has been changed because of the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have finally reached Canada and become free. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom feels so unhappy that he almost gives up, but he has two visions of Jesus and Eva. He decides to continue to be a Christian, even if he has to die. Cassy and Emmeline, with Tom’s encouragement, run away. They cleverly use Legree’s superstitious fears to help them. When Tom does not tell Legree where they are, Legree tells his men to beat him to death. Tom forgives the two men who beat him as he dies, and they feel sorry and become Christians. George Shelby comes just as Tom is dying to free him. He is very angry and sad. However, Tom, saying smilingly, “Who,—who,—who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” dies."
Important characters.
Uncle Tom.
"Uncle Tom, the title character of the story, is a patient, noble, unselfish black slave. Stowe wanted him to be a “noble hero”: in the book, he stands up for what he believes in. Even though they do not want to, even his enemies admire him."
"Recently, however, his name has also been used negatively. People often think of ""Uncle Tom"" as an old black man trying to make his masters happy, as people have criticized his quiet acceptance of slavery. However, others argue that this is not true. First of all, Uncle Tom is not really old - he is only eight years older than Mr. Shelby, which shows that he is probably around fifty. Also, Tom is not happy with slavery. His acceptance is not because of stupidity or because he likes slavery. It is because of his religious faith, which tells him to love everyone. Wherever Uncle Tom goes, he loves and spreads comfort and kindness. He helps slaves escape, such as Eliza, Emmeline and Cassy. He also refuses to beat other slaves. Because of this, he is beaten himself. Stowe was not trying to make Tom an example for ""blacks"" but for white ""and"" black people. She says that if white people were to be loving and unselfish like Uncle Tom, slavery would be impossible."
Eliza Harris.
"Eliza Harris is Mrs. Shelby's favorite maid, George Harris' wife, and Harry's mother. Eliza is a brave, intelligent, and very beautiful young slave. Eliza loves her son, Harry, very much. It is possible her love for him was even greater because she lost two of her first infant children. Her motherly love is shown when she bravely escapes with her son. Perhaps the most well-known part of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" is the part where Eliza escapes on the Ohio River with Harry."
"This escape is said to have been inspired by a story heard in the Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati by John Rankin to Stowe's husband Calvin, a professor at the school. In Rankin's story, in February, 1838, a young slave woman had escaped across the frozen Ohio River to the town of Ripley, Ohio with her child in her arms and stayed at his house before she had gone further towards the north."
Eva.
"Eva ""Evangeline"" St. Clare is St. Clare and Marie's angelic daughter. She enters the story when Tom saves her from drowning when he was going to be sold. Eva asks her father to buy Tom. She says, ""I want to make him happy"". Through her, Tom becomes St. Clare's leading coachman and Eva's ""especial attendant (helper)...Tom had...orders to let everything else go, and attend to Miss Eva whenever she wanted him,—orders which our readers may fancy (imagine) were far from disagreeable to him."" She is very beautiful: ""Her form was the perfection of childish beauty...Her face was remarkable less for its perfect beauty of features than for a singular (strange) and dreamy earnestness (seriousness) of expression...all marked her out (made her different) from the other children, and made every one turn and look after her""."
"To Tom, she ""...seemed something almost divine; and whenever her golden head and deep blue eyes peered (looked) out upon him...he half believed that he saw one of the angels stepped out of his New Testament."" He says that ""She's got the Lord's mark in her forehead."" Eva is an almost perfect, Christ-like child. She is very sad about slavery. She does not see the difference between blacks and whites. She talks very much about love and forgiveness. Even Topsy is touched by her love. Eva becomes one of the most important people in Tom's life."
Ophelia St. Clare.
"Ophelia St. Clare is perhaps the most complicated female character in the novel. St. Clare calls her, ""...desperately ... good; it tires me to death to think of it."" She does not like slavery. However, she does not like to be touched or come close to any black person as a human being. When she first saw Eva ""...shaking hands and kissing"" with the blacks, she declared that it had ""...fairly turned her stomach (made her feel sick)."" She adds, ""I want to be kind to everybody, and I wouldn't have anything hurt; but as to kissing...How can she?"""
"She has a ""clear, strong, active mind"", and is very practical. However, she has a warm heart, which she shows in her love for St. Clare and Eva. Ophelia hates slavery, but has a deep prejudice against blacks. St. Clare, as a challenge to her, buys Topsy. He tells her to try educating her. At first she tries to teach and help Topsy simply because of duty. However, Stowe says that duty is not enough: there must be love. Eva's death changes Ophelia. When Topsy cries, """"She"" said she ""loved"" me...there an't (is not) ""nobody"" left now...!"" Ophelia gently says, as ""honest tears"" fell down her face, ""Topsy, you poor child...""I"" can love you, though I am not like that dear little child. I hope I've learnt something of the love of Christ from her. I can love you...and I'll try to help you to grow up a good Christian girl."" Stowe thought that there were many people like Miss Ophelia St. Clare, who did not like slavery but could not think of blacks as people. She wanted to write about such problems through Miss Ophelia."
Important themes.
His government was able to raise more money because they stopped paying money to the Roman Catholic Church and because they closed down the monasteries. But he also spent far more money on his own enjoyment and on wars with France and Scotland. These wars did not achieve much. He made the Royal Navy much bigger and made other improvements to the armed forces.
"Early in his reign he was seen as a very handsome young man who had studied a lot and enjoyed sports, music and writing. Later in his reign he became weak, ill and hugely obese. He also became unpredictable, bad-tempered and unable to admit to making mistakes. He died at the age of 55 in 1547. The next king was his son Edward VI."
Early life.
"Henry was born at Greenwich Palace on 28 June 1491, and was the son of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York. He was one of their seven children. Four of them survived infancy  – Arthur, Prince of Wales; Margaret; Henry; and Mary ."
"He had his own servants and minstrels, including a fool named John Goose. He even had a whipping boy who was punished for Henry when he did something wrong. Prince Henry enjoyed music and jousting was very good at both of them. At the age of 10, he could play many instruments, including the fife, harp, viola and drums. Henry was a scholar, linguist, musician and athlete at his early age. He could speak fluent Latin, French and Spanish. He had the best tutors and he also had to learn jousting, archery, hunting and other military arts. Henry was very religious."
"Henry's older brother Arthur was the heir to the throne. This means he would have become the king when Henry VII died. Arthur married a Spanish princess, Catherine of Aragon (her name in Spanish was Catalina de Aragon). Prince Arthur died a few months later. He was 15 years old, and Henry was 10 years old. After his brother died, Henry was the heir to the throne."
"While his father was alive he was watched closely, because the King feared for the safety of his only remaining male heir. Henry could go out only through a private door, and then he was watched by specially appointed people. No one could speak to Henry. He spent most of his time in his room, which could only be entered through his father’s bedroom. Henry never spoke in public, unless it was to answer a question from his father. He kept his enthusiastic personality under control on public occasions because he feared his father's temper. He was given little training for his future role as King by his father and relied heavily on his counselors in the early years of his reign. In 1509, Henry VII died of tuberculosis as well and his son became King Henry VIII. He was 17 years old."
Reign.
Early years.
"Three months after becoming king, Henry married Catherine of Aragon. They tried to have children, as Henry wanted a son who could be the next king. In 1511, she gave birth to a son who they named Henry, but he died seven weeks later. She later gave birth to a girl, the future Queen Mary I. All her other children were stillborn (died before birth). He did have one son (Henry Fitzroy) through a woman he was not married to. This son could not become king."
"Early on, Henry had two of his father's advisors executed. They were not popular and Henry claimed they had been stealing from the money they had been looking after. Henry would often execute anyone he did not like during the rest of his reign. From 1514, Thomas Wolsey became an important advisor to Henry. Wolsey helped Henry change the government to give the king more power. Wolsey later became a cardinal, making him an important figure in the church."
"At first, Henry wanted to be friends with the King of France. But soon, he instead joined with Spain, the Pope and the Holy Roman Empire to weaken France. He dreamed of gaining more lands in France. The results were mixed: England won some battles against France in 1513. The alliance weakened France`s power over the Pope. Scotland invaded England in 1514 but lost badly at the Battle of the Flodden. But Henry spent a lot of money and did not gain much land."
"In 1520, an event named; 'The Field of the Cloth of Gold', took place in Calais (at the time, the city was part of England rather than France). It was held to celebrate peace between France and England because they had been at war for a long time. Loads of money was spent on it. People enjoyed music, dancing, food, wine and culture for two-and-a-half weeks. Henry famously wrestled King Francis I of France and lost. Despite this, England and France were soon fighting again. After they signed a treaty in 1525, there was less fighting."
Split with Rome.
"The most important event that happened in England when Henry was the king was the country's change in religion. At first, there was no sign that Henry would do this. Eight years into Henry's reign, the Protestant Reformation began in Germany. Until then, all of Western Europe had been part of the Roman Catholic Church. When the Reformation began, some countries broke away from the Roman Catholic Church to form Protestant churches. At first, Henry was against this. The Reformation did not spread to England straight away. But by the 1530s, there were many powerful people in England who liked the idea of the Reformation."
"Henry became desperate to have a son. By 1527, Henry was wanting to divorce Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn. The Roman Catholic Church said he could not divorce without asking the Pope. Henry asked the Pope, but the Pope would not do this. The Pope said it went against the teachings of the church. Henry blamed Wolsey for failing to change the Pope's mind. He sacked Wolsey and ordered him to be put on trial, though Wolsey died before the trial could happen. After that, Thomas More became his main advisor. But More opposed the divorce, so he was replaced a few years later by Thomas Cromwell. Henry also chose a man called Thomas Cranmer to be the Archbishop of Canterbury. Henry knew that Cranmer would do what he wanted, and Cranmer agreed that Henry could have a divorce from Catherine. The Pope did not know this, so he let Cranmer become the archbishop."
"A powerful ruler might have forced the Pope to change his mind, but the most powerful rulers would have opposed the divorce. Catherine's nephew was Charles V, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and Catherine came from Spain, the largest Catholic country. In 1534, attempts to reach an agreement over the divorce failed."
"Henry asked Parliament to pass the Act of Supremacy, which meant that the king, not the pope, was the head of the church in England. This created the new Church of England. The Pope was so angry that he excommunicated Henry, meaning Henry was thrown out of the church. Henry then forced all priests and bishops to accept him as the new leader. Anyone who refused was punished. Among those killed were Thomas More and his old teacher John Fisher."
"Henry was not a true Protestant. He wanted the Church of England to be similar to the Roman Catholic Church but under his control. Some Protestants were even executed, including Anne Askew. However, Henry was easily led by people like Thomas Crownell, Thomas Cranmer and Anne Bolyen, who secretly wanted the country to become Protestant. It was not until the reigns of Edward VI and Elizabeth I that the Church of England became fully Protestant."
"Henry and Cromwell thought that monasteries, in which Roman Catholic monks and nuns lived, had more money and land than the monks and nuns needed. Henry forced the monks and nuns to move out of the monasteries. Then Henry gave their money and land to men who supported him. Most of the men who received money and land from the closed monasteries were Protestants. This event was called the dissolution of the monasteries."
Later marriages.
"After his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII married Anne Boleyn, who was younger than Catherine and still able to have children. Henry soon became unhappy with the marriage. He and Anne did not get on well as they had before they married. Anne had many enemies in the government, including Henry's most loyal minister, Thomas Cromwell. Henry was also unhappy that Anne, just like Catherine, only had a daughter and no sons. Henry started looking for another wife."
"In January 1536, Henry fell off a horse while jousting and was badly injured. He took a long time to wake up and his leg was wounded. The wound never properly healed, and he had painful ulcers on his leg for the rest of the his life. This meant it was hard for him to do exercise, so after this he started to become obese. The head injury may have also caused him to become more bad-tempered."
"Later that year, Cromwell helped Henry to find a way to get rid of Anne, by finding people who said that she had been the lover of several other men. Anne was put on trial and found guilty, and she was executed by having her head chopped off by a French swordsman."
"Henry's third wife was Jane Seymour. She soon gave birth to a son called Edward. Although this made Henry very happy, a few days later Jane died. Henry had loved her very much and he never got over his sadness at her death. He lost interest in everything, and became bigger in size. He became angry with Thomas Cromwell when Cromwell suggested that he should get married again after Jane's death."
"After a while, Henry changed his mind. As he still only had one son, he realised that it might be a good idea to marry again, and he agreed to marry Anne of Cleves, a German princess. When Anne arrived, Henry did not think she was as pretty as she looked in the pictures he had seen, and he was not satisfied with her. Anne was also unhappy and agreed to be divorced from Henry after only a few months. Cromwell had helped arrange the marriage. Henry was angry with Cromwell and had him executed."
"In the meantime, Henry had noticed a young lady at court, called Catherine Howard, and thought that she might make a good wife. Catherine Howard was a cousin of Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn. Henry and Catherine got married in 1540, but Catherine was much younger than Henry and she soon got tired of him and started to flirt with other men. After they had been married for just over a year, Henry found out that Catherine had been having an affair with someone else. She was found guilty of treason and was executed, just like Anne Boleyn had been a few years before."
"Henry's sixth and last wife was called Catherine Parr. She was a woman in her thirties who had already been married twice. Her first two husbands had been much older than she was, and both had died. Henry thought that she would be more sensible and faithful than his other wives, and he turned out to be right. Catherine Parr stayed married to Henry for over three years until he died, but they did not have any children."
"After divorcing Catherine of Aragon, Henry began to suffer many different ailments, he never again regained health. He died on 28 January 1547 at the age of 55 and was buried in Windsor Castle. Henry was the father of two queens and one king. They were Mary I of England, Elizabeth I of England, and Edward VI of England. None of them had any children of their own."
"In 1536, the Act of Union was passed under Henry's rule which had a long-lasting effect on Wales as a nation. The Act of Union meant that Welsh people were forced to speak English and things such as road signs were translated into English. The royal family, who were based in London, were now officially in charge of Wales. However, the Act also meant that Welsh citizens were given the same legal rights as the English so there was an upside to this new law."
Personality.
Henry often liked to be captured in his portraits with either food or pets. He had many pets. Henry was often seen with his dog. He owned a white pug and was very aware of how much his dog represented him as a wealthy man.
"To do this, we use the following lemma: if a prime number ""p"" divides a product ""ab"", then it divides ""a"" or it divides ""b"" (Euclid's lemma)."
"First we now prove this lemma. Well, assume now that ""p"" does not divide ""a"". Then ""p"" and ""a"" are coprime and we have that says that there must be integers ""x"" and ""y"" such that"
"Multiplying everything with ""b"" gives"
"Remember that ""ab"" could be divided by ""p"". So now, on the left-hand side we have two terms that are divisible by ""p"". So the term on the right-hand side is also divisible by ""p"". We have now proven that if ""p"" does not divide ""a"", it must divide ""b"". That proves the lemma."
"Now we will prove that we can write an integer greater than 1 in ""only one"" way as a product of prime numbers. Take two products of primes ""A"" and ""B"" which have the same outcome. So we know for the outcome of the products that ""A"" = ""B"". Take any prime ""p"" from the first product ""A"". It divides the ""A"", so it also divides ""B"". Using several times the lemma that we just proved, we can see that ""p"" must then divide at least one factor ""b"" of ""B"". But the factors are all primes themselves, so also ""b"" is prime. But we know that ""p"" is also prime, so ""p"" must be equal to ""b"". So now we divide ""A"" by ""p"" and also divide ""B"" by ""p"". And we get a result like ""A*"" = ""B*"". Again we can take a prime ""p"" from the first product ""A*"" and find out that is equal to some number in the product ""B*"". Continuing in this way, at the end we see that the prime factors of the two products must be exactly the same. This proves that we can write a positive integer as a product of primes in only one unique way."
A Portuguesa
"""A Portuguesa"" ), meaning ""Song of the Portuguese"" ( 'The Portuguese [Song]') is the national anthem of Portugal, adopted in 1911. It was composed by Alfredo Keil, and its lyrics (words) were written by Henrique Lopes de Mendonça in response to the British Ultimatum for Portuguese troops to get rid of their positions in Africa between the (now former) colonies of Mozambique and Angola in the (also known as the Pink Map)."
Welding
"Welding is a way of heating pieces of metal using electricity or a flame so that they melt and stick together. There are many kinds of welding, including arc welding, resistance welding, and gas welding. The most common type is arc welding. Anyone who is near arc welding needs to wear a special helmet or goggles because the arc is so bright. Looking at the arc without visual protection may cause permanent eye damage. It is also important to cover all your skin because it can give you something like a sunburn. Hot sparks from the weld can burn any skin that is showing. One kind of welding that does not use an arc is Oxy-fuel welding (OFW), sometimes called gas welding. OFW uses a flame to heat up the metal. There are other kinds of welding that do not use an arc."
Arc Welding.
Any welding process that utilizes an electric arc is known as arc welding. The common forms of arc welding include:
Arc welding heats metals by making a high-current electric arc between pieces of metal to be joined and an electrode.
"Use of the electrode varies based on the type of welding process. In SMAW, GMAW, and related welding processes, the electrode is consumed and becomes part of the weld. The electrode is usually made of the same kind of metal to be welded. Because the electrode is consumed by the welding process, the electrode must constantly be fed into the weld. The SMAW welding process features a ""stick"" electrode impregnated with a weld promoter known as flux, clamped to the end."
"The GMAW welding process uses a thin wire on a rotating spool, as a continuous electrode. The size of this electrode varies from around 0.635 millimeters to about 4 millimeters. The welding machine has a motor-driven spool inside that feeds the wire electrode into the weld."
"The TIG welding (GTAW) process features an electrode that is not consumed by the welding process as the metal that makes up the weld does not have any electricity flowing through it. The electrode is made of Tungsten, so used as it will not melt while immersed in the electrical arc. A filler metal, in the form of a rod, can be used to add metal to the weld area."
Almost all welding uses filler metal to fill in the small gap between the metal pieces. The extra metal helps to make the weld strong. Sometimes welds need to be made without any filler metal. Welding with no filler metal is called autogenous welding.
Shielding in arc welding.
"All types of welding require that the hot metal have protection. Dirt, rust, grease, and even the oxidation of the metal under the weld process can prevent a proper weld joint. As such all weld processes use one of two protection methods: flux, and shielding gas."
"Welding flux may be used in a solid, liquid, or paste form. During welding, the flux will melt and some of it will evaporate. This creates a small pocket of gas around the weld. This pocket of gas prevents oxidation of the metal under weld. Melted flux, through a corrosive reaction, cleans contaminants that prevent a proper weld. After welding, the flux solidifies. This layer of solid flux is called slag, and must be removed from the weld. The SMAW weld process most commonly uses flux, and is most commonly used on steel."
"Shielding gas protects the weld by being a pocket of gas around the weld. The purpose of this gas is to keep normal air out, especially oxygen. It is different from flux because there is no liquid on the weld. There is only a gas around the weld. Because there is no liquid, it will not clean up dirt and other things on the metal. This means that the metal has to be clean before it is welded. If it is not, the dirt and other things could cause problems. The gases that are usually used are argon, helium, and a mixture that is 3 parts argon and one part carbon dioxide. Other mixtures of gases can have nitrogen, hydrogen, or even a little bit of oxygen in them. One kind of welding that uses shielding gas is gas metal arc welding. It is usually used in factories to make things."
"Welding that uses flux is easier to do outside when it is windy. This is because the liquid flux is protecting the hot metal and it will not blow away. Also, the flux is always making the pocket of gas which keeps the electric arc from going out. Welding that uses shielding gas usually cannot be used outside because the gas would blow away if there were any wind."
Other kinds of welding.
"Some kinds of welding do not use an electric arc. They might use a flame, electricity without an arc, an energy beam, or physical force. The most common type of welding that does not use an arc is called gas welding. In gas welding, a flammable(meaning it will burn) gas and oxygen are combined and burn at the end of a torch. Gas welding does not need any special shielding because a flame which is adjusted right has no extra oxygen in it. It is still important to make sure the metal is clean. The flame heats up the metal so much that it melts. When both the pieces of metal are melted at the edge, the liquid metal becomes one piece."
"The other kind of welding that does not use an arc still uses electricity. It is called resistance welding. With this kind, two pieces of thin metal are pinched together and then electricity is made to go through them. This makes the metal get really hot and melt where it is pinched together. The two pieces melt together at that place. Sometimes this is called spot welding because the welding can only happen at one small place(or spot) at a time."
Forge welding is the first kind of welding that ever was used. Forge welding needs the two pieces of metal to so hot that they almost melt. Then they are beat together with hammers until they are one piece.
"The other kinds of welding that do not use an arc are hard to do, and usually new. They are expensive too. Most of these kinds of welding are only done where specially needed. They might use an electron beam, laser, or ultrasonic sound waves."
Energy for welding.
"Every kind of welding needs to use energy. This energy is usually heat, but sometimes force is used to make a weld. When heat is used, it can be from electricity or from fire."
Power supplies for arc welding.
"A lot of electricity is used in arc welding. Some kinds of welding use alternating current like the electricity that buildings use. Other kinds use direct current like the electricity in a car or most things with a battery. Almost all kinds of welding use a lower voltage than the electricity that comes from a power plant. Arc welding requires using a special power supply that makes the electricity from the power plant usable for welding. A power supply lowers the voltage and controls the amount of current. The power supply usually has controls on it that allow these things to be changed. For kinds of arc welding that use alternating current, sometimes the power supply can do special things to make the electricity alternate differently. Some power supplies do not plug into a power plug, but instead generate their own electricity. These kind of power supplies have an engine that turns a generator head to make the electricity. The engine might run on gasoline, diesel fuel, or propane."
"Cats have anatomy similar to the other members of the genus ""Felis"". The genus has extra lumbar (lower back) and thoracic (chest) vertebrae. This helps to explain the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones. These allow cats to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their heads."
"The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful and specialized jaw. Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth: this is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents. Cats, like dogs, walk directly on their toes, with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg."
"Cats walk very precisely. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a ""pacing"" gait (walking style); that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with camels and giraffes. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait will change to be a ""diagonal"" gait, similar to that of most other mammals: the diagonally opposite hind and forelegs will move at the same time. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. On the inside of the front paws there is something which looks like a sixth ""finger"". This special feature on the inside of the wrists is the carpal pad. The carpal pad is also found on other cats and on dogs."
Behaviour.
"Cats are active carnivores, meaning that in the wild they hunt live prey. Their main prey is small mammals (like mice). They will also stalk, and sometimes kill and eat, birds. Cats eat a wide variety of prey, including insects such as flies and grasshoppers. Their main method of hunting is ""stalk and pounce"". While dogs have great stamina and will chase prey over long distances, cats are extremely fast, but only over short distances."
"The basic cat coat colouring, tabby (see top photo), gives it good camouflage in grass and woodland. The cat creeps towards a chosen victim, keeping its body flat and near to the ground so that it cannot be seen easily, until it is close enough for a rapid dash or pounce. Cats, especially kittens, practice these instinctive behaviours in play with each other or on small toys. Cats can fish. They use a flip-up movement of a front paw which, when successful, flips the fish out of water and over the cat's shoulders onto the grass. Dutch research showed this to be an innate (inherited) behaviour pattern which developed early and without maternal teaching."
"Cats are quiet and well-behaved animals, making them popular pets. Young kittens are playful. They can easily entertain themselves with a variety of store-bought or homemade toys. House cats have also been known to teach themselves to use lever-type doorknobs and toilet handles."
Cats are fairly independent animals. They can look after themselves and do not need as much attention as dogs do.
"Cats use many different sounds for communication, including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, squeaking, chirping, clicking and grunting."
"Body posture is also important. The whole shape of the body changes when a cat is relaxed, or when it is alert. Also, the position of their ears and tail are used for communication, as well as their usual functions."
"These ways of communication are very important. They are used between a mother cat and her kittens. They are also used between male and female cats; and between cats and other species, such as dogs. A mother cat protecting her kittens will fight off the largest dog. She gives good warning with a frightening display, hissing furiously, showing her claws, arching her back, and making her hair stand on end. If that fails, she attacks the dog's face with her claws. It has been said that no dog ever tries such an attack a second time."
Mating.
"Cats only mate when the queen is ""in heat"". Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last 4 to 6 days. Mating in cats is a spectacular event. Several toms may be attracted to a [queen] in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female will reject the male, but eventually the female will allow the male to mate. The female will utter a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her. This is because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120-150 backwards-pointing spines, which are about one millimeter long. When the penis is withdrawn, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which is a trigger for ovulation. After mating, the female will wash her vulva thoroughly. If a male attempts to breed with her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes. once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat."
"Because ovulation is not always triggered, females may not get pregnant by the first tom which mates with them. A queen may mate with more than one tom when she is in heat, and different kittens in a litter may have different fathers. The cycle ceases when the queen is pregnant."
"The gestation period for cats is about two months, with an average length of 66 days. The size of a ""litter"" is usually three to five kittens. Kittens are ""weaned"" at between six and seven weeks, and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months (females) and to 5–7 months (males). Females can have two to three litters per year, so might produce up to 150 kittens in their breeding life of about ten years."
Birth and after.
"Pregnant queens deliver their litters by themselves, guided by instinct. The queen finds the safest place she can. Then she will clean it thoroughly, with her tongue, if necessary. Here she will quietly give birth. She licks the newborn kits clean. In the wild, leaving a scent is risking a dangerous encounter with other animals. The kits are born blind and with closed eyes. They ""suckle"" on her teats, and sleep a good deal. After two weeks or so, their eyes open. At that stage they have blue eyes, but not the best sight. A bit later, the best developed kit will totter out of the nest. The others follow. They will soon recognise you as a living thing: that is a great moment. At first, they go back to the nest to feed and sleep. After some more days they leave the nest for good, but still they may sleep together in a 'kitten heap'."
"The queen, meanwhile, has left the nest from time to time, to hunt, feed, and also to urinate and defecate. Unlike the tom, she covers up her business to hide her scent. Very soon, the kits will urinate anywhere they please unless one trains them. This is done after they are weaned, when they are ready for some kitten food. Here is how to do it:"
"What you have done is exactly what the queen would do in the wild. You have triggered a reflex which all kittens have. The thing is, the tray is artificial, and your queen may do her business outside. But at least when young, kittens need a tray. Your next job is to call the vet, who will tell you when to bring the kits for their vaccination."
"Kittens play endlessly. It is how they do their learning. They will play their favourite games, such as 'hide and pounce', with almost anyone or anything. Soft balls on strings are a standard toy; so is a scratching post."
"With cats there is a limit to how far you can train them. They are at least as intelligent as dogs, but they are not pack animals. They like to do their own thing, and owners do best by fitting in. ""Never hit a cat"": if you do, the relationship will never be the same again. If you really want to dissuade them, try hissing. It has been said that no one really owns a cat; many cats collect extra owners, and may change house if they do not like the treatment..."
"If your kitten was born in your home do not let it out of the house until it is two to three months old. If you have the mother, she will look after the kit. But if you have got the kit from a vet or dealer, keep it in for several weeks. When it does go out, you need to watch over it. The main problem is that it may easily get lost. In time, the kit will learn every inch of the house and garden. Then, you can happily let it roam."
Grooming.
"Cats are very clean animals. They groom themselves by licking their fur. The cat's tongue can act as a hairbrush and can clean and untangle a cat's fur. Still, owners may buy grooming products to help the cat take care of itself. After licking their fur, cats sometimes get hairballs. A hairball is a small amount of fur that is vomited up by animals when it becomes too big. This is quite normal. Owners brush their cats to try to prevent a lot of hairballs."
Food.
"Many house cats eat food which their owners give them. This food is manufactured, and designed to contain the right nutrients for cats. There are many different types of cat food. These come in many different flavors and costs are often very small."
"There is moist canned food and also dry cat food which comes in different sized cans or bags and formulas. There are kitten formulas, cat formulas, health formulas, formulas for reducing a cat's weight, and many others. It seems obvious that the food should be mostly meat, as that is most of a cat's natural diet. But remember, when they catch mice, they also eat the bones. So there is need for formulas to have more than just meat."
"Cats should not be fed a daily diet of dog food. It could make the cat blind, as it has no taurine, which is a nutrient for the eyes."
Health concerns.
"Cats do get diseases, and prevention is better than cure. It is most important to get a young cat vaccinated against some of the most deadly diseases. If a cat gets a disease, a veterinarian (animal doctor) can offer help. Some cats, depending on breed, gender, age, and general health, may be more susceptible to disease than others. Regular visits to a vet can keep a cat alive many extra years by catching sickness and disease early."
"Cats that roam outside will get fleas at some time. Cat fleas will not live on people, but fleas will not hesitate to bite anyone nearby. Owners may choose to buy anti-flea collars, but any areas where the cat normally sleeps need to be cleaned up. A vet or local pet-shop may offer advice about fleas. It is recommended that people quickly take action when a cat gets fleas because fleas can make cats uncomfortable."
"House cats can become ""overweight"" through lack of exercise and over-feeding because people don't watch them. When they get ""spayed"" or neutered (""fixed""), they tend to exercise less. Spaying is done for queens, and neutering is done for toms. It is important to fix cats, and here are some reasons. First of all, if a female cat has kittens, they will need homes. Finding homes for kittens is often quite difficult. If a tom is not fixed, it develops a disgusting smell. Breeders who have entire toms keep them in a special hut outside the house, for that reason. Fixing also helps to avoid over-population. Over-population means that there are too many cats, and some will be put to sleep (put down) in animal pounds (animal shelters)."

"yeah,"
"just,"
"But, that is God's country,"
it has to be.
Yeah.
Yeah.

We're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"and you just need to take the little one. Show them all the, all the pretties before they go away."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
Yeah.
They seem to be trailing out quickly.
Yeah
because there is lots to see
"Okay,"
I'm back on.
Okay.
"Um, you say you watch evenings mostly?"
I watch evenings because I work all day.
I used to watch daytimes.
Uh-huh.
"Um, mainly like ALL MY CHILDREN, that kind of thing."
"Oh, so ..."
"And then sometimes OPRAH and sometimes DONAHUE,"
but now it's mainly evenings.
Do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there?
Yes.
Which ones?
"I tape THIRTY SOMETHING, and L A LAW."
Oh.
Those are the two I like the best.
"Oh, two they're going to change."
"Well, one they're taking,   off."
I know.
"It's going to be history, I know."
I don't know what's going to
"yeah,"
we like L A LAW.
Uh-huh.
"We don't watch THIRTY SOMETHING,"
but that's kind of young for us.
My husband and I are grandparents.
"Oh, well. Well ..."
"So we don't watch, uh, that type of show,"
but we like L A LAW.
"We like, that."
"Uh, audiology."
Okay.
Fantastic. Uh
Yeah.
What do you do?
I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida.
"Oh, really."
"Yeah,"
I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell.
Oh really?
"Uh, yeah."
Neat.
"But, uh, I don't know."
"It's, it's an interesting issue."
"There's, like you say, in Texas there's been quite a few"
"and, and in Florida in the last few years, I think there's been a lot."
"I can't, I, you know, I can't give you figures"
"but, uh,"
Yeah.
"I just,"
this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California.
Uh-huh.
"So, I think it,"
the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is what
"Oh, is that right?"
they gave a run down that Texas Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then .
Okay.
"Yeah,"
"I, I kind of,"
"yeah, I've heard things about that."
I've heard that they don't mess around very much.
Yeah.
"so,"
"Yeah,"
right.
And I like the FRUGAL GOURMET.
"Oh, I do, too"
"Oh, I do, too,"
"but I just seem to, to miss a lot of these programs."
I don't know why.
"I just,"
"if I can catch them, I do. Or if I remember."
"Well, there's very few that, you know, my life would stop if I didn't catch."
"But, uh, now I do,"
"before I go to work, I tape my soap opera."
"Oh, yeah."
I watch one
"and,"
"Well, I watch two,"
but one's a half-hour
and one's an hour
"and, and they lead into each other."
Oh.
And that's the BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and AS THE WORLD TURNS.
"Oh, okay."
"And I've watched the, AS THE WORLD TURNS since I was a little girl"
"Yeah,"
that's been on for years.
"So it's just, you know,"
"it's, it's, something I've done for the last probably twenty-five years."
"Oh, and so you get to come home and watch them"
"Yes,"
"and I don't have anyone else at home,"
so I have freedom to watch whatever I want.
Yeah.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"But I like, I like every, I like the, uh, the information shows"
and I like the comedies
"and you know, and I, I do like good movies."
Uh-huh.
"I prescribed, subscribe to H B O."
Yeah
"well, we,"
So I can get some of the movies.
"Yeah,"
that's a good idea.
"We did have H B O,"
"but it, we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious, you know."
It is.
"It's just,"
But I don't sleep a whole lot
"and I, you know,"
"at two o'clock in the morning, there isn't anything on regular T V"
"and,"
Oh.
"Oh, yes,"
if you're up then
and you don't get good reception without cable
"and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels,"
Yeah.
Right.
so that's primarily why I have it right now.
Right.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well, course, see, I listen to K V I L for the contests."
I mean
"Oh, yeah,"
"got the bumper sticker, too?"
"Oh, yes,"
"oh, yes."
You can't drive a car without bumper sticker
and you know they're going to call you up.
Someday.
Yeah
"Well, listen, I've enjoyed talking."
"I, I'm sure that the switchboard will probably give us that sign off message very shortly anyway."
Okay.
I appreciate it.
Okay.
Catch you later.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay
Okay
Have you done this very long?
"Uh, well, yeah,"
"for the last, uh, couple of months."
"Yeah,"
that's the same with us.
Yeah.
"Well, what kind of car would you buy?"
"Well, it's kind of hard to say,"
"uh, because I don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years."
"We just bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eighty-nine"
"Oh, okay."
"and, uh,"
Right.
"So if ever wanted, you know, pursue anything more than your nursing degree, that, that'd be the place to do it."
"Yeah,"
"my brother-in-law, um, is in the medical profession, I mean, he's at medical school in San Antonio right now."
"Oh, great."
So.
Great.
Yeah.
"Well, like I said, good luck to you."
Thanks.
"All right,"
"well, um, take care,"

All right.
Okay.
Bye-bye.

Yeah.
But I don't know.
I think people that treat their baby-sitters like that get a lot better baby-sitters.
"Oh, yeah."
That's true.
And they stick around for longer.
"Because I mean after I figured out I was getting eighty cents an hour, I said bag it."
And I quit you know.
Yeah.
I was just like but I'm wasting my time.
Yeah.
I really liked the little girl and everything
but I thought ...
"She does take up,"
and they do take up a lot of your time.
That ...
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I ...
They're very demanding
Uh-huh.
"Well, and she was really spoiled."
They didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything.
"So, basically, they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch."
And the mom was a dentist
and then it doesn't sell
and then the bank's  holding the bag.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well.
Huh.
"As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?"
That's right
Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple."
It's designed to be added on to.
Uh-huh.
That's good.
Yeah.
"Well, I figure it's just me and my wife"
"but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,"
so I want  to have a shop.
Yeah.
How big a lot do you got it on?
Ten acres.
Wow.
That's nice.
That's real nice.
"Well, yeah."
It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor.
He's on the other side of a hill.
Oh.
And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.
Seriously.
God.
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
"Now I never knew they were that, that big, huh,"
I won't have anything to do with.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
"Well, it was nice talking to you."
"Well, it certainly was, uh,"
"Maybe you can get,"
"how many,"
have you had very many of these calls?
"Uh, yeah,"
almost ever day.
How wonderful.
Yeah.
"Almost, almost ever single day from when they started it."
Yeah.
Maybe I'll just be so lucky.
"Okay,"
I enjoyed talking to you.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
"Phil, I guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work, or do you like to do it?"
"Yeah,"
"well, I, um,"
"about, or just over a year ago I bought my own house,"
"so this has been the first opportunity I've had to, uh, be working on my own lawn and garden,"
"and, uh, you know, when, back when I was a kid, you know, mom would send me out to weed the garden."
"I, I'd hate it, you know."
"I, I've used that quite a bit"
"and it, and it seems to work real well."
Uh-huh.
"Uh,"
Um.
"And, uh, uh, when I've had so many people, uh, to feed, like I try to do a ham and a turkey"
"and and,"
"Yeah,"
"that's my, that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time."
Yeah.
"You know, I've, uh, I had an open house party here once when, after we moved in here, uh, which I had things like that,"
but I always cooked them ahead of time
"and then I just sliced them. You know, and had macaroni salad with, uh, shrimp in it."
Uh-huh.
Have you ever had that?
No.
"What,"
"Put some fresh, little fresh shrimp"
"and it's, in your macaroni salad that you make."
Uh-huh.
The shrimp just gives it a really good flavor.
"Oh, I'll bet."
"Yeah,"
"I don't like the can, but the fresh."
Yeah.
You know.
I'll have to try that.
"Yeah,"
that was really good.
"I like things that are easy and, and, uh, nutritious."
"Yeah,"
"right,"
"but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know,"
"and then I,"
"And your time,"
then you're that much farther ahead
Yeah.
"Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons."
It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.
Right.
I've seen them
"and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in"
"and,"
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
That's neat.
"I went there,"
we have Home Depot out here.
I don't know if you've heard of it.
I went
and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.
Yes.
We have one.
I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath
and cutting that wedge out was no joke
Huh.
"Oh, I'm, I'm sure."
"We did it on a, I had a, uh, I did it through Adult Ed again."
A band saw?
What?
I did it through Adult Ed again.
Uh-huh.
"And the teacher was one of these negative people,"
"oh that's dangerous,"
"I guess, he's a big help out in your garden."
Right.
He likes to dig around a little bit.
"His mother comes in and says, why did you let him play in the dirt,"
I guess he's enjoying himself.
That's right.
"It's healthy,"
why not.
Yeah.
"He was eating the dirt,"
I wouldn't worry about it.
No.
It won't hurt them.
"I was a big dirt eater, supposedly, when I was a child"
and I turned out okay
"so, don't worry about it."
Just let him enjoy himself
"So you think that you want to move away from the big city, uh?"
"Well, that's what I've always,"
I was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people.
Yeah.
So you're just the opposite from me.
"You want to go back to that, uh,"
"After we got married we moved, ended up moving to the Houston area."
Yeah.
Yeah.
So are you from Texas?
Yeah.
You are.
"So it's not, you know,"
that's true
"Houston, in itself, is a pretty tough place."
Yeah.
"I'm  you know, I, I just, uh, I would,"
"And, uh,"
"I, I, I'm not a morning person"
so I would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news.
"I get up just barely in time to get up, get ready and get off to work"
and then at work  I have no time to read the news.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
right.
"Once you get to work, I wouldn't either,"
huh-uh.
No
"But I've always been a morning person to get up, you know."
Uh-huh.
but I can't stay up late at night to watch the late news
so I guess that's why I watch it at five o'clock
Yeah.
"But anyhow. Well, listen, I guess that's about it then."
Okay.
It's been nice talking to you Tony.
Nice talking to you.
I'll probably talk to you again.
I had a friend who was in this
and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
"Oh, well that hasn't happened to me yet."
"So, you never know,"
it might this time.
That's right.
"Okay, Tony."
You too.
"Uh-huh,"
thanks.
Bye-bye.
Bye now.
Okay.
"What kind of pet do you have, Gail?"
"Well, I don't."
I have children
"Oh, you have children"
I have little children.
"Both of my kids are under two so right now we don't have pets,"
but we've had lots of them in the past.
Have you?
Uh-huh.
"Uh, what have you had?"
"Well, we had a dog before we moved here."
"Uh, and we couldn't bring her with us."
"We came from Colorado,"
and we've had hamsters and fish and birds.
Oh.
"Okay,"
"I've ,"
"Well, you're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up."
Uh-huh.
"Well, we had a, a Schnauzer that we lost this summer,"
and he was fourteen years old.
"And, uh, we've had two Schnauzers"
"and before that we had all Dachshunds,"
"and I think my husband wants another Dachshund,"
and we're trying to debate because our children are grown
"and, and, uh, I don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a you know, another dog."
"It's usually friends from church and stuff,"
Yeah.
"and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say well what can we bring."
Yeah.
And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things
and everybody else brings something.
"That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it,"
yeah.
"Oh yeah,"
yeah.
Uh.
It's a lot more relaxing.
"I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to you know, put on this really fancy dinner for someone."
Well you see all that on T V
and I could never be that person.
Huh-uh.
"It just, uh, I'm just not,"
"well I'm so, I'm pretty laid back."
Yeah
"And, uh, you know, so I don't, I know a lady in a, my church"
"and, uh, she like does her own bread and does her own stuff"
"and so when she, um, does food, she really goes all out"
and I don't know how she can do it and be calm
Yeah
"I guess,"
Do you work?
"No,"
I don't.
Do you stay home with kids?
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty good.
"Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy"
"but, you know, he's"
Uh-huh.
"I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, uh,"
"Oh, that's pretty good."
Yeah.
"Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?"
"Well, it's got a, a very small furnace."
Uh-huh.
"And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well."
Yeah.
"But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, these many months"
Uh-huh.
and I have not had to use the heat.
Wow.
Because it's all geothermal.
Yeah.
That's pretty good.
"And with all the,"
"see I've got,"
on the south side is all glass.
"Well, as much as I could get in it, you know. And, uh, the east side is glass."
Yeah.
"I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet."
So it's almost all glass.
Wow.
"And, uh,"
My wife would love that
"Oh, yeah."
"I mean, you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows."
She loves lots of windows.
That's great.
"So, uh,"
Is it a single story?
"Well, not really."
"It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill."
"Oh, I see."
"So the first, you know,"
"the, the, the,"
what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I see."
"And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high."
Oh.
So I've got a pretty good grade there.
Yeah.
"And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?"
Exactly.
Yeah.
"I, I've always liked that."
"The,"
"you know, I, we don't have much yard"
but I built a small deck in the back.
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck."
Oh.
which my son goes hunting.
He goes deer hunting.
He goes duck hunting.
"Uh, he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And I just think that, uh, as far as that's concerned, he should be able to have them to go hunting with, you know."
"As far as  just having handguns around to, to have them, I don't believe that you should have handguns around."
"Right,"
right.
Right.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
I agree too.
"I, uh,"
"it's, it's, as far as the ban goes and everything, I don't think it's possible, uh, to completely ban guns."
There's just too many.
"Well, no."
"There's too many sports people out there that, that do do these things."
"Right,"
"and I,"
"yeah,"
"right,"
"I mean,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"And I mean the, the technology's not that hard."
"I mean, you could make a gun, you know, from simple, you know, you know."
"Yeah,"
"well I suppose you could. Uh,"
"and she'd gotten all new underwear,"
"and I was like, Laura.  How did you get all this stuff?"
"imitates a woman's ""Well, I just got paid."""
"And, and I was like, oh."
"Had some money in her pocket, yeah."
It was there.
It was burning.
It had to be spent.
"You know, and I'm like"
and she said everything was on sale.
"Oh, oh, that's good,"
at least it was on sale
"That's good honey,"
I'm glad you bought it on sale
What else can you say?
That's right.
I do recommend the for savings bit.
"They, uh, they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt."
Yeah.
"I think,"
Yeah.
You don't notice it.
I think that's probably a really good idea.
"You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone."
Huh-uh.
"Yeah,"
"so, uh, until you really need it"
"and then you realize, you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"see I was,"
"when I had, when I was living alone and I had my own house and things, uh, I put one, I was paid twice a month,"
every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed
and it's changed their perspective.
"And, and that's just the two weeks during, during the summer."
Uh-huh.
"So, if two weeks, uh, could have that kind of effect I would  think, uh,"
"Well, that's, that's great."
"I'm glad that there are still some areas that, that get the youth involved in that sort of thing."
"Well that's,"
"Like I said, I think it does,"
even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference  in their attitudes
Yes.
Well
"Well, I guess, um,"
did you have anything else?
"No,"
no
I guess that's about all.
Okay.
Okay.
"Well, I enjoyed talking with you."
"Well, good talking with you."
And I hope you have a good evening.
You too.
Thanks.
Okay.
"Bye,"
bye.
Bye
Okay.
"Do you, have you ever had to put your children in, child care, Mary Dell?"
Oh yes.
I'm an old experienced hand.
"Uh, probably four or five days."
Uh-huh.
"Well, that is great."
"Well, I hope the weather stays real good for them. And, and, uh, that you have a good visit and everything."
"Well, thank you"
Thanks.
And I hope your garden does good.
Yeah.
And the same to you.
"And, so. Okay."
"Well, it was really nice talking to you."
A pleasure.
"And, uh, good luck in your, this venture."
"It is, uh, like I said,"
it has been real interesting.
So I hope you enjoy it as much as I have been enjoying it
I am sure I will.
"In, in fact, if I had not been preparing for this, the out of town visitors, I probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days."
"Yeah,"
I forget to.
"The day goes by,"
and I forget to make a call usually.
"Well, I am glad you have broken the ice with me because now, I will, I will start doing it"
"Great,"
great.
Okay.
Okay.
"Well, thanks, Jean."
Uh. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
"Okay,"
"is, uh, that a sport you like to participate in?"
"I've, I've seen it, uh,"
"and, and I have no problem going out in a boat, uh,"
"it's just so dreadfully expensive,"
and there's just so many other ways live down there.
Yeah.
It's not a treat
Uh-huh.
it's what you do every day.
That's right.
You know.
That's right.
"Uh, one of my favorite things was, we were forever catching crab and steaming them you know, out on the, on the beach and you know, just, uh, pitching them out, on, uh, on, uh, what am I trying to say, newspaper and, and, breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them, and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Uh-huh.
"and, and that's it."
Yeah.
"And, uh, but, the other little creatures would take care of what was left."
"That's right,"
"So, going out on a boat, never did appeal to me simply because it, you know, there was so much else to do."
that's right.
Right.
Right.
"Well, do you live like along, uh, Houston, down there?"
"No,"
no.
I live in Dallas.
I lived in Dallas.
"oh, okay."
"But you, uh,"
"Yeah,"
yeah
"And these days that helps, doesn't it?"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah.
It really does.
I know what you mean.
I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it.
Now spaghetti's such an easy one.
"Um, I do that a lot."
Uh-huh.
I do spaghetti a lot.
"Yeah,"
it seems like most people like spaghetti.
"Yeah,"
I don't like to do that if it's real hot though.
Yeah.
"Because, um, I don't know,"
"I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime."
Uh-huh.
I guess.
"Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference, in your whole house."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I think that's right.
"And, um, we don't entertain that often,"
"but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy. And something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Most,"
we don't entertain like people from work or stuff often.
Oh my goodness.
"And with our budget cuts, I'm sure  that's not going to not going to change anytime soon."
Yeah.
"Well that's the only way they're. Yeah, well, that's the only way they're going to be able to do it."
And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that.
Oh my goodness.
"So, in some ways I think the, the day schools do serve those purposes."
Yeah.
That's true.
"Well even the preschools, you know they get so much of that in preschool"
"and then when they hit kindergarten, you know, it's like wham  Culture shock."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's just,"
Put the colors away
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Get the computers out
Which is too bad.
"and, you know."
Uh-huh.
hard.
Uh-huh.
It's so difficult for them.
"Um, did you have your children, did you say in home, in, in, private care,"
was that in your home or in someone else's home?
Until they were two.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
both times they were at our house.
Uh-huh.
So you were able to have somebody come there.
"Are, are you a T I-er?"
"No,"
"no,"
I work there as a temporary.
"Oh, really."
"But, are you at T I?"
Oh yeah.
So you have to do the random drug testing.
"Oh, yeah,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"In fact with me, this is, it's not much to talk about,"
I'm so much for it.
I don't really have much to comment about it.
There've been some interesting subject that they've called about.
"How many times have you called,"
or have you been participating in this?
"Oh, about ten or eleven calls."
"Oh, you got ten,"
"well you, you've passed me up."
Right.
This is about six times.
Oh.
"As contract person we have to do random drug testing, too."
Yeah.
It doesn't bother me.
I don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything.
"No,"
I think it's good.
"In fact, I don't know what the statistics were,"
but I think that they were surprised to find it so low.
"I think they were expecting to find, uh, like the national average at T I."
"If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care."
"I, I, give me cyanide."
"I mean, is it )),"
"Yeah,"
right.
I'll take anything you know.
Uh-huh.
"I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying, you can experiment on me."
"Ri-,"
Exactly.
Go ahead.
"And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, if these people knowingly consent to be, research monkeys and well, let them,"
Exactly.
"let them, do it."
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's what I think they're saying too.
Have you had any snow up your way?
"No,"
"we haven't had any since, uh, oh, just before Christmas"
"and, uh we had a lot before Christmas."
Um.
The ski resorts were really
"and, uh,"
"but, now we have, we've had fog, for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion,"
"so,"
"but no, uh, no snow."
Um.
"The snows all melted off uh,"
"Well, I talked to a woman who lived up in the hills, uh, mountains in, uh, Utah, I guess this last weekend"
"and she had, uh, quite a bit of snow on the ground her way."
"Uh-huh,"
"and I was just like, we've got to quit this."
And she's like no I don't want her to starve.
But I don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat
"Oh, shoot."
"My mom would be like, uh eat it or don't eat anything."
Eat this or <laughter>.
That's right.
"So, I can see the concerns on what different people want."
Yeah.
"Because some,"
"I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Cause some parents won't put up anything. Where others would.
"I think,"
"yeah,"
"I think the best way to go would just be to, to be able to do it out of your basement."
Uh-huh.
"And just have like at the most, like ten kids."
And all from maybe people that you know type of thing.
No.
Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and ...
That's true.
"I, I'd love to do it."
But I just don't trust people now.
There's too many lawsuits.
Yeah.
"I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ..."
More than what it's worth?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It would scare me.
"Yeah,"
I drink beer.
"have you noticed that, um, that a lot of the, um, a lot of ..."
"Yeah,"
whiskey is in liters.
Yes.
"And, and the next,"
"yeah,"
"point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters,"
yeah.
"It's like a fifth, like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange."
Yeah.
What's a fifth of whiskey?
Yeah.
"I, I always wondered about that myself."
It was a marketing ploy.
"And, and they had quarts at the same time though."
Yeah.
"But the idea was, is that by, with five fifths, um, they could, uh, they could, uh, they could sell five"
"and, and, um, it was simply a ploy to, to get people, you know to buy, to buy more for,"
Yeah.
"it's, uh, I find that interesting."
It's ...
"But it's like, you know, the, the, the, the soda and this kind of things coming in one liter bottles"
Liters.
"and, um, I, I think it's kind of generational."
Yeah.
"It, it's, like I say, I work in a machine shop"
"and, uh, everything's still inches."
"Everything's still fractions of inches, or or tenths  or thousandths, or, or ..."
Yeah.
"It's, it's hard to think  though."
I know .
"I mean, jeez if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances  whose to say."
Yeah.
"It,"
there would be much more of that
Yeah
no doubt.
Are you involved in the legal system at all?
No.
"But I .  I tend to follow it just to, just to know what's going on."
Okay.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
I've got some friends that are lawyers
so.
"Yeah,"
I do too
so.
One of them just got his law degree.
"But, uh, to tell you the truth, I'm not real familiar with, uh, the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now."
No.
I really haven't studied it in depth.
Yeah.
"I know a little more about civil cases when, than criminal cases. Which is,"
Yeah.
"it's more in how you present it versus, you know, who's right."
I'm sure of it.
"Because a lot of those things, it's all, it's in, it's largely a matter of viewpoint. And who can argue their case better."
Yep.
"Uh, it's kind of weird."
"I don't know,"
you I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something. And how weird those cases get.
"And, uh, until next time."
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.
"Uh, no"
"I think that maybe the, the automation people that are very discrete. Or not discrete, electronic devices."
"Oh, okay."
Oh.
"So, and, did he, is he the one that got you connected with us?"
Uh-huh.
Okay.
It's a lot of fun.
Yeah.
You want to punch the button and go?
"Sure,"
you ready?
Yip
Okay.
"Well, are you going to buy a car soon?"
"Well, it won't be too much longer because my husband and I are both going to retire."
"And when we retire we're going to buy us, a, you know, a new one and, and get rid of the two that we have right now."
And what are you going to buy?
"I I don't know,"
"we're either going to buy a pick up,"
or we're going to buy a van.
"Or we're going to buy an economy car,"
how do you like that
"Well, have you been listening to Iacocca's arguments that, uh, that Chrysler products are the only ones that, that all have air bags?"
"Uh, yeah."
Does that make a difference to you?
Yeah.
It sure does.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
"I, I read it."
And are we still going to maintain drams for perfume?
Yeah.
"And, and then, but then the medicine."
"And, and some of these other things"
"and, and the chemistry in those kinds of areas,"
milliliter.

= = = Thomas Shorts = = =
"Thomas Dolman Shorts was a Canadian sailor, and one of the early captains on the Okanagan Lake. Shorts started the lakeboat service on Okanagan Lake in the Penticton area."
"""Ruth Shorts"" was Thomas Shorts's first boat. She was named for his mother. ""Ruth Shorts"" was a rowboat that could make a roundtrip from Penticton to Okanagan Landing in nine days. ""Ruth Shorts"" could carry 2.5 tons of cargo as well as a few passengers. Occasionally, the boat would sport a sail if the weather permitted it. Captain Shorts had no schedule; he left when he wanted or when there was enough people to make the trip worthwhile. Shorts would row during the day and when dusk fell he would row ashore and camp on land with his passengers for the night. Captain Shorts would row sixty-five miles per trip."
"In 1884, Shorts owned and operated the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"". She was a steamer that operated on the same route the ""Ruth Shorts"" did. The ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" had the capacity to carry five tons of freight and several passengers. She ran on kerosene. After only a short time in operation, the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" was destroyed by a fire."
"In 1887, Shorts salvaged the engine from the burned ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" and modified it so that it was powered by burning wood, and he installed this engine in his new boat, the ""Jubilee"". The ""Jubilee"" was thirty feet long and could tow a barge. In 1889, only two years after she began operation, she sank."
"In 1890, Shorts partnered with Thomas Ellis to improve the lake service in the Okanagan. Ellis could provide the funds that Shorts needed. Together, they had a new boat ordered. Meanwhile, Shorts took the engine from the ""Jubilee"" and attached it to a scow and called his new creation the ""City of Vernon"". He used the ""City of Vernon"" until the new boat was ready. The new boat, named ""Penticton,"" was a twin screw steamer. After only two years of operation, Shorts and Ellis sold the ""Penticton"" to Leon Lequime of Kelowna for five thousand dollars."
"Shorts had never been big on luxury, so when the Canadian Pacific Railway entered the lake service with the SS ""Aberdeen"", Shorts could not, despite his many efforts, compete with them. Not long after the ""Aberdeen"" was launched Shorts left the lake service. He headed for the Klondike hoping to strike it rich."

Félix Torres Amat or Félix Torres i Amat de Palou (6 August 1772 – 29 December 1849) was a Spanish Bishop. He translated the Sagrada Bible into vernacular Spanish and published a record of leading authors in Catalan.
"Torres Amat was born in Barcelona in 1772 the son of Joseph Torres and Teresa Amat. He studied languages before joining his uncle Felix Amat in Tarragona where he obtained a doctorate in Philosophy. He then taught philosophy, mathematics and theology becoming Canon of the Collegiate Church of San Ildefonso on 5 May 1806."
In 1824 he published a translation of the Bible in vernacular Spanish which had been entrusted to him by the Spanish kings Carlos IV and Fernando VII. This caused some criticism as both he and his father had become associated with Jansenism and he had to retire to a monastery for some time. On 1 May 1834 he was ordained as the Bishop of Astorga and in the following year he met William Harris Rule from Gibraltar as they both shared a common interest in distributing the bible in people's first languages. Torres Amat had had difficulty publishing his translation and he had relied on money from Anglicans in London.
"Torres Amat was elected to the prestigious Real Academia Española where he briefly held the ""T Seat"". Torres Amat's bible known as the Sagrada Bible was published with illustrations by Gustave Doré."
"Apart from the translation of the bible his best known work is ""Reports to help form a critical dictionary of Catalan writers and give some idea of the ancient and modern literature of Catalonia"" This was based on the work of his brother who had been a leading librarian in Barcelona and he had started to record notable Catalan authors."

She compared me with known American writer Edgar Allan Poe. I have heard about this author but never read any of his texts. That's why just next day I found a book with Poe's verses and read there his poem ""The Raven"". I didn't understand some moments, but soon I found my teacher, professor Muhammad Mandur, who translated this poem into Arabic. He, and the other professor, Yusef Khalif, helped me on my way to become a poet in future""."

"William Meschin (sometimes William le Meschin; died between 1130 and 1135) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and baron. The brother of the earl of Chester, Meschin participated in the First Crusade. After returning to England, he acquired lands both from King Henry I of England and by his marriage to an heiress."
"Meschin built Egremont Castle on his lands and with his wife was a benefactor of a couple of religious foundations. He died sometime between 1130 and 1135, with his estates eventually being divided amongst the descendants of his three daughters."
"Meschin was the brother of Ranulf le Meschin, the Earl of Chester. They were the sons of Ranulf de Briquessart, the viscount of the Bessin, and his wife, Matilda, the daughter of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches. The boys were also nephews of Hugh d'Avranches, who was Earl of Chester. There was also an older brother, Richard, who died young, and a sister, who married Robert de Grandmesnil. Meschin went on the First Crusade and was present at the Siege of Nicaea in 1097."
"Meschin was given Gilsland by his brother, in order to protect the approaches to Carlisle. Due to attacks by the Scots, Meschin was unable to hold it. In compensation, King Henry I of England gave him lands around Allerdale in Cumberland, which centred on Egremont. These lands comprised the lordship, or feudal barony of Egremont. Through his wife, he acquired Skipton, and the lordship, or barony of Skipton. Besides these lands, Meschin also was awarded two escheated properties in Leicestershire, some of which had earlier been lands of Roger de Busli. Other properties in Leicestershire were previously held by Durand Malet and William Blund in the ""Domesday Book"". Meschin also held lands in Lincolnshire and Cheshire from his brother."
"Meschin built the original parts of Egremont Castle at Egremont. It was a motte-and-bailey stone castle on the River Ehen. He and his wife also founded the Augustinian priory of Embsay Priory. Katrina Legg argues that Meschin's main motive for the foundation was to show support for a monastic order that enjoyed the patronage of King Henry I. Against this, Legg feels that Meschin's wife's motives were more probably religious, as she was close to Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Another religious foundation of Meschin's was St Bees Priory, a daughter house of St Mary's Abbey, York. St Bees was founded around the same time as Embsay, Embsay was founded between 1120 and 1121, and St Bees was founded sometime after 1120."
"Meschin married Cecily, daughter of Robert de Rumily. They had one son, Ranulf Meschin, and three daughters, Alice, Avice, and Matilda. Another son, Matthew, who was the eldest son, died before his parents."
"Meschin died between 1130 and 1135. His widow married Henry de Tracy, and she died around 1151. Skipton went to Alice, who married William fitzDuncan. Alice and her first husband also acquired Egremont, after the death of her brother Ranulf without heirs. After the death of fitzDuncan, Alice married Alexander fitzGerold. Avice married William de Courcy. Avice married as her second husband William Paynel, son of Ralph Paynel, as his second wife. Before 1153 Avice had married as her third husband Walter, the son of Alan de Percy. Matilda married twice – first to Philip de Belmeis and second to Hugh de Mortimer. All three daughters were the eventual co-heirs of their father, after their brother died without offspring between 1135 and 1140. Meschin's lands were divided between their descendants, with parts ending up with the Counts of Aumale, the family of the Courcys, and the last and smallest part to the Mortimer family."

"""White Lies"", released in July 2007, is the first single from Paul van Dyk's album ""In Between"". It features vocals from Jessica Sutta, former member of the Pussycat Dolls."
"""I had a lot of fun working with Jessica. Her lascivious voice and sexy attitude reflects the theme of the single perfectly."" said Paul van Dyk via press release."
Jessica also spoke about working with Paul Van Dyk:
The single received positive reviews.
"""Paul Van Dyk makes a grand return to the club scene with his new single ""White Lies and Jessica Sutta also proves that Nicole Scherzinger isn't the only Pussycat Doll who can sing lead. The combination of these two results in a great song with some great remixes. While only one mix is what you'd expect from Paul Van Dyk, all of the mixes are excellent and worth checking out."""
"""Paul Van Dyk and Alex M.O.R.P.H do the Berlin Mix"" - It showcases all of the elements that make up a great trance mix. Synthesizers and pumped-up drums and beats zoom around frantically with the only vocals being that of Jessica singing the title of the song. It's a perfect choice for those late night punters who don't need a lot of singing with their music."
"If you want to actually hear the vocals, go directly to the ""L.A. Mix"". This mix uses all of the vocals and is actually not as euphoric-sounding as the first mix. The beats are rougher and the trance element is essentially missing. It almost sounds like a Dave Aude remix. Perhaps his influence rubbed off on Van Dyk for this particular version. The added elements of flamenco guitar and punched up drums make this mix a stellar one. This sound is a refreshing change to what we are used to from him."
"""The Dave Spoon Mix"" continues in the same direction as the previous mix. The keyboards are the main attraction here, though during most of the mix they overpower Jessica's vocals."
"Finally, the ""Aural Float Remix"" is a dreamy electronic mix, not at all good for dancing to but perfect for a chilled out evening at home. The song moves along lazily and feels very atmospheric, never attempting to do anything related to a dance floor."
"The video shows Sutta performing suggestive dances in burlesque outfits in two different locations: on a bed in a white outfit, being watched by people through the windows; and on stage dancing around a chair, in a black outfit while Van Dyk plays the DJ."
"The video closely resembles Madonna's video for ""Open Your Heart"" as well as Bob Fosse's choreography for his ""Mein Herr"" routine from Cabaret. The video was directed by Steven Antin and produced by Looking Glass Films in Hollywood, California."
"The track has been a success on the American dance charts, peaking at #3 on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in August 2007, becoming Paul Van Dyk's highest charting single. On Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart, it debuted in the top 40 in late August 2007, since then it has also hit the #3 spot. It has reached #80 on the UK Singles Chart in August 2007."
"On Billboard's Hot Dance Singles Sales chart it has been #1 for four weeks. It has also reaching #38 in Germany's pop charts, #4 in Turkey's top 100, #14 in Finland and #8 in Canada's top 40 charts."
The album has reached #115 on The Billboard 200 and #2 on the Top Electronic Albums and Top Heatseekers charts.

He has been praised among critics and has received several informal awards.
"Nathan was born in England and is the third child of Patrik McCree and Beverly Allison. As a child, he spent time singing in a choir from the age of 6 where he learned about harmonies and progressions from choral music."
"He started writing music when he was 11, on a Korg Delta synthesizer bought by his father, he used his 4 track reel-to-reel tape recorder to multi-track. He studied Computer Science at Kingston University and got his first job with Core Design as a programmer."
"His job there was to code a music sequencer for the Sega Mega Drive, he wrote some music on it to demonstrate how it worked. The boss liked the music and he asked him to write the music for ""Asterix and the Power of the Gods""."
"Nathan is most well known for creating the original music for ""Tomb Raider"". While creating the ""Tomb Raider"" music, he had an idea in mind to create music that sounded like English classical music. He notes that his influences might have come from English classical music that his father used to play when he was small. He wrote the entire score for the first ""Tomb Raider"" in four weeks without insight on the game levels to help him draw the music accordingly. On the following two games he was still getting very limited descriptions for what musical elements he needed."
"He spent three months working on ""Tomb Raider II""."
"After ""Tomb Raider II"" he left to go freelance and he was contracted in to do the music for ""Tomb Raider III""."
"He was not contracted to work on """", being later replaced by Peter Connelly who composed Tomb Raider music for another three Tomb Raider games. He interviewed Peter to replace him at Core Design."

= = = Anne of Foix-Candale = = =
Anna of Foix-Candale (1484 – 26 July 1506) was Queen of Hungary and Bohemia as the third wife of King Vladislaus II.
"Anne was the daughter of Gaston of Foix, Count of Candale and Infanta Catherine of Navarre. Her mother was the youngest daughter of Queen Eleanor of Navarre, and Gaston IV, Count of Foix. Anne grew up at the French royal court in Blois. She was educated in Latin and the Classics."
"The nephew of the French monarch, the Duke of Longueville, is reported to have been in love with her and wished to marry her, but he was prevented because a political marriage was planned for Anne. The elderly, twice-divorced and childless king Vladislaus II of Hungary of the Jagiellon dynasty had been searching a wife capable of giving him a son. His sights were set on a powerful alliance, and Anne, closely related to French royalty, was a good choice. So Anne got engaged in 1500, the marriage contract confirmed in 1501, and she wed Vladislaus by proxy at the French court in Blois in 1502. On her way to Hungary, she was much celebrated in Italy and in Venice, causing a conflict between France and Hungary over who should pay the expenses. On 29 September 1502, Anne wed Vladislaus in Székesfehérvár and she was crowned Queen of Hungary there that same day."
"Anne brought a French court and French advisors with her to Hungary. The relationship was happy at least from the king's view, and he is reported to have regarded her as a friend, assistant and a trusted advisor. She incurred debts in Venice and was said to favour this city all her life. In 1506, her signature was placed on a document alongside the king's regarding an alliance with the Habsburgs. On July 23, 1503 Anne gave birth to a daughter, known as Anna Jagellonica, and on July 1, 1506 to the long-awaited male heir, the future king Louis II. She enjoyed great popularity, but her pregnancies ruined her health. She died in Buda on July 26, 1506, a little more than three weeks after the birth of her son due to complications from delivery. She was 22."

"Spitz became one of America's leading high jumpers while still at Flushing High School, placing fourth in the 1929 national championships with a jump of 1.89 m (6 ft in)."
"In March 1930 he jumped 1.94 m (6 ft in), breaking the US high school record of Walter Marty. At the national championships he repeated his fourth-place finish from the previous year. He graduated from high school that spring and entered New York University."
"Spitz set his first indoor world record on February 7, 1931 at the Millrose Games, jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) and defeating the previous record holders Harold Osborn and Bert Nelson. He also had the best outdoor jump in the world that year, clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) at Travers Island and attempting the world outdoor record height of 2.04 m (6 ft in) three times. At the national championships, however, he only cleared 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in) and was yet again beaten to fourth place."
"Spitz was the world's best high jumper in 1932. On February 6 he improved his own indoor world record to 2.02 m (6 ft in), again at the Millrose Games. A week later at Boston he broke the record again, jumping 2.04 m (6 ft in), a mark that exceeded Osborn's outdoor world record as well. Spitz also won his first national indoor championship that year, clearing a meeting record 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) on that occasion."
"Spitz injured his ankle that spring, and while he remained in good form the injury gave him on-and-off trouble. He was forced to scratch from the annual meet of his own club, the New York Athletic Club, in early June. But he managed to return in time for the Olympic Trials, and after he jumped 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in workouts ahead of the Trials and 1.99 m (6 ft in) in the competition itself, tying for first with Bob Van Osdel and Corny Johnson, he was again considered the leading Olympic favorite."
"At the Olympics, however, the injured ankle bothered him again and he only managed to place ninth, clearing no higher than 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in)."
"Spitz defended his national indoor title in 1933, jumping 2.03 m (6 ft in) for a meeting record. At the outdoor championships, however, he was beaten by Johnson and shared second place with Marty, who had broken the outdoor world record earlier that year."
"In 1934 Spitz's indoor supremacy was seriously threatened by Marty, who had never jumped indoors before. At the Millrose Games on February 5 Spitz and Marty tied, both jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in). In the New York Athletic Club indoor games on February 17, however, Marty beat both Spitz and his indoor record, clearing 2.05 m (6 ft in) on his third attempt. At the national indoor championships Spitz and Marty tied for first again, both clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) this time to share the title."
"Although unable to improve his indoor best, Spitz made his best outdoor jumps that year. He won at the Penn Relays with a jump of 2.01 m (6 ft in) and went an inch higher with an additional exhibition jump. He then cleared 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in his home meet at Travers Island, his official outdoor best. Spitz and Marty, both now collegiate seniors, faced each other again at the NCAA championships and again tied, although Marty was victorious in the jump-off. At the national championships Spitz cleared 2.02 m (6 ft in), but had to be content with third place as both Johnson and Marty managed to jump an inch higher."
"Spitz continued his jumping career after graduating, but with decreasing success. At the 1935 national championships he still placed second to Johnson, clearing 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in). At the 1936 Olympic Trials he only managed 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in), sharing fourth place with six other jumpers."
"Spitz jumped in an era in which most jumpers from the American west coast (such as Marty) used the western roll, whereas east coast jumpers tended to prefer the eastern cut-off or other developments of the old scissors style. Spitz, a New Yorker, belonged to the latter group, although his technique was largely self-taught and incorporated elements of the roll."

The film is a homage to the 1964 martial arts film ""Buddha's Palm"" which starred Cho Tat-wah, who also acts in a supporting role in this film."
"Advertising company staff Mo Tak-fai (Lau) and his friend Lai Chi (Chan) go to mainland China for a business trip. Chi smuggles some relics, leading to them being chased by the police. They go into a cave to escape capture, but Chi is bitten by a poisonous snake. He finds a medicine belonging to an ancient hero named Long Jianfei and shares it with Tak-fai. Not only does the medicine detoxifies Chi, it also bestows Tak-fai and Chi internal strengths. They also rescue Princess Yunluo (Wong) and her maid Xiao Man (Mui) from the Yuan Dynasty after 800 years of slumber but in the process also releasing a two-hundred-year-old evil martial arts expert Tian Can (Yuen)."
"Fai and Chi remain skeptical about the things that happened and they bring the two ladies to Hong Kong. Yunluo is able to adapt to modern life in Hong Kong very quickly. On the other hand, in order to defeat Tian Can, Yunluo helps Fai to learn the ""Buddha's Palm"" technique while Chi, due to poor qualifications, only excel at the ""Seven Rotary Slice"" technique. However, when Tian Can arrives he effortlessly defeats Fai since he has not mastered the ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" technique. Tian Can forces Fai to eat a cursed silkworm, which can cause pain to people who consume it when Tian Can plays his drum."
"The next day, Tian Can goes on a spree. He steals money from a bank ATM, threatens Fai and Chi to go to their boss' home and capture his family, as well as defeating the police who come after them. Yunluo saves the two men but Fai is furtherly injured by Tian Can in the process. Fortunately they come across Yim Chan, leader of a supernatural performing troupe from China, who heals Fai from his injuries while also channelling energy to him. A few days later, Fai finally masters the ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" technique. He and his friends confront Tian Can in a final duel and Fai uses ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" to cripple Tian Can's martial arts ability, becoming a true hero in the end."

"McHugh was born at Annagh, Glenfarne, County Leitrim. He was the son of a tenant farmer, Peter M’Hugh of Leitrim, and of Anne McDermott. He entered a Catholic seminary, but left without taking orders. He went to Paris and engaged in journalism, and taught science and classics in the Athlone and Sligo Intermediate schools. In 1882 he married Mary Harte, daughter of a J. Harte of Sligo. She died in 1894. He became owner of ""The Sligo Champion"" in 1885. He was Mayor of Sligo in 1888, and again in 1895-98 and 1900. He was elected to Sligo County Council on its establishment in 1899 and became its first chairman."
"He was elected MP for North Leitrim as an Anti-Parnellite Nationalist in 1892, winning comfortably over the Unionist candidate with 87% of the vote. He retained the seat unopposed in 1895. At this election he also challenged the Parnellite Willie Redmond in East Clare, losing by only 57 votes in a poll of over 6,500. In 1900, standing for the reunited Irish Parliamentary Party, he was again challenged in North Leitrim by a Unionist, but again won comfortably, with 91% of the vote. In April 1901 he was imprisoned for six months following conviction for ‘seditious libel’ on account of an article on Jury Packing in Sligo published in his newspaper. The article had attacked jurymen who had convicted two men of intimidating persons who rented farms from which the former owners had been evicted. On his release he was given a celebratory lunch by the Lord Mayor of Dublin. In September the following year, he stood before the Irish Court of Bankruptcy after a petition from the Crown Solicitor for Sligo, but this apparently did not affect his political standing. In 1906 he was returned unopposed both for North Leitrim and for North Sligo, and chose to sit for the latter constituency, which he represented until his death in 1909."

= = = Pavane (Fauré) = = =
"The Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50, is a pavane by the French composer Gabriel Fauré written in 1887. It was originally a piano piece, but is better known in Fauré's version for orchestra and optional chorus. Obtaining its rhythm from the slow processional Spanish court dance of the same name, the Pavane ebbs and flows from a series of harmonic and melodic climaxes, conjuring a haunting Belle Époque elegance. The piece is scored for only modest orchestral forces consisting of string instruments and one pair each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns. A typical performance lasts about six minutes."
"The original version of the ""Pavane"" was written for piano and chorus in the late 1880s. The composer described it as ""elegant, but not otherwise important."" Fauré intended it to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its more familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than 100 quarter notes per minute. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the ""Pavane"" was not a piece of German romanticism, and that the text later added was ""clearly a piece of light-hearted chaffing between the dancers""."
"Fauré composed the orchestral version at Le Vésinet in the summer of 1887. He envisaged a purely orchestral composition, using modest forces, to be played at a series of light summer concerts conducted by Jules Danbé. After Fauré opted to dedicate the work to his patron, Elisabeth, comtesse Greffulhe, he felt compelled to stage a grander affair and at her recommendation he added an invisible chorus to accompany the orchestra (with additional allowance for dancers). The choral lyrics were based on some inconsequential verses, ""à la"" Verlaine, on the romantic helplessness of man, which had been contributed by the Countess's cousin, Robert de Montesquiou."
"The orchestral version was first performed at a Concert Lamoureux under the baton of Charles Lamoureux on November 25, 1888. Three days later, the choral version was premiered at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique. In 1891, the Countess finally helped Fauré produce the version with both dancers and chorus, in a ""choreographic spectacle"" designed to grace one of her garden parties in the Bois de Boulogne."
"From the outset, the Pavane has enjoyed immense popularity, whether with or without chorus. With choreography by Léonide Massine a ballet version entered the repertoire of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1917, where it was alternatively billed as ""Las Mininas"" or ""Les Jardins d'Aranjuez"". For Massine, the music had ""haunting echoes of Spain's Golden Age"" parallelling the formality and underlying sadness he found in the paintings of Velázquez. Some critics found the ballet pallid, but Diaghilev retained a fondness for the piece, and kept it in the company's repertoire until the end of his life."
"Fauré's example was imitated by his juniors, who went on to write pavanes of their own: Debussy's Passepied in his ""Suite bergamasque"" and Ravel's ""Pavane pour une infante défunte"", and ""Pavane de la belle au bois dormant"" in ""Ma mère l'oye""."
"The lyrics, which are optional in the orchestral version, were written by the French Robert de Montesquiou."

"Dave Smith Motors started in October 1965 in Wallace, Idaho. He purchased the small Chevrolet dealership from Mort Keane. At that time, the Chevrolets were sold mainly to miners, loggers, smelter workers and local businessmen in northern Idaho’s Silver Valley. Five years later, he moved the dealership to Kellogg, Idaho. Today Dave Smith Motors carries Chrysler, General Motors, and Nissan products, according to the Dave Smith website,(Dave Smith.com)."
"Idaho’s Silver Valley was founded in the 1800s silver boom and is one of the richest silver mining regions in the world. The community is located along Interstate 90 in northern Idaho’s Shoshone County. The valley thrived for decades as one of the nation’s greatest mining regions. Then, in 1981, the Bunker Hill mine in Kellogg closed. Over 2,000 jobs left with the mine sending the area into an economic downturn. The region also lost a lot of jobs in the timber industry. The population of the valley plummeted and car dealerships were losing the battle to stay in business. Dave Smith nearly lost the dealership."
As other dealerships were going out of business in the valley Dave Smith bought up nine other new car dealerships and sold all the brands under one roof. He also cut prices in an attempt to make up in volume what was lost in mark-ups. At any given time the dealership has more new vehicles on lots in town than the population of Kellogg.
Dave Smith Motors was one of the first car dealerships to take advantage of the Internet.
"In the late 1990s when many dealerships saw the Internet as a threat, Dave Smith embraced the Internet and used it as a tool to increase sales. Since the beginning of the list, Dave Smith Motors has ranked high on Ward’s Auto e-Dealer 100 list. Dave Smith Motors uses the Internet to reach beyond the geographic confines of their remote location in Kellogg, Idaho."
"The Internet changed the playing field for dealerships because Chrysler Corporation (now Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) allocates more cars to dealerships that sell more, a policy that rewards dealers who are able to boost their sales. Despite the concerns of competing dealerships Chrysler continued to ship even more vehicles to Dave Smith Motors, and assured other dealers that they could increase sales by improved customer service and referrals. The other dealerships were not pleased. In 1998 twenty-five Chrysler dealerships in five states threatened to boycott Chrysler Corporation if they did not reduce the number of cars they allocated to Dave Smith Motors. The Federal Trade Commission considered their boycott illegal and the group settled the charges before the boycott began."

"On 6 October 2008 President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari, patron of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) appointed Butt as chairman of the PCB. He has been involved in several controversies during his career, presiding over Pakistan during a time when security concerns—including a shooting incident involving the Sri Lankan tour bus—stripped the country of several international fixtures. He has made several attacks on current and former PCB officials and the Senate of Pakistan."
"Butt was born in Sialkot, Punjab in 1938. He began his first-class career against a touring Marylebone Cricket Club squad on 16 January 1956 while playing for Pakistan Universities. Batting at number three, he scored 35 and 97, falling three short of a debut century thanks to the bowling of Billy Sutcliffe and the catching hands of Ken Barrington. The match ended in a draw. A month later he faced the MCC once more, this time for Punjab: he scored 43 and 18 as the MCC triumphed by an innings and 29 runs. Butt went on to make several successful appearances in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy over the winter of 1956/57, scoring 225 runs at 56.25 including a maiden century of 147 runs. He promptly toured the West Indies but only featured in one first-class match before returning to the 1958/59 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy where he had a less successful second season: 73 runs from three matches at 24.33, failing to pass 50.

= = = Denizen (video game) = = =
Denizen is an action computer game published by Players Software in 1988 for the ZX Spectrum.
"""Denizen"" is a science-fiction action flip-screen maze game, with a top-down perspective. The player controls a marine, with the aim of detonating twenty explosive bolts on each of three levels. The marine is armed with a rifle and is initially supplied with 99 bullets. The player can only move orthogonally, in half-tile steps. Each screen may contain one or more enemies, who move toward the marine in a straight line until they reach an obstacle. The enemies attack the player merely by contact, draining the character's health in a manner similar to ""Gauntlet"". Each enemy requires two bullets to destroy."
"Health is regenerated by returning to the marine's start point on each level. If he is out of ammunition, this also supplies him with a single bullet. Items that can be collected include single-use keycards to open locked doors, ammunition, and a torch which allows better vision in dark areas."
"""Denizen"" received poor reviews, with criticism being levelled at the slow character movement. The weapon firing mechanism was a particular complaint; ""The self-loading 'Quick Kill' rifle... is anything but quick"", ""[The rifle] acts in the manner of an aerosol gun, two slow puffs and off goes yer fly"". The gameplay itself was described as a ""dull maze plod"" with unresponsive and repetitive action."
"However, all the reviewers highlighted the colourful, detailed graphics, with presentation comparable with Players' previous titles."

= = = Belmont railway station (Harrow) = = =
"Belmont was a station in Belmont, north-west London on the Stanmore branch line. It was opened on 12 September 1932 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as the only intermediate station on a short branch line (opened in 1890) running north from Harrow & Wealdstone to Stanmore, in anticipation of the Metropolitan Railway opening its own branch line to a new Stanmore station (now served by the Jubilee line) the same year."
Belmont station was rebuilt with a central island platform and a passing loop. The rebuilt station opened on 5 July 1937. The station was located on the north side of Kenton Lane to the west of Belmont Circle.
"From the perspective of the branch line, the connection to the main line was north-facing, i.e. away from central London. Hence the branch line could not take direct commuter services from the city, limiting its operation to a shuttle service."
"The direct service provided by the Metropolitan offered strong competition to the L&NWR station at Stanmore and passenger services beyond Belmont were ended on 15 September 1952, though a daily freight train served the goods yard at Stanmore. The passing loop was removed in 1955. The line to Stanmore was closed completely on 6 July 1964, as part of the railway cuts implemented under the Beeching Axe. Passenger services from Belmont to Harrow were withdrawn on 5 October 1964."
The track was lifted in 1966 and the station site is now occupied by a car park.
= = = Business opportunity = = =
"Construction of the Air Station was undertaken in 1936 with funds provided by the Federal Public Works Administration. The M.H. Golden Co. was the contractor. The area had to be dredged from the bay and filled and brought up to grade level. Long piles were driven in the soil at the building sites for stabilization. The contract called for one hangar with lean-to, a mess hall, a barracks building, two aprons, a runway to the field, and a small wooden seaplane ramp. During and prior to this time a Coast Guard Air Detachment was maintained on Lindbergh Field in one-half of a commercial hangar. This detachment was led by Elmer F. Stone after May 21, 1935. Stone is one of Coast Guard Aviation's most colorful figures."
"In April 1937, the Air Station was commissioned. The first commanding officer was LT S.C. Linholm, who later became Commander of Eleventh Coast Guard District. There had, however, been an Air Patrol Detachment active in San Diego between 1934 and 1937. At the time this was the only Coast Guard air base in California."
"Coast Guard Air Station San Diego saw no radical changes as a result of the declaration of war in 1941. The unit continued to watch and report the activities of fishing boats in the area, to provide assistance in cases of distress, and to provide transportation by air for other government departments. Air Sea Rescue operations were given primary focus from October 1943 on. Between January 1 and December 1, 1944, a total of 124 aircraft went down in waters covered by this unit. Of the 201 pilots and crewmen involved, 137 were saved, 59 were killed outright by mid-air collisions or impact with the water, two are missing, and three who might have been saved were lost because of improper equipment or the failure to locate them promptly."
"In June 1972 a major rebuilding plan was proposed. On January 26, 1983, a ceremony was held signaling the completion of the project."
"In April 1997, the Port of San Diego began a master plan for San Diego International Airport. The goal of the plan is to provide incremental, cost-effective improvements to SDIA to meet the region's near-term demand for air service while a long-term regional air transportation strategy is developed in collaboration with the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) and other transportation agencies."

"Constantine ""Gene"" Mako ( ; January 24, 1916 – June 14, 2013) was an American tennis player and art gallery owner. He was born in Budapest, capital of Hungary. He won four Grand Slam doubles titles in the 1930s. Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1973."
"His father, Bartholomew Mako (), graduated from the Budapest Academy of Fine Arts in 1914. He started to work as a draftsman for his mentor Viktor Madarász. He was an avid soccer player himself. He fought in World War I. After the war, he left Hungary with his wife, Georgina Elizabeth Farkas Mako () and only son, traveling first to Italy, then stopping for three years in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before settling in Los Angeles, California. There he created works for public places like churches, libraries and post offices. Gene attended to the Glendale High School and the University of Southern California although he was offered a Hungarian University Scholarship in the meantime. He quit before graduation."
"In 1934 he won the NCAA championships in singles and the doubles (with Phillip Caslin) while playing for the University of Southern California where he lettered at USC for three years (1934-36-37). He also won the boys' singles event at the U.S. National Championships in 1932 and 1934 and the boys' doubles in 1932, 1933 and 1934."
"Mako was especially successful as a doubles player with his partner and friend Don Budge. They competed in seven Grand Slam finals, four of which they won."
"In 1936 Gene Mako and Alice Marble won the finals at the US Mixed Doubles Championships against Sarah Palfrey and Don Budge (6:3 and 6:2). They won the Newport Casino Invitational Tournament three consecutive times, from 1936 to 1938."
"From 1935 to 1938 Mako was a member of the United States Davis Cup team and played in eight ties. The US team won the Davis Cup in 1937, defeating the United Kingdom in the final at Wimbledon, and again in 1938 in the final against Australia at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia. As a Davis Cup player he compiled a record of six wins and three losses."
"Mako was in the U.S. Top Ten in 1937 and 1938 (reaching as high as No. 3), and was ranked World No. 8 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph in 1938. That year he reached the U.S. final at Forest Hills versus his double partner, Don Budge, who was in pursuit of the first Grand Slam. Unseeded, Mako reached his only major singles final on victories over sixth-seed Frank Kovacs and the third and first foreign seeds, Franjo Punčec and John Bromwich."
"In 1939 he was suspended and banned from playing for breaching the amateur rules. He and Don Budge allegedly accepted a sum of 20A£ for an exhibition match in Australia, which was against amateurism. Afterwards he continued to play tennis at that time during the Second World War while serving in the Navy. He also played professional basketball while stationed in Norfolk, Virginia."
In 1973 Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. In 1999 he was elected to the University of Southern California (USC) Athletic Hall of Fame.
"He possessed strong serve and powerful smashes but due to several injuries in his career, he had to give up his power game. He preferred a volleying style, which he perfected with quickness, good angle selection and pacing paired with strategy."
"Apart from being a sportsman, Mako composed music in his early 20s. He's the author of two songs, namely ""Lovely as Spring"" and ""What Did You Dream Last Night?"". He also starred in the 1938 musical ""Happy Landing"" and the 1941 war comedy ""Caught in the Draft"", although he remained uncredited in both movies. Mako married actress Laura Mae Church in Manhattan in 1941. A month later, World War II broke out, and he joined the United States Navy. After this, he worked in a broadcasting studio. After his retirement, he designed tennis courts. His wife worked as an interior designer. He was involved in wrestling and was hired as a coach at the California Institute of Technology while also coaching the basketball team. He owned Gene Mako Galleries in Los Angeles, California. He also published a book about his father titled ""Bartholomew Mako: A Hungarian Master, 1890-1970"". In the final decade of his life, he taught art to up-and-coming artists. He died in 2013 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, aged 97, of pneumonia."

"Eaton Chapel is a private chapel to the north of Eaton Hall in Eaton Park, near the village of Eccleston, Cheshire, England. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building."
"Building of the chapel commenced in 1869, soon after the estate was inherited by Hugh Grosvenor, the 3rd Marquess of Westminster, in conjunction with a major rebuilding of the hall. Grosvenor became the 1st Duke of Westminster in 1874. He appointed Alfred Waterhouse as architect and the building was completed in 1884. When the Waterhouse hall was demolished in 1963, the chapel was retained."
"The chapel is built in buff sandstone with a grey slate roof. Internally the stone is in pink and buff bands. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave that is continuous with a three-bay chancel. The chancel terminates with a three-sided apse containing the altar. The chapel is oriented with the altar at the west end. The last bay at the east end constitutes a narthex (ante-chapel) with a gallery. On the south of the chapel is a tower which is free-standing, but joined to the chapel at the lower two storeys, and by a bridge above. At the southeast corner is a staircase turret. On the south side of the nave and in the apse are two-light windows and at the east end behind the gallery is a four-light window. The tower has six stages and contains tall lancet bell-openings. Above these is the clock stage, corbelled out from the shaft of the tower and surmounted by pinnacles at each corner. On each side is a clock face made from vitreous enamel; each clock face is in diameter. Over this is a spire decorated with gables and pinnacles. The staircase turret is surmounted by a spire."
"The narthex at the east end has a groin vaulted oak roof, and is paved with black marble and with encaustic tiles. A stone screen leads into the nave. This also has a groin vaulted roof, but built in stone. Between the nave and the chancel is a low alabaster screen. A continuation of this screen leads to the pulpit: this is also constructed in alabaster with Devonshire marble columns. The reredos and the font are also made in alabaster. The benches in the nave and chancel are in walnut and have carved ends. In the chancel is a recumbent effigy in alabaster of Constance, 1st Duchess of Westminster, by Joseph Boehm. For the effigy, Boehm worked from plaster casts of the face and hands taken after her death."
"The stained glass in the windows of the south side of the nave and the apse, and the mosaics in the blank on the north side of the nave were designed by Frederic Shields. These were commissioned in 1876 and made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The two-manual organ is in an alcove on the south side of the chancel. It was built in 1870–71 by Charles Whitley of Chester and is still in good working order. The clock tower contains a carillon of 28 bells which were cast by Chavalier Severian Van Aerschodt of Louvain; it plays 31 tunes. The clock was manufactured by Gillet's of Croydon."
"The chapel continues to be the private chapel of the Grosvenor family and is used for family christenings, confirmations and memorial services. Each December it is made available for up to eight charities to arrange carol concerts. The chapel is also open to the general public on three annual open days."

= = = Walsh convention = = =
Walsh is a convention used in the card game of bridge in response to an opening bid of 1. The convention has its origins in the Walsh System developed by Richard Walsh.
"In general, the Walsh convention is not used in four-card major systems such as Acol, but may be employed in some five-card major systems; especially those that use a prepared club, rather than better minor. The opening bid of 1 will therefore have shown either clubs or a balanced hand."
"When responder is too weak to force to game diamond suits are bypassed in favour of major suits, regardless of the length of the diamond suit. For example, holding , the response to the opening bid of 1 would be 1 rather than the normal 1."
"Continuations vary according to other details of the system being played. If Checkback Stayman is being played, then the auction 1 – 1; 1NT – 2 would show this hand and end the auction. If New minor forcing is being used, then 3 is used as the sign off bid instead."
"When the values to force to game are held, the procedure is abandoned, and suits are bid in the normal order. Responders reverse from diamonds into a major thus becomes game forcing. So, holding , the auction starts 1 – 1; 1NT – 2."
"The main purpose of the convention is to avoid missing major suit fits when opener has something akin to a weak notrump, and would rebid 1NT over the normal 1 response. The major suit fit is likely to provide a safer resting place when the hands are weak, as well as potentially scoring better (a concern perhaps only at matchpoints)."
It is a form of Canapé and thus the responses of 1 and 1 to a 1 opener are alertable in the UK under EBU regulations.

"""The Guns of Brixton"" is a song by the English punk rock band The Clash. It was written and sung by bassist Paul Simonon, who grew up in Brixton, South London. The song has a strong reggae influence, reflecting the culture of the area and the reggae gangster film ""The Harder They Come""."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was the Clash's first song to be composed and sung by Paul Simonon. By the time of ""London Calling"", Simonon had learned to play guitar and started contributing more to the songwriting."
"The band, separated from manager Bernard Rhodes, had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location. They began work on ""London Calling"" during the summer of 1979 at the Vanilla Studios in Pimlico. The band quickly wrote and recorded demos, and in August 1979 entered Wessex Studios to begin recording the album. Produced by Guy Stevens, who at the time had alcohol and drug problems and whose production methods were unconventional, it was recorded within a matter of weeks, with many songs, including ""The Guns of Brixton"", recorded in one or two takes. It was also revealed that while recording the lead vocals for the song, Simonon sang while staring directly at a CBS executive who had visited the studio during the sessions, giving Simonon the desired amount of emotion in his voice."
"A section of the song is sung by a very young Maria Gallagher, accompanied by her father Mick Gallagher on the keyboard, as a reprise at the end of the song ""Broadway"" on the 1980 Clash album ""Sandinista!"""
"""The Guns of Brixton"" predates the riots that took place in the 1980s in Brixton, but the lyrics depict the feelings of discontent in the area because of the heavy-handedness of the police, the recession and other problems at the time. The lyrics refer to a Brixton-born son of Jamaican immigrants who ""feel[s] like Ivan...at the end of ""The Harder they Come"""", referring to Ivanhoe Martin's death in the 1972 film ""The Harder They Come"". Simonon was originally doubtful about the song's lyrics, which discuss an individual's paranoid outlook on life, but was encouraged to continue working on it by Joe Strummer."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was not initially released as a single, but a version of the song, taken from the remastered version of ""London Calling"" and remixed by Jeremy Healy, was released by CBS as a CD single, 7-inch vinyl and 12-inch vinyl entitled ""Return to Brixton"" in July 1990 (catalog number 656072-2). It reached #57 on the UK Singles Chart."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was a mainstay in the Clash's live set. When performing the song live, Simonon would switch instruments with Strummer because he was unable to play the bass line whilst singing lead vocals at the same time."
"A somewhat heavier, faster version than the one found on ""London Calling"" appeared on the 1999 live compilation """"."
"Norman Cook (also known as Fatboy Slim) sampled the bass line for Beats International's 1990 song ""Dub Be Good to Me"", which became a #1 hit in the UK. Simonon, interviewed by Scott Rowley in October 1999 for ""Bassist Magazine"", said that he ""was surprised that it became number one that was quite shocking. And the fact that it was my performance that they had lifted. The smart thing would've been to copy it and change it slightly, but they just lifted it straight off. So, really, I have done ""Top of the Pops"", but I met up with Norman [Cook] and we came to an arrangement which was much needed at the time. But I thought it was a really good idea and it was quite reassuring for that to happen to my first song."""
"Cypress Hill sampled the baseline on ""What's Your Number?"" from the 2004 album ""Till Death Do Us Part."" The song also features Tim Armstrong on guitar."
"Jimmy Cliff covered the song on his 2011 ""Sacred Fire EP"", and 2012 album ""Rebirth"", produced by Armstrong. Will Hermes has called the cover ""the sound of history circling in wondrous ways"" because the song references Cliff's character Ivan from ""The Harder They Come""."

He went on to captain his side in three drawn Tests in 1968–69 but his career ended in controversial circumstances when he declared himself unfit for the third Test against Australia due to what he claimed was a back injury. In the previous Test he had been involved in a heated altercation with Dennis Lillee and the Pakistan management was sceptical about his injury. As a result Said was sent home for ""indiscipline"". He finished his career with five Test hundreds, making over 150 runs in three of them."

"MLB. He signed with the Dodgers and made his MLB debut in 2014. He played primarily shortstop in Cuba, but played third base and left field for the Dodgers, who released him in 2016."
"As a member of Cuba's Las Tunas team in the Cuban National Series, Guerrero was named to the 2010–2011 All-Star team as well as playing for the Cuba national baseball team at the 2012 Haarlem Baseball Week and the 2011 World Port Tournament. He was part of the initial roster for the 2013 World Baseball Classic but did not make the final roster and reportedly sat out the regular season because he was upset at his snub."
"He defected from Cuba in 2013 and obtained residency in Haiti. He began training in the Dominican Republic and on September 9, 2013, it was reported that he had been cleared by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control to sign with U.S. teams."
"Guerrero was rumored to be signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers, with early reports putting his deal in the seven-year, $32 million area. However, his initial agents turned out to not be licensed and he switched to Scott Boras, who said the bidding was now wide open. On October 21, 2013, it was reported that Guerrero had reached a new agreement with the Dodgers, that would be worth $28 million over 4 years. The deal included a $10 million signing bonus and allows him to become a free agent after his age 30 season. The Dodgers officially announced his signing on October 22."
"Guerrero made his professional debut with the Gigantes del Cibao in the Dominican Winter League. However, he dealt with hamstring issues and was limited to only 12 games, during which he hit .289."
"Guerrero made the Dodgers' 25-man opening day roster for the 2014 season. He made his MLB debut as a pinch hitter on March 22, 2014 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, but when Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson countered by putting in a right-handed pitcher, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly sent in a left-hander to pinch hit for Guerrero. Guerrero had his first official at-bat the next night, and struck out. After the two-game opening series in Sydney, Australia, Guerrero was optioned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes."
"During a game against the Salt Lake Bees on May 20, 2014, Guerrero was involved in a dugout scuffle with Albuquerque teammate Miguel Olivo in which Olivo bit off a portion of Guerrero's ear. He had to undergo a complicated plastic surgery operation to reattach the ear, necessitating several days in the hospital. In 65 games for the Isotopes, he played 51 games at second base, 9 in left field, 4 at shortstop and 1 at third base. He hit .329 with 15 homers and 49 RBI. The Dodgers recalled him when rosters expanded on September 1. He recorded his first Major League hit with a single to left field off of Erik Cordier of the San Francisco Giants on September 13. He appeared in 13 games with the Dodgers, primarily as a pinch hitter though he did play in left field for a few innings. He had just the one hit in 13 at-bats."
"In spring training, Guerrero made it clear he intended to exercise an unusual clause in his contract that allowed him to refuse an assignment to the minor leagues. As it happened, he hit so well during spring training that he convinced the Dodgers he belonged on the opening day roster, despite concerns about his defense."
"In his first start of the season, Guerrero had three hits in five at-bats. One of the hits was his first MLB home run, hit off of Óliver Pérez of the Arizona Diamondbacks."
"After two weeks, Guerrero was hitting so well that there was clamor for him to become the regular third baseman, as incumbent Juan Uribe was getting off to a slow start. Uribe, however, picked up his production, and Guerrero continued to be used in a utility role, playing at third base and at left field and pinch hitting. Despite not being a regular starter, Guerrero was named Rookie of the Month for April 2015, his first full month in the Major Leagues. He hit .423 with five homers and 13 RBI in only 13 games."
"On June 2, with the Dodgers trailing the Colorado Rockies by three runs and down to their last strike in the top of the 9th inning, Guerrero hit the first grand slam of his career just over the center field wall to drive in what would be the winning run for the Dodgers."
"His production tailed off down the stretch but he wound up playing in 117 games with 11 homers, 36 RBI and a .224 batting average."
"Guerrero injured his knee in spring training in 2016, causing him to begin the season on the disabled list. In a minor league rehab stint across three different levels in May, he played in 16 games and hit .136. When he was ready to rejoin the team, there was no spot available on the active roster so Guerrero was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on May 31, 2016 and removed from the 40-man roster. The Dodgers released Guerrero on June 8."
"On November 26, 2016, Guerrero signed with the Chunichi Dragons of Nippon Professional Baseball. Guerrero broke a Chunichi record for most consecutive games with a homerun after he cleared the fence against the Rakuten Eagles on 3 June 2017. He however fell short of equalling the NPB record of 7 consecutive games with a homerun set by Randy Bass and Sadaharu Oh as he failed to register a hit in the final match of the series against the Eagles on 4 June. Guerrero was selected for the 2017 Central League All-Star team by choice of the manager. The Dragons released Guerrero on December 2."
"On December 17, 2017, Guerrero signed with the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for a two-year 800 million yen ($USD million) deal."

= = = Perry (car) = = =
"The Perry was a British car made by the Perry Motor Company based in Tyseley, Birmingham who made cars between 1913 and 1916."
"The company can trace its roots back to 1824 with James and Stephen Perry making pens in a workshop in London, later moving to Birmingham and building bicycles. By the late 1890s they were having financial problems and were bought by James William Bayliss, part owner of the Bayliss-Thomas car making company."
"Their first car, a three-wheeler, was made in 1899 followed by a forecar in 1903. Cecil Bayliss, the son of the new owner, built a cyclecar in 1911 with 800 cc engine, and this was developed into the first Perry car to reach production."
"The Perry cyclecar was described as 'just placed on the market' when exhibited at the November 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show at Olympia. It was described as 'an exact replica of a full-sized model, but is of exceptionally light weight - less than 7cwt'."
"The engine for the car was built in-house and was a twin-cylinder vertical water cooled unit, with 72mm bore and 108mm stroke, unusual in that both pistons rose and fell at the same time. Drive was to the rear wheels through a 3-speed gearbox with reverse and worm-driven axle and spur differential. The rear springing was unusual in that the long semi-elliptic leaf springs were supplemented by coil springs. It was fitted with Sankey detachable wheels and Dunlop tyres."
"The basic body was an open two-seater, but a long-wheelbase version allowing a dickey seat was also available."
About 800 were made.
A full-sized car was introduced in 1914 with four-cylinder 1795 cc engine. The larger car allowed four seat bodies to be offered as well as two seaters and these were mainly made by Mulliners of Birmingham.
"About 300 were made before World War I curtailed car-building activities. A very few were made in 1919 when the design, jigs, patterns and tools were sold to Bean Cars for £15,000, who reintroduced it as the Bean 11.9."
= = = Worst Week = = =
"Worst Week is an American sitcom television series which originally aired on CBS from September 22, 2008 to June 6, 2009. The series was based on the British sitcom ""The Worst Week of My Life"". The show was adapted for American audiences by Fox under the title ""Worst Week of My Life"", but a series failed to materialize after the pilot was filmed."
"The series aired on CBS Mondays at 9:30pm ET/PT, following ""Two and a Half Men"". The premiere attracted 11 million viewers but lost a third of its lead-in audience. Ratings dropped to a low of 8.4 million viewers with the sixth episode, then began to climb steadily. They reached a high of 12.12 million viewers with the eleventh episode but declined afterwards. The season finale titled ""The Epidural"" aired on February 16, 2009."
"On May 20, 2009, CBS announced its new season schedule and canceled ""Worst Week"". A previously unaired episode entitled ""The Party"" aired on June 6, 2009. ""Worst Week"" is set in Manassas, Virginia."
"Verne Gay of ""Newsday"" graded it A and said it ""may be the best new comedy on network TV this season."""
"Less enthusiastic was Tim Goodman of the ""San Francisco Chronicle"", who said, ""Though there are plenty of hard-earned (some might say forced) laughs here and Bornheimer is a real find, you can't help but wonder how they'll keep up the pace. After all, the British series ran for only two seasons and had a mere seven episodes each season...So how is CBS going to stretch this into 22 episodes without stretching it too thin?...In many ways, ""Worst Week"" seems incapable of being made into an American version (there were previous attempts that failed), because not only does the title not make sense, but not having a payoff for all the freaky, not-so-karmic woes Sam endures will be frustrating to the viewing audience . . . [It] is a series that may end up being on a short leash."""
"Linda Stasi of the ""New York Post"" called it ""one of the worst new shows of the week"" and added, ""Only a man (or a couple of them) could get paid big bucks in Hollywood to come up with such a lame-o rip-off and perpetuate the fantasy that gorgeous women can't help but to love out-of-shape guys who do everything wrong."""

OB 293 was a North Atlantic convoy which ran during the battle of the Atlantic in World War II.
"It was notable for seeing the loss to the Kriegsmarine (KM) of , with her commander KL Günther Prien, the person responsible for the sinking of two years previously."
"OB 293 was a west-bound convoy of 37 ships, either in ballast or carrying trade goods, and sailed from Liverpool on 2 March 1941 bound for ports in North America."
"It was escorted by an escort group of two destroyers, and , and two corvettes, and . They were led by LtCdr Rowlands of ""Wolverine"", which would stay with them till they left the Western Approaches. (At this stage of the campaign escort groups were too scarce to provide ""end-to-end"" cover)."
On 6 March 1941 the convoy was sighted by commanded by Prien.
"After sending a sighting report he set to shadowing the convoy, being joined throughout the day by three other boats. They were (Kretschmer), (Matz) and (Eckermann)."
On the night of the 6/7 March the pack launched its attack.
"In the early hours of 7 March ""U-99"" slipped into the convoy from ahead, to attack on the surface; she torpedoed the tanker ""Athelbeach"", sinking her, and the whale factory ship ""Terje Viken"", which was damaged."
"""U-70"" hit a freighter ""Dunaff Head"", which sank, and a Dutch tanker, ""Mijdrecht""."
"She was only damaged, however, rounding on"" U-70"" and attempting to ram; ""U-70"" was forced to crash-dive to escape."
"""UA"" hit a freighter but did not sink her."
The response of the escorts was swift and effective. The U-boats were subjected to a fierce bombardment as the warships chased down contacts; over 100 depth charges were expended over a 5-hour period.
"""UA"" was damaged but was able to escape;"
"""U-99"" only escaped by diving deep and waiting out the attack."
"""U-70"" was damaged in the onslaught and forced to the surface, where she was fired on and sunk by the corvettes ""Camellia"" and ""Arbutus""."
"""U-47"" avoided damage and was able to stay in contact with the convoy, sending further reports and requesting re-inforcements. He had also been able to torpedo ""Terje Viken"", which was straggling after being damaged, though she still remained afloat. The escorts attempted to bring her to port, but she finally sank on the 14th; her loss was credited to both ""U-99"" and ""U-47""."
"Meanwhile, on the night of 7th/8th, at about 1am on the 8th, ""Wolverine"" sighted a U-boat on the surface which she identified as ""U-47"". She and "" Verity"" attacked, and after 4 hours, which had shown evidence of damage, the U-boat was driven to the surface within yards of ""Wolverine"", before diving again. The destroyer sent down a pattern of depth charges and was rewarded with an underwater explosion, marked by an orange glow, and flames that broke the surface."
"""Wolverine"" was credited with destroying ""U-47"", and this featured in the official record until the late 1990s. However, after reviewing the available records modern historians regard this attack as being directed against ""UA"", which was badly damaged, but survived to reach port."
"No conclusion can be reached about the fate of ""U-47"", and it is thought likely to be the result of a diving accident."
"The success of the defence of OB 293, with the loss of the U-boat ace Prien, coupled with the successful defence of Convoy HX-112, and the loss of two more aces, Kretschmer and Schepke, one week later, marks a minor turning point in the Atlantic campaign."

"The church was largely rebuilt in 1856-1883. There are two aisles, nave, chancel and north vestry with a west tower containing a ring of six bells. The large nave of six bays has fine piers and strong shafts. The chancel was rebuilt in 1883 by F. Bacon. There is also an Ascension window by Theodora Salusbury from 1929 (Carlton church has another fine window by the artist) in the north aisle. The stained window has two fish hidden in the folds of the robes. The ornate reredos behind the altar is very fine as is the whole of the chancel area."
The church includes a number of memorials/windows to the Everard family.
"The original Norman south porch was rebuilt in 1860 at a cost of £60. The font which has moved three times dates from the 13th century, and has tracery panels of various kinds including one with two parallel tree trunks. There are also sedilia in the southern aisle and a piscina. The graveyard is closed to burials now as these have transferred to the cemetery next door.

"In 1256, Le Peytevin, a Norman Baron, granted the church to the Hospital of St. John, of the Knights Hospitallers, at Newland."
"The building is in the perpendicular style, being built mainly of coursed dressed sandstone blocks under a stone slate roof and consists of a three-bay chancel with a south chapel adjacent, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles and a clerestory. A tower was added to the western end in the 15th century. In the 19th century, clergy and choir vestries were added as well as an organ chamber. The building was granted Grade II* listing in 1965. The church was internally re-ordered in 1991 and again in 2019. The latest re-ordering has returned the church to an east-facing orientation."
"The church houses the Freeston Tomb, the burial place of Sir John Freeston of Altofts (d 1594), who by his will provided for an almshouse at Kirkthorpe and a grammar school for Normanton and Warmfield.

"There is low octagonal stone Font, now standing at the west end of the nave."
"The window at the east end of the Lady Chapel depicting the fall of the Walls of Jericho, is a war memorial to the fallen of the Great War."
"The window to the left of the porch was an addition in the late 1970s as a memorial to the explorer, Martin Frobisher of nearby Altofts."
"All Saints' possesses two ancient silver cups, now housed in a collection at York Minster. The oldest was made in London in 1655 and is inscribed ""Normanton cupp 1674"". The second is two-handled porringer inscribed ""The Gift of Mrs Henry Favell of Pontefract to the Church of Normanton for ever 1699"""
"In ""Normanton, Past and Present,"" author Walter Hampson (1928) noted the monuments within the church: ""The chapel is the burial place of the Bunnys of Newland, Torres of Snydale, Favells of Normanton, Smiths (now Bosworths) late of Newland and the Mallets and Levetts of Normanton. The Favells were an important Normanton family and were resident here in the early part of the 17th century. On the south chancel floor are memorial slabs of the Favells bearing the dates 1698, 1714, 1777 and others in the 18th century. Here also is a large altar tomb of the Malletts and Levetts. The Mallets it would seem were a very ancient family, as we are told their ancestors flourished here in the middle of the 13th century. The tomb on the top bears the arms of the Levetts together with the arms of the Mallets. On the wall above the tomb is an undated tablet recording that 'Mrs. Elizabeth Levett made benefaction for the poor of Normanton and Snydale, and for teaching poor children.' There also are tombs of the Torres mentioned under Snydale."""
"The Mallets and the Levetts had lived in Normanton for centuries. (The first High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1069 was William Malet; Speaker of the House of Commons, and High Sheriff of Yorkshire Sir Thomas Gargrave had married Elizabeth, daughter of William Levett of Normanton)."
"There are several monuments in All Saints' Church to the Yorkshire antiquarian James Torre, who having graduated from the Inner Temple in London gave up the law, sold his properties and retired to do historical research at York, later purchasing the manor of Snydale. Torre died in 1699."
"This is so because the wealth of the ruler is something kept by the people. If the people are already rich, how can it stand to reason that the ruler alone is poor?"

"You Ruo spoke from profundity the idea of the oneness of the ruler and the people in his advice to Duke Ai. The implication was that the Duke's proposal to increase the taxation was due to the insufficiency of his revenues for state expenditure; to insure the sufficiency of state expenditure, then, what could take precedence over measures to insure sufficiency for his people?"
4. Qǐgǔ:

"Then,"

Essay Topic:
"“Zi Mo (子莫) holds on to the middle… Holding on to the middle is closer to being right, but to do this without the proper measure is not different from holding to one extreme.”"
1. Pòtí:
"Mencius’ contemporary Zi Mo wanted to rectify the deviation of heterodox teachings, but did not realize that he himself fell into deviation."
2. Chéngtí:
"The fact is, the middle is defined as “not deviant,” and the correct application of the middle is the proper measure. Zi Mo wanted to rectify the deviant ways of Yang Zi (楊子) and Mo Zi (墨子), but did not know the proper measure, so this was but another deviation. This was the standard Mencius used to repudiate his error and to establish our way."
3. Qǐjiǎng:
"To elaborate, for our Way is the principal one, but the manifestations are many; egoism and indiscriminate love certainly deviate from the Way. And our way uses the one principle to join together the many, but those who hold on to egoism or indiscriminate love are certainly holding on to an extreme which leads nowhere. Thus there was Zi Mo who understood the errors of Yang Zi and Mo Zi, and thereupon mediated between the two in order to grasp the middle course."
4. Qǐgǔ:
"Zi Mo would probably say, I cannot bear to be like Yang Zi, who cut off all ties with others in a niggardly fashion; I simply stop short of loving indiscriminately."
I have not time to be like Mo Zi who joyfully sacrifices himself for others: I simply stop short of being an egoist.
"Because one rejects egoism, one may be thought to be escaping from the error of Yang Zi and heading towards benevolence."
"Because one rejects indiscriminate love, one may be thought to be escaping for the error of Mo Zi and heading towards righteousness."

"The Thought and Daniel meet in Belshazzar's palace gardens. The Thought informs Daniel that Belshazzar has married Idolatry, even though he is already married to Vanity. Daniel cries woe for God's people."
"Belshazzar enters with Vanity and his new bride, Idolatry. He wants them to embrace each other. They do so and ask him what is on his mind. He relates the story of the Great Flood and also the Tower of Babel. After he tells his stories, his two wives decree that he is their king and god. Belshazzar asks what can break their bond, and Daniel informs him that “The Hand of God,” can break up Belshazzar, Vanity, and Idolatry. Belshazzar gets upset with Daniel and threatens his life. Daniel says that God will save him. Vanity and Idolatry tell Belshazzar that Daniel is annoying them and they want to leave. As they leave, Belshazzar tells Daniel he owes his life to the two queens, not to God. The Thought tells Daniel that he has learned a valuable lesson – by invoking the hand of God, his life can be spared in future situations."
"Death and Daniel enter and discuss Belshazzar and his sins of vanity and idolatry. Death offers to kill Belshazzar for Daniel, as an agent of an angry God. Daniel gives Death permission to visit Belshazzar and scare him, but not kill him. Daniel wants to save his soul. Death is upset about only being allowed to show himself to and warn Belshazzar and not take his soul. He calls for Thought. Thought joins Death and is scared of him. Death asks Thought where Belshazzar is. Thought tells Death that Belshazzar is with his two wives in the garden. Death asks Thought to take him there. Thought does because he doesn't have the courage to say no."
"Belshazzar, Idolatry, and Vanity enter. The ask Belshazzar why he looks so sad and stops talking so suddenly. Belshazzar says he doesn't know the source of the intense pain he feels. It is Death approaching that none of the trio can see. Death shows himself to Belshazzar who is shocked and terrified. He asks Death who he is; Death tells Belshazzar that he is a creditor here to collect a debt that Belshazzar owes. Thought rethinks his decision to lead Death to Belshazzar. Belshazzar asks what he owes. Death shows him a book that has the debt listed, but Belshazzar states that the book is one he lost. Death says the debt was written down by Belshazzar himself. He reads back what Belshazzar wrote about owing his life to Death. Death tells Belshazzar that today is not the day that he has come to collect the debt, but that the day is coming. Death exits."
"Belshazzar, Idolatry, Vanity, and Thought are still together. The two queens want to know what is troubling Belshazzar. He says he is not sure – some phantom visited him. To please Belshazzar, the queens take turns complimenting each other. They all sit down and Idolatry fans Belshazzar with the feather from her hat while Vanity sings to him about his greatness to continue to soothe him."
"Death is angry because the queens have soothed Belshazzar into a sleep. Death says he will haunt Belshazzar in his dream. The queens leave the garden and Thought also falls asleep. Death sees Belshazzar asleep and decides to kill him. He draws his sword, but Daniel enters and says, “No,” while holding back the arms of Death. Death inquires why he cannot kill the king. Daniel says Belshazzar has not lived his whole life and it is not time yet for him to die. Death argues that Belshazzar's life is a mockery to both God and Death."
"While Belshazzar is asleep, in his dream the queens enter with a Statue – it is Belshazzar as a god. The queens praise Belshazzar and build him up. The Statue warns Belshazzar in his sleep that he needs to leave Idolatry and Vanity behind or else he will suffer because of them. The Statue tells the dream queens that the great God decrees them gone. Belshazzar wakes up and is troubled by what he saw and felt in his sleep. He starts to question keeping so much stock in Idolatry and Vanity. However, Idolatry seduces him again and he returns to his former self. Thought suggests Belshazzar throw a feast to shake off all of the melancholy. Belshazzar calls for the gold wine glasses and wine reserved for presenting the Eucharist to be used, because he deserves the best. Idolatry and Vanity set the table for the feast while Thought sings."
"Death comes to the feast in a disguise and makes a plea to God to loose his hand in order to kill Belshazzar due to his sacrilegious behavior against the Eucharist on top of his sins of Idolatry and Vanity. Belshazzar demands wine, and Death, being mistaken for a servant, brings him a golden cup of poisoned wine declaring that in the cup is both Life and Death. Belshazzar toasts himself, drinks the wine, and then there are several increasingly loud thunder claps. A hand appears in the clouds and writes nonsense words that neither Idolatry, Vanity, Belshazzar, nor Thought can decipher. Idolatry says Daniel can read them and calls him to do it."
"Daniel comes and interrupts the words that translate to mean that: One, God has numbered Belshazzar's days on earth. Two, Belshazzar has been weighed in the balance and been found wanting. Three, Belshazzar's kingdom will be a wasteland ravaged by his enemies when Belshazzar dies. All this because Belshazzar has profaned the sacred golden sacramental cups meant only to be used for the Eucharist. Death tells Belshazzar know that there was “death,” or poison, in the cups. Belshazzar cries out for Idolatry to save him, but she cannot. He calls out to Vanity to help him, but she cannot. Belshazzar asks Thought to help him, but Thought reminds him that he did not take heed of the warnings he received. Belshazzar finally calls on Daniel. Daniels says he is God's agent and Belshazzar must take his punishment. Belshazzar wonders who could save him – Death says no one. Death says “Die, thou sinner,” draws his sword, and stabs Belshazzar in the heart. As Death and Belshazzar wrestle, Belshazzar calls out a warning to all men. Idolatry lays down her worship of all other gods for God Himself, asks for forgiveness for Calderón's faults, and says that his intentions as the playwright was to point back to God."

"Angelica Rock is a small barren rock island emerging from Buzzards Bay, within the town limits of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. The rock is privately owned and is located southwest of Sconticut Neck and Wilbur's Point. The island is home to a number of sea birds as well as a nonfunctional windmill structure."
"The Town of Fairhaven refers to it as ""Angelica Island,"" while official nautical charts refer to it as ""Angelica Rock."""
"In the early 1970s, the island was purchased by Dr. Aris T. Papas, a clinical psychologist and professor who intended to build a summer home there. Papas and his son constructed the windmill by hauling materials via rowboat, and the windmill was functional until it was destroyed by a storm months later. However, the summer home plans were abandoned and a concrete slab from the project remains there today."
"A family member tried to sell the island in the mid 1990s for about $100,000, but had no buyers. The island has been described as a local landmark and is a frequent subject for photographers. The property is still owned by the Papas family."

= = = Phileine Says Sorry = = =
"Phileine Says Sorry () is a Dutch/American 2003 comedy-drama film directed by Robert Jan Westdijk. It is based on the novel ""Phileine zegt sorry"" by Ronald Giphart."
"The story is about Phileine (Kim van Kooten) and her actor boyfriend Max (Michiel Huisman). He goes to New York City to improve his acting skills. Later on, without Max knowing it, Phileine also travels to New York."
"On the plane, she meets an American couple, Fabian and Lena, who offer to bring her to Max's house. Fabian gives Phileine his phone number to call him during her stay for a tour. Inside Max's house, Phileine meets his friends: the bespectacled Jules, the sick Leonard, the Flemish Gulpje, the terrible Joanna and weatherman LT (Louis Theodore). That same evening, a welcome party is held, but because of all the new impressions, drinks, and fatigue, Phileine goes to bed early."
"In the morning, she finds a note from Max that he had to leave early for rehearsal but that the two of them will have dinner together in the evening. Phileine goes to the living room and meets Gulpje. Soon, they decide to be best friends and have lunch. After lunch, Phileine calls Fabian for a tour. During that tour, Fabian gets a little bit too personal so she reminds him that he has a wife."
"Max can’t make it to diner because his rehearsal runs out. Phileine spends that night with the friends of Max. Together with Gulpje, she stirs the group up because they both like to joke around at the expense of others."
"On day two, Phileine attends the premiere of Romeo and Juliet. The play shows the sexual side of society, so it is played naked and shows sex and masturbation scenes. Part of the audience is so shocked that after the break, they call out their displeasure and leave the theater. Phileine is astonished but remains still in her seat until the end."
"At the after party, she tries to obtain explanations about what had happened on stage. She asks Max and the director Reginald, but neither gives her an answer. She quarrels with Max but settles the matter later in a pub. The next day, she goes with Gulpje to the restaurant where the scene from “When Harry Met Sally"" was filmed. Phileine and Gulpje get the attention of two men and they invite them to their table. They want to show off their tricks and begin gently with panting and moaning. Initially the men find it funny, but when Phileine and Gulpje start screaming, the whole thing gets embarrassing and they run out the restaurant."
"A little later the women run into Jules and start a conversation about sexual harassment from men. After an insulting remark by Phileine, Jules departs. Only then does she discover that Jules is not female but male. Phileine goes to meet LT, the boyfriend of 'terrible Joanna', on his boat on the water. They have sex in 'revenge' for the escapade between Joanna and Max on stage."
"The next day, they decide to go to the last performance of the show. From the back of the theater, they see that Max is about to penetrate Joanna on stage. This time, Phileine will not let this happen and makes a huge scene by disrupting the play. Max tries to defend his action by explaining it as art. Phileine doesn’t accept this and gets the audience on her side in the argument."
"The day after, the newspapers are filled with what happened in the theater and Phileine is requested for a number of TV shows. She goes to David Letterman's show where she takes control over the show and wins the support of the audience. She is provided with money so she can stay the night in a hotel. The next day, Max is at her door to take her to an AIDS Gala of his friend Leonard. She doesn’t want to go with him, so he lifts her up over his shoulder and takes her to a taxi."
"The atmosphere between Phileine and the other people is hostile at the Gala. Except for Gulpje, Phileine has offended everybody else. Even Max is furious at her because he finds out she has slept with LT. Eventually Phileine realizes why everyone is mad at her. She gets on the stage and delivers a speech in which she says sorry for the first time in her life to everyone who she has treated rudely. She ends the speech with: ""Sorry that I exist."""

"In the spring of 602, the Goth Witteric, one of the conspirators with Sunna de Mérida to reestablish Arianism in 589, was given command of the army to repulse the Byzantines. From his position of power at the head of the army, he surrounded himself with people in his confidence. When it came time to expel the Byzantines, Witteric instead used his troops to strike at the king in the spring of 603. Invading the royal palace, and deposing the young king, he counted on the support of a faction of nobles in opposition to the dynasty of Leovigild. Witteric cut off the king's right hand and later had him condemned and executed in the summer of 603."
= = = William Howard Taft National Historic Site = = =
"William Howard Taft National Historic Site is a historic house at 2038 Auburn Avenue in the Mount Auburn Historic District of Cincinnati, Ohio, a mile (1.6 km) north of Downtown. It was the birthplace and childhood home of William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States and the 10th Chief Justice of the United States. The two-story Greek Revival house, built circa 1835, is a reminder of the elegant era when wealthier people here could escape the dirt, heat, smoke and crowded conditions of the lower city."
"William Howard Taft's father, Alphonso Taft, came to Cincinnati from Vermont in 1838 to establish a law practice. He moved his family to this house a little over a decade later. Alphonso Taft became an early supporter of the Republican Party in Cincinnati. He lived in this house with his family and parents. He would eventually serve as the 31st United States Secretary of War and the 35th United States Attorney General."
"The house is believed to have been built in the early 1840s by a family named Bowen. Alphonso bought the house at 60 Auburn Street (now 2038 Auburn Avenue), with its accompanying 1.82 acres, for $10,000 on June 13, 1851. Mount Auburn was once a popular area to live for upper-class Cincinnatians, as it allowed those of higher incomes to escape the sweltering heat and humidity of downtown Cincinnati summers. The Taft residence, a Greek Revival domicile, was relatively modest compared to other nearby residences, which were a mix of Second Empire, Italianate, and Georgian Revival."
"Alphonso's wife Fanny Phelps Taft died a year after the family moved to the Mount Auburn residence, in June 1852. In December 1853 Alphonso remarried, choosing a schoolteacher from Massachusetts named Louise Torrey. Louise Taft would give birth to their second child, William Howard Taft, in the house on September 15, 1857, presumably in the first-floor nursery in the rear ell. (The first child had died at age fourteen months from whooping cough.) Alphonso had six children living in the house, two by Fanny (three others had died beforehand) and four by Louise."
"The house was used for social events. Visitors included many local and state dignitaries, including future President James A. Garfield. Rugs in the parlor were often rolled up for dancing. Family activities took place in the library; Alphonso was an avid book collector."
"William would live in the house until he went to Yale University in 1874. Afterward, the Taft family would spend less time in the house, starting when Alphonso served in the Ulysses S. Grant administration. In 1877 a fire damaged the second floor and roof. Alphonso and Louise would lease the house in 1889, moving to California because the climate was thought to be beneficial for those with declining health. William had married in 1886, and the rest of the Taft sons had moved out by this point as well. In May 1891 Alphonso died in San Diego, California, and was buried in Cincinnati; the tenants of the Auburn house allowed the mourners to gather at the house for the funeral. Louise eventually was able to sell the house outright, after ten years of trying, in 1899 to Judge Albert C. Thompson, after returning to her home town of Millbury, Massachusetts, to live with her sister."
"In the 13th century, (this conflict formed the backdrop for some of Dante Alighieri's ""Divine Comedy"", completed in 1320)."
"A crossroads near the rue Camollia. On the outskirts of Sienna, the banned Guelphs and the reigning Ghibellines fight. The Guelphs are led by Orso who had been banished for having dared to throw a garland to the Ghibelline Cordelia Saracini. From the battle the guelfes emerge victorious at the portcullis of the Saracini palace. Orso demands that Cordelia appear at the balcony and open the gates to the town. Cordelia replies to him: « … now is not the time to open the gates, when thieves are in the town! » Orso give orders for an assault, the gate rises and he enters the Saracini palace bent on vengeance. Rather than throw Cordelia from the window as the screaming crowd demands, he drags her half-strangled back into the palace."
"Premier tableau – a great hall in the Seigniory palace. Despite their apparent victory, the Guelphs only control but half of the city. Among the dead on the Ghibelline side is Andreino, the fifteen-year-old son of Uberta, Cordelia's old nurse. The Guelphs request a truce in order to tend to the injured and bury the dead : plague is feared. The Saracini palace is on fire. Cordelia comes back, alive, but tells her brothers Ercole and Giugurta, as well as her nurse, that she has been raped by a man of whom all she can remember is the voice."
"Deuxième tableau – the cathedral square. Guelphs and Ghibellines attend the solemn mass for the Virgin in the cathedral. At the point of coming to blows, the Bishop Azzolino steps forward and upbraids them : « Siennois, is this what you call a truce for the Virgin ? Church is God's house alone ! – Faithless and unworthy Christians put your weapons down or I will close these doors and will open them only to admit your coffins! » They defer in the face of the threat; Orso only speaking a word but it is enough for Cordelia to recognize as she follows the men into the church."
"Premier tableau – a cloister. While Cordelia recognizes Orso as her torturer, Uberta learns by chance that the killer of her son is also Orso ! The two women argue over which should kill him. Cordelia decides with her plea : « You only mourn a death; I, I mourn myself, alive! ». Cordelia strikes Orso, and he falls to the ground, his throat cut with a dagger thrust. As a fight ensues, his men carry him, still breathing, to the shade of a church porch. When Cordelia and Uberta retrace steps to finish their vengeance, they cannot find the body and wonder if he was only injured. Cordelia cries out : « God of vengeance ! let him be dead ! I will not finish the task ! »."
"Deuxième tableau – the square. Cordelia discovers Orso in agony and pleading for a drink. Faced with this suffering, she pities him and pours fresh water on his lips."
"Premier tableau – a room in the Saracini palace. Cordelia has concealed Orso in the burnt palace. Giugurta, beaten, must flee the town. He wants to leave the palace by the gardens but to do that must pass through the room where Orso is hiding, convalescent. Cordelia puts him off with such insistence that Uberta becomes suspicious. A horrific explanation finally reveals the truth to Uberta, but Cordelia asks for mercy in the name of Andreino who would have condemned this bloody sacrifice. Cordelia and Orso find themselves alone. Two images alternate in the mind of Orso : the woman who stabbed him and the woman who saved him. The two make one victim of him; his repentance bursts forth and to restore her honour he asks to marry her. Cordelia replies that he is also guilty to his country riven by war. Orso promises her : « You will see me again when I have triumphed over discord and vanquished hatred! » He leaves the palace and it is announced that Giugurta has been arrested by the Guelphs, masters of the city."
"Deuxième tableau – ruins of the old Seigniory palace. The captured Ghibelline prisoners including Giurgurta are about to be executed. Orso enters and proposes to the people that the prisoners be freed, in order to march against the Emperor laying siege to the city and demanding 50,000 florins to lift the siege. The people accept. As they set off for battle Giugurta catches a glance and words from Cordelia to Orso, and says that he will return and question her after the battle."
"Sienna cathedral. The Siennese return victorious. Cordelia, frightened by her brother's threats has taken refuge in the cathedral. Giugurta find her there having extracted the information before killing Uberta. After proud protests, Cordelia faints on the altar steps, and he takes advantage to make her swallow poison. The victors come in with Orso at their head. Cordelia has convulsions which are mistaken for the plague. The crowd disperses in horror, and Orso takes Cordelia in his arms. So doing, he condemns himself to be trapped with her in the place tainted by the plague. At their pleas, Azollino joins them in marriage. Alone, they exchange parting words : Orso's wound has re-opened, and the two lovers die side by side."

"Dhamaal (; English translation: ""Fun"") is a 2007 Indian comedy film directed by Indra Kumar and produced by Ashok Thakeria. The film stars Sanjay Dutt, Ritesh Deshmukh, Arshad Warsi, Aashish Chaudhary and Javed Jaffrey in the lead roles while Asrani, Sanjay Mishra, Vijay Raaz, Manoj Pahwa and Tiku Talsania are featured in supporting roles. It is heavily inspired from Rat Race which is a 2001 American comedy film directed by Jerry Zucker, and some scenes are shot-for-shot copies from other Mr. Bean Movies. It is the first installment of ""Dhamaal film series"". The film was remade on 2008 Kannada movie ""Mast Maja Maadi""."
"In 2011, the film spawned a sequel, under the title of ""Double Dhamaal"", with the lead cast reprising their roles."
"A third sequel, under the name ""Total Dhamaal"" was released in February 2019, with only Deshmukh, Warsi and Jaffrey returning with an entirely new cast and a fresh story, having no connections to ""Dhamaal"" and ""Double Dhamaal."""
"Four good-for-nothing friends - Roy (Ritesh Deshmukh), Adi (Arshad Warsi), Boman (Aashish Chaudhary), and Manav(Javed Jaffrey) - are kicked out of their house by their landlady (Suhasini Mulay) for not paying their rents. Desperate to earn money, they devise up a plan. Adi tells Manav to steal a painting from the house. They decide to sell it to the son of the late Businessman Dwiwedi. However, Manav accidentally picks up a blank painting not knowing the reality. They humorously sell the painting for Rs.20,000 to Dwiwedi. They then pick up the original painting with the intention to sell it to Mr. Aggarwal, not knowing that he has been murdered. The case is handled by Inspector Kulkarni (Murli Sharma). He learns that before Mr. Aggrawal was murdered, he was speaking on the phone to somebody and he mentioned the words ""horse"" and ""grass."" He interprets these words to be some code language. The four arrive at Agrawal's residence. Kulkarni demands to see the painting. Seeing the horse and grass on the painting, he immediately arrests them."
"On the highway, Kulkarni drops the four on the road after realizing that they are innocent. The four are overjoyed until they suddenly witness a car accident of Don Bose (Prem Chopra). He tells them that he has hidden a treasure of 10 crore in the St. Sebastian garden in Goa under a big 'W'. He tells them to divide the money equally among themselves and then dies. They come across Inspector Kabir Nayak (Sanjay Dutt) who has been trying to arrest Bose for the past ten years. He tries to extract information from the four but in vain, they escape from there and decide to travel to Goa. Desperate for his promotion, Kabir is determined to capture the four. All four friends steal Boman's car which belongs to his father Nari (Asrani), who loves his car more than his son and threw his son out after he damaged his car. The friends manage to steal their car but not before hitting Nari on the head and making him unconscious. Roy loses control of the car in a forest and hits it against a tree, breaking both headlights. They decide to spend the night in the car. The next day Kabir is transferred to Yavatmal for failing to capture Bose. Furious he walks towards his table where Nari is waiting for him to file a complaint against his son for stealing his car. He gives Kabir the photos of Boman and his car. Meanwhile, all four come across a broken bridge which is the only way through the forest. They decide to jump the car but Boman is reluctant to do so. They manage to jump the car on the other side but it blasts off."
"Kabir tracks the four down after discovering the destroyed car. He is able to learn the location of the treasure due to Manav's dumbness. He ties all four of them to a tree and sets off. However they manage to escape and it is revealed that Roy had actually cut the engine wires of Kabir's car so he must have not gone too far. They reach a dhabha and pretend to be detectives. They make the villagers believe that Kabir is a member of the Pasha gang and lures them to capture him for the reward would be Rs. 15 lakhs. Kabir defeats the villagers and he and the four arrive at a settlement - 60% would belong to the four and 40% would belong to Kabir. But Boman insists on having his money separately for damaging his car from the rest of the three. Consequently, a fight ensues and is decided that whoever reaches the treasure first would take all the money."
"All four part ways and try to reach Goa as soon as possible. Roy encounters a dacoit Babubhai (Sanjay Mishra) and agree to divide the money among themselves provided they reach Goa as soon as possible. Boman also encounters his father. Though Nari initially wants to kill his son, changes his mind after he learns about the ten crores. Adi and Manav travel together. Kabir nearly escapes death as he hangs off a cliff and is rescued by some school children whose school bus he stole. All of them go through a series of humorous adventures before reaching Goa. All of them except Kabir reach the garden at the same time. Finally Roy explains that it is useless finding the treasure alone and all agree to find the money together. They all search for the big 'W'. Manav is able to locate the Palm trees which make the shape of a 'W' when a crow defecates on Adi. But Kabir arrives there and tells them to divide the money against them to which all agree. They dig there and are able to find the money. But again a fight ensues over the payment for the damage of the car. All are enraged when Adi and Manav decide to pay the money as one unit but are separate units while taking money. The fight goes on during which Kabir takes all the money and runs. He tries to escape in a hot air balloon on a beach but finds it tied to a pole. He dives in an effort to cut the rope but is beaten up by the rest who pursue him. The balloon blows off shore and all are disheartened. Conditions change when the wind changes direction and the balloon again blows onshore. They follow the balloon in a towing van. The balloon clashes against a pole and the bag falls down. All of them try to collect as much money as they can when suddenly some spot lights focus on them and a crowd cheers loudly behind them. They are actually standing in stage where a function is being held by an organisation named 'Help Orphans'. Seeing the money everybody thinks they have come here to donate money. All of them get emotional and all decide to donate the money for the orphans. The film ends on a happy note conveying that the fate of the money was already decided. It never belonged to the four friends. They were just a medium which helped the money reach its true destination."
"The film's soundtrack is composed by Adnan Sami with lyrics penned by Sameer. The songs, ""Dekho Dekho"" and ""Miss India Marthi Mujhpe"", were both known as the title song, since the main chorus of both the songs included the title ""Dhamaal""."
"A sequel named ""Double Dhamaal"" was released in 2011. Third film of the franchise was named Total Dhamaal and released in 2019. Both the movies became huge box office hits."

"Delgadillo was also invited to the ""Youth Festival"" in Cuba, and in 1998, he presented his first CD in front of a major audience in the Metropolitan Theater in Mexico City. Later on, he played alongside Cuban musician Silvio Rodríguez during his Mexican tour in the National Auditorium."
"Later on, he recorded a compilation of his work in Spain."
"Currently, he plays in major Mexican theatres on a regular basis."
"He mostly writes about everyday happenings, and has been often called the creator of an ""informal"" kind of songwriting. He is a master of metaphors and deals with topics such as nature, the longing of someone special, birthday gifts, popcorn fights, hot phone calls, etc. He specializes in describing the extraordinary out of something very ordinary."
= = = Srinkal = = =
Srinkhal () is a collection of short stories in the Assamese language written by Bhabendra Nath Saikia. The author received the Sahitya Akademi award for the collection in 1976.
The book contains 14 stories:
"Starting his career at Dortmund in 1996 he managed just 15 appearances for the club and eventually moved to 2. Fußball-Bundesliga club 1. FC Köln where he went on to make 65 appearances in his three years at the club scoring 15 goals and helping the club gain promotion into the Bundesliga. He was tipped for national team selection but a series of injuries meant he was regularly out of action. In 2002, he moved to 1. FC Kaiserslautern and then on to SpVgg Greuther Fürth two years later where he made over 81 appearances for the club and netted 21 goals."
"His good performances attracted several Bundesliga clubs and Timm decided to move to Karlsruher SC in July 2007, where he signed a three-year contract. On 27 June 2009, his contract was extended until 30 June 2012. In July 2011, the club told Timm that he will not be part of the squad any longer, yet all subsequent attempts to reach mutual consent on an earlier termination of his contract failed. Timm made use of his right to participate in the training sessions but he had not been given a shirt number for the 2011–12 season. He was restored to the squad but was released by KSC at the end of the season"

"Bill Schuffenhauer (born June 24, 1973) is an American bobsledder who has competed since 2000. Competing in three Winter Olympics, he won the silver medal in the four-man event at Salt Lake City in 2002."
"Bill grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah and as a child, his mother was a prostitute and drug addict who was often beaten in front of him. He had to steal, to eat from trash cans, and once was caught trying to break into a bicycle store to try to steal something to sell for food."
"The few friends he had were mostly in street gangs, and Bill drank and smoked cannabis often. His mother was often evicted, and he lived in foster homes. Schuffenhauer's maternal grandmother, Sadie Muniz, took him in as he was about to enter junior high in Roy, Utah. ""She reminded me to never give up and always push on,"" he said."
"Because of his grandmother's influence, he began going to school and started to participate in track and field at Roy High School, due to his great speed. He persevered to become an Olympian, and his coaches encouraged him greatly as well. He soon became a decathlete. He went to Weber State University and there he won the junior nationals in 1992. Additionally he played American football in high school."
"Schuffenhauer's Olympics dream as a track and field athlete came to an end in 2000. While training for Sydney, he suffered a bad ankle injury and he could barely walk. When his friend told him that the U.S. Olympic team was practicing bobsledding in Park City, he took the chance to go and observe. While there, the team members noticed his 6-foot, 200 pound frame and asked him he wanted to be a pusher. He accepted and trained with the team from then on."
"He was not originally slated to be a regular member, but was promoted when one of the U.S. four-man team members tested positive for steroids. That crew, piloted by Todd Hays, won a silver medal at the Salt Lake Games."
"At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy, Bill's two-man team placed 14th, after which he retired. He had two children and he felt responsible for them. Bobsledders earn only a meager amount, but Bill made the tough decision to continue to aspire for qualification for Vancouver. He fought through a neck injury (2 herniated disks) with the help of a chiropractor and a team physician."
"In January 2010, in St. Moritz, Switzerland, Bill and his 3 USA teammates placed sixth and qualified for Vancouver and it was officially announced on January 17, 2010 that Bill's team would represent the United States at Vancouver. They finished 13th in the four-man event."
"""The dream is happening right now. I'm here. That's all I wanted,"" he said. Then he added, ""It would be nice to get a medal of any color."""
= = = Trams in New Zealand = = =
"Trams in New Zealand were a major form of transport from the 19th century into the mid-20th century. New Zealand's first (horse) tramway was established in 1862 (Nelson), followed by a steam tramway in 1871 (Thames), and the first electric tramway in 1900 (Maori Hill, Dunedin). The tram systems in the main centres, and in some smaller towns, were soon electrified. By the 1950s, all systems were in the process of being replaced by trolley-buses or buses. The last tram service closed in 1964, in Wellington. A tram running parallel with a public road opened in Western Springs, Auckland, in 1980 and a central city loop line in Christchurch in 1995. Both are heritage lines."
"Some moves are proceeding to extend tram use in New Zealand again. In Auckland, the MOTAT line was extended in 2006–07 to reach a second site of the museum, and the former Auckland Regional Council promoted the creation of an Auckland waterfront tram line, originally with MOTAT vehicles, but will initially operate former Melbourne trams leased from Bendigo Tramways Company Limited. The Auckland Tramway Limited opened 6 August 2011 with the support of Waterfront Auckland (later merged into Panuku Development Auckland) and the new Auckland Council."
"In Christchurch, the city loop is currently operating on a limited circuit after being reopened 27 November 2013 following the Christchurch earthquake of 2011 which halted services while the CBD was closed off. The tramway was being extended in several small stages starting late 2000s and was nearly complete when the 2011 earthquake struck. While these proposals are all officially heritage / tourist lines, there is some investigation into later extension or conversion for normal transport use. This line was extended in 2014 with the reopening of the full pre-earthquake circuit and the opening of the nearly complete extension through the mall and High Street."
"In 1862 the first horse tramway in New Zealand, between Nelson and the port, opened as part of the Dun Mountain Railway, built to export ore from the mine in the hills above Nelson. Other horse-drawn tram systems were built on the West Coast of the South Island, where a gold rush started in 1864."
"Horse-drawn lines also opened in the main centres; Auckland and Devonport in 1886, Dunedin 1879, Christchurch 1880 and Dunedin 1879."
"At Grahamstown (now Thames) in the North Island where gold had also been found, a steam tramway to Tararu was opened on 2 December 1871, but closed on 11 November 1874, due to 'not sufficient traffic'. A steam locomotive for the tramway was built at Mechanics Bay in 1872 by Fraser and Tinne."
"As a divisional point, Biscotasing did not last much beyond the era of construction, as Chapleau, about midway between Sudbury and Lake Superior, was selected to replace it. Soon after, the town lost its importance as a railroad town but still existed as a quiet fur trading town. The railway provided an inland access point to waterways flowing south to Lake Huron and north to James Bay, and the town subsequently developed as a centre for Indian trade in the region."
"The local water routes also helped to develop Biscotasing as a major centre for lumbering. In 1884, Public Lands Surveyor James Allan noted that timber in the area had been overrun by fires and was of very little value, consisting mostly of scrubby spruce and small pitch pine. The same year a sawmill was in operation at Biscotasing, mostly to serve the requirements of CPR construction."
"The first permanent sawmill was established by Sadler and O'Neil in the early 1890s. Robert Booth and Patrick Shannon, were also actively logging this region from 1895. Booth and Shannon produced square timber, which was taken by CPR to Papineauville for export to Britain, from the Port of Quebec in Quebec. By 1903 Booth and Shannon were the only lumber producers in Biscotasing, possibly having taken over and expanding the O'Neil mill which closed in 1898."
"The original Booth and Shannon mill was destroyed by fire 1913-06-13. It was subsequently rebuilt, at which time Robert Booth left the partnership, with Patrick's son, the firm was reorganized as P. & G. Shannon. In 1923 the mill was sold to Midland lumbermen Pratt and Shanacy. The mill closed in 1927 for lack of timber. The mill was dismantled and removed by 1938."
"Many of the old buildings in Biscotasing that survive today are from the sawmill era. A small steam locomotive, once used to switch cars of lumber from the mill to the lumber piling grounds, sat for many years, derelict on the mill property, across the tracks, opposite the Pratt and Shanacy company store. In 1958, David L. Pratt, of Toronto donated his father's steam engine for display at the Algonquin Provincial Park Logging Museum."
"From railway construction camp, to fur trade depot and lumbering centre, in 1922 Biscotasing became the first place in Northern Ontario to use aircraft (Curtiss NC) for forest fire surveillance."

"In number theory, a provable prime is an integer that has been calculated to be prime using a primality-proving algorithm. Contrast with probable prime, which is likely (but not certain) to be prime, based on the output of a probabilistic primality test. In principle, every prime number can be proved to be prime in polynomial time by using the AKS primality test. In practice, other methods which guarantee that their result is prime, but which do not work for all primes, are useful for the random generation of provable primes."

"Before Frio went to sleep, he read a Tales legend again. But this one ended strangely: the hero arrives too late and the world is destroyed."
"When Frio and Kyaro wake up, they find out the machine has been stolen. Not long after they find out, a re-color of the machine appears. The one boarding it was Dr. White, Dr. Brown from 100 days into the future whose hair had turned white from extreme stress."
"There are thieves who are ruining the timeline of the Tales legends, and they have to be stopped. Dr. White now needs Frio and Kyaro to help stop the thieves and brings with him the aid of the heroes from Tales of Symphonia, Destiny, and Eternia."
"Tales of the World: Narikiri Dungeon 3 is a turn-based tactical RPG as well as a real-time RPG. Battles take place in enclosed areas that include ally parties and enemy units. Players move parties (consisting of three characters each) by selecting the sprite of the party's player-controlled character, and selecting the target location on the map. The limit of where the party can travel is indicated by dots between the target destination and the starting point of the party. When the dots are gray, the party can move to that location, as long as an obstacle does not block him/her. If it is red, then the target is out of range. The player can alter the destination of the party at any time during the player's turn. When the player ends the turn, all ally parties will move simultaneously. When one of the players' parties comes in contact with an enemy party, the player engages in a LMBS-style battle. In a typical RPG fashion, players level up their party members to gain stat increases. Like many Tales games, Narikiri Dungeon 3 includes the aspect of cooking: players can use acquired ingredients to prepare meals that affect party members, like replenishing HP, or temporarily gaining a certain stat in battle."

"""Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress"" (also titled ""Long Cool Woman"" or ""Long Cool Woman (in a Black Dress)"") is a song written by Allan Clarke, Roger Cook, and Roger Greenaway and performed by the British rock group The Hollies. Originally appearing on the album ""Distant Light"", it was released as a single on 17 April 1972 (on Parlophone in the United Kingdom), selling 1.5 million copies in the United States and two million worldwide. It reached No. 2 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 in September 1972. ""Billboard"" ranked it as the No. 24 song for 1972."
"On the day ""Long Cool Woman"" was recorded at AIR Studios, the group's producer, Ron Richards, was ill and, as a result, the song was produced by the group. The song is different from most other Hollies songs in that there are no three-part vocal harmonies, and the song features lead guitar and lead vocal work by Allan Clarke. Upon his return, Ron Richards mixed the recording."
"The song was written in the swamp rock style of Creedence Clearwater Revival, in terms of the vocal, rhythm, and melodic style. It came out in the spring of 1972 (the same year Creedence split up). Clarke imitated John Fogerty's vocal style, which was based on the Creedence song ""Green River"". According to Clarke, the song was written ""in about five minutes""."
"In the Hollies' native United Kingdom, the song was only a modest success for the band, peaking at number 32 on the charts. However, it was a smash hit in the United States, peaking at number 2 for two weeks behind Gilbert O'Sullivan’s ""Alone Again (Naturally)"". It was their highest charting single in that country. It also topped the charts in South Africa and peaked at number 2 in New Zealand and Australia. By this time, Clarke had already left the band, but he feels that ""it wasn't unfortunate"", since he had co-written the song. Clarke rejoined the Hollies in the summer of 1973, partly due to the success of this song."
"Soyarabai was a saint from the Mahar caste in 14th century Maharashtra, India. She was a disciple of her husband, Chokhamela."
"Soyarabai framed large literature using blank verse of her own devising. She wrote much but only about 62 works are known. In her Abhang she refers to herself as Chokhamela's Mahari, accuses god for forgetting Dalits and of making life bad. Her most basic verses concern the simple food she gives the god. Her poems describe her devotion towards god and voice her objections to untouchability."
"Soyarabai believed that ""The body only can be impure or polluted, but the soul is ever clean, pure knowledge. The body is born unclean and so how can anybody claim to be pure in body? The body has much pollution. But the pollution of the body remains in the body. The soul is untouched by it."""
Soyarabai undertook an annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur with her husband. They were harassed by orthodox Brahmins but never lost their faith and peace of mind.
= = = Atmospheric optics ray-tracing codes = = =
Atmospheric optics ray tracing codes - this article list codes for light scattering using ray-tracing technique to study atmospheric optics phenomena such as rainbows and halos. Such particles can be large raindrops or hexagonal ice crystals. Such codes are one of many approaches to calculations of light scattering by particles.
"Ray tracing techniques can be applied to study light scattering by spherical and non-spherical particles under the condition that the size of a particle is much larger than the wavelength of light. The light can be considered as collection of separate rays with width of rays much larger than the wavelength but smaller than a particle. Rays hitting the particle undergoes reflection, refraction and diffraction. These rays exit in various directions with different amplitudes and phases. Such ray tracing techniques are used to describe optical phenomena such as rainbow of halo on hexagonal ice crystals for large particles."
Review of several mathematical techniques is provided in series of publications.
The 46° halo was first explained as being caused by refractions through ice crystals in 1679 by the French physicist Edmé Mariotte (1620–1684) in terms of light refraction
Jacobowitz in 1971 was the first to apply the ray-tracing technique to hexagonal ice crystal. Wendling et al. (1979) extended Jacobowitz's work from hexagonal ice particle with infinite length to finite length and combined Monte Carlo technique to the ray-tracing simulations.
"The compilation contains information about the electromagnetic scattering by hexagonal ice crystals, large raindrops, and relevant links and applications."

He spoke about “Lay It Down” which is produced by Willie B, saying: ""Shout out to Willie B. He fuck with Jay Rock and them. He produced that shit. That’s one of them hard-hitting joints. It’s going straight to the point. Lay it down. That’s a robbing song."" He also spoke about “Have U Seen Her” which features Hit Skrewface, saying: ""This is featuring my boy Screwface. SMKA, they produced that. That’s one of them bangers. It’s hard.”"
"""ESGN"" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, which indicates ""generally favorable reviews"", based on 5 reviews. Anthony Asencio of HipHopDX gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying ""Ultimately, ""ESGN"" may not be a cultural event. It doesn’t introduce a new sound, nor does it feature many moments we haven’t heard before. Yet what makes this album important are all the reasons Hip Hop needs Freddie Gibbs. On any one album, he can give you pieces of Tupac, UGK, Three 6 Mafia, and blend them into a harmony that would make Bone Thugs-n-Harmony proud. And on that point, ESGN is a massive success."" Chris Mench of ""XXL"" gave the album an L, saying ""None of this criticism is to say that ""ESGN"" is a bad album. Freddie is a talented rapper with great flow and a wise selection of collaborators, and many songs are individually effective. Rather, it is simply an album that lacks a clear perspective on the many heavy topics it tackles. A first time listener may walk away feeling very familiar with Freddie Gibbs’ sound, but still unsure of who exactly he is."" David Amidon of PopMatters gave the album a seven out of ten, saying ""For those hip-hop fans forever in pursuit of the latest glass-shattering bass and semi-auto mob rules, ""ESGN"" is likely 2013’s flagship release. This is Gibbs’ deep breath; let's see what direction he takes off running in next."""
"Chris Bosman of Consequence of Sound gave the album four out of five stars, saying ""Gibbs’ EPs and mixtapes tend to run long, and ""ESGN"" – at 19 tracks — is no exception. The length is a weakness. The bleakness of Gibbs’ world, even when it's going well, can leave you gasping. The shock is somewhat lost in the number of tracks. In the scheme of the album, it's a minor quibble. ""ESGN"" digs new paths through rap's hallowed grounds. It may not be the crossover success that those who ride for Gibbs would love to see, but it doesn’t diminish this excellent record."" Jonah Bromwich of Pitchfork Media gave the album a 6.9 out of 10, saying ""On “Hundred Thousand"", Gibbs supplies a perfect—and, true to form, concise—review of ""ESGN"" himself. “Ain’t trying to be the man, just trying to maintain.” Callin an album ""more of the same"" sounds dismissive but its something that fans are often happy to receive and there are those for whom 20 tracks of Gibbs rapping nearly perfectly will be enough. But for everyone else, ""ESGN"" comes as an unwelcome reversion to the mean. It's the sound of a rapper more than happy to maintain his narrow lane after being burned by the industry, one who's lost the ambition to leave his comfort zone, at least for the time being."""

"Eleanor Rigby is a 2004 novel by Douglas Coupland, about a lonely woman at ages 36 and 42. The novel is written as a first-person narrative by the main character, Liz Dunn."
"The novel centres on changes to Liz's life when someone from her past unexpectedly re-enters her life. It is written in a light, often comic, tone, but resonates on many deeper issues, including loneliness, family, religious visions and multiple sclerosis."
"Two distinct plot movements are separated by a break in the narrative flow. The first part of the novel involves two retellings: the story of Liz Dunn’s trip to Europe and her pregnancy, and the story of the re-emergence into her life of her child, Jeremy, who is dying of multiple sclerosis."
"As a teenager, Liz goes on a trip to Europe, her one big expressive moment. On this trip, while drunk, she loses her virginity in Italy to a man she cannot remember. From this experience, she becomes pregnant with Jeremy, who is put up for adoption, and goes in and out of foster families for much of his young life."
"Jeremy arrives back into Liz’s life when she is at a low point of loneliness. His illness is terminal, and because of drug abuse, he has only a short time to live. Jeremy’s introduction into Liz’s life rattles the lonely world she has constructed, opening up her and her world."
"The first part of the novel, narrated by Liz, jumps between these two moments, constantly reminding the reader that these are moments in the past. There is a symbolic page break between the first section, which takes place in the past, and the second section, which takes place in the novel’s present."
"In the present, Jeremy has died. Liz finds a meteorite that she takes to be a very precious object. She sleeps with it under her pillow to keep it close. She eventually, through a list of circumstances, decides to travel to Europe to find Jeremy’s father, a trip which again leads her to a world of excitement, police and army incidents, and a reunion with Jeremy’s father."
"Liz Dunn is the protagonist of this novel. She is an overweight, lonely woman, who lives a removed solitary existence. Her apartment, for instance, can only accommodate one person."
"Coupland has spoken extensively about the character of Liz Dunn, claiming that she was his most realistic character."
"Liz’s son Jeremy, who was sent out for adoption, has a terminal case of multiple sclerosis. He has traveled through the foster-care system of British Columbia, residing with many families who abused him. He eventually reconnects with Liz after finding her and registers her as his next of kin for emergencies. When he is hospitalized, Liz reconnects with her son."
"Jeremy is cheerful in the face of his condition, happy with the life that he has left to lead. He eventually becomes a successful mattress salesman in the time leading up to his death. He experiences visions of a post-apocalyptic future, which enthralls Liz. He envisions a future where crops have gone foul and farmers ask a divine voice for guidance."
The inspiration for Eleanor Rigby was loneliness. Coupland suffered through a period in his early twenties he describes as being caused by loneliness.
"The novel is named after The Beatles' song of the same name. The song reference was inspired from a moment in Coupland's past. Coupland heard the song ""on a friend's mother's record player. And the story threw me: 'Oh my God, what happened to her?' The lyrics didn't tell you much but in my head I always saw her as an only child of very old parents who didn't have a clue and she was left in a rectory and died without leaving any mark anywhere ... The book's not like that, of course, but it's the mood and the way Liz describes herself."" The song itself features in the narrative as it is Liz Dunn's email address."

= = = Rubber chicken = = =
"A rubber chicken is a prop used in comedy. The phrase is also used as a description for food served at speeches, conventions, and other large meetings, and as a metaphor for speechmaking."
A rubber chicken is an imitation plucked fowl made in a latex injection mold.
"The origin of the rubber chicken is obscure, but is possibly based on the use of pig bladders, which were inflated, attached to a stick and used as props or mock-weapons by jesters in the days before the development of plastic and latex. Chicken corpses were readily available; therefore jesters could employ them as variations of slapsticks."
"One account attributes the first use of a prop chicken to John Holmberg, the Swedish black-faced clown of the early 1900s. Holmberg would perform with his pockets full of fake food to mock the gluttony reportedly prevalent among the upper classes at the time."
A claim that the symbol originated during the French Revolution with soldiers hanging a chicken from their muskets for luck is printed on the tag of rubber chickens manufactured by Archie McPhee.
"The term ""rubber chicken"" is used disparagingly to describe the food served at political or corporate events, weddings, and other gatherings where there are a large number of guests who require serving in a short timeframe. Often, pre-cooked chicken is held at serving temperature for some time and then dressed with a sauce as it is served. Consequently, the meat may be tough or “rubbery.” Someone who ""travels the rubber chicken circuit"" is said to do so by attending or making speeches at many such gatherings, often as part of political campaigning."

"Ridley Creek State Park is a Pennsylvania state park in Edgmont, Middletown and Upper Providence Townships, Delaware County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The park, about north of the county seat of Media, offers many recreational activities, such as hiking, biking, fishing, and picnicking. Ridley Creek passes through the park. Highlights include a paved multi-use trail, a formal garden designed by the Olmsted Brothers, and Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation, which recreates daily life on a pre-Revolutionary farm. The park is adjacent to the John J. Tyler Arboretum. Ridley Creek State Park is just over from downtown, Philadelphia between Pennsylvania Route 352 and Pennsylvania Route 252 on Gradyville Road."
"The bulk of the property was acquired in the late 1960s from the estate of well known horse breeder Walter M. Jeffords, Sr. and his wife Sarah, a niece of Samuel D. Riddle. The Jeffords had acquired the land starting about 1912 in small parcels, until they had over , which was the largest private undeveloped property in the Philadelphia area by the 1960s. By 1918 they had built a large mansion, now the park office, around a stone colonial farmhouse. Twenty-four other historic properties were located on the grounds, many farmsteads that had retained family ownership since the seventeenth century. In 1976 these properties were registered on the National Register of Historic Places as a national historic district."
"The area was originally settled by English Quakers and remained agrarian into the twentieth century. The oldest property is the 1683 Worrel House. In 1718 a water mill, then known as Providence Mill, began to grind corn. In the late 18th century a plaster mill was established next to the grist mill. A rolling and slitting mill replaced the plaster mill by 1812, and became known as Bishop's Mills. Workers cottages, a dam, and several outbuildings complete the mill complex, now known as Sycamore Mills. The mills operated until 1901, when they were damaged by fire."
The Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation is a living museum on the farm where the Pratt family lived from 1720 to 1820. Admission is charged and it is open to the general public on weekends from April through November.
"The location of Ridley Creek State Park, just from downtown Philadelphia, has led to its popularity. Ridley Creek is very popular with fishermen. It is stocked with trout by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. A portion of the creek is a designated catch and release area for fly fishing only. There is a wheelchair accessible fishing platform on a multi-use trail. The of hiking trails at Ridley Creek State Park are popular with dog owners. These trails pass through a variety of habitats.

= = = Life Got Cold = = =
"""Life Got Cold"" is a song by British girl group Girls Aloud, taken from their debut album ""Sound of the Underground"" (2003). The song was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. Noel Gallagher of Oasis received a writing credit due to similarities with Oasis' ""Wonderwall""."
"Released as their third single in August 2003, ""Life Got Cold"" became Girls Aloud's third consecutive top three hit on the UK Singles Chart. The song peaked at number two in Ireland and Scotland, and peaked at number 14 in Belgium."
"Set in an abandoned city, the music video suggests coldness and darkness with its blue hue. It portrays Girls Aloud moving in stunted movement. ""Life Got Cold"" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on three of Girls Aloud's concert tours. Described as a ""surprisingly poignant"", the melancholic ballad received favorable reviews from contemporary music critics; however, it was criticised for its similarities with Oasis."
"""Life Got Cold"" is a ballad written in D minor. The chord progressions vary throughout the song but the different chords include B, C, Dm, Gm, and Am. Following typical verse-chorus form, the song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. The verses are ""talk-sung"", while the bridge and chorus are song over guitar strumming. The middle 8 is a slower version of the bridge. The song tells the tale of young love that ended ""when summer slipped away."" ""Life Got Cold"" was a late addition to ""Sound of the Underground"", completed by Xenomania shortly before the album's release. Producer Brian Higgins did not take the idea of a Girls Aloud version of the song seriously until he heard the group sing it, because a track working ""has always got to be based on an artist's performance, not the music itself. But they sang it, and they really nailed the melancholic aspect of it, and it sounded beautiful."" The lyrics focus on ""the directionlessness of modern life."""
"The song received attention because of similarities between the guitar riff of ""Life Got Cold"" and that of the 1995 Oasis hit ""Wonderwall"". A BBC review stated ""part of the chorus sounds like it is going to turn into Wonderwall by Oasis."" A source told ""The Sun"" that Girls Aloud ""are all big Oasis fans so I'm sure they won't mind comparisons with their classic love song."" Warner/Chappell Music has since credited Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher. Girls Aloud later made a cameo appearance in Oasis' 2007 rockumentary ""Lord Don't Slow Me Down""."
"""Life Got Cold"" was not originally the choice for Girls Aloud's third single. Polydor Records had originally chosen ""Some Kind of Miracle"" to be released, but the plan was dropped after an overwhelming fan response to ""Life Got Cold"". The single was released on 18 August 2003 in the UK. It was available on two different CD single formats and as a cassette tape. The first CD featured a cover of the Duran Duran song ""Girls on Film"" as the b-side, which would later become the title for a Girls Aloud DVD, as well as a remix of ""No Good Advice"". The disc's enhanced section features the ""Life Got Cold"" music video and a photo gallery. The second disc included both the radio edit and album version of ""Life Got Cold"", as well as the 29 Palms Remix Edit and the Stella Browne Edit. It also came with a free fold-out poster. The cassette also featured an exclusive b-side, an original track entitled ""Lights, Music, Camera, Action"". The photos featured on the single's artwork were reshot at the last minute, following the group's request."
"""Life Got Cold"" received positive reviews from music critics, although it did receive criticism due to the similarities with the song Wonderwall by Oasis. BBC called the song a ""charming ballad"" that was ""a sweet but slightly sad pop song."" RTÉ.ie thought ""Life Got Cold"" was ""surprisingly poignant."""
"However, some noted that the chorus held many similarities to that of the Oasis song ""Wonderwall"". The songwriters dismissed claims of plagiarising Oasis. Allmusic referred to it as ""a solid ballad, suggesting a less intellectual Dido."""
"The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number three, behind Blu Cantrell's ""Breathe"" and Lemar's ""Dance (With U)"". It spent a second week in the top ten, slipping to number eight. The song spent a total of nine weeks in the top 75 overall, a far cry from the fourteen weeks ""No Good Advice"" or the twenty-one weeks that ""Sound of the Underground"" spent in the chart. ""Life Got Cold"" also debuted at number three on the Irish Singles Chart, but managed to rise to number two the following week. It spent two further weeks in the top ten, then two weeks in the top twenty. The single barely missed the top ten of the Netherlands Top 40, instead peaking at number eleven. It has since become the group's 16th best selling single domestically."
"The music video for ""Life Got Cold"" was directed by Phil Griffin, who previously directed the videos for ""Sound of the Underground"" and ""No Good Advice"". The band members are seen in stunted movement, wandering around an abandoned city setting. Both group and individual shots are shown in various scenes. Nadine Coyle is seen in front of an abandoned building, while Sarah Harding is next to a car and a phone booth. Nicola Roberts is alone in a kitchen as pouring rain can be seen on the window. Cheryl Cole is shown in an alleyway, while Kimberley Walsh is alone on a street curb. The group are shown together on an abandoned bus, in an alley at night, and sat in front of the abandoned building. The video has a slightly blue hue to it, suggesting coldness and darkness. It also makes use of lens flares."
"The video can be found on two of Girls Aloud's official DVD releases, ""Girls on Film"" (2005) and ""Style"" (2007)."
"""Life Got Cold"" was first performed live by Girls Aloud at two summer festivals in 2003, Pop Beach and Live & Loud. The first televised performance occurred on """" on 19 July 2003. The group performed in black-and-white business casual attire, as seen in the music video and on the single's artwork. They performed on ""CD:UK"" once more the following month, although Cheryl was absent due to illness. Girls Aloud also appeared on ""Diggin' It"", ""Popworld"", ""Top of the Pops"" and ""Top of the Pops Saturday"" (twice)."

"To date the band has released five studio albums, alongside several EPs, singles, and companion releases. The band won the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for their second studio album, ""The Chemistry of Common Life"". In 2018, the band released its fifth studio album, ""Dose Your Dreams"", after a hiatus. Driven by Haliechuk, it is a concept album focusing on the band's recurring character David, and featuring several guest lead vocalists, alongside Abraham, Falco, and Haliechuk."
"The band formed and played their first shows in early 2001. The initial practicing lineup consisted of 10,000 Marbles (Mike Haliechuk, lead guitar), Concentration Camp (Josh Zucker, rhythm guitar, vocals), Mustard Gas (Sandy Miranda, bass guitar) and Chris Colohan (of Left For Dead/The Swarm fame, who was lead vocalist for Cursed). Just prior to recording their demo tape, Concentration Camp concentrated on guitar duties and vocal duties were taken over from Colohan by Pink Eyes (Damian Abraham, also known as Mr. Damian). Drums were played by Mr. Jo (Jonah Falco, also credited as G. Beat or J. Falco)."
"Following the release of the demo, the band embarked on a long series of 7"" records. The band released the """"No Pasaran"""" 7"" in May 2002. The ""Police"" 7"" was released on March 2003, quickly followed the ""Baiting the Public"" 7"" in May 2003. Two more 7""'s followed in 2004, the ""Dance of Death"" single, and the ""Litany"" 4-song ep. The vinyl releases to this point were collected on 2004s ""Epics in Minutes"" CD. The band was the subject of a two-minute 16 mm film showing its links to the Toronto hardcore scene, a local infoshop and punk radio show."
"The band's use of imagery and symbolism (notable the use of Sigils) took a decided turn after the release of Epics in Minutes, as it was followed by two limited 12""s, the ""Looking for Gold"" 12"", and the live ""Let Likes be Cured by Likes"" 12"". The ""Looking for Gold"" 12"" contained no liner notes or credits, no song titles, and a hidden track. It was self-released by the band in 2004 in two limited runs of 300 and 400 copies. The title track was 16 minutes long, used 18 guitar tracks, had a three-minute drum solo and contained 5 minutes of whistling."
"In the summer of 2004 the band released the ""Generation"" 7"" and 12"" eps. After touring for most of 2005 the band took on David Eliade as a quasi-full-time manager/promoter. In early 2006 Eliade began shopping demos of songs from the planned ""Hidden World"" album to labels, ending with the band signing to Jade Tree Records for an early fall 2006 release of the album. Jade Tree is distributed by Touch & Go which in turn has a distribution agreement with ADA (Warner Music Group). Jade Tree licensed the vinyl version to Deranged Records, which released it as a double album in November 2006."
"Several other records, such as ""Year of the Dog"" 12"" were released, before the band went on the European tour, visiting England, Germany and Spain, among other places. January 16, 2007 marked the band's live television debut on ""MTV Live"", where they were introduced as ""Effed Up"". During their performance of their song ""Baiting the Public"", the majority of the audience were moshing and causing damage to the set (also visible was a cut on Damian's forehead), resulting in a sum of $2,000 in damages. This performance sparked controversy and resulted in MTV Canada banning moshing from future ""MTV Live"" performances."
"On October 9, 2008 the band returned to MTV Live, this time performing in the men's washroom. Once again, the band (and their fans) caused a large amount of damage, destroying the ceiling, spray painting walls and knocking over amps and a motorcycle which was brought into the washroom as a prop. Fans, who were told beforehand to stay out of the washroom and to watch from outside the door, rushed the doors and joined in the destruction the band had already started. The band was supposed to play three songs, but were stopped after the first song as MTV was not aware of the destruction the band had planned and were concerned about the safety of the band, audience and crew."
"On October 10 Abraham blogged about the performance on the MTV Live website, saying the bathroom performance was ""f**king out of control terrifying."""
"In November 2007, the band played a show in New York that was filmed for the movie ""Burn"", directed by Richard Roepnack. The performance was positively reviewed in the ""New York Times"", although the Times chose not to print the band's name, referring to them instead as a string of asterisks."
"The band signed to Matador Records in Spring of 2008. That summer, Matador reissued the ""Year Of The Pig"" 12"" single. This time it came out with additional formats including a series of three 7""es, for the US, UK and Japan respectively, each with a different edit of the A-side and a new B-side. A CDEP compiled all the versions from the various vinyl versions. The band toured extensively in the UK behind this release, following it with a trip up the West Coast."
"On October 7, 2008, Matador released Fucked Up's second album, ""The Chemistry Of Common Life."" It has received near-universal critical acclaim from publications such as the NME, The New York Times, Blender, Pitchfork, Alternative Press, Q Magazine and many more. The band toured the Eastern US in October, including a much-covered 12-hour long show on the Bowery in New York on October 14. They were joined by musical guests including Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend, Moby, John Joseph of the Cro-Mags, members of Endless Boogie, Les Savy Fav, Dinosaur Jr., and others."

The story is complicated by misdirection and unreliable narrators. The record debuted at No. 83 on the Billboard 200 in the US. It has received wide critical acclaim."

Guy is abusive to the weak Mia, a former nun who suffers from cardiomyopathy; his mistress, Nicole Horner, a fellow teacher at the school, is protective of Mia. When both women grow tired of his abuses, they collaborate to murder him in an apartment owned by a family friend of Nicole's. The women lure him there, and Mia drugs him before they successfully drown him in a bathtub. They wrap his body in a shower curtain and place it in a wicker box."
"While en route to the school, Nicole crashes Guy's car in a pileup on the interstate, but the wicker box goes unnoticed by authorities. The women arrive at the school in the middle of the night, and dump Guy's corpse in the unkempt swimming pool on the property, staging his death as an accidental drowning. When his body fails to rise to the surface after several days, Nicole has the pool drained, but Guy's body is nowhere to be found. The women subsequently discover photos taken of them on the day of Guy's murder, and believe someone is blackmailing them."
"After reading about the discovery of a John Doe in a nearby river, Mia goes to view the body at the sheriff's station, but finds it is not Guy. There, she attracts the attention of Shirley Vogel, a retired police officer-turned-private investigator who offers to look into Guy's disappearance. Nicole is resistant, and Shirley quickly becomes suspicious of the women. Their fears of a blackmailer are confirmed when Mia discovers the shower curtain used to conceal Guy's body hanging in her bathroom window."
"Shirley confronts Mia with the accident report from Guy's car, and surmises that Guy was en route to see her in Pittsburgh on the day he disappeared. Mia grows increasingly paranoid, believing Guy is alive and stalking the women. This fear increases when two videographers filming an event at the school capture an image of Guy standing in one of the building's windows. Later, while investigating the school's basement, Shirley is attacked and knocked unconscious."
"That night, Mia finds Guy floating in her bathtub, and witnesses him rise from the water. Terrified, she loses consciousness and collapses, apparently suffering a heart attack. Nicole arrives, and it is revealed that she and Guy had planned the series of events to scare Mia to the point of heart failure. Nicole laments, however, and tells Guy she had wanted to call it off. While overlooking Mia's body, Nicole realizes she is in fact not dead; when Guy realizes she is alive, he attacks both women, knocking Nicole unconscious."
"Mia flees downstairs, and Guy tackles her to the ground in front of the pool and attempts to drown her. Nicole manages to stop him by driving a garden rake into his head, and he falls into the pool. As Nicole attempts to revive Mia, Guy pulls her into the pool and tries to drown her. Mia enters the pool, and together, both women successfully drown him. They exit the pool and are confronted by Shirley, who punches Mia in the face; willing to cover for the women, she explains it will help prove self-defense in Guy's murder. Mia walks away from the pool, distraught, and Shirley smokes a cigarette while watching Guy's body sink to the bottom."
"Filming took place in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The St. Philomena School was used as the primarily filming location."
"The movie was compared unfavorably to the original movie, and received overall negative reviews. It currently holds a 'rotten' 18% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews. Stone was nominated for a Razzie Award for ""Worst New Star"" (as the new ""serious"" Sharon Stone) for this film and ""Last Dance"", where she lost to Pamela Anderson for ""Barb Wire""."
"The movie was a box office bomb, grossing far below its $45 million budget."
= = = Blephariceridae = = =
"The Blephariceridae, commonly known as net-winged midges, are a nematoceran family in the order Diptera. The adults resemble crane flies except with a projecting anal angle in the wings, and different head shape, absence of the V on the mesonotum, and more laterally outstretched, forward-facing legs. They are uncommon, but dozens of genera occur worldwide, and over 200 species."
"They are found near fast-flowing streams where the larvae live. Blepharicerid larvae are filter feeders and have suckers on their abdominal sternites, used to adhere to rocks in the torrents in which they live. These suckers are sometimes called creeping welts. These are of unique evolutionary origin within the Diptera."
"One recent classification based largely on fossils treats this family as the sole member of its infraorder, but this has not gained wide acceptance."

= = = Victoria Beckham (album) = = =
"Victoria Beckham (stylised as VB) is the self-titled debut and, to date, only studio album by English singer-songwriter, Victoria Beckham. It was released on 1 October 2001 by Virgin Records. Beckham was the last member of the Spice Girls to release a solo album. The album's lead single, ""Not Such an Innocent Girl"" was released on 17 September 2001. The second single, ""A Mind of Its Own"" was released on 11 February 2002. A third single, ""I Wish"", was promoted but never materialised, following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved."
"The album was a success, reached number ten in the United Kingdom and number twenty on the Australian Hitseekers Albums Chart."
"Initially, the album was to be titled ""Innocent Girl"" and set to be released on 27 August 2001, but was released on 1 October. Beckham revealed that she felt she had ""a lot to prove"" with the album's release: ""When I started recording this album, I had a lot to prove. I want to prove I can sing and dance and have a vision. I'm really baring my soul on this. I hope people like it. When I was with the other girls I never did a lot of the singing, so this is the first time that people are going to see me and what I am capable of"". She added that she hoped the album would do well ""and I can have a successful solo career""."
"The album did not include the hit ""Out of Your Mind"", but spawned two singles, ""Not Such an Innocent Girl"" and ""A Mind of Its Own"" which managed to reach the top ten in the United Kingdom."
"""Not Such an Innocent Girl"" was released on 17 September 2001 as the lead single from the album. In the United Kingdom, the single faced competition in a hugely hyped chart battle with Kylie Minogue's single ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"". On the chart date of 29 September 2001, ""Not Such an Innocent Girl"" debuted at number six on the UK Singles Chart with first week sales of 35,000 units, while ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" debuted at number one with first week sales of 306,000 units. It has sold about 80,263 copies altogether becoming the 163rd best seller of 2001. It sold 36,000 copies in its first week of release in the United Kingdom, and about 80,263 copies altogether becoming the 163rd best seller of 2001."
"The music video has a futuristic theme and features two Victorias: one dressed in all-white with blonde hair (""the good girl""), and the other in all-black with jet black hair (""the bad girl""). The video culminates into a ""dance-off"" and motorcycle race between the two Victorias. The complex video was shot almost entirely on a green set with a great deal of post-production, making it one of the most complex solo Spice Girl videos to date."
"""A Mind of Its Own"" was released on 11 February 2002 as the second single from her debut self-titled solo album (2001). It peaked and debuted at number six on the UK Singles Chart and sold 56,570 becoming the 173rd best seller of 2002. There is a French version of the song called ""Mon Coeur N'en Fait Qu'a Sa Tete"" (an adaptation of the title into French, or ""my heart does what it wants to do"")."
"A third single, ""I Wish"", was promoted but never materialised. The single version was a remix featuring Robbie Craig, and was performed on TV on ""Friday Night's All Wright"". Following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved. Beckham was reportedly dropped by Virgin Records along with fellow Spice Girls Emma Bunton and Melanie B,; but a statement from her publicist denied reports, stating: ""No-one has been dropped. The Virgin deal has come to a natural end and both parties have decided not to continue."""
"""Victoria Beckham"" faced a chart battle during the album's release week with Kylie Minogue's ""Fever"". Both singers had previously faced a battle in the singles' chart, when their singles were released on the same day. However, Beckham's album debuted at number ten on the UK Albums Chart on 13 October 2001, whilst Minogue's album topped the charts. ""Victoria Beckham"" charted for three weeks on the chart. However, the album has only sold 50,000 copies overall in the United Kingdom, while costing £5 million to produce. After ""Being Victoria Beckham"", an official documentary that aired in March 2002, the album re-entered the UK Albums Chart at number sixty-seven."
"Upon its release, the album received mixed to negative reviews. The BBC Music described the album as ""a mish-mash affair of gushy sentiment and wishy-washy RnB"" whilst ""NME"" called the album ""a new low in shameless pop slaggery""."
"Credits adapted from the liner notes of ""Victoria Beckham""."
"""Why"" can be played by two to four players aged 12 to adult. The four gamepiece characters are each humorous allusions to detectives of popular media fiction: Sergeant Monday (Sergeant Friday), Dick Crazy (Dick Tracy), Charlie Clam (Charlie Chan), and Shylock Bones (Sherlock Holmes). The six ""ghosts"" in the game are each based on actual historical figures: Daniel Boone, Pocahontas, Napoleon, Nero, Cleopatra and Henry the Eighth. The weapons in the game are a rope, a gun, poison, and an ax. The motive cards include the ""Jealousy,"" ""Lover's Quarrel,"" ""Self Defense,"" and can be used only in conjunction with Alfred Hitchcock ""It's A Mystery To Me"" card."
"The object of the game is to capture one ghost, one weapon, and one motive card. There are four cards for each ghost and weapon. An alternative way to win is capturing the six Alfred Hitchcock cards and the ""It's A Mystery To Me"" card. Each player is dealt seven cards and start out in the Living Room. The remaining cards are dealt evenly into the six rooms. A player can only have up to seven cards in his or her hand at one time. A player is able to obtain more cards from the lawn, from another player, or from another room."
"To acquire cards from the lawn, a player must first make it to the Living Room by rolling a 7, 11, doubles, or the player's normal roll. Then they have to prove they have that type of card by showing it and then flipping over the card they want. If they are correct, they take the card. If they are incorrect, they must put down the card they thought it was and take the wrong card. For one player to take from another, they must be on the same space as each other or in the same room. A player challenges another player's card by first proving that they have one of its set. If they do have the card, they must give it to the player or they can give them a ""No Clue"" card and this card is removed from the game. If they do not have the card, they are then able to challenge that player for a card with the same rules applying. The player's turn ends after this. To get a card from a room, they must first make it to the room by rolling a 7, 11, doubles, or through the regular roll. Then they pick up the top card and discard the same card or another card if applicable into the lawn."
"To begin the game, each player rolls the dice to see who goes first. The player with the highest roll begins and play proceeds to the left. If a player rolls 7, 11, or doubles they are able to advance to any room of their choosing. Otherwise, they advance through the hallway spaces. They can travel in either direction, but cannot backtrack."
"If all cards have been taken from the rooms then the required cards for winning must be in either a players hand or in the lawn. All players advance through the Living Room by rolling a 7, 11, doubles, or through a standard dice roll. Once all the players are in the Living Room a new set of rules is followed."
"A player can challenge another player if they roll a 7, 11, or doubles with standard challenge rules applying. A player can pick from the lawn if they roll an odd number. Standard discard rules apply except when a player discards one of their cards back into the lawn, they place it face-up. If a player rolls an even number, they lose their turn."
"For two players, only 34 of 60 cards are used. Three complete ghosts, two complete weapons, three motive, and three ""No Clue"" cards are removed from the pack. Additionally only rooms 1-4 are used and 5 and 6 are left empty. For three players, only 48 of 60 cards are used. Two complete ghosts and one complete weapon is removed from the pack. All six rooms are still used."
"If a player wants a card from the Lawn and they don't have one of that kind in their hand, they may falsely identify the card wanted, in order to pick it up. For example: If a player was collecting Cleopatra cards and another player wished to hinder him, they may pick up a Cleopatra card from the lawn in this way: Show any card from their hand such as an Ax, point to the Cleopatra card on the lawn and say, ""This is an Ax card."" Since they pointed to the wrong card (on purpose), now they must pick up the Cleopatra card and lay down the Ax card."
"For a more difficult game, cards are kept on the lawn face down until the end of the game. Also players may complete and lay down more than one Ghost to increase their Rewards. However, to end the game, the Mystery must be solved as before. Now players add up their Rewards, counting their cards on the table and in their hands. One complete ghost or weapon is worth $500.00. One complete Alfred Hitchcock is worth $1000.00. The player that ends the game earns $1000.00 as well. Motive and ""No Clue"" cards have no value. $200.00 is deducting for each part of Alfred a player has at the end of the game or the ""It's A Mystery to Me"" card. With these additional rules, each player receiving the largest reward wins the game."
= = = Subsonic aircraft = = =
"A subsonic aircraft is an aircraft with a maximum speed less than the speed of sound (Mach 1). The term technically describes an aircraft that flies below its critical Mach number, typically around Mach 0.8. All current civil aircraft, including airliners, helicopters and airships, as well as many military types, are subsonic."
"Although high speeds are usually desirable in an aircraft, supersonic flight requires much bigger engines, higher fuel consumption and more advanced materials than subsonic flight. A subsonic type therefore costs far less than the equivalent supersonic design, has greater range and causes less harm to the environment."
"The less harsh subsonic environment also allows a much wider range of aircraft types, such as balloons, airships and rotorcraft, allowing them to fill a much wider range of roles."
"Subsonic flight is characterised aerodynamically by incompressible flow, where dynamic pressure changes due to motion through the air cause the air to flow away from areas of high dynamic pressure to areas of lower dynamic pressure, leaving the static pressure and density of the surrounding air constant. At high subsonic speeds, compressibility effects begin to appear."
"The propeller is one of the most efficient sources of thrust available and is common on subsonic aeroplanes and airships. Sometimes it is enclosed in the form of a ducted fan. At higher subsonic speeds and at high altitudes, such as attained by most airliners, the high-bypass turbofan becomes necessary. Pure jets such as the turbojet and ramjet are inefficient at subsonic speeds and not often used."
"The span and area of a wing are both important to the lift characteristics. They are related by the aspect ratio, which is the ratio of the span, measured from tip to tip, to the average chord, measured from leading edge to trailing edge."
"The aerodynamic efficiency of a wing is described by its lift/drag ratio, with a wing giving high lift for little drag being the most efficient. A higher aspect ratio gives a higher lift/drag ratio and so is more efficient."
"The drag of a wing consists of two components, the induced drag, which is related to the production of lift, and the profile drag, largely due to skin friction which is contributed to by the whole wing area. It is therefore desirable for a wing to have the least area compatible with the desired lift characteristics. This is best achieved with a high aspect ratio, and high-performance types often have this kind of wing."
"But other considerations such as light weight, structural stiffness, manoeuvrability, ground handling and so on often benefit from a shorter span and, consequently a less efficient wing. Small, low-altitude general aviation planes typically have aspect ratios of six or seven; airliners of 12 or more; and high-performance sailplanes of 30 or more."
"At speeds above the critical Mach number, the airflow begins to become transonic, with local airflow in some places causing small sonic shock waves to form. This soon leads to the shock stall, causing a rapid increase in drag. The wings of fast subsonic craft such as jet airliners tend to be swept in order to delay the onset of these shock waves."
"In theory, induced drag is at its minimum when the span wise distribution of lift is elliptical. A number of factors influence induced drag, however, and as a practical matter a wing of elliptical planform, like that of the Supermarine Spitfire fighter of World War II, is not necessarily the most efficient. The wings of jet airliners, which are highly optimized for efficiency, are far from elliptical in shape."
"The ratio of tip chord to root chord is called the taper ratio. Taper has the desirable effect of reducing the root bending stress by shifting the lift inboard, but it has been argued by some noted designers, including John Thorp and Karl Bergey, that an untapered rectangular planform is best for aeroplanes of less than 6,000 pounds gross weight."

"Izumrud (, meaning ""Emerald"") was a protected cruiser of the Imperial Russian Navy, and the lead ship in the two-ship . ""Izumrud"" and her sister ship were based on the German-built ."
"""Izumrud"" was ordered as part of the Imperial Russian Navy's plan to expand the Russian Pacific Fleet based at Port Arthur and Vladivostok to counter the growing threat posed by the Imperial Japanese Navy towards Russian hegemony in Manchuria and Korea."
"""Izumrud"" was laid down at the Nevsky Shipyard in Saint Petersburg, Russia on 1 January 1901. However, construction was delayed due to priority given to completion of . The ""Zakladka"", or formal ceremony of laying a plate, took place on 14 June 1902. ""Izumrud"" was launched on 1 October 1903. Construction continued to be plagued by delays, including an ice storm in December. However, with the start of the Russo-Japanese War in early 1904, construction efforts were greatly accelerated."
"""Izumrud"" was formally commissioned in January 1904 and she was assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron of the Russian Pacific Fleet."
"Under the overall command of Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, ""Izumrud"" was part of the Second Pacific Squadron intended to relieve the Japanese siege of Port Arthur. Captained by Commander Vasili Fersen, she participated in the decisive Battle of Tsushima from 27–28 May 1905. At the end of the battle, Fersen refused to obey the order of Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov to surrender, and used her speed to escape through the Japanese blockade. However, on the night of 28 May, she ran aground in Vladimir Bay in the Russian Maritime Province. She was destroyed by explosive charges set by her crew, who later reached Vladivostok by land."
